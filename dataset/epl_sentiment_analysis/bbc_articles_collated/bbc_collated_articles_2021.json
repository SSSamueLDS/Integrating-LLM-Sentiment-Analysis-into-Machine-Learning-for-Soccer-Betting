The home side had heroes everywhere in match-winner Son, the outstanding defender Japhet Tanganga and the tireless Lucas Moura.\nIt remains to be seen how the Kane affair plays out but this will be the perfect psychological lift to Spurs that will sustain them until the saga comes to a close one way or the other.\nRusty Man City can have no complaints\nManchester City's race appeared run long before the end of this game, with the early spark of promise snuffed out by the endeavour and skill of Spurs.\nGrealish made some useful contributions early on but his day ended in the frustration of a yellow card and it is clear Guardiola, understandably, still has some work to do to integrate his talents into a squad already packed with creative ability.\nOne look at the City bench hinted at what Guardiola can introduce in the weeks ahead, even if Kane does not make the move to Manchester.\nKevin de Bruyne, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus were introduced in the final 20 minutes, while England's Euro 2020 pair Kyle Walker and John Stones were unused substitutes, as were Aymeric Laporte, Rodri and Bernardo Silva - a formidable array of talent.\nBut nothing could save this over-complicated and listless City show with Benjamin Mendy showing yet again what a flawed figure he is at left-back while Nathan Ake was also uncomfortable.\nAnd, significantly, City's lack of punch, with the great Sergio Aguero now gone, may just have prompted Guardiola to look even further into the acquisition of Kane, especially as Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have already given notice that there will be very little margin for error in the title race this season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Chelsea 3-0 Crystal Palace: Premier League title contenders cruise against Patrick Vieira's side\nChelsea underlined their Premier League title credentials with a thoroughly comfortable win over Patrick Vieira's Crystal Palace.\nThe highlight in front of a noisy, near-full Stamford Bridge was when academy product Trevoh Chalobah smashed home their third from 25 yards on his Premier League debut.\nBlues boss Thomas Tuchel said before the game he was surprised his side - who are European champions and won the Uefa Super Cup on Wednesday - were considered among the favourites to win the title.\nBut they were excellent in their league opener as Vieira's first game as a manager in England resulted in a limp performance.\nMarcos Alonso whipped in Chelsea's opener with a free-kick from about 22 yards.\n'When I scored I was crying' - Chalobah on first goal for Chelsea\nChristian Pulisic then blasted in a second via the underside of the bar after Vicente Guaita spilled Mason Mount's cross.\nAnd Chalobah, who joined Chelsea's youth set-up 14 years ago, drove home from distance to seal the win.\nPalace improved slightly after the break, but Jordan Ayew's header was their only effort on target.\nNo Lukaku, Kante, Ziyech, Chilwell, Havertz, no problem\nChelsea's remarkable squad depth is why many people expect them to win the title this season.\nSeven of 20 BBC pundits tipped the Blues, with the other 13 going for champions Manchester City.\nStriker Romelu Lukaku was not able to play because he is still quarantining after his \u00a397.5m move from Inter Milan. Influential midfielder N'Golo Kante and winger Hakim Ziyech were injured against Villarreal on Wednesday.\nEngland left-back Ben Chilwell, experienced centre-back Thiago Silva and Kai Havertz, who scored the winner in the Champions League final, were left on the bench.\nEx-Blues midfielder Joe Cole said during the week that every decision Tuchel makes seems to pay off.\nAnd it felt that way when Alonso, who started instead of Chilwell at left wing-back, curled in a perfect free-kick to give them a deserved lead. Palace offered so little threat that he basically played as an orthodox winger.\nPulisic then continued his fine form against Palace with a close-range finish after Guaita spilled a cross. Five of the American's 13 Premier League goals have come against the Eagles.\nThey had plenty of chances to score more with Timo Werner's first touch letting him down on a couple of occasions and Alonso forcing a good save from Guaita.\nBut the best moment of the game came when 22-year-old Chalobah, who made his Chelsea debut in Belfast three days ago, picked the ball up in space and drilled home via the inside of the post.\nThere were plenty of cheers too when Champions League hero Havertz came on - the first time he, or many of this Blues squad, have played at a full Stamford Bridge.\nVieira should forget this and move on\nThis was the first Palace game under legendary former Arsenal midfielder Vieira, who previously managed New York City in the USA and Nice in France's Ligue 1.\nHe warned beforehand that \"to put my ideas in place may take longer\", but this was as hard a first game as he could have anticipated.\nNine first-team players left the club over the summer - mostly at the end of their contracts - after manager Roy Hodgson's exit. Despite that, only one summer signing started - \u00a318m defender Marc Guehi, against the club that sold him this summer.\nJoachim Andersen, who was relegated with Fulham last season, came on in the second half.\nPalace are hoping to have a more youthful look after the departure of those ageing players - and 18-year-old winger Jesurun Rak-Sakyi made his debut from the bench.\nVieira's side - who started with a four-man defence and also tried a back five - failed to have a single shot or touch in Chelsea's box in the first half.

New \u00a350m defender Ben White was particularly culpable as Christian Norgaard arrived to head home.\nBrentford's supporters, understandably, celebrated wildly at the final whistle, but this was a result and performance that instantly turns the spotlight on Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta as he desperately needs an improvement on last season.\nFollow reaction to the game\nBrentford make powerful statement\nBrentford could not have made a better start to life in the Premier League, showing the pedigree that has made them such an entertaining side on their journey to this stage.\nOn a thunderous night at the Brentford Community Stadium, the arena was alive with noise and excitement well before kick-off - and what happened when the action started only raised those levels.\nTough days will inevitably lie ahead for the top-flight newcomers, but this was a night when the Bees showed what they were all about under charismatic manager Frank.\nOnce they realised Arsenal had little offer after the early exchanges, Brentford took charge and Bryan Mbeumo had already struck the post before Canos opened the scoring.\nThey grew in confidence, winning the physical challenges, attacking swiftly and, on the rare occasions he was called upon, keeper Raya looked a class act.\nFrank and his players rightly savoured the moment at the final whistle - in front of supporters who did themselves huge credit with the standing ovation given to Arsenal substitute Bukayo Saka, who was racially abused after missing a penalty in England's Euro 2020 final loss to Italy.\nThis was quite simply how Brentford would have scripted it. No-one can begrudge them their victory - and the manner in which they revelled in it.\nAbject Arsenal get what they deserved\nArsenal were handed a difficult opening assignment as there is always an element of jeopardy attached to a visit to a newly-promoted side.\nThis, however, was light years from what will be required this season and manager Arteta has work to do to knock the Gunners into shape on this evidence.\nYes, he was missing strikers Lacazette and Aubameyang, while Saka only started on the bench, but the lack of resolve, the lack of a coherent plan and lack of threat when they needed to fight their way back into contention was alarming.\nOnly Smith Rowe looked capable of providing a spark while it was a harrowing start to life at Arsenal for expensive summer acquisition White. He was tormented throughout and part of a desperate attempt to defend the throw-in that led to Brentford's second goal.\nArsenal are familiar with the criticisms that will be aimed at them, namely a failure to match the fight and physical assets of opponents, but here they can have no answer to the charges. They were weak in all areas, especially in defence, with Pablo Mari and Calum Chambers also on the rack throughout.\nKeeper Leno was at fault for the first goal, put his defence under pressure playing out from the back and almost gifted Brentford a third, providing evidence why Arteta is in the market for a new number one.\nThis was a thoroughly wretched night in every respect for Arteta and his players. They will hope it is a one-off, but the club's detractors will say they have seen too many nightmares like this.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Lindelof's pass fell perfectly for the forward, who allowed the ball to bounce before crashing it into the net.\nIt meant he followed Anthony Martial as the only Manchester United player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Van Persie - and the first to do it in front of fans.\nLeeds swept away\nThe volume for an already noisy crowd was turned up another notch by Raphael Varane's introduction just before the teams emerged.\nManchester United's new \u00a334m defender will be tasked with bringing greater stability to a back four that, even here, looked shaky at times.\nSkipper Harry Maguire was almost embarrassed in a foot race with Patrick Bamford which he started with a clear advantage and poor marking should have been exploited by Rodrigo, who was off target with his header after being allowed to meet Raphinha's curling free-kick unopposed.\nFor a team whose league record at Old Trafford is poor - Leeds have not won here since 1981 - and who conceded six in the corresponding fixture last season, it did not bode well.\nAyling did offer some hope when he was afforded far too much space to shoot - presumably on the basis he had never previously scored a Premier League goal - and promptly found the corner from 25 yards.\nBut it was only the prelude to a Manchester United onslaught from which there was no chance of recovery.\nTrouble before the game\nThis was always likely to be a tinderbox fixture on the first weekend of full Premier League stadiums for 19 months.\nTrouble in the city centre, in which Greater Manchester Police said there were \"isolated incidents of disorder\", briefly gave way to unanimity at the stadium as supporters joined together to applaud figures from both clubs who have passed away during the coronavirus pandemic. But that did not last.\nAmid the mutual loathing was one chant about the Munich air disaster among the visiting support, which BBC Sport has been told was in response to a Turkish flag being dropped into the Leeds fans from a higher tier of the stand. For Leeds this is massively inflammatory as it references the two fans who were killed in Istanbul in 2000 before the Uefa Cup semi-final with Galatasaray.\nLater, substitute Jadon Sancho was told he \"let his country down\" as he began his first warm-up - a reference to his missed penalty for England in the Euro 2020 final against Italy.\nGiven the chaos of United's end to last season, when a home game against Liverpool had to be abandoned after home fans broke into the stadium, club officials will probably be relieved there was no threat to this fixture, although there was an anti-Glazer chant to underline that the issues with the owners have not gone away.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

There were plenty of fans who voiced their opposition to his appointment six weeks ago.\nBut this was a day to rejoice in what was his first Premier League match in more than two years. The win was only Everton's third in the past 13 home games, stretching back to last season, when a European challenge stuttered under former boss Carlo Ancelotti.\nOften, the team struggled to overturn deficits under the Italian manager - but buoyed by a raucous atmosphere and Benitez's switch, they continued to press for more goals once they had equalised.\nSouthampton contributed to what was an open game, with Armstrong showing plenty of endeavour and linking well with Adams.\nThere was also a fine debut for Tino Livramento at right-back, while the back-line kept Calvert-Lewin in check until Richarlison joined him in attack.\nThe Brazilian struggled in the first half, placed on the left of a three behind Calvert-Lewin, and was booked for an outrageous dive after the half-hour mark.\nAt that point, Everton looked nothing like the side who would go on to take control in the second half, and Keane's mistake led to a catalogue of errors that threatened to gift Ralph Hasenhuttl's side another goal.\nBut after Richarlison's equaliser, the hosts were inspired by their fans and pressed for more goals. The Brazilian dummied brilliantly but Keane's effort was blocked by the industrious James Ward-Prowse.\nEverton fans were not to be disappointed, though, and will hope that Benitez's reign continues in a similar fashion after both a performance and result that were worth waiting for.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It's up to both of us to manage him, make him as explosive and electric as he can be.\n\"But when he has that form and that level of fitness, that hunger, he's very difficult to play against. I thought he was outstanding today.\n\"There's some outstanding strikers in the Premier League and of course he's up there with them. He had a really good pre-season and we saw the results of that today.\"\nWolves, beginning life under Nuno Espirito Santo's successor Lage, missed a golden chance before Vardy's header but, having run clear of the defence Adama Traore side-footed tamely wide.\nLage hads promised a more attacking approach than that seen in Nuno's final season at Molineux and there was certainly evidence of greater adventure after the break as the visitors pushed forward in pursuit of parity.\nTo stem the Wolves attacks, Rodgers handed Foxes debuts to two summer signings in centre-back Jannik Vestergaard and central midfielder Boubakary Soumare.\nIt took some timely blocks and an offside flag to rule out a finish from Conor Coady to deny Wolves an equaliser - but few would have described a point for the visitors as undeserved.\nThe game also saw a return to action for Wanderers striker Raul Jimenez, who was quiet in his first game since fracturing his skull last November.\nText commentary of Saturday's matches in the Premier League\nTimeless Vardy shows no signs of slowing down\nThis summer has been something of a showcase for the enduring attraction of 34-year-old players.\nParis St-Germain's signing of Lionel Messi shows the French club's understandable faith in the Argentina captain's ability to continue at the highest level during the middle years of his fourth decade.\nAt the King Power, they have their own seemingly age-defying forward in Vardy, who was a headache for the Wolves defence throughout.\nHe certainly shows no signs of losing a yard of pace, playing on the shoulder of the last Wolves defender to stretch the play and always making himself a target for precise forward passes.\nHis goal was a testament to his sharp thinking, movement and finishing, with his front-post dart catching the away defence out and then his glancing finish being too good for debutant goalkeeper Jose Sa.\nBut for an assistant's flag, some last-ditch sliding tackles from Coady and a wayward finish, the ex-England forward would have had more goals.\nNew Wolves boss Lage must wish he had a forward like him.\nIn Traore, they do have someone with unparalleled pace and bags of tricks but he lacked composure or the ability to make the right decision when it mattered.\nHe should have given his side the lead with the chance he put past the post and had countless other opportunities, including an effort he fired straight at Kasper Schmeichel after outmuscling Vestergaard.\nSummer recruit Francisco Trincao also showed flashes of promise, but not enough to earn his side a point.\n\"It was my feeling [Wolves would equalise in the second half].

The home side had heroes everywhere in match-winner Son, the outstanding defender Japhet Tanganga and the tireless Lucas Moura.\nIt remains to be seen how the Kane affair plays out but this will be the perfect psychological lift to Spurs that will sustain them until the saga comes to a close one way or the other.\nRusty Man City can have no complaints\nManchester City's race appeared run long before the end of this game, with the early spark of promise snuffed out by the endeavour and skill of Spurs.\nGrealish made some useful contributions early on but his day ended in the frustration of a yellow card and it is clear Guardiola, understandably, still has some work to do to integrate his talents into a squad already packed with creative ability.\nOne look at the City bench hinted at what Guardiola can introduce in the weeks ahead, even if Kane does not make the move to Manchester.\nKevin de Bruyne, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus were introduced in the final 20 minutes, while England's Euro 2020 pair Kyle Walker and John Stones were unused substitutes, as were Aymeric Laporte, Rodri and Bernardo Silva - a formidable array of talent.\nBut nothing could save this over-complicated and listless City show with Benjamin Mendy showing yet again what a flawed figure he is at left-back while Nathan Ake was also uncomfortable.\nAnd, significantly, City's lack of punch, with the great Sergio Aguero now gone, may just have prompted Guardiola to look even further into the acquisition of Kane, especially as Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have already given notice that there will be very little margin for error in the title race this season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

There were plenty of fans who voiced their opposition to his appointment six weeks ago.\nBut this was a day to rejoice in what was his first Premier League match in more than two years. The win was only Everton's third in the past 13 home games, stretching back to last season, when a European challenge stuttered under former boss Carlo Ancelotti.\nOften, the team struggled to overturn deficits under the Italian manager - but buoyed by a raucous atmosphere and Benitez's switch, they continued to press for more goals once they had equalised.\nSouthampton contributed to what was an open game, with Armstrong showing plenty of endeavour and linking well with Adams.\nThere was also a fine debut for Tino Livramento at right-back, while the back-line kept Calvert-Lewin in check until Richarlison joined him in attack.\nThe Brazilian struggled in the first half, placed on the left of a three behind Calvert-Lewin, and was booked for an outrageous dive after the half-hour mark.\nAt that point, Everton looked nothing like the side who would go on to take control in the second half, and Keane's mistake led to a catalogue of errors that threatened to gift Ralph Hasenhuttl's side another goal.\nBut after Richarlison's equaliser, the hosts were inspired by their fans and pressed for more goals. The Brazilian dummied brilliantly but Keane's effort was blocked by the industrious James Ward-Prowse.\nEverton fans were not to be disappointed, though, and will hope that Benitez's reign continues in a similar fashion after both a performance and result that were worth waiting for.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Lindelof's pass fell perfectly for the forward, who allowed the ball to bounce before crashing it into the net.\nIt meant he followed Anthony Martial as the only Manchester United player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Van Persie - and the first to do it in front of fans.\nLeeds swept away\nThe volume for an already noisy crowd was turned up another notch by Raphael Varane's introduction just before the teams emerged.\nManchester United's new \u00a334m defender will be tasked with bringing greater stability to a back four that, even here, looked shaky at times.\nSkipper Harry Maguire was almost embarrassed in a foot race with Patrick Bamford which he started with a clear advantage and poor marking should have been exploited by Rodrigo, who was off target with his header after being allowed to meet Raphinha's curling free-kick unopposed.\nFor a team whose league record at Old Trafford is poor - Leeds have not won here since 1981 - and who conceded six in the corresponding fixture last season, it did not bode well.\nAyling did offer some hope when he was afforded far too much space to shoot - presumably on the basis he had never previously scored a Premier League goal - and promptly found the corner from 25 yards.\nBut it was only the prelude to a Manchester United onslaught from which there was no chance of recovery.\nTrouble before the game\nThis was always likely to be a tinderbox fixture on the first weekend of full Premier League stadiums for 19 months.\nTrouble in the city centre, in which Greater Manchester Police said there were \"isolated incidents of disorder\", briefly gave way to unanimity at the stadium as supporters joined together to applaud figures from both clubs who have passed away during the coronavirus pandemic. But that did not last.\nAmid the mutual loathing was one chant about the Munich air disaster among the visiting support, which BBC Sport has been told was in response to a Turkish flag being dropped into the Leeds fans from a higher tier of the stand. For Leeds this is massively inflammatory as it references the two fans who were killed in Istanbul in 2000 before the Uefa Cup semi-final with Galatasaray.\nLater, substitute Jadon Sancho was told he \"let his country down\" as he began his first warm-up - a reference to his missed penalty for England in the Euro 2020 final against Italy.\nGiven the chaos of United's end to last season, when a home game against Liverpool had to be abandoned after home fans broke into the stadium, club officials will probably be relieved there was no threat to this fixture, although there was an anti-Glazer chant to underline that the issues with the owners have not gone away.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

New \u00a350m defender Ben White was particularly culpable as Christian Norgaard arrived to head home.\nBrentford's supporters, understandably, celebrated wildly at the final whistle, but this was a result and performance that instantly turns the spotlight on Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta as he desperately needs an improvement on last season.\nFollow reaction to the game\nBrentford make powerful statement\nBrentford could not have made a better start to life in the Premier League, showing the pedigree that has made them such an entertaining side on their journey to this stage.\nOn a thunderous night at the Brentford Community Stadium, the arena was alive with noise and excitement well before kick-off - and what happened when the action started only raised those levels.\nTough days will inevitably lie ahead for the top-flight newcomers, but this was a night when the Bees showed what they were all about under charismatic manager Frank.\nOnce they realised Arsenal had little offer after the early exchanges, Brentford took charge and Bryan Mbeumo had already struck the post before Canos opened the scoring.\nThey grew in confidence, winning the physical challenges, attacking swiftly and, on the rare occasions he was called upon, keeper Raya looked a class act.\nFrank and his players rightly savoured the moment at the final whistle - in front of supporters who did themselves huge credit with the standing ovation given to Arsenal substitute Bukayo Saka, who was racially abused after missing a penalty in England's Euro 2020 final loss to Italy.\nThis was quite simply how Brentford would have scripted it. No-one can begrudge them their victory - and the manner in which they revelled in it.\nAbject Arsenal get what they deserved\nArsenal were handed a difficult opening assignment as there is always an element of jeopardy attached to a visit to a newly-promoted side.\nThis, however, was light years from what will be required this season and manager Arteta has work to do to knock the Gunners into shape on this evidence.\nYes, he was missing strikers Lacazette and Aubameyang, while Saka only started on the bench, but the lack of resolve, the lack of a coherent plan and lack of threat when they needed to fight their way back into contention was alarming.\nOnly Smith Rowe looked capable of providing a spark while it was a harrowing start to life at Arsenal for expensive summer acquisition White. He was tormented throughout and part of a desperate attempt to defend the throw-in that led to Brentford's second goal.\nArsenal are familiar with the criticisms that will be aimed at them, namely a failure to match the fight and physical assets of opponents, but here they can have no answer to the charges. They were weak in all areas, especially in defence, with Pablo Mari and Calum Chambers also on the rack throughout.\nKeeper Leno was at fault for the first goal, put his defence under pressure playing out from the back and almost gifted Brentford a third, providing evidence why Arteta is in the market for a new number one.\nThis was a thoroughly wretched night in every respect for Arteta and his players. They will hope it is a one-off, but the club's detractors will say they have seen too many nightmares like this.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 3-0 Crystal Palace: Premier League title contenders cruise against Patrick Vieira's side\nChelsea underlined their Premier League title credentials with a thoroughly comfortable win over Patrick Vieira's Crystal Palace.\nThe highlight in front of a noisy, near-full Stamford Bridge was when academy product Trevoh Chalobah smashed home their third from 25 yards on his Premier League debut.\nBlues boss Thomas Tuchel said before the game he was surprised his side - who are European champions and won the Uefa Super Cup on Wednesday - were considered among the favourites to win the title.\nBut they were excellent in their league opener as Vieira's first game as a manager in England resulted in a limp performance.\nMarcos Alonso whipped in Chelsea's opener with a free-kick from about 22 yards.\n'When I scored I was crying' - Chalobah on first goal for Chelsea\nChristian Pulisic then blasted in a second via the underside of the bar after Vicente Guaita spilled Mason Mount's cross.\nAnd Chalobah, who joined Chelsea's youth set-up 14 years ago, drove home from distance to seal the win.\nPalace improved slightly after the break, but Jordan Ayew's header was their only effort on target.\nNo Lukaku, Kante, Ziyech, Chilwell, Havertz, no problem\nChelsea's remarkable squad depth is why many people expect them to win the title this season.\nSeven of 20 BBC pundits tipped the Blues, with the other 13 going for champions Manchester City.\nStriker Romelu Lukaku was not able to play because he is still quarantining after his \u00a397.5m move from Inter Milan. Influential midfielder N'Golo Kante and winger Hakim Ziyech were injured against Villarreal on Wednesday.\nEngland left-back Ben Chilwell, experienced centre-back Thiago Silva and Kai Havertz, who scored the winner in the Champions League final, were left on the bench.\nEx-Blues midfielder Joe Cole said during the week that every decision Tuchel makes seems to pay off.\nAnd it felt that way when Alonso, who started instead of Chilwell at left wing-back, curled in a perfect free-kick to give them a deserved lead. Palace offered so little threat that he basically played as an orthodox winger.\nPulisic then continued his fine form against Palace with a close-range finish after Guaita spilled a cross. Five of the American's 13 Premier League goals have come against the Eagles.\nThey had plenty of chances to score more with Timo Werner's first touch letting him down on a couple of occasions and Alonso forcing a good save from Guaita.\nBut the best moment of the game came when 22-year-old Chalobah, who made his Chelsea debut in Belfast three days ago, picked the ball up in space and drilled home via the inside of the post.\nThere were plenty of cheers too when Champions League hero Havertz came on - the first time he, or many of this Blues squad, have played at a full Stamford Bridge.\nVieira should forget this and move on\nThis was the first Palace game under legendary former Arsenal midfielder Vieira, who previously managed New York City in the USA and Nice in France's Ligue 1.\nHe warned beforehand that \"to put my ideas in place may take longer\", but this was as hard a first game as he could have anticipated.\nNine first-team players left the club over the summer - mostly at the end of their contracts - after manager Roy Hodgson's exit. Despite that, only one summer signing started - \u00a318m defender Marc Guehi, against the club that sold him this summer.\nJoachim Andersen, who was relegated with Fulham last season, came on in the second half.\nPalace are hoping to have a more youthful look after the departure of those ageing players - and 18-year-old winger Jesurun Rak-Sakyi made his debut from the bench.\nVieira's side - who started with a four-man defence and also tried a back five - failed to have a single shot or touch in Chelsea's box in the first half. They had to wait an hour to test Edouard Mendy but even then Ayew's header was straight at the Blues keeper.\nJeffrey Schlupp fired over and Christian Benteke shot wide but there was never a single moment in the game when the Eagles looked like scoring.\nTheir next game - against promoted Brentford next Saturday - is the real acid test of how Vieira and Palace are looking.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It's up to both of us to manage him, make him as explosive and electric as he can be.\n\"But when he has that form and that level of fitness, that hunger, he's very difficult to play against.

We had a good moment and we started to control the game,\" Wolves boss Lage told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"In the first half we had a good chance to score then two or three minutes later they scored.\n\"We started the second half well and they reacted, moving to three centre-backs, and we tried to put more players between the lines.\n\"I'm not happy because we deserved more than we got but I have confidence in what we are doing.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He is an incredibly important player for us.\"\nGrealish grabs glory but Jesus shines brightest\nEngland midfielder Grealish ingratiated himself with his new adoring fans thanks to his goal and typically busy display, but it was Jesus who unlocked the Canaries' cage to ensure this was a stroll.\nHis clever movement, control and delivery created three of City's five goals, all from low, inviting balls across the face of the six-yard box that wreaked havoc among the Norwich defence.\nThere was some fortune about the first two as Grant Hanley's attempted clearance flew in off Norwich keeper Tim Krul before City's second bounced in off Grealish's knee.\nHowever, the lead was just reward for the imperious hosts, who saw a neat Ferran Torres finish chalked off in-between those goals after the video assistant referee noticed Bernardo Silva's clip on Milot Rashica in the build-up.\nAymeric Laporte added the third, steering home a corner from close range, before Jesus guided Kyle Walker's through ball into the path of Raheem Sterling for the substitute to sweep home City's fourth.\nRiyad Mahrez also came off the bench to round off the rout, beating Krul one-on-one as City emphatically put any lingering worries over three successive defeats - this season and last - behind them.\nBigger tests, of course, await with Arsenal, Leicester, Chelsea and Liverpool among their next five fixtures - with defeats in the Champions League final, Community Shield and league to Chelsea, Leicester and Tottenham respectively still relatively fresh in the mind.\n\"One week ago, we are not contenders to win the Premier League. Now we are scary!\" smiled Guardiola.\n\"Listen, we are same team except for Sergio, who went to Barcelona, and Jack coming in. We are the same guys and the same team we were last season - and last season was exceptional.\"\nCanaries chastened by classy City\nOnly two teams - Leicester in 2001-02 and Wigan in 2010-11 - have had a goal difference worse than Norwich's of minus eight two games into a Premier League season but they will take some solace that Liverpool and City are already out of the way, until next year at least.\nThis scoreline was a repeat of Norwich's most recent visit there in July 2020, which came just 10 months after they provided one of the most memorable all-time Premier League surprises by beating City 3-2 at Carrow Road.\nTeemu Pukki and Todd Cantwell, scorers that evening, are among a handful of players remaining but neither had a sniff on Saturday as Norwich failed to force Ederson into a single save.\nThey were unfortunate for City's opener as Hanley's clearance was going out for a corner until it struck Krul, still stationed at his near post, but they did not learn from the mistake of allowing space out wide to manager Daniel Farke's frustration.\n\"I am disappointed because four times we conceded more or less the same goal. Of course they have unbelievable quality but we also have to fulfil our work with more quality,\" said the Canaries boss.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

After a long video assistant referee review, the referee's decision not to give the penalty stood.\nIf Rob Holding had scored with a header from eight yards out in the second half, that could have sparked a comeback but he headed wide.\nArsenal have injury and illness problems - with \u00a350m centre-back White out with Covid, Alexandre Lacazette recovering from the illness and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang only fit for the bench after catching the virus too.\nBut all signs are already pointing to another season of struggle. After two eighth-placed finishes in a row, could it get even worse?\nAugust 1992 was the first month of the Premier League. That was the last time before now Arsenal were in the relegation zone at the end of a day with more than one game played.\nMikel Arteta's side play West Brom in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, and their next league game is at champions Manchester City next Sunday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

You have to battle for the first win and we did that today.\n\"We just lacked intensity last week. I called it an international friendly but you cannot do that in front of 42,000 at Villa Park.\n\"It is brilliant to have the fans back and they have waited 18 months to get back. It was great to give them the three points to savour.\n\"We have seen Danny Ings [score] against us so it is good he is an Aston Villa player now.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It's not going for us, is it? We lost a game last week with a big talking point and today we feel aggrieved too. The same official is involved. Last week we were crying out for the referee to have a look at the monitor, he didn't and today he did.\n\"I thought VAR was for clean and obvious. The penalty for us, there were no lines drawn last week but there were this week - why? We are still talking about VAR.\n\"We had a decent start and a big chance but there were small margins between the teams.

Solskjaer then moving to punish Saints further by sending on \u00a373m man Jadon Sancho for the disappointing Anthony Martial.\nInstead, it was Southampton who created the best opportunity to take all three points as De Gea saved crucially from Adam Armstrong when he looked to poised to score.\nUnited boss Solskjaer will be disappointed with both the performance and the result but this was no more than Southampton deserved as they bounced back impressively from defeat at Everton in their first game.\n'From basketball to rugby' - Solskjaer joins Klopp in criticising new refereeing approach\nMan Utd fall well short\nManchester United opened brightly and had a threatening spell after equalising but otherwise this was an average performance from a side harbouring genuine Premier League title ambitions.\nUnited grew increasingly sloppy as the game went on, the occasional moments of sparkle from Paul Pogba failing to compensate for the complete lack of inspiration around him.\nMartial contributed little or nothing and it was no surprise when was replaced by Sancho, who was quiet as Southampton regained composure and a measure of control after Greenwood's leveller.\nNemanja Matic was ponderous and off the pace while Fred's main contribution was to unwittingly deflect Adams' shot agonisingly out of the reach of De Gea when Saints went in front.\nWho knows what goes on behind the scenes but those two performances pose the question of what Donny van de Beek must lack in Solskjaer's eyes to seemingly not even merit serious consideration for a place in United's engine room?\nScott McTominay was left on the bench until late on but when he came on the pattern of the game was set.\nUnited, who hit the bar through Pogba in the first half, are now unbeaten in their last 27 away games in the Premier League, equalling the longest unbeaten away record in the English top flight set by Arsenal between April 2003 and September 2004, but this accolade would have tasted sweeter on the back of a victory.\nIt is very early days and United were superb when thrashing Leeds United but this was the sort of careless, lacklustre display they cannot afford to repeat too often in a season that already looks like it will offer little margin for error for those chasing honours at the top of the table.\nSaints show their mettle\nSouthampton's week brightened up considerably after that opening-day 3-1 loss at Everton when James Ward-Prowse, their most influential player, committed his future to the club by signing a new five-year contract.\nAnd spirits will have been lifted even further by the manner in which they earned a point against big-spending United that was richly merited.\nSaints were on the back foot amid United's early surge but held firm to take the lead and then, when United drew level and appeared to be carrying all the momentum, they showed the character and resilience to recover from the setback to push United all the way and threaten to take all three points.\nArmstrong, their \u00a315m summer signing from Blackburn Rovers, will be disappointed he did not take the big chance to take all three points when he was played through by Adams, De Gea diving low to his left to rescue United.\nThe striker then had the chance to make amends from the resulting corner but could not force home a header at the far post.\nSouthampton and manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, who greeted the final whistle with a fist-pump salute, will be very satisfied with the outcome and the performance and he look to have captured a real gem in 18-year-old right-back Valentino Livramento, signed from Chelsea for \u00a35m.\nThe youngster was outstanding, both in the physical challenges in defence and also as an attacking threat, with one storming first-half run ending with a cross that was only inches away from the incoming Armstrong.\nSaints may feel they could have had all three points but this was a game which gave Hasenhuttl plenty to build on.\nReaction from Southampton v Man Utd, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nEverything you need to know about Southampton, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about Manchester United, all in one place\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

It is the Spaniard's first red card on his 274th appearance in English football.\nThere was calamitous defending from Caglar Soyuncu for West Ham's second as the Turkey international's sloppy backpass was intercepted by the unselfish Antonio, who crossed for Benrahma to fire past Schmeichel from 12 yards.\nAntonio had drawn level with Di Canio courtesy of his strike at Newcastle in West Ham's season opener, but it seemed as if he would have to wait for his moment of glory as he saw five chances go begging.\nBut after holding off Soyuncu in the box from Declan Rice's cross, Antonio turned past the centre-back and found the bottom corner.\nHis night was not over yet. As a packed London Stadium chanted 'ole' with each Hammers pass, Antonio capped off a near-perfect evening as he flicked the ball above two Leicester defenders, before beating them both on the turn and stabbing past Schmeichel.\nAfter missing out on a place in the top four by two points last season, West Ham start the new campaign full of optimism and - even if after only two games - end the day top of the Premier League for just the second time ever.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Perhaps buoyed by that, Palace made the better start, harrying Brentford when they were in possession and going close through Gallagher, who put in an all-action display.\nHowever, their attacking threat waned as the game wore on, allowing Brentford to regain some control.\nIt was perhaps little surprise that the home side's best chance after the break came from an effort from distance, with McArthur, captain in absence of Luka Milivojevic, firing in an effort that was superbly tipped over by Raya.\nDespite their frustration, the home supporters backed their side throughout and Vieira is confident they will continue to do so during this period of transition.\n\"The fans will always be patient if we perform like we did today,\" he said. \"Today showed to the fans that we are working hard and working well.\n\"We are disappointed because we wanted to give the fans the three points because they were fantastic. They supported us through the game and that is really good for the rest of the season.\"\nFollow reaction plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nEverything you need to know about Crystal Palace, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about Brentford, all in one place\nBees repay Frank's faith\nIn contrast to Palace's summer of change, Brentford boss Frank has kept faith with the majority of the players who secured promotion from the Championship.\nHe named an unchanged starting XI from last weekend's raucous win against Arsenal, but they offered little attacking threat in the opening stages - although Ivan Toney went close with a snap shot from distance.\nAfter that uncertain start, the Bees grew into the game and ended the half on top, with Mbeumo's free kick clipping the bar and Frank Onyeka having a fizzing effort from distance saved by Vicente Guaita.\nToney remained their greatest threat in the second half, twice going close with headers from corners, while they rarely looked like conceding at the other end.\nA return of four points and two clean sheets represents a fine start to what is their first top-flight campaign for 74 years, while Saturday's game gave Vieira his first point as Palace boss.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He is so big and strong to stop - it was a great goal.\n\"We played well first half and it was nice to get the second and give us a cushion. Watford responded as we anticipated and when we had to defend we did that and did it well.\n\"Back to back wins at any stage are hard to achieve. We are in a good place, but it is just a start.\"\nWatford manager Xisco Munoz to BBC Sport: \"I think we need to learn quickly about the Premier League.

You have to battle for the first win and we did that today.\n\"We just lacked intensity last week. I called it an international friendly but you cannot do that in front of 42,000 at Villa Park.\n\"It is brilliant to have the fans back and they have waited 18 months to get back. It was great to give them the three points to savour.\n\"We have seen Danny Ings [score] against us so it is good he is an Aston Villa player now.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It's not going for us, is it? We lost a game last week with a big talking point and today we feel aggrieved too. The same official is involved. Last week we were crying out for the referee to have a look at the monitor, he didn't and today he did.\n\"I thought VAR was for clean and obvious. The penalty for us, there were no lines drawn last week but there were this week - why? We are still talking about VAR.\n\"We had a decent start and a big chance but there were small margins between the teams.

Perhaps buoyed by that, Palace made the better start, harrying Brentford when they were in possession and going close through Gallagher, who put in an all-action display.\nHowever, their attacking threat waned as the game wore on, allowing Brentford to regain some control.\nIt was perhaps little surprise that the home side's best chance after the break came from an effort from distance, with McArthur, captain in absence of Luka Milivojevic, firing in an effort that was superbly tipped over by Raya.\nDespite their frustration, the home supporters backed their side throughout and Vieira is confident they will continue to do so during this period of transition.\n\"The fans will always be patient if we perform like we did today,\" he said. \"Today showed to the fans that we are working hard and working well.\n\"We are disappointed because we wanted to give the fans the three points because they were fantastic. They supported us through the game and that is really good for the rest of the season.\"\nFollow reaction plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nEverything you need to know about Crystal Palace, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about Brentford, all in one place\nBees repay Frank's faith\nIn contrast to Palace's summer of change, Brentford boss Frank has kept faith with the majority of the players who secured promotion from the Championship.\nHe named an unchanged starting XI from last weekend's raucous win against Arsenal, but they offered little attacking threat in the opening stages - although Ivan Toney went close with a snap shot from distance.\nAfter that uncertain start, the Bees grew into the game and ended the half on top, with Mbeumo's free kick clipping the bar and Frank Onyeka having a fizzing effort from distance saved by Vicente Guaita.\nToney remained their greatest threat in the second half, twice going close with headers from corners, while they rarely looked like conceding at the other end.\nA return of four points and two clean sheets represents a fine start to what is their first top-flight campaign for 74 years, while Saturday's game gave Vieira his first point as Palace boss.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He is fantastic and all of us have to learn from him,\" the Manchester City manager told BBC Sport.\n\"He can play as a striker, he can play left, he can play right - always what the team needs. He can play 10 minutes from the bench and he will play the best 10 minutes he can play.\"\nFollow reaction plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nEverything you need to know about Manchester City, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about Norwich City, all in one place\nJesus is yet to become a regular starter under Guardiola, making 54 Premier League substitute appearances alongside 78 starts since joining the club from Palmeiras for \u00a327m in 2016.\nBut with Sergio Aguero departing for Barcelona in the summer and City's intentions regarding Kane still uncertain, Guardiola hinted he will call upon the 24-year-old more this term.\n\"He has so much importance for me. It's not just when he makes an exceptional performance like today, it's every day,\" Guardiola added.\n\"One of the reasons why I am a manager in the best moments of my career, apart from the titles and trophies, is because you can work with people like Gabriel. He is an incredibly important player for us.\"\nGrealish grabs glory but Jesus shines brightest\nEngland midfielder Grealish ingratiated himself with his new adoring fans thanks to his goal and typically busy display, but it was Jesus who unlocked the Canaries' cage to ensure this was a stroll.\nHis clever movement, control and delivery created three of City's five goals, all from low, inviting balls across the face of the six-yard box that wreaked havoc among the Norwich defence.\nThere was some fortune about the first two as Grant Hanley's attempted clearance flew in off Norwich keeper Tim Krul before City's second bounced in off Grealish's knee.\nHowever, the lead was just reward for the imperious hosts, who saw a neat Ferran Torres finish chalked off in-between those goals after the video assistant referee noticed Bernardo Silva's clip on Milot Rashica in the build-up.\nAymeric Laporte added the third, steering home a corner from close range, before Jesus guided Kyle Walker's through ball into the path of Raheem Sterling for the substitute to sweep home City's fourth.\nRiyad Mahrez also came off the bench to round off the rout, beating Krul one-on-one as City emphatically put any lingering worries over three successive defeats - this season and last - behind them.\nBigger tests, of course, await with Arsenal, Leicester, Chelsea and Liverpool among their next five fixtures - with defeats in the Champions League final, Community Shield and league to Chelsea, Leicester and Tottenham respectively still relatively fresh in the mind.\n\"One week ago, we are not contenders to win the Premier League. Now we are scary!\" smiled Guardiola.\n\"Listen, we are same team except for Sergio, who went to Barcelona, and Jack coming in. We are the same guys and the same team we were last season - and last season was exceptional.\"\nCanaries chastened by classy City\nOnly two teams - Leicester in 2001-02 and Wigan in 2010-11 - have had a goal difference worse than Norwich's of minus eight two games into a Premier League season but they will take some solace that Liverpool and City are already out of the way, until next year at least.\nThis scoreline was a repeat of Norwich's most recent visit there in July 2020, which came just 10 months after they provided one of the most memorable all-time Premier League surprises by beating City 3-2 at Carrow Road.\nTeemu Pukki and Todd Cantwell, scorers that evening, are among a handful of players remaining but neither had a sniff on Saturday as Norwich failed to force Ederson into a single save.\nThey were unfortunate for City's opener as Hanley's clearance was going out for a corner until it struck Krul, still stationed at his near post, but they did not learn from the mistake of allowing space out wide to manager Daniel Farke's frustration.\n\"I am disappointed because four times we conceded more or less the same goal. Of course they have unbelievable quality but we also have to fulfil our work with more quality,\" said the Canaries boss.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It is the Spaniard's first red card on his 274th appearance in English football.\nThere was calamitous defending from Caglar Soyuncu for West Ham's second as the Turkey international's sloppy backpass was intercepted by the unselfish Antonio, who crossed for Benrahma to fire past Schmeichel from 12 yards.\nAntonio had drawn level with Di Canio courtesy of his strike at Newcastle in West Ham's season opener, but it seemed as if he would have to wait for his moment of glory as he saw five chances go begging.\nBut after holding off Soyuncu in the box from Declan Rice's cross, Antonio turned past the centre-back and found the bottom corner.\nHis night was not over yet. As a packed London Stadium chanted 'ole' with each Hammers pass, Antonio capped off a near-perfect evening as he flicked the ball above two Leicester defenders, before beating them both on the turn and stabbing past Schmeichel.\nAfter missing out on a place in the top four by two points last season, West Ham start the new campaign full of optimism and - even if after only two games - end the day top of the Premier League for just the second time ever.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

After a long video assistant referee review, the referee's decision not to give the penalty stood.\nIf Rob Holding had scored with a header from eight yards out in the second half, that could have sparked a comeback but he headed wide.\nArsenal have injury and illness problems - with \u00a350m centre-back White out with Covid, Alexandre Lacazette recovering from the illness and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang only fit for the bench after catching the virus too.\nBut all signs are already pointing to another season of struggle.

The right-back clipped a first-time pass into the box for Mane to fire past Pope as he opened his tally for the new season with his 50th goal for the Reds.\nEverything you need to know about Liverpool, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about Burnley, all in one place\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He is so big and strong to stop - it was a great goal.\n\"We played well first half and it was nice to get the second and give us a cushion. Watford responded as we anticipated and when we had to defend we did that and did it well.\n\"Back to back wins at any stage are hard to achieve. We are in a good place, but it is just a start.\"\nWatford manager Xisco Munoz to BBC Sport: \"I think we need to learn quickly about the Premier League. The positive thing was in the second half we gave a very good performance.\n\"I think the first half was two mistakes - one bad pass and one problem with set pieces - and we concede two goals.

Solskjaer then moving to punish Saints further by sending on \u00a373m man Jadon Sancho for the disappointing Anthony Martial.\nInstead, it was Southampton who created the best opportunity to take all three points as De Gea saved crucially from Adam Armstrong when he looked to poised to score.\nUnited boss Solskjaer will be disappointed with both the performance and the result but this was no more than Southampton deserved as they bounced back impressively from defeat at Everton in their first game.\n'From basketball to rugby' - Solskjaer joins Klopp in criticising new refereeing approach\nMan Utd fall well short\nManchester United opened brightly and had a threatening spell after equalising but otherwise this was an average performance from a side harbouring genuine Premier League title ambitions.\nUnited grew increasingly sloppy as the game went on, the occasional moments of sparkle from Paul Pogba failing to compensate for the complete lack of inspiration around him.\nMartial contributed little or nothing and it was no surprise when was replaced by Sancho, who was quiet as Southampton regained composure and a measure of control after Greenwood's leveller.\nNemanja Matic was ponderous and off the pace while Fred's main contribution was to unwittingly deflect Adams' shot agonisingly out of the reach of De Gea when Saints went in front.\nWho knows what goes on behind the scenes but those two performances pose the question of what Donny van de Beek must lack in Solskjaer's eyes to seemingly not even merit serious consideration for a place in United's engine room?\nScott McTominay was left on the bench until late on but when he came on the pattern of the game was set.\nUnited, who hit the bar through Pogba in the first half, are now unbeaten in their last 27 away games in the Premier League, equalling the longest unbeaten away record in the English top flight set by Arsenal between April 2003 and September 2004, but this accolade would have tasted sweeter on the back of a victory.\nIt is very early days and United were superb when thrashing Leeds United but this was the sort of careless, lacklustre display they cannot afford to repeat too often in a season that already looks like it will offer little margin for error for those chasing honours at the top of the table.\nSaints show their mettle\nSouthampton's week brightened up considerably after that opening-day 3-1 loss at Everton when James Ward-Prowse, their most influential player, committed his future to the club by signing a new five-year contract.\nAnd spirits will have been lifted even further by the manner in which they earned a point against big-spending United that was richly merited.\nSaints were on the back foot amid United's early surge but held firm to take the lead and then, when United drew level and appeared to be carrying all the momentum, they showed the character and resilience to recover from the setback to push United all the way and threaten to take all three points.\nArmstrong, their \u00a315m summer signing from Blackburn Rovers, will be disappointed he did not take the big chance to take all three points when he was played through by Adams, De Gea diving low to his left to rescue United.\nThe striker then had the chance to make amends from the resulting corner but could not force home a header at the far post.\nSouthampton and manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, who greeted the final whistle with a fist-pump salute, will be very satisfied with the outcome and the performance and he look to have captured a real gem in 18-year-old right-back Valentino Livramento, signed from Chelsea for \u00a35m.\nThe youngster was outstanding, both in the physical challenges in defence and also as an attacking threat, with one storming first-half run ending with a cross that was only inches away from the incoming Armstrong.\nSaints may feel they could have had all three points but this was a game which gave Hasenhuttl plenty to build on.\nReaction from Southampton v Man Utd, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nEverything you need to know about Southampton, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about Manchester United, all in one place\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

And before the start of the new campaign the West Ham boss would have settled for seven points from the opening three games.\nBut this felt like two points dropped against a team that had failed to score in 270 minutes under their new boss.\nIt could have been worse as Palace finished the game strongly, with Marc Guehi wasting a glorious chance in stoppage time when he sent a free header over the bar.\nBy the time West Ham play their next game at Southampton on 11 September, Moyes will have added reinforcements. After this game, the Hammers announced they had signed France centre-back Kurt Zouma from Chelsea on a four-year deal for \u00a329.8m.\nEncouraging signs for Vieira\nGoing into the game, Palace were yet to impress under Vieira and it looked like another disappointing afternoon when Fornals broke the deadlock six minutes before half-time.\nTheir second half performance, however, was their best 45-minute showing under the new manager, who will take heart from the character his side showed.\nPalace confirmed the signing of Watford midfielder Will Hughes before kick-off and are likely to be one of the busiest clubs on transfer deadline day after releasing nine senior players at the end of last season.\nAt least Gallagher's arrival looks like a good piece of business.\nAt the age of only 21, he showed impressive composure to equalise after Christian Benteke had headed Wilfried Zaha's deep cross into his path.\nHis second was even better, the England Under-21 international producing a lovely turn before beating Lukasz Fabianski with a clinical finish.\nPalace face Tottenham and then Liverpool after the international break but they will take the positives from this battling performance.",

And before the start of the new campaign the West Ham boss would have settled for seven points from the opening three games.\nBut this felt like two points dropped against a team that had failed to score in 270 minutes under their new boss.\nIt could have been worse as Palace finished the game strongly, with Marc Guehi wasting a glorious chance in stoppage time when he sent a free header over the bar.\nBy the time West Ham play their next game at Southampton on 11 September, Moyes will have added reinforcements. After this game, the Hammers announced they had signed France centre-back Kurt Zouma from Chelsea on a four-year deal for \u00a329.8m.\nEncouraging signs for Vieira\nGoing into the game, Palace were yet to impress under Vieira and it looked like another disappointing afternoon when Fornals broke the deadlock six minutes before half-time.\nTheir second half performance, however, was their best 45-minute showing under the new manager, who will take heart from the character his side showed.\nPalace confirmed the signing of Watford midfielder Will Hughes before kick-off and are likely to be one of the busiest clubs on transfer deadline day after releasing nine senior players at the end of last season.\nAt least Gallagher's arrival looks like a good piece of business.\nAt the age of only 21, he showed impressive composure to equalise after Christian Benteke had headed Wilfried Zaha's deep cross into his path.\nHis second was even better, the England Under-21 international producing a lovely turn before beating Lukasz Fabianski with a clinical finish.\nPalace face Tottenham and then Liverpool after the international break but they will take the positives from this battling performance."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester City 5-0 Arsenal: Gunners suffer third league defeat in a row\nTen-man Arsenal were completely outplayed by Manchester City as they slumped to the bottom of the Premier League.\nIt is the first time since 1954 that the Gunners have lost their three opening games of the league season and this match was effectively over by half-time.\nCity captain Ilkay Gundogan and striker Ferran Torres scored in the first 12 minutes and any hope Arsenal had of an unlikely comeback was ended when midfielder Granit Xhaka was sent off for lunging into a challenge on Joao Cancelo.\nA trademark teasing run from \u00a3100m man Jack Grealish set up Gabriel Jesus for an easy third just before the break, then Rodri guided home a fourth from 20 yards just after it.\nSuch was his side's total control that City manager Pep Guardiola had used all three substitutes within 16 minutes of the second half starting. It turned into an extended keep-ball session for the hosts, who finished off the rout with Torres' second six minutes from time.\nGuardiola's counterpart and former assistant Mikel Arteta looked shell-shocked in the other technical area as Raheem Sterling - twice - Aymeric Laporte and Riyad Mahrez wasted opportunities to increase the margin of victory still further.\nBy the end, Arsenal had managed a single shot - off target - and 19% possession. They are still to score in the Premier League this season and immediately after the international break play Norwich, the team they replaced at the foot of the table before the Canaries went back to the bottom after a 2-1 defeat by Leicester City.\nNo Kane, no Ronaldo, no problem\nAfter being forced to abandon their hopes of prising Harry Kane out of Tottenham and opting not to pursue a deal for Manchester United-bound Cristiano Ronaldo, it appears Guardiola will attack the new season without an orthodox number nine.\nIf his side continue to meet opponents as accommodating as Arsenal, there will be no problem.\nThe Gunners defence was so flimsy, it scarcely did justice to their status as a Premier League outfit.\nCity's opener looked good on the eye. But there was no challenge on Bernardo Silva as he strode through the visitors' midfield, no effective closing down of Jesus as he lined up his cross and barely a challenge on Gundogan - hardly the greatest physical threat - as he rose at the far post. Add in Bernd Leno's weak attempt to keep the ball out of his goal and it summed up everything that is wrong about the visitors.\nAt one point, Ederson stood for fully 10 seconds, not moving, as he decided where to aim his clearance. Eventually Emile Smith-Rowe closed the Brazilian down and forced him to do something.\nPerhaps he was a little bored. Earlier, he had delayed for so long an intended pass from his own goal-line that Smith-Rowe almost nicked the ball but could only watch as it ricocheted off him and narrowly wide of the far post. That was as close as Arsenal came to scoring.\nIn his programme notes Guardiola proclaimed this would be a 'tough game' for his team. By the end, it was City's biggest ever win against the Gunners and their third successive 5-0 home win in the league.\nXhaka's red card folly\nArsenal's performance dispelled any notion that a 6-0 Carabao Cup triumph over a team of West Brom youngsters in midweek might shunt Arteta's under-firing group into life.\nThe return of skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and new signing Martin Odegaard made no noticeable difference to two previously tepid performances against Brentford and Chelsea.\nThe Gunners' hapless state was exemplified by Xhaka.\nAn experienced international, needed to guide the youngsters around him, Xhaka's response to his team going two goals down so early in a key game was to launch himself at Cancelo in a manner that made referee Martin Atkinson's decision to brandish a red card automatic.\nArteta offered some sympathy to the Swiss as he made his way down the tunnel and spoke to the fourth official in a manner that indicated he felt the decision was wrong.\nHe may have a different opinion when he reviews the incident - but there is far more for Arteta to find criticism of from this.\nManchester City are next in action at Leicester on Saturday, 11 September (15:00 BST). On the same day, Arsenal entertain Norwich (15:00).\nFollow live text and radio coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nEverything you need to know about Manchester City, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about Arsenal, all in one place\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They responded spiritedly to Albrighton's goal, but after McLean's header hit the back of the net at a corner, Jones consulted VAR again to rule out what had looked to be the equaliser.\nFoxes bounce back\nBrendan Rodgers will be pleased by his side's response to a chastening 4-1 defeat by West Ham in their previous outing, but he will know his side can play better.\nAnd the Foxes also had to contend with the early loss of Pereira, who limped off after his role in Vardy's opener, potentially adding to an already ample injury list.\nAlbrighton's winner was his side's first shot on target of the second half and just his fourth league goal in three years.\nMcLean's disallowed equaliser was followed by pressure on the Leicester goal that saw Joshua Sargent and Idah miss chances, but the Foxes hung on to move up into eighth place.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They responded spiritedly to Albrighton's goal, but after McLean's header hit the back of the net at a corner, Jones consulted VAR again to rule out what had looked to be the equaliser.\nFoxes bounce back\nBrendan Rodgers will be pleased by his side's response to a chastening 4-1 defeat by West Ham in their previous outing, but he will know his side can play better.\nAnd the Foxes also had to contend with the early loss of Pereira, who limped off after his role in Vardy's opener, potentially adding to an already ample injury list.\nAlbrighton's winner was his side's first shot on target of the second half and just his fourth league goal in three years.\nMcLean's disallowed equaliser was followed by pressure on the Leicester goal that saw Joshua Sargent and Idah miss chances, but the Foxes hung on to move up into eighth place.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester City 5-0 Arsenal: Gunners suffer third league defeat in a row\nTen-man Arsenal were completely outplayed by Manchester City as they slumped to the bottom of the Premier League.\nIt is the first time since 1954 that the Gunners have lost their three opening games of the league season and this match was effectively over by half-time.\nCity captain Ilkay Gundogan and striker Ferran Torres scored in the first 12 minutes and any hope Arsenal had of an unlikely comeback was ended when midfielder Granit Xhaka was sent off for lunging into a challenge on Joao Cancelo.\nA trademark teasing run from \u00a3100m man Jack Grealish set up Gabriel Jesus for an easy third just before the break, then Rodri guided home a fourth from 20 yards just after it.\nSuch was his side's total control that City manager Pep Guardiola had used all three substitutes within 16 minutes of the second half starting. It turned into an extended keep-ball session for the hosts, who finished off the rout with Torres' second six minutes from time.\nGuardiola's counterpart and former assistant Mikel Arteta looked shell-shocked in the other technical area as Raheem Sterling - twice - Aymeric Laporte and Riyad Mahrez wasted opportunities to increase the margin of victory still further.\nBy the end, Arsenal had managed a single shot - off target - and 19% possession. They are still to score in the Premier League this season and immediately after the international break play Norwich, the team they replaced at the foot of the table before the Canaries went back to the bottom after a 2-1 defeat by Leicester City.\nNo Kane, no Ronaldo, no problem\nAfter being forced to abandon their hopes of prising Harry Kane out of Tottenham and opting not to pursue a deal for Manchester United-bound Cristiano Ronaldo, it appears Guardiola will attack the new season without an orthodox number nine.\nIf his side continue to meet opponents as accommodating as Arsenal, there will be no problem.\nThe Gunners defence was so flimsy, it scarcely did justice to their status as a Premier League outfit.\nCity's opener looked good on the eye. But there was no challenge on Bernardo Silva as he strode through the visitors' midfield, no effective closing down of Jesus as he lined up his cross and barely a challenge on Gundogan - hardly the greatest physical threat - as he rose at the far post. Add in Bernd Leno's weak attempt to keep the ball out of his goal and it summed up everything that is wrong about the visitors.\nAt one point, Ederson stood for fully 10 seconds, not moving, as he decided where to aim his clearance. Eventually Emile Smith-Rowe closed the Brazilian down and forced him to do something.\nPerhaps he was a little bored. Earlier, he had delayed for so long an intended pass from his own goal-line that Smith-Rowe almost nicked the ball but could only watch as it ricocheted off him and narrowly wide of the far post. That was as close as Arsenal came to scoring.\nIn his programme notes Guardiola proclaimed this would be a 'tough game' for his team. By the end, it was City's biggest ever win against the Gunners and their third successive 5-0 home win in the league.\nXhaka's red card folly\nArsenal's performance dispelled any notion that a 6-0 Carabao Cup triumph over a team of West Brom youngsters in midweek might shunt Arteta's under-firing group into life.\nThe return of skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and new signing Martin Odegaard made no noticeable difference to two previously tepid performances against Brentford and Chelsea.\nThe Gunners' hapless state was exemplified by Xhaka.\nAn experienced international, needed to guide the youngsters around him, Xhaka's response to his team going two goals down so early in a key game was to launch himself at Cancelo in a manner that made referee Martin Atkinson's decision to brandish a red card automatic.\nArteta offered some sympathy to the Swiss as he made his way down the tunnel and spoke to the fourth official in a manner that indicated he felt the decision was wrong.\nHe may have a different opinion when he reviews the incident - but there is far more for Arteta to find criticism of from this.\nManchester City are next in action at Leicester on Saturday, 11 September (15:00 BST). On the same day, Arsenal entertain Norwich (15:00).\nFollow live text and radio coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nEverything you need to know about Manchester City, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about Arsenal, all in one place\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

But Newcastle's efforts were irrelevant to the ecstatic home fans, who had the added bonus of their side returning to the top of the Premier League.\nRecap Manchester United v Newcastle, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nEverything you need to know about Manchester United, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about the Magpies, all in one place\nSignificant day at Old Trafford\nYou only had to look in the directors' box to understand this was a special day for the hosts.\nExecutive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who has not been seen since the Super League debacle, and co-chairman Avram Glazer, who was making his first Old Trafford visit in two years, were both present.\nGlazer and Woodward both played central roles in Ronaldo's return to the club from Juventus.\nHowever, Sir Alex Ferguson was arguably even more significant in the move, ringing the Portuguese to implore him to return to the club where he is still feted as a hero, rather than accept an offer from Manchester City.\nRonaldo proved he still has much to offer at the age of 36, and that the efforts to entice him back to the club were worthwhile.\nHis opener showed the value of anticipation, as he followed Greenwood's shot in when the Newcastle defenders hesitated.\nThe second emphasised that Ronaldo retains enough speed to cause problems for defences as he charged clear to take his overall Manchester United tally to 120.\nAlthough he has never previously operated as a striker in the conventional sense, that is where he started - and largely he stayed there. He did drop deeper at times, but generally was the most advanced Manchester United player.\nAt times, that did mean the hosts searched for wider crossing positions more often than a team with such gifted technical players would prefer. But the ends justified the means on this occasion.\nThere was, however, to be no repeat of the hat-trick he scored on his last appearance against Newcastle at Old Trafford in January 2008.\nNevertheless, with Fernandes delivering the kind of goal that has earned him hero status at the club and Lingard giving a reminder of the ability he showed on loan at West Ham, it was a victory that went beyond the contribution of a single individual - even if Ronaldo's name will dominate the aftermath.\nNewcastle hope extinguished\nRonaldo's momentous goal must have felt like a kick in the guts for former Old Trafford captain Bruce.\nNewcastle's record at the ground is terrible and the build-up to this game pitched them in the role of spoilsports, trying to wreck a party that had been building up all week.\nThrough a combination of disciplined defending, what could be kindly described as 'time management' - which irritated the home fans immensely - and incisive counter-attacks, Newcastle were excellent.\nAllan Saint-Maximin, Sean Longstaff and Joe Willock all got themselves in a position to threaten David de Gea's goal without managing to beat the home keeper.\nRonaldo's goal with the half time break beckoning ruined all that good work, and it was so preventable too.\nIsaac Hayden was standing next to the Portuguese when Greenwood took aim but, unlike Ronaldo, he didn't gamble on the outcome and was not in position to challenge when Woodman made his mistake.\nTo their credit, Newcastle renewed their efforts after half-time and for a brief time after they had capitalised on a Harry Maguire error to convert a superb counter-attack - which ended with Saint-Maximin prodding a ball through for Manquillo's second goal in English football - a second Old Trafford win since 1972 seemed possible.\nThat hope evaporated as Ronaldo returned to centre stage, leaving the visiting fans to renew their chants demanding change at the top of their club.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

However, former England forward Danny Welbeck could only shoot tamely at David Raya when he only had the Bees keeper to beat.\nIn a second half largely lacking quality, the better chances continued to fall to the hosts but Shandon Baptiste, making his first Premier League start, wasted another opportunity.\nBrentford deserved at least a point, but their fans went home disappointed when Trossard collected the ball from substitute Alexis Mac Allister, dribbled along the 18-yard box and unleashed a fine strike for the winning goal.\nThe only downside for Brighton was a first-half injury to centre-back Adam Webster who sustained a muscle injury when making a clearance and had to be replaced.\nBrentford are next in action on 18 September with an away game at Wolves (12:30 BST), before Brighton entertain Leicester the following day (14:00 BST).\n'One moment decides the game' - what they said\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was an even game between two sides that wanted to get on top.

Burnley defender James Tarkowski seemed to exact revenge on the Brazilian with a full-blooded challenge by the sidelines.\nBut, in both cases, referee Martin Atkinson deemed there was no foul, let alone further punishment.\nBenitez was particularly incensed by the tackle on the Everton forward, who was operating up front on his own in the absence of Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The England striker is set to miss two to three weeks with thigh and toe injuries, although Benitez said after the game that it could be longer.\nThe Everton boss, however, will be pleased his side came through a tough encounter without their top scorer as an exciting start to the season continued.\nBurnley are still searching for their first win and remain 18th with a single point.\nTownsend the architect of stunning win\nThe reaction from home fans to this success was in stark contrast to the end of the first half, where Burnley edged an ugly encounter.\nAfter also coming from behind to beat Southampton on the opening weekend by the same scoreline, Benitez once again showed he still has the magic touch.\nOn that occasion a tactical tweak turned the game in Everton's favour. This time it was Townsend who was the architect of a fine victory, which banished memories of their poor home form last season under former boss Carlo Ancelotti.\nTownsend and Gray have been revelations since signing for the Toffees for a grand total of \u00a31.7m this summer.\nTheir constant running has injected pace and versatility into the side and, on a day when Everton missed Calvert-Lewin and a 3-4-3 formation seemed to be misfiring, the pair showed why they are fast becoming fans' favourites.\nThey were largely silent in the first period, however, as Everton struggled to deal with a direct and robust Sean Dyche side.\nDwight McNeil, linked with a move to Everton in the transfer window and scorer of the winner here last season, served up a delicious cross to Chris Wood, who could not get a firm contact on his header. Mee and Josh Brownhill also went close.\nBut a sedate match sparked into life around the half-hour mark when the home crowd were quick to show their frustration with the players and tempers began to flare on the pitch.\nRicharlison body-checked Mee, with Ashley Westwood and Seamus Coleman - who shrugged off a hamstring injury to start - arguing in the aftermath.\nTarkowski seemed to seek retribution by steaming through Richarlison on the touchline.\nIn the end, three Everton goals in six minutes, and a debut for new striker Salomon Rondon, proved the best response of all.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

That was partly down to Ederson, whose participation in this game had been in doubt along with Jesus.\nThe Brazilian duo were eventually cleared to play for their clubs this weekend after complaints about their failure to report for international duty were dropped - and both played key roles in their team's latest win.\nEderson received a facial injury and required lengthy treatment after making a brave save to keep out Barnes before denying substitute Ademola Lookman late on.\nAt the other end, Jesus was lively and would surely have scored but for Schmeichel's superb early save.\nAfter making a losing start to the season, Guardiola's side are beginning to hit familiar form.\nBy winning their first match away from Etihad Stadium since 14 May, they have made a perfect start to a testing week that sees them start their latest attempt to win the Champions League for the first time.\nWednesday's home group game with RB Leipzig, last season's Bundesliga runners-up, will provide another big test for City.\nThey will prepare for it on the back of a winning run and with confidence sky-high.\nFoxes offer plenty of promise\nThere was no repeat for Leicester of the triumphant scenes at Wembley five weeks ago when Kelechi Iheanacho's 89th-minute penalty defeated Guardiola's side in the Community Shield.\nDespite a second defeat in three games, there were still plenty of positives for Brendan Rodgers at the start of a busy period of games that will go some way to shaping the Foxes' season.\nRodgers gave first league starts to summer signings Ryan Bertrand and Jannik Vestergaard in what was the first of seven league and cup matches in the space of 22 days.\nBoth showed promise by making important blocks while Lookman - who joined shortly before the summer transfer window closed last month - was a lively addition after appearing as a 73rd-minute substitute.\nAs well as forcing Ederson into a clever save, former Everton winger Lookman was denied by Ruben Dias after the defender blocked his goal-bound shot late on.\nLeicester, who also welcomed back Jonny Evans from a foot injury, have endured a mixed start to the season after winning two and losing two of their four games.\nBut there is plenty of optimism in the air as they get ready to launch another Europa League campaign at home to Napoli on Thursday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We tried something a little bit different today, we tried to invite them to play a little bit more.\n\"Armando [Broja] showed he is a very good sub. He was immediately on to the opposition and had some threats that are new to this team. This was good to see and gives me a lot of confidence for the future.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes speaking to BBC Sport: \"Southampton made it difficult for us, but overall we had a lot of control of the game but we just couldn't find the openings or the moments required to get a goal.\n\"I felt we played well with the ball, but we didn't do that in the final third. I think we were poor, we didn't have the connections. It may have had a lot to do with the players being away for the international break.\"\nOn the red card: \"[Antonio] had been booked for the first one. You just don't make any more challenges and give the referee a decision to make. My feeling was from where I was it was probably a booking and he got sent off for it.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Cristiano Ronaldo twice scores as Manchester United beat Newcastle\nCristiano Ronaldo scored twice on his return to Manchester United as the hosts eventually cruised to victory against Newcastle United and delighted a packed Old Trafford.\nCheered from the moment he left the team coach on its arrival at the ground, throughout the warm-up and then once the game had started, Ronaldo repaid the backing in the best possible manner.\nTwelve years after he last scored for Manchester United in this stadium, Ronaldo broke the deadlock in first-half added time when he tapped in after visiting keeper Freddie Woodman spilled Mason Greenwood's shot.\nThen, after Javier Manquillo had levelled with his first Newcastle goal, Ronaldo finished off a flowing move by racing on to Luke Shaw's through ball and drilling a low shot through Woodman's legs.\nHis international team-mate Bruno Fernandes rifled in the goal of the game as he collected Paul Pogba's square pass and curled a shot into the top corner from the edge of the area before substitute Jesse Lingard added a fourth in added time.\nThe margin of victory was harsh on Steve Bruce's men, who played well for long periods. But Newcastle's efforts were irrelevant to the ecstatic home fans, who had the added bonus of their side returning to the top of the Premier League.\nRecap Manchester United v Newcastle, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nEverything you need to know about Manchester United, all in one place\nEverything you need to know about the Magpies, all in one place\nSignificant day at Old Trafford\nYou only had to look in the directors' box to understand this was a special day for the hosts.\nExecutive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who has not been seen since the Super League debacle, and co-chairman Avram Glazer, who was making his first Old Trafford visit in two years, were both present.\nGlazer and Woodward both played central roles in Ronaldo's return to the club from Juventus.\nHowever, Sir Alex Ferguson was arguably even more significant in the move, ringing the Portuguese to implore him to return to the club where he is still feted as a hero, rather than accept an offer from Manchester City.\nRonaldo proved he still has much to offer at the age of 36, and that the efforts to entice him back to the club were worthwhile.\nHis opener showed the value of anticipation, as he followed Greenwood's shot in when the Newcastle defenders hesitated.\nThe second emphasised that Ronaldo retains enough speed to cause problems for defences as he charged clear to take his overall Manchester United tally to 120.\nAlthough he has never previously operated as a striker in the conventional sense, that is where he started - and largely he stayed there. He did drop deeper at times, but generally was the most advanced Manchester United player.\nAt times, that did mean the hosts searched for wider crossing positions more often than a team with such gifted technical players would prefer. But the ends justified the means on this occasion.\nThere was, however, to be no repeat of the hat-trick he scored on his last appearance against Newcastle at Old Trafford in January 2008.\nNevertheless, with Fernandes delivering the kind of goal that has earned him hero status at the club and Lingard giving a reminder of the ability he showed on loan at West Ham, it was a victory that went beyond the contribution of a single individual - even if Ronaldo's name will dominate the aftermath.\nNewcastle hope extinguished\nRonaldo's momentous goal must have felt like a kick in the guts for former Old Trafford captain Bruce.\nNewcastle's record at the ground is terrible and the build-up to this game pitched them in the role of spoilsports, trying to wreck a party that had been building up all week.\nThrough a combination of disciplined defending, what could be kindly described as 'time management' - which irritated the home fans immensely - and incisive counter-attacks, Newcastle were excellent.\nAllan Saint-Maximin, Sean Longstaff and Joe Willock all got themselves in a position to threaten David de Gea's goal without managing to beat the home keeper.\nRonaldo's goal with the half time break beckoning ruined all that good work, and it was so preventable too.\nIsaac Hayden was standing next to the Portuguese when Greenwood took aim but, unlike Ronaldo, he didn't gamble on the outcome and was not in position to challenge when Woodman made his mistake.\nTo their credit, Newcastle renewed their efforts after half-time and for a brief time after they had capitalised on a Harry Maguire error to convert a superb counter-attack - which ended with Saint-Maximin prodding a ball through for Manquillo's second goal in English football - a second Old Trafford win since 1972 seemed possible.\nThat hope evaporated as Ronaldo returned to centre stage, leaving the visiting fans to renew their chants demanding change at the top of their club.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He fired wastefully over the crossbar from only eight yards out following Toney's pull-back from the byeline, then shot over and also curled an effort just wide from the edge of the penalty area.\nToney, whose 31 league goals helped Brentford gain promotion last season, headed off target from a well-worked free-kick and nearly caught out Albion goalkeeper Robert Sanchez with a cheeky long-range effort.\nBrighton have already beaten Burnley and Watford this season and should have gone ahead early on. However, former England forward Danny Welbeck could only shoot tamely at David Raya when he only had the Bees keeper to beat.\nIn a second half largely lacking quality, the better chances continued to fall to the hosts but Shandon Baptiste, making his first Premier League start, wasted another opportunity.\nBrentford deserved at least a point, but their fans went home disappointed when Trossard collected the ball from substitute Alexis Mac Allister, dribbled along the 18-yard box and unleashed a fine strike for the winning goal.\nThe only downside for Brighton was a first-half injury to centre-back Adam Webster who sustained a muscle injury when making a clearance and had to be replaced.\nBrentford are next in action on 18 September with an away game at Wolves (12:30 BST), before Brighton entertain Leicester the following day (14:00 BST).\n'One moment decides the game' - what they said\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was an even game between two sides that wanted to get on top. Until the 75th minute, we were better or at least had more dangerous situations.\n\"In the last 15, we were more under pressure. Defensively we set high standards. Just four shots away. Offensively, in spells we were good but we need to be better. We had chances to score and we need to score some.\n\"One moment decides the game and that is the Premier League. A solid performance. We could have edged it.\n\"We need to look into the performance. We played a good Brighton side and were unlucky.\"\nBrighton head coach Graham Potter, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm really pleased for the boys and supporters. It was a hard-fought match.\n\"You see the belief in what Brentford are doing. First half, they were the better team and we had to stick in. Second half, we grew into the game and it is great to get the finish at the end. Away wins are always terrific.\n\"It is not easy to control it here but the players did it well.

That was partly down to Ederson, whose participation in this game had been in doubt along with Jesus.\nThe Brazilian duo were eventually cleared to play for their clubs this weekend after complaints about their failure to report for international duty were dropped - and both played key roles in their team's latest win.\nEderson received a facial injury and required lengthy treatment after making a brave save to keep out Barnes before denying substitute Ademola Lookman late on.\nAt the other end, Jesus was lively and would surely have scored but for Schmeichel's superb early save.\nAfter making a losing start to the season, Guardiola's side are beginning to hit familiar form.\nBy winning their first match away from Etihad Stadium since 14 May, they have made a perfect start to a testing week that sees them start their latest attempt to win the Champions League for the first time.\nWednesday's home group game with RB Leipzig, last season's Bundesliga runners-up, will provide another big test for City.\nThey will prepare for it on the back of a winning run and with confidence sky-high.\nFoxes offer plenty of promise\nThere was no repeat for Leicester of the triumphant scenes at Wembley five weeks ago when Kelechi Iheanacho's 89th-minute penalty defeated Guardiola's side in the Community Shield.\nDespite a second defeat in three games, there were still plenty of positives for Brendan Rodgers at the start of a busy period of games that will go some way to shaping the Foxes' season.\nRodgers gave first league starts to summer signings Ryan Bertrand and Jannik Vestergaard in what was the first of seven league and cup matches in the space of 22 days.\nBoth showed promise by making important blocks while Lookman - who joined shortly before the summer transfer window closed last month - was a lively addition after appearing as a 73rd-minute substitute.\nAs well as forcing Ederson into a clever save, former Everton winger Lookman was denied by Ruben Dias after the defender blocked his goal-bound shot late on.\nLeicester, who also welcomed back Jonny Evans from a foot injury, have endured a mixed start to the season after winning two and losing two of their four games.\nBut there is plenty of optimism in the air as they get ready to launch another Europa League campaign at home to Napoli on Thursday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

After the break it was one-way traffic as Chelsea grew into the game and a flat Spurs side looked lethargic after going behind.\nHarry Kane was kept quiet and restricted to just two chances and often looked lost at the top of the pitch. It is the first time since 2015-16 that the England striker has failed to score in his first four Premier League appearances of a season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

City had to be wary of Tino Livramento's frequent breaks forward down the right and Adam Armstrong also impressed with his work on and off the ball.\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl has not enjoyed his visits to these parts too much in the past few months, with his side shipping 14 goals in heavy defeats at City and Manchester United last season, but a much-deserved point should give him reason to celebrate at last.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

As the 60-year-old headed down the tunnel, his face told the story of a man relieved for now but who faces an uphill task to turn the mood around.\nSaint-Maximin shines on torrid night for Newcastle\nAfter a week where Bruce declared that quitting was \"not in my nature\", this was an atmosphere which perhaps proved that his family was right to think he was \"sick\" for staying in the job.\nIt took only three minutes before a section sang \"we want Brucey out\" but as the hosts unravelled under Leeds' relentless counter-attacks, large sections of St James' Park made their feelings known.\nIn a frantic first half, where Leeds could have scored three or four goals, the atmosphere threatened to boil over.\nRaphinha's opener was another stain on a defence who came into the match having conceded 13 goals, the most in the Premier League this season.\nKarl Darlow returned in goal after being in hospital with Covid-19 and was called into action on several occasions, as Leeds created plenty of opportunities, with Raphinha, Daniel James, Mateusz Klich and Junior Firpo all going close.\nA stressed Bruce winced on the sidelines. Despite Newcastle's defensive frailties, they still looked sharp in attack, with Saint-Maximin, playing up front, at the heart of their endeavour and in the end he proved a saviour.\nA good break from the French forward led to Ritchie hitting the woodwork, and his goal before the break was transformative, although there was still time for Newcastle to almost concede again when Raphinha was guilty of missing when on his own in the opposition box.\nA more sedate and equal second half suited Bruce and Newcastle, who were without last season's top scorer Callum Wilson, as the energy both sides showed in the first half dissipated.\nDarlow, who replaced a struggling Freddie Woodman provided the extra assurance that the hosts needed, especially when he had to save from Jamaal Lascelles, who almost headed into his own net.\nSaint-Maximin drew two equally fine stops from Meslier in the Leeds goal and created a fine chance for Joelinton, who fired over, to groans all around the ground.\nGiven that the first half could have been a lot worse for Newcastle and their under-fire boss, a point was a decent return and spoke of a good second-half recovery.\nFor Bielsa's side, it was their third draw of the season and although it is the first time they have gone five games without a win under the Argentine, there was plenty of encouragement that their form will improve.\nThe same might not be said for Newcastle, however, as \"Bruce out\" chants rang out and they collected only their second point of the season to remain 18th.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

As the 60-year-old headed down the tunnel, his face told the story of a man relieved for now but who faces an uphill task to turn the mood around.\nSaint-Maximin shines on torrid night for Newcastle\nAfter a week where Bruce declared that quitting was \"not in my nature\", this was an atmosphere which perhaps proved that his family was right to think he was \"sick\" for staying in the job.\nIt took only three minutes before a section sang \"we want Brucey out\" but as the hosts unravelled under Leeds' relentless counter-attacks, large sections of St James' Park made their feelings known.\nIn a frantic first half, where Leeds could have scored three or four goals, the atmosphere threatened to boil over.\nRaphinha's opener was another stain on a defence who came into the match having conceded 13 goals, the most in the Premier League this season.\nKarl Darlow returned in goal after being in hospital with Covid-19 and was called into action on several occasions, as Leeds created plenty of opportunities, with Raphinha, Daniel James, Mateusz Klich and Junior Firpo all going close.\nA stressed Bruce winced on the sidelines. Despite Newcastle's defensive frailties, they still looked sharp in attack, with Saint-Maximin, playing up front, at the heart of their endeavour and in the end he proved a saviour.\nA good break from the French forward led to Ritchie hitting the woodwork, and his goal before the break was transformative, although there was still time for Newcastle to almost concede again when Raphinha was guilty of missing when on his own in the opposition box.\nA more sedate and equal second half suited Bruce and Newcastle, who were without last season's top scorer Callum Wilson, as the energy both sides showed in the first half dissipated.\nDarlow, who replaced a struggling Freddie Woodman provided the extra assurance that the hosts needed, especially when he had to save from Jamaal Lascelles, who almost headed into his own net.\nSaint-Maximin drew two equally fine stops from Meslier in the Leeds goal and created a fine chance for Joelinton, who fired over, to groans all around the ground.\nGiven that the first half could have been a lot worse for Newcastle and their under-fire boss, a point was a decent return and spoke of a good second-half recovery.\nFor Bielsa's side, it was their third draw of the season and although it is the first time they have gone five games without a win under the Argentine, there was plenty of encouragement that their form will improve.\nThe same might not be said for Newcastle, however, as \"Bruce out\" chants rang out and they collected only their second point of the season to remain 18th.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Strike duo Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood have scored just one goal between them in six matches in all competitions and Burnley never really looked like improving on an awful record of 16 goals in their last 22 home league games.\nBarnes should have done better when he headed Westwood's cross wide despite being unmarked, and although he beat the ground in frustration when another chance went begging, his chest control and volley while under pressure from two defenders was a hopeful at best.\nCornet's introduction gave the home fans a lift and the former Lyon man did bring a decent save out of Ramsdale.\nBut aside from the penalty shout, when Taylor mistakenly thought Ramsdale had taken Vydra down without touching the ball, Burnley never really looked like finding an equaliser.\nThe final whistle brought a prolonged period of baiting between the two sets of supporters, who gathered within yards of each other and hurled abuse, followed by a number of missiles.\nA stadium announcement to clear the area initially went unheeded, although the crowds dispersed after around 10 minutes.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

After the break it was one-way traffic as Chelsea grew into the game and a flat Spurs side looked lethargic after going behind.\nHarry Kane was kept quiet and restricted to just two chances and often looked lost at the top of the pitch. It is the first time since 2015-16 that the England striker has failed to score in his first four Premier League appearances of a season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Ben Foster got a hand to his dipping effort, but it wasn't enough to keep it out.\nDarlow denied Sarr when the Senegal winger drove in from the right and unleashed a shot destined for the bottom corner, before he tipped Juraj Kucka's free kick around the post as the hosts searched for parity.\nWith half time looming, Newcastle squandered an excellent chance for a second. Craig Cathcart's backpass was latched on to by Allan Saint-Maximin, who looked to play in Longstaff, but it was slightly behind him and the midfielder could only shoot over.\nNewcastle had more chances after the break, with Foster saving from Miguel Almiron, Joelinton and Joe Willock.

Having kept Sarr quiet for much of the game, they were undone by him in the second half. The opportunity at the end of the first half for Longstaff ultimately proved very costly.\nWatford were second best for long spells but will argue they deserved their draw on the balance of the second half, as their wait for a first clean sheet continues.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

He was a threat all game, he was superb,\" said Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers.\n\"You are seeing his energy in the game, freshness, movement and work rate. He is a top, top striker.

The Belgian produced five key passes for his side, including a perfect ball to set Vardy clear for Leicester's first.\nFor much of the second half Cornet's memorable first Burnley goal looked set to give the Clarets their first win at the sixth attempt.\nThe Ivory Coast international is the first foreign first-team player Burnley have signed from abroad since Steven Defour in 2016, and he complemented his non-negotiable hard work for the team down the left with flair in the final third.\nHis afternoon was cut short as he pulled up with a hamstring injury, however, and while Dyche's side seemed destined to hold out for an important opening win, Vardy had other ideas.\nSweeping past Pope to slot in his fifth goal in six league games this term, he ensured Leicester remain in mid-table following a mixed start to the campaign.\nBurnley, meanwhile, sit second from bottom after picking up two points from a possible 18.\n\"It was a good performance overall. I'm a bit tired of saying that because we have to turn good performances into wins,\" said Dyche.\n\"It's life in the Premier League and we have to tidy up the details.

The chances came and went, Mendy made saves to keep Chelsea alive, but in the end all was well that ended well for City.\nThis was a performance with few flaws apart from that lack of ruthlessness, with Laporte and Ruben Dias in total command at the heart of defence, Kevin de Bruyne adding flourishes in midfield and Grealish prompting throughout.\nGrealish wears his \u00a3100m price tag lightly, playing with freedom and a smile on his face.

Ben Foster got a hand to his dipping effort, but it wasn't enough to keep it out.\nDarlow denied Sarr when the Senegal winger drove in from the right and unleashed a shot destined for the bottom corner, before he tipped Juraj Kucka's free kick around the post as the hosts searched for parity.\nWith half time looming, Newcastle squandered an excellent chance for a second. Craig Cathcart's backpass was latched on to by Allan Saint-Maximin, who looked to play in Longstaff, but it was slightly behind him and the midfielder could only shoot over.\nNewcastle had more chances after the break, with Foster saving from Miguel Almiron, Joelinton and Joe Willock. They paid the price for wastefulness when Sarr levelled with a header at the back post from a corner 18 minutes from time.\nFollow live text commentary of all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nVisit the Watford page\nVisit the Newcastle page\nWait goes on for improving Magpies\nNewcastle boss Bruce wanted to see \"more of the same\" after an open game in the draw with Leeds last week, but his side controlled the game for long spells.\nChances came and went, but overall it was a controlled performance for the visitors.\nSaint-Maximin was lively as always, and Willock was a driving force from midfield, despite previously being ruled out until after the international break with a toe problem.\nPerhaps it was the continued absence of top goalscorer and chief goal threat Callum Wilson, but Newcastle suffered for not putting the game to bed. Having kept Sarr quiet for much of the game, they were undone by him in the second half. The opportunity at the end of the first half for Longstaff ultimately proved very costly.\nWatford were second best for long spells but will argue they deserved their draw on the balance of the second half, as their wait for a first clean sheet continues.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Everyone is OK.\"\nMaupay, who celebrated by cupping his ears in front of the Palace fans, clashed with Zaha on the halfway line as Palace were ready to take the kick-off.\n\"Football is nothing without fans and some involvement with players,\" said Maupay. \"The atmosphere was really tough and when I scored, I looked at Zaha and smiled at him because when he scored his penalty he celebrated and he gave some to our fans.\n\"I won't say what he said and what I said but you know how it is on the pitch with players sometimes. You give banter on the pitch sometimes and it was the perfect time to give him something.\"\nThe game itself was exciting enough before the action in the stands.\nWith seconds left on the clock, Palace keeper Vicente Guaita passed the ball straight to Joel Veltman on the halfway line.\nVeltman hit a long ball into the path of Maupay, who lobbed Guaita from the edge of the box.\nZaha had looked set to be the hero when he scored a penalty - his eighth goal against Albion - at the end of the first half after Leandro Trossard barged over Conor Gallagher.\nMaupay's equaliser was not enough to send Brighton top of the table at the end of a day for the first time in their 120-year history, which a win would have done.\nPalace are a team whose style of play has been transformed under Patrick Vieira this season and will be hugely frustrated by the finale, having missed chances to seal the win.\nVisit the Palace page\nVisit the Brighton page\nLate drama again... but a very different game\nThis is the third time in a row that this rivalry has seen a late game-changing goal.\nLast October, it was Alexis Mac Allister in the 90th minute to rescue a 1-1 draw for Brighton. In February, Christian Benteke scored in the 95th minute as Palace won 2-1.\nBoth those games had something in common - Brighton deserved to win.\nIn those two games Brighton had 45 shots, with Palace scoring with three of their four efforts.\nBut this time it was the Seagulls who were fortunate to get a point.\nPalace are a different team this season. They are proactive now with passing and pressing, compared to the reactive style of counter-attacking football under Roy Hodgson.\nIn the first half of this game, Palace had more shots, touches in Brighton's box and passes in the final third than they had in those two matches last season combined.\nThey deservedly led through Zaha's confident penalty, his fifth goal in five games at Selhurst Park against Albion. Jordan Ayew missed a glorious chance to kill the game off when he shot wide on the end of a counter-attack.\nBrighton remain sixth, a far cry from their four seasons in the Premier League until now, all between 15th and 17th place.\nPotter said before the game not much was actually different this season - just the club having more luck. Or perhaps the absence of bad luck.\nPalace played quite 'Brighton-esque football' at times, especially in the first half, which they dominated.\nActual Brighton were better when Steven Alzate replaced Dan Burn at half-time and they went to a back four. Alzate went off injured himself 20 minutes later, but the system remained.\nThey had as many shots in the first seven minutes of the second half as they did in the first 45 (three). But they had to wait until the 90th minute for another chance with Shane Duffy heading straight at Guaita.\nIt looked as if that would be their final chance but Maupay ghosted in behind the Palace defence to loft the ball over Guaita's head.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Everyone is OK.\"\nMaupay, who celebrated by cupping his ears in front of the Palace fans, clashed with Zaha on the halfway line as Palace were ready to take the kick-off.\n\"Football is nothing without fans and some involvement with players,\" said Maupay. \"The atmosphere was really tough and when I scored, I looked at Zaha and smiled at him because when he scored his penalty he celebrated and he gave some to our fans.\n\"I won't say what he said and what I said but you know how it is on the pitch with players sometimes. You give banter on the pitch sometimes and it was the perfect time to give him something.\"\nThe game itself was exciting enough before the action in the stands.\nWith seconds left on the clock, Palace keeper Vicente Guaita passed the ball straight to Joel Veltman on the halfway line.\nVeltman hit a long ball into the path of Maupay, who lobbed Guaita from the edge of the box.\nZaha had looked set to be the hero when he scored a penalty - his eighth goal against Albion - at the end of the first half after Leandro Trossard barged over Conor Gallagher.\nMaupay's equaliser was not enough to send Brighton top of the table at the end of a day for the first time in their 120-year history, which a win would have done.\nPalace are a team whose style of play has been transformed under Patrick Vieira this season and will be hugely frustrated by the finale, having missed chances to seal the win.\nVisit the Palace page\nVisit the Brighton page\nLate drama again... but a very different game\nThis is the third time in a row that this rivalry has seen a late game-changing goal.\nLast October, it was Alexis Mac Allister in the 90th minute to rescue a 1-1 draw for Brighton. In February, Christian Benteke scored in the 95th minute as Palace won 2-1.\nBoth those games had something in common - Brighton deserved to win.\nIn those two games Brighton had 45 shots, with Palace scoring with three of their four efforts.\nBut this time it was the Seagulls who were fortunate to get a point.\nPalace are a different team this season. They are proactive now with passing and pressing, compared to the reactive style of counter-attacking football under Roy Hodgson.\nIn the first half of this game, Palace had more shots, touches in Brighton's box and passes in the final third than they had in those two matches last season combined.\nThey deservedly led through Zaha's confident penalty, his fifth goal in five games at Selhurst Park against Albion. Jordan Ayew missed a glorious chance to kill the game off when he shot wide on the end of a counter-attack.\nBrighton remain sixth, a far cry from their four seasons in the Premier League until now, all between 15th and 17th place.\nPotter said before the game not much was actually different this season - just the club having more luck. Or perhaps the absence of bad luck.\nPalace played quite 'Brighton-esque football' at times, especially in the first half, which they dominated.\nActual Brighton were better when Steven Alzate replaced Dan Burn at half-time and they went to a back four. Alzate went off injured himself 20 minutes later, but the system remained.\nThey had as many shots in the first seven minutes of the second half as they did in the first 45 (three). But they had to wait until the 90th minute for another chance with Shane Duffy heading straight at Guaita.\nIt looked as if that would be their final chance but Maupay ghosted in behind the Palace defence to loft the ball over Guaita's head.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

He was a threat all game, he was superb,\" said Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers.\n\"You are seeing his energy in the game, freshness, movement and work rate. He is a top, top striker. His movement for the goals was excellent, both were really good team goals but he makes the pass because of his movement.\"\nVisit the Leicester page\nVisit the Burnley page\nVardy has final say as Burnley wait for first win\nIt proved an eventful opening 45 minutes for both Leicester's Vardy and Burnley's Cornet, though as has so often been the case for the Foxes it was Vardy who had the final say.\nThe 34-year-old missed a wonderful chance to put Leicester in front moments before his own goal when he headed Tielemans' whipped cross over from close range.\nMatt Lowton also produced a wonderful sliding challenge to prevent Vardy tapping in Ricardo Pereira's ball across the six-yard box, as Burnley's defence initially stood firm under pressure.\nTielemans was excellent in the Leicester midfield and a route back into the match for the hosts always appeared likely to come through him. The Belgian produced five key passes for his side, including a perfect ball to set Vardy clear for Leicester's first.\nFor much of the second half Cornet's memorable first Burnley goal looked set to give the Clarets their first win at the sixth attempt.\nThe Ivory Coast international is the first foreign first-team player Burnley have signed from abroad since Steven Defour in 2016, and he complemented his non-negotiable hard work for the team down the left with flair in the final third.\nHis afternoon was cut short as he pulled up with a hamstring injury, however, and while Dyche's side seemed destined to hold out for an important opening win, Vardy had other ideas.\nSweeping past Pope to slot in his fifth goal in six league games this term, he ensured Leicester remain in mid-table following a mixed start to the campaign.\nBurnley, meanwhile, sit second from bottom after picking up two points from a possible 18.\n\"It was a good performance overall. I'm a bit tired of saying that because we have to turn good performances into wins,\" said Dyche.\n\"It's life in the Premier League and we have to tidy up the details. We might just need a twist of fate on our side.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

The chances came and went, Mendy made saves to keep Chelsea alive, but in the end all was well that ended well for City.\nThis was a performance with few flaws apart from that lack of ruthlessness, with Laporte and Ruben Dias in total command at the heart of defence, Kevin de Bruyne adding flourishes in midfield and Grealish prompting throughout.\nGrealish wears his \u00a3100m price tag lightly, playing with freedom and a smile on his face. He could have had two goals - and certainly should have had one when Mendy saved at his feet - and created opportunities for others.\nWhen he was substituted with minutes to go as Guardiola looked to close out the win, he responded to the jeers of Chelsea's fans with a beaming smile.\nThis was a job very well done by Grealish - and Manchester City.\nChelsea suffer at Guardiola's hands\nAs Manchester City took total control, Chelsea's misery was illustrated by the grim statistic that they did not muster a single shot on target. And this is a fair reflection of their performance.\nThomas Tuchel's side have looked a powerhouse this season, even winning games when not playing well as they did against Aston Villa, and earning a point at Anfield despite being down to 10 men for 45 minutes.\nThis, in contrast, was a dreadful display which spluttered throughout, barely getting out of first gear and rarely giving Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson an anxious moment.\nTuchel has rightly been hailed for his tactical acumen since his arrival at Chelsea, particularly when overcoming this same Manchester City side to win the Champions League in Porto.\nHere, however, Tuchel was in furious and frustrated mood from the first whistle as Chelsea failed to lay a glove on City, although his set up of three defensively-minded midfield players in N'Golo Kante, Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic did not help.\nChelsea strike pair of Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner were cut adrift, although the performances and touch of both strikers disappointed on the rare occasions they were able to get into the game.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications to make sure you never miss a moment"

Salah's run and pass was sheer perfection and his attacking partner gratefully accepted the invitation to finish in style.\nAnd after the excellent Foden drew City level, Salah scored a goal that will live long in the memory as he twisted and turned in between a host of City defenders before lashing an unstoppable finish past Ederson.\nIt was a goal worthy of winning any match, but in reality Liverpool could not complain at only getting a point as they struggled to exert their authority.\nSalah's masterclass, however, showed once again that he truly belongs among the game's elite.\nFoden shows his class for City\nFoden's importance for City was also emphasised as he gave Milner a nightmare for the 78 minutes the Liverpool veteran was on the pitch, and scored a crucial equaliser just as The Kop sensed their side had finally established supremacy.\nMilner, in at right-back with Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, simply could not cope with Foden, escaping with a foul on the edge of the area that was not given then being booked for hauling the youngster down in desperate fashion.\nCity were clearly determined to probe the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence where Milner was not actually receiving too much assistance, and it was no surprise that Foden found himself in space to give Allison no chance with a fine finish to level.\nThis was a good response from City to their midweek Champions League loss to Paris St-Germain, although once against questions will be raised about the lack of a recognised striker when a host of first-half chances were not taken.\nCity's play was measured and, with Ruben Dias and Aymeric Laporte solid at the back, it took those two moments of rare skill by Salah to unlock them.\nIt would have been harsh on City had they not got at least a point and Guardiola's joy was obvious when De Bruyne got the leveller, albeit he was running hot with fury at the time after referee Paul Tierney decided against giving that second yellow card to Milner - earning one himself as his vociferous protests continued after Salah had restored Liverpool's lead.\nCity have performed impressively against the two teams widely regard as their closest Premier League title rivals in the last eight days, winning at Chelsea then coming away with a point at Anfield.\nGuardiola will regard four points as a reasonable return and will be highly satisfied that his team could have had the maximum, even pressing for a winner in the closing moments.\nThe most decisive contribution in this frantic finale, however, came from Rodri as he somehow blocked Fabinho in a packed goalmouth when he looked certain to score the match-winner.\nHe made a crucial intervention and Guardiola was all smiles again at the final whistle.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He opted for Vardy, who took a touch before side-footing in Leicester's second.\nThe 34-year-old is now the Premier League's leading goalscorer with six goals in seven games this season. Since turning 30, he has scored 90 goals in the competition.\nPalace impressed early in the second half and went close through Odsonne Edouard, who crashed his effort against the crossbar after cutting inside Caglar Soyuncu and Jannik Vestergaard.\nThey finally find a breakthrough when, after replacing Jordan Ayew early in the second half, 19-year-old Olise saw his first effort from Tyrick Mitchell's cross blocked, before he brilliantly volleyed the rebound past Schmeichel.\nAged 19 years and 295 days, Olise is the first teenager to score for Palace in the Premier League since Clinton Morrison in May 1998.\nThat goal really lifted the home crowd and it seemed like one-way traffic. Vieira got his substitutions spot on and Selhurst Park was sent into raptures when Schlupp headed in the equaliser against his former side.\nHis goal after 48 seconds is the second-quickest by a substitute in the Premier League this season, after team-mate Edouard took just 29 seconds to score against Tottenham.\nSchlupp came close to heading in a second three minutes from time, but his effort glanced just wide of the far post as the sides were forced to settle for a point.\nReaction from Selhurst Park and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nVisit the Crystal Palace page\nVisit the Leicester page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It was more than the man himself managed. Left on the bench after his injury-time winner against Villarreal on Wednesday, Ronaldo came on in the 57th minute but had minimal impact either before or after the equaliser.\nEverton thought they had a winner four minutes from time but VAR intervened to rule Yerry Mina's tap-in out for offside.\nThe result completes a decidedly unimpressive run of home results for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team, who lost against Aston Villa seven days ago after being dumped out of the EFL Cup by West Ham.\nUnconvincing Man Utd\nEven at half-time, with United top of the 'in-play' table, there remained so many questions to be asked of Solskjaer and his team.\nMore should be known in the weeks following the upcoming international break.\nHome fixtures with Liverpool and Manchester City, plus tricky trips to Leicester and Tottenham will, at the very least, give an indication about United's ability to challenge for the title deep into the season, something they looked like doing last term, only to fade badly in January just as Pep Guardiola's squad were surging clear.\nFor the opening 10 minutes against Everton, they retained the speed and fluidity so often lacking. And then it drifted away.\nBy the time Martial broke the deadlock, it was the visitors who were carrying the greater goal threat. Salomon Rondon and Abdoulaye Doucoure had shots blocked and David de Gea produced a superb one-handed save to deny the excellent Gray.\nThat opportunity was created when what should have been a straightforward pass to Edinson Cavani from Fernandes went straight to Lucas Digne.\nCavani did bring a good save out of Jordan Pickford with a downward header when the game was still goalless and Jadon Sancho might have done better with a late opportunity that he drove straight at his England team-mate. But even with Paul Pogba introduced from the bench as well, it was all a bit haphazard from the hosts and never looked like bringing greater reward.\nBenitez bounce\nAfter his appointment as manager triggered so much controversy amongst the Goodison Park faithful, Rafael Benitez has quietly gone about constructing a very impressive team.\nThe flakiness of James Rodriguez has been replaced by a durability that will not be swept aside quite so easily.\nEven without the injured Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, the Toffeemen were an effective unit, did not panic when United had the early momentum and took their time to grow into the game.\nAnd, given United have not kept a clean sheet at Old Trafford in the Premier League since March, they must have known opportunities would come their way.\nGray in particular was outstanding, although it could be argued more streetwise players than Fred and Wan-Bissaka would have prevented him getting out of the situation from where the goal came, either through fair means or foul.\nAnd while Mina was certainly offside, Tom Davies had enough clear space in front of him to go for goal himself as Everton came close to a win.\nManchester United's next Premier League game is at Leicester on Saturday, 16 October (15:00 BST). Everton are next in action against West Ham on Sunday, 17 October (14:00).\nReaction from Old Trafford and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nVisit the Manchester United page\nVisit the Everton page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Salah's run and pass was sheer perfection and his attacking partner gratefully accepted the invitation to finish in style.\nAnd after the excellent Foden drew City level, Salah scored a goal that will live long in the memory as he twisted and turned in between a host of City defenders before lashing an unstoppable finish past Ederson.\nIt was a goal worthy of winning any match, but in reality Liverpool could not complain at only getting a point as they struggled to exert their authority.\nSalah's masterclass, however, showed once again that he truly belongs among the game's elite.\nFoden shows his class for City\nFoden's importance for City was also emphasised as he gave Milner a nightmare for the 78 minutes the Liverpool veteran was on the pitch, and scored a crucial equaliser just as The Kop sensed their side had finally established supremacy.\nMilner, in at right-back with Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, simply could not cope with Foden, escaping with a foul on the edge of the area that was not given then being booked for hauling the youngster down in desperate fashion.\nCity were clearly determined to probe the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence where Milner was not actually receiving too much assistance, and it was no surprise that Foden found himself in space to give Allison no chance with a fine finish to level.\nThis was a good response from City to their midweek Champions League loss to Paris St-Germain, although once against questions will be raised about the lack of a recognised striker when a host of first-half chances were not taken.\nCity's play was measured and, with Ruben Dias and Aymeric Laporte solid at the back, it took those two moments of rare skill by Salah to unlock them.\nIt would have been harsh on City had they not got at least a point and Guardiola's joy was obvious when De Bruyne got the leveller, albeit he was running hot with fury at the time after referee Paul Tierney decided against giving that second yellow card to Milner - earning one himself as his vociferous protests continued after Salah had restored Liverpool's lead.\nCity have performed impressively against the two teams widely regard as their closest Premier League title rivals in the last eight days, winning at Chelsea then coming away with a point at Anfield.\nGuardiola will regard four points as a reasonable return and will be highly satisfied that his team could have had the maximum, even pressing for a winner in the closing moments.\nThe most decisive contribution in this frantic finale, however, came from Rodri as he somehow blocked Fabinho in a packed goalmouth when he looked certain to score the match-winner.\nHe made a crucial intervention and Guardiola was all smiles again at the final whistle.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We have to find the balance between the defensive and attacking part of the game.\n\"All the players did well, we have talented players and when they are confident, they are unstoppable.\"\nSpurs had numerous opportunities to put the game to bed but failed to convert, the most notable being an Emiliano Martinez save to deny Kane his first league goal of the season.\nThe England striker has now failed to score in his last six Premier League appearances, which is his longest scoreless streak in the competition since failing to net in his first six games of the 2015-16 campaign.\nThe win moves Nuno's side up to eighth on 12 points, two places and points better off than Villa.\n\"We needed a win but a well-deserved win,\" he added. \"We did a good match against tough opponents. Important for us, the boys and the fans. We reacted well after conceding and [were] positive in a lot of ways.\n\"The boys did well. Villa are a very good team with the press so it was about taking risks. Our front three were always in the middle. They played well.\"\nNuno also thanked the home fans for their support throughout the game, saying: \"The fans, the support, what they give us today is huge. It is really important and we are very thankful.\"\nBest action and reaction from Sunday's Premier League action\nVisit the Tottenham page\nVisit the Aston Villa page\nTottenham show ability and resolve to claim big win\nTottenham badly needed this result, and possibly the process by which they achieved it even more.\nAll three of the wins with which they began the season were achieved by a 1-0 scoreline. At no point this league campaign had they overcome a setback to pick up points.\nThey can now tick that significant psychological milestone off the list.\nThey deserved it too, settling into the game after an opening 15 minutes in which both sides repeatedly gave the ball away to take control. They fashioned more chances and could have been out of sight long before Watkins sent a wave of panic around the stadium with just over 20 minutes left, courtesy of a first goal of the season from Targett's low cross.\nThe wounds from last Sunday's humiliation at the Emirates will still take time to heal, but performances and results like this against a fine Villa side will go a long way to silencing the growing number of critics looking to question Nuno's suitability for the manager's job and the application of some of his players.\nVilla are no mugs. They demonstrated that in last weekend's victory at Manchester United. But they can have no complaints about this loss.\nAt no point did they really have a grip on the game and in losing parity so soon after they battled back to earn it they also relinquished the opportunity to properly test the nerves of a still fragile home side.\n\"It feels like it got away from us,\" said Villa boss Dean Smith. \"I didn't think there was too much between the teams.\n\"The difference was that they had the outstanding player on the pitch, which was Son. He was outstanding.\n\"We started both halves well. There was a 10-minute spell in the first half where we looked a bit stressed, but we covered that. Second half we looked better and stretched play a lot quicker and got our reward.\n\"We huffed and puffed but there wasn't much in the game. We had some good moments in the penalty box without them turning into really good chances.

Wolves were unhappy with Joelinton's challenge on goalkeeper Sa in the build-up to the goal, but the home side's appeals were quickly dismissed by the video assistant referee.\nSaint-Maximin - who endured a frustrating afternoon at Molineux - went closest for the visitors in a second-half of few clear-cut chances, but Hwang struck again after more fine work from the tireless Jimenez to clinch the points for Wolves.\nIn a week which has seen Newcastle embroiled in legal proceedings with the Premier League regarding last summer's collapsed takeover of the club, Magpies fans could be forgiven for asking where their first win of the season is going to come from.\nInjured striker Callum Wilson cannot return quickly enough - Newcastle have claimed just two victories in their 17 Premier League games without the 29-year-old.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

A tough start had seen them lose to Liverpool and Manchester City but of more concern were recent losses to Watford and Everton in which they conceded five goals and scored just one.\nWhile the struggles to score were evident again against Burnley, they did at least look more solid in defence as they picked up a first clean sheet of the season.\nThis was Sean Dyche's 400th game in charge of Burnley but will not be one that will live long in his memory as his side were unable to mark the occasion with a win.\nThe Clarets have largely played well this season with their problem being holding on to leads once they get their noses in front but on this occasion their finishing largely deserted them as they failed to make the most of several promising positions they got themselves in.\nUltimately, there were positives that both sides can take from the game but with seven games of the season gone they will be desperate to pick up that elusive victory as soon as possible.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Of course as coaches we want to win but in terms of performance it was as good as I can remember.\"\nThe Gunners' best first-half opportunity fell to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who nodded against the outside of the post from Bukayo Saka's looping cross.\nEmile Smith Rowe shot straight at Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez in a rare second-half attack, but an Arsenal winner would have been harsh on the hosts.\nThe point leaves Brighton in fifth place, level on 14 points with Everton, Manchester United and Liverpool - who face Manchester City on Sunday.\n\"It's a foundation,\" Potter said. \"Fourteen points from seven games is good for us but we have to keep moving.\n\"This performance gives us a lot of hope and belief going forward.\"\nRelive Saturday's Premier League action\nVisit the Brighton page\nVisit the Arsenal page\nAlbion rue missed opportunities\nArsenal went into this game on a high after last weekend's morale-boosting victory over north London rivals Tottenham, but they were second best for long periods as Brighton took the game to their visitors.\nThe Seagulls registered 21 attempts at Aaron Ramsdale's goal but only two of those efforts forced the 23-year-old goalkeeper into action.\nBurn will be bitterly disappointed not to have broken the deadlock after connecting well with Lewis Dunk's delivery from an unmarked position deep inside the penalty area.\nTrossard dragged a shot wide from the corner of the box early on in the match, before Maupay - who had scored the winner in his previous two starts against the Gunners - blazed over from close range.\nJakub Moder twice fired wide from the edge of the area as Brighton made a lively start to the second period, but there was no way through for Potter's side.\nThere were positives for the Albion boss, though. Former Barcelona wing-back Marc Cucurella caused Arsenal all sorts of problems in the first half in particular, while Adam Lallana, Gross and Moder linked up well in midfield.\nBy contrast, Martin Odegaard - one of Arsenal's standout performers in recent wins over Burnley and Spurs - was largely anonymous.\nBoth teams had penalty appeals turned down in the closing stages. Smith Rowe was adjudged to have fallen too easily under Duffy's challenge, before Gabriel evaded punishment for a tug-back on the Albion defender.\nBrighton's tally of eight clean sheets in Premier League home matches this calendar year is exceeded only by Manchester City and Chelsea, who each have nine.\nArsenal, meanwhile, have scored just five goals in their opening seven league games, their fewest at this stage of a season since 1986-87.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It was more than the man himself managed. Left on the bench after his injury-time winner against Villarreal on Wednesday, Ronaldo came on in the 57th minute but had minimal impact either before or after the equaliser.\nEverton thought they had a winner four minutes from time but VAR intervened to rule Yerry Mina's tap-in out for offside.\nThe result completes a decidedly unimpressive run of home results for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team, who lost against Aston Villa seven days ago after being dumped out of the EFL Cup by West Ham.\nUnconvincing Man Utd\nEven at half-time, with United top of the 'in-play' table, there remained so many questions to be asked of Solskjaer and his team.\nMore should be known in the weeks following the upcoming international break.\nHome fixtures with Liverpool and Manchester City, plus tricky trips to Leicester and Tottenham will, at the very least, give an indication about United's ability to challenge for the title deep into the season, something they looked like doing last term, only to fade badly in January just as Pep Guardiola's squad were surging clear.\nFor the opening 10 minutes against Everton, they retained the speed and fluidity so often lacking. And then it drifted away.\nBy the time Martial broke the deadlock, it was the visitors who were carrying the greater goal threat. Salomon Rondon and Abdoulaye Doucoure had shots blocked and David de Gea produced a superb one-handed save to deny the excellent Gray.\nThat opportunity was created when what should have been a straightforward pass to Edinson Cavani from Fernandes went straight to Lucas Digne.\nCavani did bring a good save out of Jordan Pickford with a downward header when the game was still goalless and Jadon Sancho might have done better with a late opportunity that he drove straight at his England team-mate. But even with Paul Pogba introduced from the bench as well, it was all a bit haphazard from the hosts and never looked like bringing greater reward.\nBenitez bounce\nAfter his appointment as manager triggered so much controversy amongst the Goodison Park faithful, Rafael Benitez has quietly gone about constructing a very impressive team.\nThe flakiness of James Rodriguez has been replaced by a durability that will not be swept aside quite so easily.\nEven without the injured Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, the Toffeemen were an effective unit, did not panic when United had the early momentum and took their time to grow into the game.\nAnd, given United have not kept a clean sheet at Old Trafford in the Premier League since March, they must have known opportunities would come their way.\nGray in particular was outstanding, although it could be argued more streetwise players than Fred and Wan-Bissaka would have prevented him getting out of the situation from where the goal came, either through fair means or foul.\nAnd while Mina was certainly offside, Tom Davies had enough clear space in front of him to go for goal himself as Everton came close to a win.\nManchester United's next Premier League game is at Leicester on Saturday, 16 October (15:00 BST). Everton are next in action against West Ham on Sunday, 17 October (14:00).\nReaction from Old Trafford and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nVisit the Manchester United page\nVisit the Everton page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We have to find the balance between the defensive and attacking part of the game.\n\"All the players did well, we have talented players and when they are confident, they are unstoppable.\"\nSpurs had numerous opportunities to put the game to bed but failed to convert, the most notable being an Emiliano Martinez save to deny Kane his first league goal of the season.\nThe England striker has now failed to score in his last six Premier League appearances, which is his longest scoreless streak in the competition since failing to net in his first six games of the 2015-16 campaign.\nThe win moves Nuno's side up to eighth on 12 points, two places and points better off than Villa.\n\"We needed a win but a well-deserved win,\" he added. \"We did a good match against tough opponents. Important for us, the boys and the fans. We reacted well after conceding and [were] positive in a lot of ways.\n\"The boys did well. Villa are a very good team with the press so it was about taking risks. Our front three were always in the middle. They played well.\"\nNuno also thanked the home fans for their support throughout the game, saying: \"The fans, the support, what they give us today is huge. It is really important and we are very thankful.\"\nBest action and reaction from Sunday's Premier League action\nVisit the Tottenham page\nVisit the Aston Villa page\nTottenham show ability and resolve to claim big win\nTottenham badly needed this result, and possibly the process by which they achieved it even more.\nAll three of the wins with which they began the season were achieved by a 1-0 scoreline. At no point this league campaign had they overcome a setback to pick up points.\nThey can now tick that significant psychological milestone off the list.\nThey deserved it too, settling into the game after an opening 15 minutes in which both sides repeatedly gave the ball away to take control. They fashioned more chances and could have been out of sight long before Watkins sent a wave of panic around the stadium with just over 20 minutes left, courtesy of a first goal of the season from Targett's low cross.\nThe wounds from last Sunday's humiliation at the Emirates will still take time to heal, but performances and results like this against a fine Villa side will go a long way to silencing the growing number of critics looking to question Nuno's suitability for the manager's job and the application of some of his players.\nVilla are no mugs. They demonstrated that in last weekend's victory at Manchester United. But they can have no complaints about this loss.\nAt no point did they really have a grip on the game and in losing parity so soon after they battled back to earn it they also relinquished the opportunity to properly test the nerves of a still fragile home side.\n\"It feels like it got away from us,\" said Villa boss Dean Smith. \"I didn't think there was too much between the teams.\n\"The difference was that they had the outstanding player on the pitch, which was Son. He was outstanding.\n\"We started both halves well. There was a 10-minute spell in the first half where we looked a bit stressed, but we covered that. Second half we looked better and stretched play a lot quicker and got our reward.\n\"We huffed and puffed but there wasn't much in the game. We had some good moments in the penalty box without them turning into really good chances.

Of course as coaches we want to win but in terms of performance it was as good as I can remember.\"\nThe Gunners' best first-half opportunity fell to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who nodded against the outside of the post from Bukayo Saka's looping cross.\nEmile Smith Rowe shot straight at Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez in a rare second-half attack, but an Arsenal winner would have been harsh on the hosts.\nThe point leaves Brighton in fifth place, level on 14 points with Everton, Manchester United and Liverpool - who face Manchester City on Sunday.\n\"It's a foundation,\" Potter said. \"Fourteen points from seven games is good for us but we have to keep moving.\n\"This performance gives us a lot of hope and belief going forward.\"\nRelive Saturday's Premier League action\nVisit the Brighton page\nVisit the Arsenal page\nAlbion rue missed opportunities\nArsenal went into this game on a high after last weekend's morale-boosting victory over north London rivals Tottenham, but they were second best for long periods as Brighton took the game to their visitors.\nThe Seagulls registered 21 attempts at Aaron Ramsdale's goal but only two of those efforts forced the 23-year-old goalkeeper into action.\nBurn will be bitterly disappointed not to have broken the deadlock after connecting well with Lewis Dunk's delivery from an unmarked position deep inside the penalty area.\nTrossard dragged a shot wide from the corner of the box early on in the match, before Maupay - who had scored the winner in his previous two starts against the Gunners - blazed over from close range.\nJakub Moder twice fired wide from the edge of the area as Brighton made a lively start to the second period, but there was no way through for Potter's side.\nThere were positives for the Albion boss, though. Former Barcelona wing-back Marc Cucurella caused Arsenal all sorts of problems in the first half in particular, while Adam Lallana, Gross and Moder linked up well in midfield.\nBy contrast, Martin Odegaard - one of Arsenal's standout performers in recent wins over Burnley and Spurs - was largely anonymous.\nBoth teams had penalty appeals turned down in the closing stages. Smith Rowe was adjudged to have fallen too easily under Duffy's challenge, before Gabriel evaded punishment for a tug-back on the Albion defender.\nBrighton's tally of eight clean sheets in Premier League home matches this calendar year is exceeded only by Manchester City and Chelsea, who each have nine.\nArsenal, meanwhile, have scored just five goals in their opening seven league games, their fewest at this stage of a season since 1986-87.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He opted for Vardy, who took a touch before side-footing in Leicester's second.\nThe 34-year-old is now the Premier League's leading goalscorer with six goals in seven games this season. Since turning 30, he has scored 90 goals in the competition.\nPalace impressed early in the second half and went close through Odsonne Edouard, who crashed his effort against the crossbar after cutting inside Caglar Soyuncu and Jannik Vestergaard.\nThey finally find a breakthrough when, after replacing Jordan Ayew early in the second half, 19-year-old Olise saw his first effort from Tyrick Mitchell's cross blocked, before he brilliantly volleyed the rebound past Schmeichel.\nAged 19 years and 295 days, Olise is the first teenager to score for Palace in the Premier League since Clinton Morrison in May 1998.\nThat goal really lifted the home crowd and it seemed like one-way traffic. Vieira got his substitutions spot on and Selhurst Park was sent into raptures when Schlupp headed in the equaliser against his former side.\nHis goal after 48 seconds is the second-quickest by a substitute in the Premier League this season, after team-mate Edouard took just 29 seconds to score against Tottenham.\nSchlupp came close to heading in a second three minutes from time, but his effort glanced just wide of the far post as the sides were forced to settle for a point.\nReaction from Selhurst Park and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nVisit the Crystal Palace page\nVisit the Leicester page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

I feel sorry for them today.\n\"I liked the personality and character we showed. In the second half, we had desire to compete and won the ball quite high.\n\"This is the part of the game we wanted to improve, being aggressive. lt's part of the DNA of Crystal Palace.\"\nArsenal were understandably aggrieved when James McArthur was only booked late in the first half for a wild kick at Bukayo Saka, who went off injured at half-time.\n\"It's a clear red card,\" said Gunners boss Mikel Arteta. \"He had no intention of playing the ball.

They might still wonder.\nPalace have only lost once in six games now and even though they lost two points late on, they impressed and did not miss Wilfried Zaha, who was out through illness.\nLacazette's late equaliser could be a huge boost for Arsenal's confidence, though, as it stretched their unbeaten run to six games in a match they started so well.\nAubameyang volleyed in a lovely opener from a tight angle but they were then architects of their own downfall.\nBoth Palace goals came from Arsenal midfielders losing the ball, first Partey and then Sambi Lokonga - the half-time replacement for the injured Saka.\nBut that is to take nothing away from Palace, who forced those errors and deserved their lead.\nVieira may rue his decision to replace goalscorer Edouard with defender James Tomkins - who had not played a league game this season - eight minutes from time.\nThey were holding on at the end and the hosts showed good character to find a way through. They may have thought Tierney's shot off the bar was their last chance but they kept the pressure on and Lacazette broke Palace hearts.\nHe did so with his first league goal since 11 April.\n\"He fights for every ball and he transmitted some belief and energy to the crowd when he came on,\" said Arteta.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Honestly, it was emotional and tough.\"\nHe added: \"Since the new manager came in we have improved. We were on the end of some bad results but there's loads to improve on.\"\nRomain Saiss started the comeback when he scored from inside the six-yard area before Coady bundled in the equaliser soon after Max Kilman had headed against the bar.\nRuben Neves sparked jubilant scenes in the away end when his free-kick took a deflection on its way past Emiliano Martinez to secure a win that had looked improbable for long spells in the game.\nWolves are only the third team in Premier League history to score three goals from the 80th minute onwards to overturn a 2-0 deficit and win 3-2, after Reading in 2013 and Wigan in 2010.\nReaction from Aston Villa v Wolves, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Villa page\nGo to the Wolves page\nVilla boss Dean Smith will be livid with some of his side's defending in the closing stages.\nThere was little sign of the drama to follow when Ings headed the home side ahead after McGinn beat Saiss to send in a cross.\nThe Scotland midfielder added the second with a deflected shot from long range after Ollie Watkins' attempt had been blocked.\nWolves' recovery began when Saiss struck from substitute Daniel Podence's cross, but an away win still looked a tall order at that stage.\nThere were five minutes of normal time left when Coady made it 2-2 after a scramble inside the box.\nNeves' last-gasp winner left Villa to reflect on a first league home defeat since 9 May - and earned Bruno Lage the most dramatic win of his Wolves reign so far.\nWolves put faltering start behind them\nAfter losing their first three league games, Wolves are now eighth in the table after eight games, and their faltering start to life under Lage - who replaced Nuno Espirito Santo this summer - is a distant memory.\nSuddenly they are one of the form teams as they equalled the club record of three consecutive Premier League away wins, set last June, when the third victory was also at Villa Park.\nWhile Villa will be upset with the way they threw this game away, Wolves showed great character to keep fighting to the end.\nTheir fourth win of the season was secured after in-form Raul Jimenez started on the bench.\nJimenez, who had scored one goal and assisted another two in the previous two league games, came off the bench in the 88th minute with the score 2-2.\nAfter Jacob Ramsey had fouled Adama Traore just outside the box deep in stoppage time, Jimenez stood over the free-kick before moving away for Neves to seal the victory.\nVilla left to pick up the pieces\nVilla have impressed this season with wins over Newcastle and Everton - as well as a first victory in 12 years at Manchester United.\nAfter going into the international break on the back of a 2-1 defeat at Tottenham, they now have to pick up the pieces from a damaging derby defeat.\nSmith opted to start with keeper Martinez and midfielder Douglas Luiz - despite the fact they played for Argentina and Brazil respectively in the early hours of Friday morning UK time.\nBoth had rushed back to Birmingham after being involved in World Cup qualifiers.\nMartinez did make one fine save to keep out Traore when the game was goalless, while Luiz went close in the first half with a long-range attempt.\nBut neither could save their side from slipping to defeat, and Villa must regroup before their next match, away at Arsenal on Friday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

They played with more belief and we focused too much on defending.\n\"I was happy with the first 65-70 minutes and we should have scored more. But respect to Brentford.\"\nReaction to Brentford v Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Brentford news page\nGo to the Chelsea news page\nChilwell takes his chance as Chelsea remain firm\nThe early part of the season saw 24-year-old Chilwell largely limited to a place on the Chelsea bench, with Marcos Alonso's revival earning him the left-wing-back spot in Tuchel's Premier League line-up.\nTuchel insisted it was \"no great drama\" and it always seemed likely a player of Chilwell's calibre would play his part over the long season.\nChilwell spoke afterwards about the importance of \"taking your chance\". Recent form suggests he has done exactly that - scoring in the 3-1 win over Southampton before the international break, then finding the net again in England's 5-0 victory in Andorra last Saturday.\nPreferred once again to Alonso against Brentford, the \u00a350m signing from Leicester continued his rich vein of scoring form with a confident and crisp left-foot strike.\nNot only did he score the winner but he was part of a defensive unit which remained firm under pressure despite lacking key players.\nVeteran centre-back Thiago Silva was missing after playing for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier against Uruguay about 36 hours previously, while Germany international Antonio Rudiger was also out injured.\nThat saw 22-year-old Malang Sarr given a league debut in a back three also containing Chalobah, another inexperienced youngster, and Andreas Christensen.\n\"We have Eddy [Mendy] to thank, he was amazing,\" Chilwell said. \"He made superb saves and got us the three points in the end.\n\"I'm happy to get on the scoresheet and happy to score the only goal of the game. But we showed our defensive steel.\"\n'There should have only been one winner' - Frank\nBrentford have impressed fans and pundits alike since winning promotion to the Premier League and came away from this match with lots of credit despite the defeat.\nChilwell's strike was reward for a first half where Chelsea dominated without creating many clear-cut opportunities.\nBrentford lacked aggression on the front foot and struggled to impose themselves in the Chelsea third.\nBut the Bees considerably improved in the final half an hour and will count themselves unfortunate not to earn at least a point.\nA higher intensity allowed the hosts to pose more questions of the makeshift Chelsea defence, with tactical tweaks and substitutions from boss Thomas Frank helping his side press the European champions back.\nThe statistics laid bare their dominance in the final stages.\nThe Bees had 15 shots in the second half - 12 of which came in the final 11 minutes - and spent almost 40% of the last 15 minutes inside Chelsea's third.\nWhile it did not produce an equaliser, it earned Frank's side a proud ovation from the home fans at the final whistle and keeps them in seventh place after an encouraging start to their debut season in the Premier League.\n\"If you look over the 90 minutes, there can only be one winner - and that's us,\" said Frank.\n\"We kept the number one side and European champions to five shots.

But they were well short of the form that has carried them into the upper reaches of the table before the international break.\nNorwich stumble in front of goal\nHaving picked up the first point of their Premier League campaign a fortnight ago at Burnley, Norwich started well, stretching Brighton's defence and forcing Robert Sanchez into an early save from Sargent's deflected shot.\nBrighton picked up momentum and asserted themselves on the hosts. Neal Maupay, with four goals in his past seven games, was a constant nuisance to the Norwich defence, appealing in vain for a penalty after going down under the challenge of goalkeeper Tim Krul.\nIf Krul was judged not to get enough of a touch on Maupay, he certainly did of Leandro Trossard's volley shortly after, brilliantly tipping the goal-bound shot on to the bar.\nBrighton created Norwich's best chance of the half as Sanchez rushed out of goal, missed his kick and presented Sargent with an open goal. However the American's attempt from 20 yards and an angle lacked power, allowing Shane Duffy to cover round and hoof clear.\nSargent's sloppy touch allowed another prime chance to go to waste after the break, as his lack of conviction and accuracy gave Dan Burn room to slide in and block his way to goal.\nSargent was withdrawn on 75 minutes by manager Daniel Farke as Norwich came into the ascendancy in the second half and his replacement Milot Rashica sprung Teemu Pukki with an exquisite touch.\nHowever the Finn, who had clipped a previous chance wide, could not out-run the covering Burn, who made another excellent tackle.\nMaupay came close to wrecking Norwich's afternoon entirely as he turned Solly March's cross over the top in the final five minutes.\nBrighton will have to improve with both Manchester City and Liverpool to play before the end of the month but the return of energetic wideman Tariq Lamptey off the bench to make his first Premier League appearance in 10 months following a series of hamstring injuries was one positive to take back to the south coast.\nWhile a second successive point after six straight defeats is a sign of improvement for Norwich, their performance did little to foster faith they can survive in the top flight.\nThey have scored just twice in the league this season with both strikes coming from Pukki. With Todd Cantwell sidelined and Emi Buendia having left for Aston Villa, he looks woefully short of quality company to share the goal-scoring burden.\nFollow live text commentary of Norwich City v Brighton & Hove Albion, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Norwich page\nGo to the Brighton page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

This is the favourite moment of my career so far, hopefully there are many moments and goals more to come.\"\nOf the goal, he added: \"It was a great run from Nathan Redmond, he said before the game the goals will come, just to keep making runs. He put the ball on a plate for me and I was able to finish.\"\nThe Saints had been the better side and looked far more likely to break the deadlock throughout, but also suffered from a familiar lack of cutting edge in front of goal.\nPrior to the goal, their best chances came from corners, with Broja glancing one header wide and flicking on a second that Mohamed Elyounoussi was inches from converting at the back post.\nLeeds, who were missing six senior players, including Patrick Bamford, Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha, only had two shots.\nJack Harrison's drive - deflected over by Mohammed Salisu - was the closest they came but Daniel James also put a good chance past the post after he had nipped in to claim the ball off Salisu in the box.\nThe win takes Southampton to seven points and 15th place, a point and two league positions better off than Leeds.\n\"We've been searching for this first win and it is amazing to get it here at home in front of the fans,\" added Broja.\n\"Hopefully we can push on and the wins will keep coming.\"\nBest action and reaction from Southampton v Leeds United, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Southampton page\nGo to the Leeds page\nSaints finally get their march under way\nThis was not a game for the neutrals.\nBut then Saints boss Hasenhuttl had suggested as much in his pre-match press conference\n, external\nin which he stated the game would \"not be a five course dinner\".\nThe absence of star performers on both sides did not help, with the home side missing the suspended James Ward-Prowse for the first time in the league since December 2018 and Leeds gutted by injury and the need to rest Raphinha following his exploits for Brazil on Friday.\nBut Southampton had all the necessary attributes on their side - discipline, cohesion, determination and, for the one moment that mattered, composure.\nDanny Ings' sale in the summer stripped them of the one man that could be relied upon for a decent finish and they have noticeably struggled without him in the early stages of this season.\nHowever in Broja they have a raw talent, borrowed from Chelsea, who could well grow into the man they need, at least for this campaign.\nHis finish was a fine one, stroked high past the diving Illan Meslier to end a move that began as a Leeds attack broke down, with Nathan Redmond released to provide a low cross invitingly into the striker's feet.\nHaving out-shot Leeds 19-3, the home side would have been kicking themselves had they not taken all three points, especially with Leeds so painfully out of sorts.\n\"It is important to get the first win, the most important one of the season,\" Hasenhuttl told Sky Sports. \"It took a bit longer this season. We fully deserved this win.\n\"We were aggressive and showed some good solutions. It was a demanding game for everybody but the lads did a good job. We had a short two days to prepare for the game and the gameplan worked well I thought.\"\nLeeds, meanwhile, were not the bold, brave side Marcelo Bielsa brought into the Premier League last season, but a pale imitation in dire need of regularly fit players and a spark to ignite their campaign.\nBielsa admitted that the best team had won and refused to blame his side's performance on the absence of key players.\n\"I concede that we didn't play well at any moment in the game,\" he told BBC Sport. \"The result is fair and it is justified in the first half. In the second half it was more even but we didn't play well in any moment.\n\"It is not common to not be able to count on six players but the team that started the game was formed of players that usually play.\n\"Despite that it was difficult for us to get into the game in the first half, so I don't link the absence of the players to the result of the game.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Although City dominated possession and created plenty of chances, they failed to extend their advantage, giving the visitors hope.\nBurnley gave them a few scares before De Bruyne added a second goal with 20 minutes to go, curling his shot home when the ball broke to him inside the box.\nSterling made only his third league start of the season - having been recalled at the end of a week where he spoke publicly about being open to a move abroad if he failed to get more game time at City.\nHe struggled to make an impact in the first half while playing as the central attacker in City's front three, managing only 11 touches - by far the lowest of any of their outfield players - and only one shot, which was blocked.\nSterling was far more involved when he switched to the left flank after the break but was unable to add to his tally of one league goal in 2021-22 and it was down to De Bruyne to finish the game off.\nThe win keeps City two points behind leaders Chelsea, who won at Brentford. Burnley remain in the bottom three, still without a league win this season.\nReaction from Manchester City v Burnley, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Man City page\nGo to the Burnley page\nDe Bruyne goal ensures Man City avoid nervy finale\nBurnley could not end their winless run, which at 11 games is the longest in England's top four divisions, but they still gave City plenty to think about.\nMaxwel Cornet, who saw his shot brilliantly saved by Zack Steffen after running clear, went close to equalising in the first half, as did Josh Brownhill, who fizzed his shot inches wide.\nCity were misfiring too, with Riyad Mahrez another of their players failing to make the most of his recall - the closest he came with his four efforts at goal was when he blasted another Silva cut-back against the bar.\nIt could have made for a nervous finale for City's fans, if not for De Bruyne's cool finish after Burnley failed to clear their lines.\nIt meant the home supporters were able to relax and celebrate the news of Leicester's late goals in their win over City's neighbours United - something they did extremely loudly.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Watford 0-5 Liverpool: Roberto Firmino hat-trick and Mohamed Salah scores another stunner\nRoberto Firmino scored a hat-trick as rampant Liverpool condemned Claudio Ranieri to a miserable start to life as Watford manager in a one-sided game at Vicarage Road.\nThe home side had no answer to Liverpool's fluid attacking play.\nSadio Mane became the third African player to score 100 Premier League goals before Roberto Firmino struck either side of the break and Mohamed Salah finished a brilliant individual goal with a smart shot beyond Ben Foster.\nSalah's goal takes him level with former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba as the highest-scoring African player in Premier League history with 104 goals.\nFirmino completed the scoring in the final minute for his first hat-trick since December 2018.\nSalah is best player in world - Klopp\nHas Ranieri walked into a nightmare at Watford?\nThe result means Liverpool have scored three goals or more in all six away games in all competitions so far this season, something no other English top-flight side has ever managed. It also extended their unbeaten start to the season and keeps them second in the Premier League table.\nIt could easily have been more but a combination of bad luck and - from Salah - a terrible mis-control cost them further opportunities.\nWatford did not manage a corner until the 78th minute. That it was greeted with huge cheers and a standing ovation just about summed up Ranieri's day.\nBest action and reaction from Watford v Liverpool, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nSalah equals Premier League goals record for Africa\nGo to the Watford page\nGo to the Liverpool page\nRanieri's task laid bare\nWatford is Ranieri's 22nd different job in his long and varied coaching career. Rarely can he have endured a start as sobering as this.\nIt was Watford's heaviest Premier League defeat since their eight-goal hammering by Manchester City in September 2019 and their biggest at home since the same opponents scored six here two years before that. There was certainly nothing to trigger a celebration before his 70th birthday on Thursday.\nThe dimensions of Vicarage Road mean the edge of the managers' technical areas are about as close as it is possible to get to the side of the pitch.\nIt meant that Ranieri was almost on top of the action as the size of his task was laid bare.\nA long pre-match chat with Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp was about as good as it got for the Italian.\nThe hosts simply did not get near enough to their talented opponents. Salah was given far too much space by Danny Rose even before he created the opener. Firmino was allowed to drop into the space between Watford's defence and midfield without anyone tracking his movements and Liverpool stroked the ball about at will further back, with no press to hurry them up.\nWith a paltry 17% possession, no shots, no corners and, obviously, no goals, the first half was a non-event for Ranieri and his new team. And if he hoped the introduction of Tom Cleverley into midfield for the second period would improve matters, he was sadly mistaken as Liverpool scored twice within 10 minutes of the restart.\nWatford did rally towards the end, with Ismaila Sarr striking a post, although by then any chance of turning the game into a contest was long gone.\nIf there was a consolation for Ranieri, it is that there should be no dissenters if he wants to make significant changes during his first full week working with his new team.\nHowever, with a fixture list that includes Everton, Arsenal, Chelsea and both Manchester clubs among Watford's next seven opponents, Ranieri needs a plan if his club's famously trigger-happy owners are not to be considering whether to axe yet another manager.\nRampant Reds show their quality\nThis was Liverpool's biggest win since the 7-0 hammering of Crystal Palace last December, which was also the last time Firmino, Salah and Mane all scored in a top-flight game.\nIn joining Egypt's Salah and Ivorian Didier Drogba as African goalscoring centurions, Senegalese Mane is part of a pretty exclusive Premier League club.\nSalah's curling pass with the outside of his left foot could not have been any more inviting and Mane showed superb composure to meet the ball with perfect timing and give Foster no chance.\nFirmino's three were welcome - but they were also all pretty straightforward. The first two were tap-ins thanks to James Milner's low cross into the six-yard area and the ball running loose from a desperate Ben Foster save after Craig Cathcart had turned the ball towards his own goal.\nThere was a bit more to the Brazilian's third as he ran forward with intelligence, something no defender countered, after Neco Williams had crossed.\nBut there was no doubting Salah's was the goal of the game.\nSurrounded by three players on the edge of the Watford box, through a combination of speed, dexterity and brilliant close control, Salah got rid of them all before finding the target with his usual unerring accuracy.\nIt means he has now scored in eight successive matches in all competitions and in nine out of 10 in total, underlining why Liverpool are so keen for him to sign an extension to his current contract, which has less than two years to run.\nWatford are next in action against Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday, 23 October (15:00 BST). Liverpool are at Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00). Their next Premier League game is at Manchester United on Sunday, 24 October (16:30).\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

I feel sorry for them today.\n\"I liked the personality and character we showed. In the second half, we had desire to compete and won the ball quite high.\n\"This is the part of the game we wanted to improve, being aggressive. lt's part of the DNA of Crystal Palace.\"\nArsenal were understandably aggrieved when James McArthur was only booked late in the first half for a wild kick at Bukayo Saka, who went off injured at half-time.\n\"It's a clear red card,\" said Gunners boss Mikel Arteta. \"He had no intention of playing the ball. I don't know how, with VAR, he hasn't been sent off.\"\nArsenal move up to 12th with a sixth game unbeaten, while Palace remain 14th after a third draw in a row.\nFollow reaction to Arsenal v Crystal Palace\nEverything you need to know about the Gunners, all in one place\nGo to our Palace topic page\nVieira so close to famous return\nVieira - a three-time Premier League title winner with Arsenal, and part of the 'Invincibles' who went through the 2003-04 top-flight campaign unbeaten - returned to face his old team for the first time as a manager.\nHe received a great reception from the Gunners faithful before kick-off.\n\"I don't want to say I expected it but when you spend nine years at a club like that and I was part of a generation who did well for the club, it meant a lot to me,\" said the Frenchman.\nFor long periods, home fans may have been wondering if they have the right former Gunners captain in charge in Arteta. They might still wonder.\nPalace have only lost once in six games now and even though they lost two points late on, they impressed and did not miss Wilfried Zaha, who was out through illness.\nLacazette's late equaliser could be a huge boost for Arsenal's confidence, though, as it stretched their unbeaten run to six games in a match they started so well.\nAubameyang volleyed in a lovely opener from a tight angle but they were then architects of their own downfall.\nBoth Palace goals came from Arsenal midfielders losing the ball, first Partey and then Sambi Lokonga - the half-time replacement for the injured Saka.\nBut that is to take nothing away from Palace, who forced those errors and deserved their lead.\nVieira may rue his decision to replace goalscorer Edouard with defender James Tomkins - who had not played a league game this season - eight minutes from time.\nThey were holding on at the end and the hosts showed good character to find a way through. They may have thought Tierney's shot off the bar was their last chance but they kept the pressure on and Lacazette broke Palace hearts.\nHe did so with his first league goal since 11 April.\n\"He fights for every ball and he transmitted some belief and energy to the crowd when he came on,\" said Arteta.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Ever since I have walked into this club, it is difficult. I knew how difficult it was going to be with the frustrations.\n\"I will carry on as best I can until I hear otherwise. The owners have conducted themselves respectfully since they came in. As long as I don't hear otherwise, I will go into work tomorrow.\"\nWhat Newcastle need to do to stay up - analysis\nFan 'stable' after game halted because of medical emergency\nReaction from Sunday's games including Tottenham's win at Newcastle\nGo to the Newcastle page\nGo to the Spurs page\nCarnival atmosphere disappears as fans turn on Bruce\nPrior to kick-off, there was a unique atmosphere outside St James' Park and around the city.\nThere were some fans who celebrated the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover by wearing headdresses and draping themselves in Saudi flags, but the overwhelming majority answered the call to wear black and white as they celebrated a new era after Mike Ashley's 14-year reign came to an end.\nInside the stadium, the Gallowgate End was a sea of black and white as supporters waved flags and unveiled a banner quoting lyrics from Newcastle-born performer Jimmy Nail's 1995 song Big River, about the city and rebuilding hope for the future.\nIt must have been an uplifting sight for Al-Rumayyan, who was attending his first game in his capacity as the governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which now owns 80% of the club.\nHe broke out into a huge grin as Wilson scored early on from Javier Manquillo's cross, while Staveley hugged her husband Mehrdad Ghodoussi.\nBut the way Tottenham opened up the Newcastle defence showed how much work is needed to take the club to the top end of the Premier League, let alone into contention to win the title. The priority this season is to avoid relegation.\nAnd the result will not have given Bruce any further security about his job.\nAfter reports last week that he would be sacked, with the club then saying he would remain in charge for this game 45 minutes before his pre-match press conference on Friday, his future remains unclear.\nBut this was a demonstration of a team struggling for form, and with little chance of the game turning Newcastle's way, chants of \"We want Brucey out\" came from the Gallowgate End after 74 minutes and continued until the end, when the final whistle was met with boos.\nIt was a message that would have been heard loud and clear by the new owners.\nTottenham keep composure on dramatic day\nOn a day when the visitors might have been distracted by the atmosphere, this was a welcome boost to Spurs boss Nuno, whose side have earned successive wins after a derby defeat by Arsenal that led to many questions about the club's direction.\nTottenham's front four of Ndombele, Son, Lucas Moura and Kane were a menace to the hosts, who need to prioritise a defensive midfielder among their spending plans.\nPrior to the game being stopped and with Spurs already leading 2-1, Moura headed on to the bar, and they looked far more likely to score in the second half than their opponents before Dier's late own goal.\n\"We knew we had to ignore the noise and do our job,\" said Nuno. \"We did not start well but did an amazing job after. I'm really proud of them.\n\"I would like to score more, the boys would also, but Newcastle are a good team with good defenders.\"\nCredit must also go to Reguilon and Dier for the part they played in alerting medics to the stricken supporter and to midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, who continued after the incident, having also played when Denmark team-mate Christian Eriksen had a cardiac arrest during their Euro 2020 match against Finland in June.\nAfter a day when there were conflicting emotions and no end of drama, it put the result into perspective.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

This is the favourite moment of my career so far, hopefully there are many moments and goals more to come.\"\nOf the goal, he added: \"It was a great run from Nathan Redmond, he said before the game the goals will come, just to keep making runs. He put the ball on a plate for me and I was able to finish.\"\nThe Saints had been the better side and looked far more likely to break the deadlock throughout, but also suffered from a familiar lack of cutting edge in front of goal.\nPrior to the goal, their best chances came from corners, with Broja glancing one header wide and flicking on a second that Mohamed Elyounoussi was inches from converting at the back post.\nLeeds, who were missing six senior players, including Patrick Bamford, Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha, only had two shots.\nJack Harrison's drive - deflected over by Mohammed Salisu - was the closest they came but Daniel James also put a good chance past the post after he had nipped in to claim the ball off Salisu in the box.\nThe win takes Southampton to seven points and 15th place, a point and two league positions better off than Leeds.\n\"We've been searching for this first win and it is amazing to get it here at home in front of the fans,\" added Broja.\n\"Hopefully we can push on and the wins will keep coming.\"\nBest action and reaction from Southampton v Leeds United, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Southampton page\nGo to the Leeds page\nSaints finally get their march under way\nThis was not a game for the neutrals.\nBut then Saints boss Hasenhuttl had suggested as much in his pre-match press conference\n, external\nin which he stated the game would \"not be a five course dinner\".\nThe absence of star performers on both sides did not help, with the home side missing the suspended James Ward-Prowse for the first time in the league since December 2018 and Leeds gutted by injury and the need to rest Raphinha following his exploits for Brazil on Friday.\nBut Southampton had all the necessary attributes on their side - discipline, cohesion, determination and, for the one moment that mattered, composure.\nDanny Ings' sale in the summer stripped them of the one man that could be relied upon for a decent finish and they have noticeably struggled without him in the early stages of this season.\nHowever in Broja they have a raw talent, borrowed from Chelsea, who could well grow into the man they need, at least for this campaign.\nHis finish was a fine one, stroked high past the diving Illan Meslier to end a move that began as a Leeds attack broke down, with Nathan Redmond released to provide a low cross invitingly into the striker's feet.\nHaving out-shot Leeds 19-3, the home side would have been kicking themselves had they not taken all three points, especially with Leeds so painfully out of sorts.\n\"It is important to get the first win, the most important one of the season,\" Hasenhuttl told Sky Sports. \"It took a bit longer this season. We fully deserved this win.\n\"We were aggressive and showed some good solutions. It was a demanding game for everybody but the lads did a good job. We had a short two days to prepare for the game and the gameplan worked well I thought.\"\nLeeds, meanwhile, were not the bold, brave side Marcelo Bielsa brought into the Premier League last season, but a pale imitation in dire need of regularly fit players and a spark to ignite their campaign.\nBielsa admitted that the best team had won and refused to blame his side's performance on the absence of key players.\n\"I concede that we didn't play well at any moment in the game,\" he told BBC Sport. \"The result is fair and it is justified in the first half. In the second half it was more even but we didn't play well in any moment.\n\"It is not common to not be able to count on six players but the team that started the game was formed of players that usually play.\n\"Despite that it was difficult for us to get into the game in the first half, so I don't link the absence of the players to the result of the game.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Honestly, it was emotional and tough.\"\nHe added: \"Since the new manager came in we have improved. We were on the end of some bad results but there's loads to improve on.\"\nRomain Saiss started the comeback when he scored from inside the six-yard area before Coady bundled in the equaliser soon after Max Kilman had headed against the bar.\nRuben Neves sparked jubilant scenes in the away end when his free-kick took a deflection on its way past Emiliano Martinez to secure a win that had looked improbable for long spells in the game.\nWolves are only the third team in Premier League history to score three goals from the 80th minute onwards to overturn a 2-0 deficit and win 3-2, after Reading in 2013 and Wigan in 2010.\nReaction from Aston Villa v Wolves, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Villa page\nGo to the Wolves page\nVilla boss Dean Smith will be livid with some of his side's defending in the closing stages.\nThere was little sign of the drama to follow when Ings headed the home side ahead after McGinn beat Saiss to send in a cross.\nThe Scotland midfielder added the second with a deflected shot from long range after Ollie Watkins' attempt had been blocked.\nWolves' recovery began when Saiss struck from substitute Daniel Podence's cross, but an away win still looked a tall order at that stage.\nThere were five minutes of normal time left when Coady made it 2-2 after a scramble inside the box.\nNeves' last-gasp winner left Villa to reflect on a first league home defeat since 9 May - and earned Bruno Lage the most dramatic win of his Wolves reign so far.\nWolves put faltering start behind them\nAfter losing their first three league games, Wolves are now eighth in the table after eight games, and their faltering start to life under Lage - who replaced Nuno Espirito Santo this summer - is a distant memory.\nSuddenly they are one of the form teams as they equalled the club record of three consecutive Premier League away wins, set last June, when the third victory was also at Villa Park.\nWhile Villa will be upset with the way they threw this game away, Wolves showed great character to keep fighting to the end.\nTheir fourth win of the season was secured after in-form Raul Jimenez started on the bench.\nJimenez, who had scored one goal and assisted another two in the previous two league games, came off the bench in the 88th minute with the score 2-2.\nAfter Jacob Ramsey had fouled Adama Traore just outside the box deep in stoppage time, Jimenez stood over the free-kick before moving away for Neves to seal the victory.\nVilla left to pick up the pieces\nVilla have impressed this season with wins over Newcastle and Everton - as well as a first victory in 12 years at Manchester United.\nAfter going into the international break on the back of a 2-1 defeat at Tottenham, they now have to pick up the pieces from a damaging derby defeat.\nSmith opted to start with keeper Martinez and midfielder Douglas Luiz - despite the fact they played for Argentina and Brazil respectively in the early hours of Friday morning UK time.\nBoth had rushed back to Birmingham after being involved in World Cup qualifiers.\nMartinez did make one fine save to keep out Traore when the game was goalless, while Luiz went close in the first half with a long-range attempt.\nBut neither could save their side from slipping to defeat, and Villa must regroup before their next match, away at Arsenal on Friday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

But they were well short of the form that has carried them into the upper reaches of the table before the international break.\nNorwich stumble in front of goal\nHaving picked up the first point of their Premier League campaign a fortnight ago at Burnley, Norwich started well, stretching Brighton's defence and forcing Robert Sanchez into an early save from Sargent's deflected shot.\nBrighton picked up momentum and asserted themselves on the hosts. Neal Maupay, with four goals in his past seven games, was a constant nuisance to the Norwich defence, appealing in vain for a penalty after going down under the challenge of goalkeeper Tim Krul.\nIf Krul was judged not to get enough of a touch on Maupay, he certainly did of Leandro Trossard's volley shortly after, brilliantly tipping the goal-bound shot on to the bar.\nBrighton created Norwich's best chance of the half as Sanchez rushed out of goal, missed his kick and presented Sargent with an open goal. However the American's attempt from 20 yards and an angle lacked power, allowing Shane Duffy to cover round and hoof clear.\nSargent's sloppy touch allowed another prime chance to go to waste after the break, as his lack of conviction and accuracy gave Dan Burn room to slide in and block his way to goal.\nSargent was withdrawn on 75 minutes by manager Daniel Farke as Norwich came into the ascendancy in the second half and his replacement Milot Rashica sprung Teemu Pukki with an exquisite touch.\nHowever the Finn, who had clipped a previous chance wide, could not out-run the covering Burn, who made another excellent tackle.\nMaupay came close to wrecking Norwich's afternoon entirely as he turned Solly March's cross over the top in the final five minutes.\nBrighton will have to improve with both Manchester City and Liverpool to play before the end of the month but the return of energetic wideman Tariq Lamptey off the bench to make his first Premier League appearance in 10 months following a series of hamstring injuries was one positive to take back to the south coast.\nWhile a second successive point after six straight defeats is a sign of improvement for Norwich, their performance did little to foster faith they can survive in the top flight.\nThey have scored just twice in the league this season with both strikes coming from Pukki. With Todd Cantwell sidelined and Emi Buendia having left for Aston Villa, he looks woefully short of quality company to share the goal-scoring burden.\nFollow live text commentary of Norwich City v Brighton & Hove Albion, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Norwich page\nGo to the Brighton page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Although City dominated possession and created plenty of chances, they failed to extend their advantage, giving the visitors hope.\nBurnley gave them a few scares before De Bruyne added a second goal with 20 minutes to go, curling his shot home when the ball broke to him inside the box.\nSterling made only his third league start of the season - having been recalled at the end of a week where he spoke publicly about being open to a move abroad if he failed to get more game time at City.\nHe struggled to make an impact in the first half while playing as the central attacker in City's front three, managing only 11 touches - by far the lowest of any of their outfield players - and only one shot, which was blocked.\nSterling was far more involved when he switched to the left flank after the break but was unable to add to his tally of one league goal in 2021-22 and it was down to De Bruyne to finish the game off.\nThe win keeps City two points behind leaders Chelsea, who won at Brentford. Burnley remain in the bottom three, still without a league win this season.\nReaction from Manchester City v Burnley, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Man City page\nGo to the Burnley page\nDe Bruyne goal ensures Man City avoid nervy finale\nBurnley could not end their winless run, which at 11 games is the longest in England's top four divisions, but they still gave City plenty to think about.\nMaxwel Cornet, who saw his shot brilliantly saved by Zack Steffen after running clear, went close to equalising in the first half, as did Josh Brownhill, who fizzed his shot inches wide.\nCity were misfiring too, with Riyad Mahrez another of their players failing to make the most of his recall - the closest he came with his four efforts at goal was when he blasted another Silva cut-back against the bar.\nIt could have made for a nervous finale for City's fans, if not for De Bruyne's cool finish after Burnley failed to clear their lines.\nIt meant the home supporters were able to relax and celebrate the news of Leicester's late goals in their win over City's neighbours United - something they did extremely loudly.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Newcastle 2-3 Tottenham: New era at St James' Park begins with loss\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce said he will \"carry on as best I can\" after the club's new era under its Saudi Arabian owners got off to a losing start at home to Tottenham.\nWatched by new non-executive chair Yasir Al-Rumayyan and part-owner Amanda Staveley, Newcastle led after two minutes as Callum Wilson returned from injury to head in.\nThe home fans went wild with delight, a continuation of carnival-esque scenes before the match.\nBruce, marking his 1,000th game in management, might have felt a sense of optimism while clinging to hope he may continue in the job.\nBut then reality struck for a team yet to win in eight Premier League games this season as Spurs scored twice in five minutes.\nFirst, Tanguy Ndombele fired in a right-footed drive, before Harry Kane scored his first league goal of the season when he beat the Newcastle offside trap to dink in, the goal awarded by the video assistant referee after initially being ruled out.\nThe game was then halted when a fan suffered a medical emergency in the stands.\nSupporters and players - including Eric Dier - played their part in alerting medics to the seriousness of the situation before the game was suspended.\nPlay resumed with five minutes of the first half remaining, and Tottenham extended their lead when Son Heung-min slid in at the back post for his fourth of the season.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side, who moved up to fifth in the table, looked comfortable in the second half as the mood turned sour towards Bruce, with home fans calling for him to be sacked.\nA poor audition to stay in the job was made worse when substitute Jonjo Shelvey received a second yellow card for a rash challenge on Sergio Reguilon after 83 minutes.\nAnd despite a brief response when Dier's own goal made it 3-2, the result left Newcastle next-to-bottom of the table with a huge transformation needed to turn the club into the superpower that the new owners want them to be.\nAsked if he will remain in the job, Bruce said: \"That is for other people to decide. Ever since I have walked into this club, it is difficult. I knew how difficult it was going to be with the frustrations.\n\"I will carry on as best I can until I hear otherwise. The owners have conducted themselves respectfully since they came in. As long as I don't hear otherwise, I will go into work tomorrow.\"\nWhat Newcastle need to do to stay up - analysis\nFan 'stable' after game halted because of medical emergency\nReaction from Sunday's games including Tottenham's win at Newcastle\nGo to the Newcastle page\nGo to the Spurs page\nCarnival atmosphere disappears as fans turn on Bruce\nPrior to kick-off, there was a unique atmosphere outside St James' Park and around the city.\nThere were some fans who celebrated the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover by wearing headdresses and draping themselves in Saudi flags, but the overwhelming majority answered the call to wear black and white as they celebrated a new era after Mike Ashley's 14-year reign came to an end.\nInside the stadium, the Gallowgate End was a sea of black and white as supporters waved flags and unveiled a banner quoting lyrics from Newcastle-born performer Jimmy Nail's 1995 song Big River, about the city and rebuilding hope for the future.\nIt must have been an uplifting sight for Al-Rumayyan, who was attending his first game in his capacity as the governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which now owns 80% of the club.\nHe broke out into a huge grin as Wilson scored early on from Javier Manquillo's cross, while Staveley hugged her husband Mehrdad Ghodoussi.\nBut the way Tottenham opened up the Newcastle defence showed how much work is needed to take the club to the top end of the Premier League, let alone into contention to win the title. The priority this season is to avoid relegation.\nAnd the result will not have given Bruce any further security about his job.\nAfter reports last week that he would be sacked, with the club then saying he would remain in charge for this game 45 minutes before his pre-match press conference on Friday, his future remains unclear.\nBut this was a demonstration of a team struggling for form, and with little chance of the game turning Newcastle's way, chants of \"We want Brucey out\" came from the Gallowgate End after 74 minutes and continued until the end, when the final whistle was met with boos.\nIt was a message that would have been heard loud and clear by the new owners.\nTottenham keep composure on dramatic day\nOn a day when the visitors might have been distracted by the atmosphere, this was a welcome boost to Spurs boss Nuno, whose side have earned successive wins after a derby defeat by Arsenal that led to many questions about the club's direction.\nTottenham's front four of Ndombele, Son, Lucas Moura and Kane were a menace to the hosts, who need to prioritise a defensive midfielder among their spending plans.\nPrior to the game being stopped and with Spurs already leading 2-1, Moura headed on to the bar, and they looked far more likely to score in the second half than their opponents before Dier's late own goal.\n\"We knew we had to ignore the noise and do our job,\" said Nuno. \"We did not start well but did an amazing job after. I'm really proud of them.\n\"I would like to score more, the boys would also, but Newcastle are a good team with good defenders.\"\nCredit must also go to Reguilon and Dier for the part they played in alerting medics to the stricken supporter and to midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, who continued after the incident, having also played when Denmark team-mate Christian Eriksen had a cardiac arrest during their Euro 2020 match against Finland in June.\nAfter a day when there were conflicting emotions and no end of drama, it put the result into perspective.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

They played with more belief and we focused too much on defending.\n\"I was happy with the first 65-70 minutes and we should have scored more. But respect to Brentford.\"\nReaction to Brentford v Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Brentford news page\nGo to the Chelsea news page\nChilwell takes his chance as Chelsea remain firm\nThe early part of the season saw 24-year-old Chilwell largely limited to a place on the Chelsea bench, with Marcos Alonso's revival earning him the left-wing-back spot in Tuchel's Premier League line-up.\nTuchel insisted it was \"no great drama\" and it always seemed likely a player of Chilwell's calibre would play his part over the long season.\nChilwell spoke afterwards about the importance of \"taking your chance\". Recent form suggests he has done exactly that - scoring in the 3-1 win over Southampton before the international break, then finding the net again in England's 5-0 victory in Andorra last Saturday.\nPreferred once again to Alonso against Brentford, the \u00a350m signing from Leicester continued his rich vein of scoring form with a confident and crisp left-foot strike.\nNot only did he score the winner but he was part of a defensive unit which remained firm under pressure despite lacking key players.\nVeteran centre-back Thiago Silva was missing after playing for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier against Uruguay about 36 hours previously, while Germany international Antonio Rudiger was also out injured.\nThat saw 22-year-old Malang Sarr given a league debut in a back three also containing Chalobah, another inexperienced youngster, and Andreas Christensen.\n\"We have Eddy [Mendy] to thank, he was amazing,\" Chilwell said. \"He made superb saves and got us the three points in the end.\n\"I'm happy to get on the scoresheet and happy to score the only goal of the game. But we showed our defensive steel.\"\n'There should have only been one winner' - Frank\nBrentford have impressed fans and pundits alike since winning promotion to the Premier League and came away from this match with lots of credit despite the defeat.\nChilwell's strike was reward for a first half where Chelsea dominated without creating many clear-cut opportunities.\nBrentford lacked aggression on the front foot and struggled to impose themselves in the Chelsea third.\nBut the Bees considerably improved in the final half an hour and will count themselves unfortunate not to earn at least a point.\nA higher intensity allowed the hosts to pose more questions of the makeshift Chelsea defence, with tactical tweaks and substitutions from boss Thomas Frank helping his side press the European champions back.\nThe statistics laid bare their dominance in the final stages.\nThe Bees had 15 shots in the second half - 12 of which came in the final 11 minutes - and spent almost 40% of the last 15 minutes inside Chelsea's third.\nWhile it did not produce an equaliser, it earned Frank's side a proud ovation from the home fans at the final whistle and keeps them in seventh place after an encouraging start to their debut season in the Premier League.\n\"If you look over the 90 minutes, there can only be one winner - and that's us,\" said Frank.\n\"We kept the number one side and European champions to five shots. In the end, we were all over them.

That it was greeted with huge cheers and a standing ovation just about summed up Ranieri's day.\nBest action and reaction from Watford v Liverpool, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nSalah equals Premier League goals record for Africa\nGo to the Watford page\nGo to the Liverpool page\nRanieri's task laid bare\nWatford is Ranieri's 22nd different job in his long and varied coaching career. Rarely can he have endured a start as sobering as this.\nIt was Watford's heaviest Premier League defeat since their eight-goal hammering by Manchester City in September 2019 and their biggest at home since the same opponents scored six here two years before that. There was certainly nothing to trigger a celebration before his 70th birthday on Thursday.\nThe dimensions of Vicarage Road mean the edge of the managers' technical areas are about as close as it is possible to get to the side of the pitch.\nIt meant that Ranieri was almost on top of the action as the size of his task was laid bare.\nA long pre-match chat with Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp was about as good as it got for the Italian.\nThe hosts simply did not get near enough to their talented opponents. Salah was given far too much space by Danny Rose even before he created the opener. Firmino was allowed to drop into the space between Watford's defence and midfield without anyone tracking his movements and Liverpool stroked the ball about at will further back, with no press to hurry them up.\nWith a paltry 17% possession, no shots, no corners and, obviously, no goals, the first half was a non-event for Ranieri and his new team. And if he hoped the introduction of Tom Cleverley into midfield for the second period would improve matters, he was sadly mistaken as Liverpool scored twice within 10 minutes of the restart.\nWatford did rally towards the end, with Ismaila Sarr striking a post, although by then any chance of turning the game into a contest was long gone.\nIf there was a consolation for Ranieri, it is that there should be no dissenters if he wants to make significant changes during his first full week working with his new team.\nHowever, with a fixture list that includes Everton, Arsenal, Chelsea and both Manchester clubs among Watford's next seven opponents, Ranieri needs a plan if his club's famously trigger-happy owners are not to be considering whether to axe yet another manager.\nRampant Reds show their quality\nThis was Liverpool's biggest win since the 7-0 hammering of Crystal Palace last December, which was also the last time Firmino, Salah and Mane all scored in a top-flight game.\nIn joining Egypt's Salah and Ivorian Didier Drogba as African goalscoring centurions, Senegalese Mane is part of a pretty exclusive Premier League club.\nSalah's curling pass with the outside of his left foot could not have been any more inviting and Mane showed superb composure to meet the ball with perfect timing and give Foster no chance.\nFirmino's three were welcome - but they were also all pretty straightforward. The first two were tap-ins thanks to James Milner's low cross into the six-yard area and the ball running loose from a desperate Ben Foster save after Craig Cathcart had turned the ball towards his own goal.\nThere was a bit more to the Brazilian's third as he ran forward with intelligence, something no defender countered, after Neco Williams had crossed.\nBut there was no doubting Salah's was the goal of the game.\nSurrounded by three players on the edge of the Watford box, through a combination of speed, dexterity and brilliant close control, Salah got rid of them all before finding the target with his usual unerring accuracy.\nIt means he has now scored in eight successive matches in all competitions and in nine out of 10 in total, underlining why Liverpool are so keen for him to sign an extension to his current contract, which has less than two years to run.\nWatford are next in action against Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday, 23 October (15:00 BST). Liverpool are at Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00). Their next Premier League game is at Manchester United on Sunday, 24 October (16:30).\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Arsenal 3-1 Aston Villa: Gunners hit three past lacklustre Villa\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta has praised Emile Smith Rowe for changing his lifestyle after the 21-year-old midfielder helped the Gunners to a thoroughly deserved victory over Aston Villa as they moved into the top half of the Premier League table.\nThomas Partey headed in Smith Rowe's corner for his first goal for the Gunners - having earlier hit the crossbar.\nRight at the end of the first half, Arsenal were given a penalty after a long video assistant referee review for a Matt Targett foul on Alexandre Lacazette.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang's penalty was saved excellently by former Arsenal keeper Emiliano Martinez, but the Gabon striker put home the rebound from close range.\nVilla improved on a thoroughly wretched first half, but Smith Rowe scored Arsenal's third 11 minutes into the second half.\nHe won the ball in his own half and then finished the move via a deflection and the post.\nThe visitors got a consolation when Jacob Ramsey curled his first Villa goal into the top corner from 20 yards. They put on good pressure and created a few chances in the closing stages but it was too little, too late.\nFollow reaction to the game here\nGo to the Arsenal page\nGo to the Aston Villa page\nVilla saw two bids for England Under-21 international Smith Rowe turned down in the summer, with Arteta insisting he was never worried he would leave the Emirates Stadium.\nSmith Rowe now has two goals and two assists this season and Arteta has been pleased with the development of the academy graduate.\nHe said: \"When you want to take the game to the next level, when you become a real important player in such a big club, that should be the only priority and every detail is important and relevant.\n\"You have to make him aware of that, you cannot give percentages away that can make big differences and he has changed that.\n\"There is no complaining, he is just looking forwards, he is really determined, he has changed the way he is living as well a little bit and some of the habits that he had and he's been superb.\"\nMore like it from Arsenal\nThis did not look like a game between two teams sitting next to each other in the table - but Arsenal were 12th and Villa 13th before kick-off.\nArsenal are capable of good spells - like at the start of Monday's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace - and good games - like the 3-1 win over Tottenham.\nThis was one of the good games, well for 80 minutes.\nAston Villa were the opposite of their 3-2 defeat by Wolves. They collapsed there in the final 10 minutes - but this time that was when they they had most of their chances.\nThey did not manage a shot in the first half, the first time since May 2018 that has happened to a team playing against Arsenal in the league.\nThe Gunners should have been out of sight - Partey had hit the woodwork from close range before headed them into the lead.\nAubameyang had a goal disallowed for a debatable Lacazette foul and Martinez made several smart saves.\nBut Arsenal got the second they deserved in first-half injury time. The crowd thought Craig Pawson was whistling for half-time but he was actually stopping play for a VAR consultation.\nTargett was about to clear the ball when Lacazette stepped across him and drew a foul instead. The penalty was given and Aubameyang scored at the second attempt.\nVilla had more threat when they brought on winger Leon Bailey for defender Axel Tuanzebe at half-time, but after their first couple of chances, Smith Rowe wrapped it up.\nOr so it looked until Ramsey scored the best goal of the game. Ollie Watkins, Ramsey and Bailey all had chances to for Villa but could not set up a tense finale.\nSmith 'confused' about penalty\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith told BBC Sport: \"First half we got dominated physically. I can take the second half. I don't expect us to get dominated physically though. You can't give teams in the Premier League a head start.\n\"We knew Arsenal would start quickly but we allowed them to control the first half.\n\"I am confused about the penalty. We spoke at length [before the season] about the lower-contact frivolous penalties.\n\"I have seen it once and can't work out if he touches ball first or man. If we are looking at a penalty that long maybe they aren't given.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He has the mentality to perform for Newcastle United.\"\nPolice investigate Crystal Palace fans' banner criticising Saudi Arabian deal\nEagles striker Benteke had opened the scoring 11 minutes into the second half, powering a header into the bottom corner from Tyrick Mitchell's deep cross.\nBenteke also struck the woodwork in both halves, heading Michael Oliseh's teasing delivery against the foot of the post in the first before sending a looping header onto the top of the crossbar in the second.\nIn an eventful afternoon for the Belgian striker, he spurned a glorious opportunity to restore Palace's advantage when he fired into the side-netting from James McArthur's through ball, before having a late goal ruled out by VAR for a foul against Marc Guehi.\nPalace's sixth draw of the season leaves them in 15th place - five points above Newcastle, who remain second bottom on four points and without a win this season.\n\"It is a base for us to start,\" added Jones. \"I would like for us to be better on the ball but that doesn't come overnight. It takes time and we've concentrated on trying to shore up a little bit and not concede as many goals.\n\"We have to improve, we have to be better but I have to give the lads credit, mentally and physically.\"\nReaction to Crystal Palace v Newcastle, plus all of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Crystal Palace page\nGo to the Newcastle United page\nWilson goal papers over Newcastle cracks\nNewcastle's new owners have said the appointment of a new manager \"will be announced in due course\" after relieving Bruce of his duties just 13 days after the Saudi Arabian-backed \u00a3305m takeover of the club.\nThe consortium has already held talks with former Roma coach Paulo Fonseca, while former Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, ex-Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre and Belgium boss Roberto Martinez have also been linked with the job.\nBruce's exit was met with relief bordering on jubilation by the vast majority of Newcastle supporters - but there was little for the travelling Toon Army to get excited about in the early stages on Saturday as Palace dominated possession.\nThe closest the visitors came to a first-half breakthrough was when Wilson fired into the side-netting from a tight angle after Emil Krafth's goal-bound effort was cleared by Guehi.\nAllan Saint-Maximin showed fleeting glimpses of his creative brilliance but endured a frustrating afternoon as Newcastle's rare attacks were easily dealt with by the home defence.\nIt seemed only a matter of time before Palace doubled their advantage once Benteke had nodded the hosts into a thoroughly deserved lead, but Wilson sent the away fans wild with a magnificent strike into the top corner from Krafth's flick-on.\nThe former Bournemouth striker has now scored six goals in his last six Premier League appearances for the club.\nThe Magpies rode their luck late on as Benteke's strike was disallowed, but interim manager Jones will have appreciated his team's resilience in his first of two games at the helm before a new manager is due to be appointed.\nFamiliar failings for Palace\nEven before Monday's 2-2 draw at Arsenal - a game which Palace also dominated for large spells - Patrick Vieira spoke about the need for his side to \"turn good performances into wins\".\nThe former Gunners captain has done a tremendous job in a very short space of time at Selhurst Park, implementing a more expansive and attacking brand of football than his predecessor Roy Hodgson, but the 3-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in September remains his only victory in the league this season.\nThe first half was a familiar tale of frustration as the hosts enjoyed 79% of possession but failed to turn their territorial dominance into goals.\nBenteke could have scored four or five on another day. The former Aston Villa and Liverpool striker broke Newcastle's resistance with a fine header early in the second half but was twice denied by the frame of the goal and sent an acrobatic effort of his own sailing narrowly over Karl Darlow's crossbar.\nThe Belgian will be bitterly disappointed not to have restored the hosts' advantage soon after Wilson's equaliser when he latched onto McArthur's pass and steered a low effort wide of the near post.\nHe thought he had atoned for his earlier misses with another firm header past Darlow on 87 minutes, but Guehi was adjudged to have fouled Matt Ritchie in the build-up as Palace were made to settle for a fourth successive draw in the Premier League.\n\"It was of course frustrating because we did enough to take those three points,\" Eagles boss Vieira said afterwards. \"Obviously we don't win enough games, but when you look at how we defended set-pieces today it was much better than previously.\n\"The goal that we concede, it was a fantastic goal.

It is shaping up to be a three-horse race along with Chelsea and Manchester City for the title and this was the performance of true thoroughbreds.\nThe only downside to their day was the injury to Keita, injured in a two-footed challenge by Pogba in what is a cruel blow to the midfielder given he has been showing the best form of his stop-start Liverpool career.\nWhat now for Solskjaer?\nSolskjaer was in defiant mood after United came from two goals down to beat Atalanta in the Champions League but there is a frailty and confusion about this team that means they will constantly fall short - and this inevitably puts further pressure on the manager.\nThere are defeats that carry greater significance than others and the sight of United chasing shadows five goals down while Solskjaer stood helplessly on the touchline being taunted for long periods by joyous Liverpool fans made this one of those days.\nAny defeat to Liverpool is painful for United fans. When the defeat is as comprehensive as this one and in front of their own supporters, it is a day that will cut deeply to every part of Old Trafford.\nIt was a defensive shambles, with poor communication and lack of understanding about what the team is trying to do cruelly exposed by Liverpool. As a result, this game was effectively over within 13 minutes.\nSolskjaer has praised the backing of United's fans and the Stretford End largely stuck with him and the team but there is no disguising the fact there were loud jeers at half time and by the time the final whistle sounded, huge sections of the stadium were deserted.\nThere was also a lack of discipline in the United performance, Cristiano Ronaldo perhaps fortunate to escape a red card for kicking out at Curtis Jones while he was on the floor then Pogba - presumably sent on to restore some slight semblance of order - getting one for his challenge on Keita.\nUnited have been steadfast in their backing for Solskjaer but the shock waves of this result will have questions being asked more strongly than ever about his position by everyone from the club's hierarchy to their fans.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He has the mentality to perform for Newcastle United.\"\nPolice investigate Crystal Palace fans' banner criticising Saudi Arabian deal\nEagles striker Benteke had opened the scoring 11 minutes into the second half, powering a header into the bottom corner from Tyrick Mitchell's deep cross.\nBenteke also struck the woodwork in both halves, heading Michael Oliseh's teasing delivery against the foot of the post in the first before sending a looping header onto the top of the crossbar in the second.\nIn an eventful afternoon for the Belgian striker, he spurned a glorious opportunity to restore Palace's advantage when he fired into the side-netting from James McArthur's through ball, before having a late goal ruled out by VAR for a foul against Marc Guehi.\nPalace's sixth draw of the season leaves them in 15th place - five points above Newcastle, who remain second bottom on four points and without a win this season.\n\"It is a base for us to start,\" added Jones. \"I would like for us to be better on the ball but that doesn't come overnight. It takes time and we've concentrated on trying to shore up a little bit and not concede as many goals.\n\"We have to improve, we have to be better but I have to give the lads credit, mentally and physically.\"\nReaction to Crystal Palace v Newcastle, plus all of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo to the Crystal Palace page\nGo to the Newcastle United page\nWilson goal papers over Newcastle cracks\nNewcastle's new owners have said the appointment of a new manager \"will be announced in due course\" after relieving Bruce of his duties just 13 days after the Saudi Arabian-backed \u00a3305m takeover of the club.\nThe consortium has already held talks with former Roma coach Paulo Fonseca, while former Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, ex-Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre and Belgium boss Roberto Martinez have also been linked with the job.\nBruce's exit was met with relief bordering on jubilation by the vast majority of Newcastle supporters - but there was little for the travelling Toon Army to get excited about in the early stages on Saturday as Palace dominated possession.\nThe closest the visitors came to a first-half breakthrough was when Wilson fired into the side-netting from a tight angle after Emil Krafth's goal-bound effort was cleared by Guehi.\nAllan Saint-Maximin showed fleeting glimpses of his creative brilliance but endured a frustrating afternoon as Newcastle's rare attacks were easily dealt with by the home defence.\nIt seemed only a matter of time before Palace doubled their advantage once Benteke had nodded the hosts into a thoroughly deserved lead, but Wilson sent the away fans wild with a magnificent strike into the top corner from Krafth's flick-on.\nThe former Bournemouth striker has now scored six goals in his last six Premier League appearances for the club.\nThe Magpies rode their luck late on as Benteke's strike was disallowed, but interim manager Jones will have appreciated his team's resilience in his first of two games at the helm before a new manager is due to be appointed.\nFamiliar failings for Palace\nEven before Monday's 2-2 draw at Arsenal - a game which Palace also dominated for large spells - Patrick Vieira spoke about the need for his side to \"turn good performances into wins\".\nThe former Gunners captain has done a tremendous job in a very short space of time at Selhurst Park, implementing a more expansive and attacking brand of football than his predecessor Roy Hodgson, but the 3-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in September remains his only victory in the league this season.\nThe first half was a familiar tale of frustration as the hosts enjoyed 79% of possession but failed to turn their territorial dominance into goals.\nBenteke could have scored four or five on another day. The former Aston Villa and Liverpool striker broke Newcastle's resistance with a fine header early in the second half but was twice denied by the frame of the goal and sent an acrobatic effort of his own sailing narrowly over Karl Darlow's crossbar.\nThe Belgian will be bitterly disappointed not to have restored the hosts' advantage soon after Wilson's equaliser when he latched onto McArthur's pass and steered a low effort wide of the near post.\nHe thought he had atoned for his earlier misses with another firm header past Darlow on 87 minutes, but Guehi was adjudged to have fouled Matt Ritchie in the build-up as Palace were made to settle for a fourth successive draw in the Premier League.\n\"It was of course frustrating because we did enough to take those three points,\" Eagles boss Vieira said afterwards. \"Obviously we don't win enough games, but when you look at how we defended set-pieces today it was much better than previously.\n\"The goal that we concede, it was a fantastic goal. There is nothing I can be frustrated about.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It is shaping up to be a three-horse race along with Chelsea and Manchester City for the title and this was the performance of true thoroughbreds.\nThe only downside to their day was the injury to Keita, injured in a two-footed challenge by Pogba in what is a cruel blow to the midfielder given he has been showing the best form of his stop-start Liverpool career.\nWhat now for Solskjaer?\nSolskjaer was in defiant mood after United came from two goals down to beat Atalanta in the Champions League but there is a frailty and confusion about this team that means they will constantly fall short - and this inevitably puts further pressure on the manager.\nThere are defeats that carry greater significance than others and the sight of United chasing shadows five goals down while Solskjaer stood helplessly on the touchline being taunted for long periods by joyous Liverpool fans made this one of those days.\nAny defeat to Liverpool is painful for United fans. When the defeat is as comprehensive as this one and in front of their own supporters, it is a day that will cut deeply to every part of Old Trafford.\nIt was a defensive shambles, with poor communication and lack of understanding about what the team is trying to do cruelly exposed by Liverpool. As a result, this game was effectively over within 13 minutes.\nSolskjaer has praised the backing of United's fans and the Stretford End largely stuck with him and the team but there is no disguising the fact there were loud jeers at half time and by the time the final whistle sounded, huge sections of the stadium were deserted.\nThere was also a lack of discipline in the United performance, Cristiano Ronaldo perhaps fortunate to escape a red card for kicking out at Curtis Jones while he was on the floor then Pogba - presumably sent on to restore some slight semblance of order - getting one for his challenge on Keita.\nUnited have been steadfast in their backing for Solskjaer but the shock waves of this result will have questions being asked more strongly than ever about his position by everyone from the club's hierarchy to their fans.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They put on good pressure and created a few chances in the closing stages but it was too little, too late.\nFollow reaction to the game here\nGo to the Arsenal page\nGo to the Aston Villa page\nVilla saw two bids for England Under-21 international Smith Rowe turned down in the summer, with Arteta insisting he was never worried he would leave the Emirates Stadium.\nSmith Rowe now has two goals and two assists this season and Arteta has been pleased with the development of the academy graduate.\nHe said: \"When you want to take the game to the next level, when you become a real important player in such a big club, that should be the only priority and every detail is important and relevant.\n\"You have to make him aware of that, you cannot give percentages away that can make big differences and he has changed that.\n\"There is no complaining, he is just looking forwards, he is really determined, he has changed the way he is living as well a little bit and some of the habits that he had and he's been superb.\"\nMore like it from Arsenal\nThis did not look like a game between two teams sitting next to each other in the table - but Arsenal were 12th and Villa 13th before kick-off.\nArsenal are capable of good spells - like at the start of Monday's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace - and good games - like the 3-1 win over Tottenham.\nThis was one of the good games, well for 80 minutes.\nAston Villa were the opposite of their 3-2 defeat by Wolves. They collapsed there in the final 10 minutes - but this time that was when they they had most of their chances.\nThey did not manage a shot in the first half, the first time since May 2018 that has happened to a team playing against Arsenal in the league.\nThe Gunners should have been out of sight - Partey had hit the woodwork from close range before headed them into the lead.\nAubameyang had a goal disallowed for a debatable Lacazette foul and Martinez made several smart saves.\nBut Arsenal got the second they deserved in first-half injury time. The crowd thought Craig Pawson was whistling for half-time but he was actually stopping play for a VAR consultation.\nTargett was about to clear the ball when Lacazette stepped across him and drew a foul instead. The penalty was given and Aubameyang scored at the second attempt.\nVilla had more threat when they brought on winger Leon Bailey for defender Axel Tuanzebe at half-time, but after their first couple of chances, Smith Rowe wrapped it up.\nOr so it looked until Ramsey scored the best goal of the game. Ollie Watkins, Ramsey and Bailey all had chances to for Villa but could not set up a tense finale.\nSmith 'confused' about penalty\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith told BBC Sport: \"First half we got dominated physically. I can take the second half. I don't expect us to get dominated physically though. You can't give teams in the Premier League a head start.\n\"We knew Arsenal would start quickly but we allowed them to control the first half.\n\"I am confused about the penalty. We spoke at length [before the season] about the lower-contact frivolous penalties.\n\"I have seen it once and can't work out if he touches ball first or man.

It amazes me, it wasn't going towards the goal - and Ashley Young was covering. That staggers me.\"\nWith Villa pressing forward for an equaliser, Fornals tapped in a third on the break and Bowen rounded off the scoring for West Ham with another close-range finish into an empty net after good work from Michail Antonio and Manuel Lanzini.\nWest Ham's victory epitomised their fine start to the campaign and they have now earned more points at this stage of the season than any other, bar 1975-76.\nMoyes' side building momentum\nWhile there is still a considerable distance to go until prizes and European places are confirmed next May, momentum and hope appears to be building at West Ham.\nMoyes' side have been excellent on three fronts this term, with a superb Premier League start, reaching the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup and taking charge of their Europa League group with three straight wins.\nAnd there is also a positivity and attacking impetus attached to his side that has perhaps not always been present in his previous jobs elsewhere.\nRather than sitting back at Villa Park they went straight after their out-of-sorts opponents and the likes of Bowen, Tomas Soucek and Antonio all had good opportunities to double their lead before the home side levelled.\nRice's goal owed a little to luck with Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez complaining that he had been unsighted by the England midfielder's effort from distance.\nHowever, after Konsa's red card, they were thoroughly professional and eventually made their extra man count.\nVilla, who started Leon Bailey for the first time and lost Jacob Ramsey to a first-half injury, will consider themselves unfortunate in moments but they were also far too passive early on, and with a man down, paid the price for having to constantly chase the game.\nFollow live text and radio commentary of Aston Villa v West Ham United, plus what happened in Norwich v Leeds\nGo straight to all the best Villa content\nVisit the Hammers page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

And after a Spurs display that was dreadful and deadly dull, that key difference signalled an ominous warning for Nuno.\nManchester United's fans, no matter how they were feeling as their team went down without a fight against Liverpool, did not turn publicly on their manager. Yes, many left before the end, but the dissent aimed at Solskjaer personally was hardly mutinous.\nNuno was cut no such slack in a hostile, sour atmosphere at Spurs.\nFollow reaction to Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester United, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Spurs content\nVisit the United page\nHe does not enjoy Solskjaer's status as a club playing legend and the fact he was way down Spurs chairman Daniel Levy's list of potential successors after Jose Mourinho's sacking in April means he is fighting an uphill struggle for credibility.\nIt is not Nuno's fault that it was almost a case of last man standing when he was finally appointed after a botched managerial search. But it meant there was no shield of sympathy when the simmering mood of mutiny at Spurs boiled over here.\nThe environment was, at best, subdued as United held a 1-0 lead courtesy of Cristiano Ronaldo's superb volley. It turned to hot fury when Nuno replaced the popular Lucas Moura with Steven Bergwijn after 54 minutes.\nIt was the tipping point.\nBoos swept around this vast arena, not aimed at Bergwijn but at a manager who has singularly failed to win the hearts and minds of Spurs fans - and whose cause is not helped by a counter-punching style of football completely at odds with the bold statements made as the club sought their new manager.\nSpurs did not muster a shot on target here and barely looked likely to.\nIn fact, they have not had a shot on target in their past two hours and 16 minutes of football, since Harry Kane's effort in the 44th minute against West Ham. This was the first time Spurs have failed to have a shot on target in a Premier League home game since December 2013 against Liverpool.\nAnd that does not misrepresent just how lacking in ideas Spurs were.\nUnited turned the screw and the environment worsened, Kane getting it in the neck after another listless performance was capped by a run and tame cross straight at a Manchester United defender.\nIt did not sound here as if Kane was \"one of their own\" - the cry from Spurs fans in his pomp. He looked and played like a man struggling for inspiration after a summer move to Manchester City did not materialise, although it should be stressed the paucity of service did him no favours.\nNuno's only respite came in the last four minutes when Spurs fans turned their ire on Levy after Marcus Rashford made it 3-0, a goal which resulted in a swift emptying of thousands of seats and demands for the chairman to leave the club.\nIt is Nuno who is under pressure but this is not all down to him. Not by any stretch. The criticism of Levy is merited.\nSpurs have lost their way since they reached the Champions League final against Liverpool in 2019. They may have lost 2-0 in Madrid but they felt on the up under Mauricio Pochettino,\nInstead, the much-loved Pochettino did not get the backing he wanted, grew dissatisfied and was sacked six months later. Jose Mourinho was an expensive, quick-fix vanity appointment that failed, so Spurs find themselves where they are now.\nSpurs are currently a middling club with not the slightest chance of mounting a title challenge. We are only 10 games into the league season but there are no positive signs of progress.\nAs for Solskjaer, what a contrast this was to last Sunday as he walked over to take the acclaim from United's followers after a highly efficient display, decorated by the stardust applied by Ronaldo, who not only scored but created a superb second for Edinson Cavani.\nThis does not mean Solskjaer's troubles are over but his delight was understandable. This was a game he could not afford to lose.\nRonaldo came to his manager's aid with world-class quality and United's move to a three-man defence, with Raphael Varane back alongside captain Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof, easily repelled Spurs' attacking efforts, such as they were.\nSolskjaer had gone to the cliff edge with the defeat by Liverpool but pulled back from the brink in style here. Now he must continue the good work away to Atalanta in the Champions League, then against Manchester City in the derby at Old Trafford.\nHe was in desperate straits and needed to pull out a big result when nothing else would do.\nIt is a good knack for any manager to have - Nuno must hope he can discover a similar habit in very troubled times.\nOur coverage of Tottenham Hotspur is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Spurs - go straight to all the best content",

Christian Norgaard forced Nick Pope into action and Ivan Toney went close after a rare moment of confusion in the Clarets' defence.\nBut while Saman Ghoddos' excellent volley eventually reduced Burnley's advantage with 11 minutes remaining, Thomas Frank's side were unable to produce a sensational late rally and slumped to a third successive league defeat.\nReaction to Burnley v Brentford, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Burnley content\nVisit the Brentford page\nClarets celebrate Dyche anniversary in style\nBurnley had not failed to muster a win from their opening 10 games of a Premier League season since 2014-15 - and on that occasion they were ultimately relegated from the top-flight.\nBut on the day the Premier League's longest-serving current manager celebrated nine years in charge at Turf Moor, Dyche's side never appeared in danger of recording an unwanted club record of 13 games without victory in the competition.\nThe Clarets' performances have been steadily improving - they had lost just once in their previous four in the league - and they were rewarded for an electric start against beleaguered opposition.\nBrentford, unbeaten in four away league games this term, were unable to compose themselves as Burnley harried and probed from the start.\nThe inspired hosts registered 10 first-half shots to the Bees' two and Premier League debutant Alvaro Fernandez - in for injured goalkeeper David Raya - stood little hope of reaching Wood and Cornet's quality efforts, while Lowton expertly guided his header back across goal.\nCornet had already seen a goal disallowed after Wood was found marginally offside in the build-up, while Fernandez avoided a greater deficit with good saves to deny a Wood header and Johann Gudmundsson at close quarters.\nThough more threatening after the interval, Brentford could not produce the second-half reaction necessary to salvage a result from their poor start as Toney squandered a couple of half-chances before Ghoddos' consolation.\nThis impressive first victory moved Dyche's men out of the bottom three and - with the addition of the talented Cornet in attack - it demonstrated they are capable of greater things than their early results suggest.\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche told BBC Match of the Day: \"We were a bit nervous in the second half, but the first half was terrific. There was some really good play from us.\n\"The fans have been patient and stood by us. They know it's a challenge for us, but we've got all noses pointing in the right direction. We've got tough games coming, but they're all tough.\"\nBrentford manager Thomas Frank said: \"At half-time we talked about pride and getting back into the game. The second half was better.\n\"We win or learn. Today we definitely learned, especially in the first half. In the second half we grew into it, even though the dynamic changed a bit in the second half.

They had some really good ones. The problem was they tended to come from mistakes by their opponents.\nRomain Saiss' sliced clearance sent Demarai Gray clear, only for the former Leicester man to drag his shot wide. Holgate seemed to be caught by surprise when the Wolves defence allowed a free-kick to reach him at the far post, from where he scooped the ball over.\nBut the tepid nature of their display was not appreciated by a travelling support whose side had just lost successive home games and conceded four goals in the final 12 minutes against Watford in their last outing, and made their feelings known at the half-time whistle blew.\nThe introduction of Fabian Delph and doubtless some choice words from their manager led to a significant improvement from the visitors.\nSa's woeful pass out of his six-yard area would have led to an Everton goal had the Wolves goalkeeper and his captain Conor Coady not combined to block Richarlison's route to the net.\nCoady was in the way again when Godfrey shot from the edge of the area. This time, though, the block went straight to Iwobi, who slammed home a first-time shot.\nEverton pressed on but once Sa denied Gordon, they were unable to fashion another opportunity, leaving Benitez pondering how to arrest a slide in fortunes that began when they were seven points ahead of tonight's opponents - who they now find themselves two behind.\nWolves' next game is at Crystal Palace on Saturday (15:00 GMT). Everton are next in action the following day when they entertain Tottenham (14:00).\n'We are changing things that will be positive for the future'\nWolves boss Bruno Lage, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was very good, three points and especially what we did in the first half - the way we played and the goals we scored. Very good.\n\"These kind of things can happen. We prepared for the game very well, we had a long time to prepare. We saw the way we can find the right space and when they played 4-4-2 we found the right spaces.\n\"I don't care if we score goals in the first half or the second half I want the team to understand how the opponent is playing.\"\nEverton boss Rafael Benitez, speaking to BBC Sport: \"When you lose games you have to be disappointed. We didn't do well in the first half but second half much better. It is something we have to change and hopefully better for the next game.\n\"We were too worried about making mistakes but in the second half we saw the character we have. It is something we have to learn for the future and don't waste half an hour.\n\"I think the second half we maybe deserved a couple of goals. Even in the first half playing bad we still had chances.\n\"With players out and we are maybe pushing players who are not really available like Delph back today. We are changing a lot of things I believe will be positive for the future.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Christian Norgaard forced Nick Pope into action and Ivan Toney went close after a rare moment of confusion in the Clarets' defence.\nBut while Saman Ghoddos' excellent volley eventually reduced Burnley's advantage with 11 minutes remaining, Thomas Frank's side were unable to produce a sensational late rally and slumped to a third successive league defeat.\nReaction to Burnley v Brentford, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Burnley content\nVisit the Brentford page\nClarets celebrate Dyche anniversary in style\nBurnley had not failed to muster a win from their opening 10 games of a Premier League season since 2014-15 - and on that occasion they were ultimately relegated from the top-flight.\nBut on the day the Premier League's longest-serving current manager celebrated nine years in charge at Turf Moor, Dyche's side never appeared in danger of recording an unwanted club record of 13 games without victory in the competition.\nThe Clarets' performances have been steadily improving - they had lost just once in their previous four in the league - and they were rewarded for an electric start against beleaguered opposition.\nBrentford, unbeaten in four away league games this term, were unable to compose themselves as Burnley harried and probed from the start.\nThe inspired hosts registered 10 first-half shots to the Bees' two and Premier League debutant Alvaro Fernandez - in for injured goalkeeper David Raya - stood little hope of reaching Wood and Cornet's quality efforts, while Lowton expertly guided his header back across goal.\nCornet had already seen a goal disallowed after Wood was found marginally offside in the build-up, while Fernandez avoided a greater deficit with good saves to deny a Wood header and Johann Gudmundsson at close quarters.\nThough more threatening after the interval, Brentford could not produce the second-half reaction necessary to salvage a result from their poor start as Toney squandered a couple of half-chances before Ghoddos' consolation.\nThis impressive first victory moved Dyche's men out of the bottom three and - with the addition of the talented Cornet in attack - it demonstrated they are capable of greater things than their early results suggest.\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche told BBC Match of the Day: \"We were a bit nervous in the second half, but the first half was terrific. There was some really good play from us.\n\"The fans have been patient and stood by us. They know it's a challenge for us, but we've got all noses pointing in the right direction. We've got tough games coming, but they're all tough.\"\nBrentford manager Thomas Frank said: \"At half-time we talked about pride and getting back into the game. The second half was better.\n\"We win or learn. Today we definitely learned, especially in the first half. In the second half we grew into it, even though the dynamic changed a bit in the second half. We need to perform much better than we did in the first half.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

They had some really good ones. The problem was they tended to come from mistakes by their opponents.\nRomain Saiss' sliced clearance sent Demarai Gray clear, only for the former Leicester man to drag his shot wide. Holgate seemed to be caught by surprise when the Wolves defence allowed a free-kick to reach him at the far post, from where he scooped the ball over.\nBut the tepid nature of their display was not appreciated by a travelling support whose side had just lost successive home games and conceded four goals in the final 12 minutes against Watford in their last outing, and made their feelings known at the half-time whistle blew.\nThe introduction of Fabian Delph and doubtless some choice words from their manager led to a significant improvement from the visitors.\nSa's woeful pass out of his six-yard area would have led to an Everton goal had the Wolves goalkeeper and his captain Conor Coady not combined to block Richarlison's route to the net.\nCoady was in the way again when Godfrey shot from the edge of the area. This time, though, the block went straight to Iwobi, who slammed home a first-time shot.\nEverton pressed on but once Sa denied Gordon, they were unable to fashion another opportunity, leaving Benitez pondering how to arrest a slide in fortunes that began when they were seven points ahead of tonight's opponents - who they now find themselves two behind.\nWolves' next game is at Crystal Palace on Saturday (15:00 GMT). Everton are next in action the following day when they entertain Tottenham (14:00).\n'We are changing things that will be positive for the future'\nWolves boss Bruno Lage, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was very good, three points and especially what we did in the first half - the way we played and the goals we scored. Very good.\n\"These kind of things can happen. We prepared for the game very well, we had a long time to prepare. We saw the way we can find the right space and when they played 4-4-2 we found the right spaces.\n\"I don't care if we score goals in the first half or the second half I want the team to understand how the opponent is playing.\"\nEverton boss Rafael Benitez, speaking to BBC Sport: \"When you lose games you have to be disappointed. We didn't do well in the first half but second half much better. It is something we have to change and hopefully better for the next game.\n\"We were too worried about making mistakes but in the second half we saw the character we have. It is something we have to learn for the future and don't waste half an hour.\n\"I think the second half we maybe deserved a couple of goals. Even in the first half playing bad we still had chances.\n\"With players out and we are maybe pushing players who are not really available like Delph back today.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Tottenham 0-3 Manchester United: 'Nuno not cut slack in sour Spurs atmosphere'\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer will have known just how Nuno Espirito Santo felt as Tottenham's manager stared out blankly at thousands of vacated seats towards the end of a humiliating home defeat.\nIt was only six days ago that Manchester United manager Solskjaer was suffering similar emotions as Liverpool inflicted a 5-0 humiliation at Old Trafford.\nAfter a week in which every aspect of Solskjaer's work and record was pored over with forensic zeal, he survived to inflict pain on Nuno and Spurs with a 3-0 victory that lifts the clouds gathering over the Norwegian, at least temporarily.\nThere was, however, one significant difference between last weekend and this. And after a Spurs display that was dreadful and deadly dull, that key difference signalled an ominous warning for Nuno.\nManchester United's fans, no matter how they were feeling as their team went down without a fight against Liverpool, did not turn publicly on their manager. Yes, many left before the end, but the dissent aimed at Solskjaer personally was hardly mutinous.\nNuno was cut no such slack in a hostile, sour atmosphere at Spurs.\nFollow reaction to Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester United, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Spurs content\nVisit the United page\nHe does not enjoy Solskjaer's status as a club playing legend and the fact he was way down Spurs chairman Daniel Levy's list of potential successors after Jose Mourinho's sacking in April means he is fighting an uphill struggle for credibility.\nIt is not Nuno's fault that it was almost a case of last man standing when he was finally appointed after a botched managerial search. But it meant there was no shield of sympathy when the simmering mood of mutiny at Spurs boiled over here.\nThe environment was, at best, subdued as United held a 1-0 lead courtesy of Cristiano Ronaldo's superb volley. It turned to hot fury when Nuno replaced the popular Lucas Moura with Steven Bergwijn after 54 minutes.\nIt was the tipping point.\nBoos swept around this vast arena, not aimed at Bergwijn but at a manager who has singularly failed to win the hearts and minds of Spurs fans - and whose cause is not helped by a counter-punching style of football completely at odds with the bold statements made as the club sought their new manager.\nSpurs did not muster a shot on target here and barely looked likely to.\nIn fact, they have not had a shot on target in their past two hours and 16 minutes of football, since Harry Kane's effort in the 44th minute against West Ham. This was the first time Spurs have failed to have a shot on target in a Premier League home game since December 2013 against Liverpool.\nAnd that does not misrepresent just how lacking in ideas Spurs were.\nUnited turned the screw and the environment worsened, Kane getting it in the neck after another listless performance was capped by a run and tame cross straight at a Manchester United defender.\nIt did not sound here as if Kane was \"one of their own\" - the cry from Spurs fans in his pomp. He looked and played like a man struggling for inspiration after a summer move to Manchester City did not materialise, although it should be stressed the paucity of service did him no favours.\nNuno's only respite came in the last four minutes when Spurs fans turned their ire on Levy after Marcus Rashford made it 3-0, a goal which resulted in a swift emptying of thousands of seats and demands for the chairman to leave the club.\nIt is Nuno who is under pressure but this is not all down to him. Not by any stretch. The criticism of Levy is merited.\nSpurs have lost their way since they reached the Champions League final against Liverpool in 2019. They may have lost 2-0 in Madrid but they felt on the up under Mauricio Pochettino,\nInstead, the much-loved Pochettino did not get the backing he wanted, grew dissatisfied and was sacked six months later. Jose Mourinho was an expensive, quick-fix vanity appointment that failed, so Spurs find themselves where they are now.\nSpurs are currently a middling club with not the slightest chance of mounting a title challenge. We are only 10 games into the league season but there are no positive signs of progress.\nAs for Solskjaer, what a contrast this was to last Sunday as he walked over to take the acclaim from United's followers after a highly efficient display, decorated by the stardust applied by Ronaldo, who not only scored but created a superb second for Edinson Cavani.\nThis does not mean Solskjaer's troubles are over but his delight was understandable. This was a game he could not afford to lose.\nRonaldo came to his manager's aid with world-class quality and United's move to a three-man defence, with Raphael Varane back alongside captain Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof, easily repelled Spurs' attacking efforts, such as they were.\nSolskjaer had gone to the cliff edge with the defeat by Liverpool but pulled back from the brink in style here. Now he must continue the good work away to Atalanta in the Champions League, then against Manchester City in the derby at Old Trafford.\nHe was in desperate straits and needed to pull out a big result when nothing else would do.\nIt is a good knack for any manager to have - Nuno must hope he can discover a similar habit in very troubled times.\nOur coverage of Tottenham Hotspur is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Spurs - go straight to all the best content"

It amazes me, it wasn't going towards the goal - and Ashley Young was covering.

We know we cannot drop much points to be close to them but against the big six we performed well.\"\nThe result took City above Liverpool into second in the Premier League while fifth-placed United are nine points behind leaders Chelsea.\n'Something simply has to change at Man Utd'\nMan Utd 'not at same level' - Fernandes\nGo straight to all the best Manchester United content\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nMan City in a different class\nThis was a magnificent performance of class and control from City, who dominated from first whistle to last to illustrate just how superior they are to United.\nThey had already threatened before Bailly's own goal and the only question was how they failed to rack up a handful of goals before half-time as they laid siege to keeper De Gea at the Stretford End.\nThe Spaniard singlehandedly (and occasionally with his feet) kept City out as they cut through United's defence at will, aided and abetted by some truly awful defending from Maguire, Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka in particular.\nIt was almost as if De Gea could take no more when he seemed caught by surprise by Silva's second for City but, understandably, he may have been expecting Maguire and Shaw to deal with that situation before it became fatal.\nCity had outstanding performers everywhere. Cancelo's crosses, freed from any defensive pressure, were a deadly weapon and the imperious Rodri ran the show at the heart of the action, winning and giving possession before spraying around the passes that allowed Pep Guardiola's side to show their quality in the wide positions.\nIt was the perfect response, in the Premier League context at least, to the shock home loss to Crystal Palace last week and again if Guardiola has a complaint - and this arch-perfectionist is never satisfied - it might be that City did not rub United's nose in it to the same extent as Liverpool did here two weeks ago.\nIn the final reckoning, however, this was a powerful show of domination from the Premier League champions on the territory of their derby rivals.\nMore misery for Solskjaer\nThis may not have been quite as bad for United as the crushing defeat against Liverpool but it was another abject example of just how far away they are from being serious Premier League challengers.\nUnited were on the back foot from the first whistle, penned in and carrying all the hallmarks of a lower league club hoping for the best against an elite side in the FA Cup.\nIt was painful viewing as City strutted around imperiously, dominating possession and gratefully accepting the ball when United presented it back to them, as they did with grim regularity.\nRonaldo had one chance which was saved but it was a rare incursion into City territory and, as against Liverpool, frustration eventually got the better of him and he was shown a yellow card for a foul on De Bruyne in the dying seconds.\nAll the time, Solskjaer - as he did against Liverpool - looked powerless to alter affairs on his very occasional appearances in his technical area, during which he was taunted mercilessly by City's fans.\nThe introduction of Jadon Sancho at half-time had little impact with the tone already set and you almost felt sympathy for the forgotten man Donny van de Beek when he was sent on with 10 minutes left. It was an interesting moment as the Netherlands midfielder received huge applause from the Stretford End as he warmed up and when he came on - although some of this may have been from Fred being put out of his misery.\nUnited head into the international break with only one win in six Premier League games, four points from a possible 18, and more questions over the beleaguered figure of Solskjaer.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Palace's celebrations were cut short by an offside flag, but VAR deemed that Zaha was being played onside by two Wolves defenders and awarded the goal.\nThe hosts got the rub of the green when Wolves' penalty was overturned but an equaliser would have been harsh on Palace, who were much improved in the second half and deservedly doubled their tally through Gallagher's deflected strike.\nRemarkably, the Eagles have now scored 13 of their 15 league goals this season in the second half of games.\nThe result also means that Palace have remained unbeaten in their opening six home fixtures of a league campaign for the first time since 1993-94, when they were in the second tier.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

While there were question marks over how much Alisson was impeded for the opener the Brazil goalkeeper should really have done better with West Ham's second, but he allowed Fornals' shot to creep past him.\nThat prompted a period in which West Ham broke their lines on a number of occasions as Liverpool struggled to cope with the hosts' excellent counter-attacking.\nIt was a disappointing result for the Reds, but they will at least accept they were beaten by genuine rivals for the top four.\nWest Ham genuine contenders home and abroad\nDavid Moyes has worked wonders since returning to West Ham two years ago, turning them from relegation candidates to a side that now has aspirations of playing Champions League football.\nBut this was arguably one of the most eye-catching results of the former Manchester United boss' tenure.\nOnce again they displayed the characteristics they have been renowned for under the Scot - a disciplined defence coupled with a devastatingly quick and precise attack on the counter.\nLiverpool have proven a bogey side for West Ham in recent years, winning eight and drawing two of their 10 encounters prior to Sunday's game, but rarely did the Reds look like extending that unbeaten run in this game.\nIt is now four league wins in a row for Moyes' side and with the Hammers also in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and the knockout phases of the Europa League, fans can rightly dream of more magical moments to come this season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

However, Bernardo Silva took advantage of awful defending from Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw to steal in on another Cancelo cross at the far post.\nUnited's only response was a volley from the subdued Cristiano Ronaldo. The second half was merely a formality as City moved down the gears but still looked more likely to score in what was another chastening afternoon for Manchester United and their manager.\nCity boss Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport he wanted to give a \"massive compliment to the players\" because \"they are the real artists for the way we played\".\nGuardiola said City's approach was shaped by United's ability on the counter-attack, adding: \"If you don't finish the attack you will be attacked much, much quicker and that is where they are so good. That is why we needed a game with a thousand million passes. We need a game like with the ball in the fridge, keep it there.\n\"Right now Chelsea are unstoppable. We know we cannot drop much points to be close to them but against the big six we performed well.\"\nThe result took City above Liverpool into second in the Premier League while fifth-placed United are nine points behind leaders Chelsea.\n'Something simply has to change at Man Utd'\nMan Utd 'not at same level' - Fernandes\nGo straight to all the best Manchester United content\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nMan City in a different class\nThis was a magnificent performance of class and control from City, who dominated from first whistle to last to illustrate just how superior they are to United.\nThey had already threatened before Bailly's own goal and the only question was how they failed to rack up a handful of goals before half-time as they laid siege to keeper De Gea at the Stretford End.\nThe Spaniard singlehandedly (and occasionally with his feet) kept City out as they cut through United's defence at will, aided and abetted by some truly awful defending from Maguire, Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka in particular.\nIt was almost as if De Gea could take no more when he seemed caught by surprise by Silva's second for City but, understandably, he may have been expecting Maguire and Shaw to deal with that situation before it became fatal.\nCity had outstanding performers everywhere. Cancelo's crosses, freed from any defensive pressure, were a deadly weapon and the imperious Rodri ran the show at the heart of the action, winning and giving possession before spraying around the passes that allowed Pep Guardiola's side to show their quality in the wide positions.\nIt was the perfect response, in the Premier League context at least, to the shock home loss to Crystal Palace last week and again if Guardiola has a complaint - and this arch-perfectionist is never satisfied - it might be that City did not rub United's nose in it to the same extent as Liverpool did here two weeks ago.\nIn the final reckoning, however, this was a powerful show of domination from the Premier League champions on the territory of their derby rivals.\nMore misery for Solskjaer\nThis may not have been quite as bad for United as the crushing defeat against Liverpool but it was another abject example of just how far away they are from being serious Premier League challengers.\nUnited were on the back foot from the first whistle, penned in and carrying all the hallmarks of a lower league club hoping for the best against an elite side in the FA Cup.\nIt was painful viewing as City strutted around imperiously, dominating possession and gratefully accepting the ball when United presented it back to them, as they did with grim regularity.\nRonaldo had one chance which was saved but it was a rare incursion into City territory and, as against Liverpool, frustration eventually got the better of him and he was shown a yellow card for a foul on De Bruyne in the dying seconds.\nAll the time, Solskjaer - as he did against Liverpool - looked powerless to alter affairs on his very occasional appearances in his technical area, during which he was taunted mercilessly by City's fans.\nThe introduction of Jadon Sancho at half-time had little impact with the tone already set and you almost felt sympathy for the forgotten man Donny van de Beek when he was sent on with 10 minutes left. It was an interesting moment as the Netherlands midfielder received huge applause from the Stretford End as he warmed up and when he came on - although some of this may have been from Fred being put out of his misery.\nUnited head into the international break with only one win in six Premier League games, four points from a possible 18, and more questions over the beleaguered figure of Solskjaer.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Bringing on Ryan Fraser certainly made the difference for us and he played his part in the third goal for Maxi.\"\nAs Howe settles into his new role a month after the club's Saudi Arabian-backed takeover, he will have watched a game which offered him encouragement while also illustrating the size of his task to keep Newcastle in the top flight.\nWith the home fans singing Howe's name from the first minute, Newcastle took an early lead when Jamaal Lascelles nodded in from Matt Ritchie's corner, but it only lasted 75 seconds as Ivan Toney took advantage of Karl Darlow's mistake to fire in low against his former employers and celebrate in front of the Gallowgate End.\nThe 25-year-old, who was sold by Newcastle to Peterborough in 2018 after several loan spells, was twice close to scoring again, being caught slightly offside and then having a goal-bound shot cleared off the line by Fabian Schar.\nThomas Frank's impressive team took the lead after 31 minutes when Sergi Canos' back-post cross found fellow wing-back Rico Henry, who stabbed a shot past Darlow.\nEight minutes later, Joelinton brought the scores level again, curling into the bottom corner following the lively Saint-Maximin's cross, for his first goal of the season.\nIn a thrilling encounter, Brentford went ahead once more when substitute Frank Onyeka's shot was deflected past Darlow via Lascelles, but Saint-Maximin's finish rescued a point.\nTindall praised the his side's attack and physical presence, but was \"disappointed\" to concede three goals in what he described as an \"incredible\" atmosphere at a sold-out St James' Park.\nThe result meant Newcastle continued their worst start to a league campaign, and are yet to win in the Premier League this season, while Brentford ended a run of four top-flight defeats.\nSigns of Howe influence but plenty to resolve\nThere has been no shortage of drama at Newcastle since October's takeover, but following Howe's appointment 12 days ago, it appeared as if things had settled down over the international break - with the new head coach using the time to influence the squad with his methods.\nThat was until Friday night, where a positive coronavirus test meant he would watch his first game from his hotel room, and relay messages to his staff via the phone.\nAs starts to Premier League managerial reigns go, it was unique, but perhaps fitting for a club, where entertainment and gallows humour is never in short supply.\nTindall, who was Howe's assistant at Bournemouth, said the manager was \"gutted\" he could not attend the game and said it was \"certainly a first for Eddie and myself\" to work in that way.\nBut he said: \"Hopefully we will have him back for the Arsenal game [next Saturday], we are just waiting on the doctors for that so it's a little bit out of our hands.\"\nWhat Howe will have seen from his room is symptomatic of Newcastle's season, which has left them mired in the bottom three.\nHe had promised to offer the type of football that would \"do the fans and city proud\", and as Saint-Maximin dazzled up front, Jonjo Shelvey sprayed passes to both wings and Joelinton and Joe Willock provided trickery in midfield, the supporters revelled in the type of \"front-foot\" football they felt was missing under former manager Steve Bruce.\nThere appeared to be an increase in intensity to Newcastle's play too as Tindall encouraged the hosts to press in Brentford's half.\nBut as the impressive Toney and Bryan Mbeumo cut through the hosts' defence, it showed that there is plenty to do to make Newcastle a more solid outfit.\nToney was a menace at times, testing a back three of Lascelles, Ciaran Clark and Schar in Newcastle's 3-4-3 set-up, and he could have had a hat-trick.\nThat changed in the second half as Newcastle tried to tighten up.\nBut once they went behind to Lascelles' own goal, a double substitution, which altered the formation and proved crucial.\nSean Longstaff replaced Willock in midfield, while Fraser came on and provided a delightful cross from Newcastle's best move to set up Saint-Maximin.\nWith the crowd in raptures, there was still time to get a winner but after another quick break, and the goal at his mercy, Joelinton slipped to massive groans all around St James' Park.\nIt was a sign that although the Howe revolution has begun, there are many issues still to resolve as the team remains five points from safety.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Palace's celebrations were cut short by an offside flag, but VAR deemed that Zaha was being played onside by two Wolves defenders and awarded the goal.\nThe hosts got the rub of the green when Wolves' penalty was overturned but an equaliser would have been harsh on Palace, who were much improved in the second half and deservedly doubled their tally through Gallagher's deflected strike.\nRemarkably, the Eagles have now scored 13 of their 15 league goals this season in the second half of games.\nThe result also means that Palace have remained unbeaten in their opening six home fixtures of a league campaign for the first time since 1993-94, when they were in the second tier.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I'm really happy to be back.\"\nWolves dominated proceedings after a slow start and created numerous opportunities to take a first-half lead - the best of which fell to Jimenez, who dragged a tame effort wide with only West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to beat.\nKurt Zouma had the ball in the net for the Hammers, but the centre-back's header was disallowed for a foul on Romain Saiss.\nMichail Antonio and Jarrod Bowen blazed over in the second half as the visitors sought a route back into the game, but David Moyes will be bitterly disappointed with his team's below-par performance.\nMax Kilman should have ended West Ham's hopes of salvaging a point when he fired Rayan Ait-Nouri's free-kick delivery over the crossbar with three minutes remaining.\n\"We knew we were beaten in the last match [at Crystal Palace], so this was a good opportunity today to bounce back,\" added Jimenez.\n\"We're fighting as a team and as a family.

Kane, fresh from scoring seven goals in two international appearances, never looked like adding to his solitary Premier League goal as he again struggled to make an impact at club level.\nLeeds, in contrast, looked like the team of last season as they attacked with pace and precision and belied their injury problems to put in a dominant performance.\nBut the game turned on its head in the second half as whatever Conte said at the interval worked wonders.\nSpurs came out looking considerably more alert, quicker to every ball, more direct with their attacks and could have won by a bigger margin but for the woodwork. Son also sent a dipping strike just wide in the closing stages.\nThere is still work to be done, most notably finding out how to get the best out of Kane.\nBut the manner in which Conte was able to rectify what was so wrong in the opening period bodes well for Tottenham fans' hopes of success under the Italian, who is yet to taste defeat since replacing Nuno Espirito Santo.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

I'm really happy to be back.\"\nWolves dominated proceedings after a slow start and created numerous opportunities to take a first-half lead - the best of which fell to Jimenez, who dragged a tame effort wide with only West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to beat.\nKurt Zouma had the ball in the net for the Hammers, but the centre-back's header was disallowed for a foul on Romain Saiss.\nMichail Antonio and Jarrod Bowen blazed over in the second half as the visitors sought a route back into the game, but David Moyes will be bitterly disappointed with his team's below-par performance.\nMax Kilman should have ended West Ham's hopes of salvaging a point when he fired Rayan Ait-Nouri's free-kick delivery over the crossbar with three minutes remaining.\n\"We knew we were beaten in the last match [at Crystal Palace], so this was a good opportunity today to bounce back,\" added Jimenez.\n\"We're fighting as a team and as a family.

Ruben Neves tested Fabianski from distance before Nelson Semedo shot wide of the near post from Ait-Nouri's cross.\nJimenez should have put the hosts into the lead moments later after latching onto an exquisite Neves pass, but failed to hit the target after attempting to dink the ball over the onrushing Fabianski.\nThe pattern of play continued early in the second half, with the lively Podence forcing the Hammers' goalkeeper into two terrific saves - one from a low shot towards the far corner and another from a looping strike from the edge of the penalty area.\nJimenez eventually got the goal the hosts' enterprising play deserved as Wolves recorded three successive top-flight victories for the first time since 1980.\nIt all started so well for West Ham, who were crisp in possession in the early stages and tested Jose Sa through Jarrod Bowen and Tomas Soucek.\nThey faded as the game wore on, though, managing just one further shot on target - from captain Declan Rice in the second half.\nA fifth successive victory would have equalled the club's top-flight record, but it was not to be.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Bringing on Ryan Fraser certainly made the difference for us and he played his part in the third goal for Maxi.\"\nAs Howe settles into his new role a month after the club's Saudi Arabian-backed takeover, he will have watched a game which offered him encouragement while also illustrating the size of his task to keep Newcastle in the top flight.\nWith the home fans singing Howe's name from the first minute, Newcastle took an early lead when Jamaal Lascelles nodded in from Matt Ritchie's corner, but it only lasted 75 seconds as Ivan Toney took advantage of Karl Darlow's mistake to fire in low against his former employers and celebrate in front of the Gallowgate End.\nThe 25-year-old, who was sold by Newcastle to Peterborough in 2018 after several loan spells, was twice close to scoring again, being caught slightly offside and then having a goal-bound shot cleared off the line by Fabian Schar.\nThomas Frank's impressive team took the lead after 31 minutes when Sergi Canos' back-post cross found fellow wing-back Rico Henry, who stabbed a shot past Darlow.\nEight minutes later, Joelinton brought the scores level again, curling into the bottom corner following the lively Saint-Maximin's cross, for his first goal of the season.\nIn a thrilling encounter, Brentford went ahead once more when substitute Frank Onyeka's shot was deflected past Darlow via Lascelles, but Saint-Maximin's finish rescued a point.\nTindall praised the his side's attack and physical presence, but was \"disappointed\" to concede three goals in what he described as an \"incredible\" atmosphere at a sold-out St James' Park.\nThe result meant Newcastle continued their worst start to a league campaign, and are yet to win in the Premier League this season, while Brentford ended a run of four top-flight defeats.\nSigns of Howe influence but plenty to resolve\nThere has been no shortage of drama at Newcastle since October's takeover, but following Howe's appointment 12 days ago, it appeared as if things had settled down over the international break - with the new head coach using the time to influence the squad with his methods.\nThat was until Friday night, where a positive coronavirus test meant he would watch his first game from his hotel room, and relay messages to his staff via the phone.\nAs starts to Premier League managerial reigns go, it was unique, but perhaps fitting for a club, where entertainment and gallows humour is never in short supply.\nTindall, who was Howe's assistant at Bournemouth, said the manager was \"gutted\" he could not attend the game and said it was \"certainly a first for Eddie and myself\" to work in that way.\nBut he said: \"Hopefully we will have him back for the Arsenal game [next Saturday], we are just waiting on the doctors for that so it's a little bit out of our hands.\"\nWhat Howe will have seen from his room is symptomatic of Newcastle's season, which has left them mired in the bottom three.\nHe had promised to offer the type of football that would \"do the fans and city proud\", and as Saint-Maximin dazzled up front, Jonjo Shelvey sprayed passes to both wings and Joelinton and Joe Willock provided trickery in midfield, the supporters revelled in the type of \"front-foot\" football they felt was missing under former manager Steve Bruce.\nThere appeared to be an increase in intensity to Newcastle's play too as Tindall encouraged the hosts to press in Brentford's half.\nBut as the impressive Toney and Bryan Mbeumo cut through the hosts' defence, it showed that there is plenty to do to make Newcastle a more solid outfit.\nToney was a menace at times, testing a back three of Lascelles, Ciaran Clark and Schar in Newcastle's 3-4-3 set-up, and he could have had a hat-trick.\nThat changed in the second half as Newcastle tried to tighten up.\nBut once they went behind to Lascelles' own goal, a double substitution, which altered the formation and proved crucial.\nSean Longstaff replaced Willock in midfield, while Fraser came on and provided a delightful cross from Newcastle's best move to set up Saint-Maximin.\nWith the crowd in raptures, there was still time to get a winner but after another quick break, and the goal at his mercy, Joelinton slipped to massive groans all around St James' Park.\nIt was a sign that although the Howe revolution has begun, there are many issues still to resolve as the team remains five points from safety.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

The Gunners have won their past 10 home games against Newcastle in all competitions, and have never lost a Premier League home game against the team bottom of the table.\nThe side he put out looked attacking on paper but on the actual pitch they sat in and tried to frustrate Arsenal.\nShelvey was their main threat when they went forward with five of their nine efforts on goal, including a fine strike tipped on to the crossbar by Ramsdale.\nCallum Wilson was isolated up front, with only 13 touches, but he felt he should have had a penalty when he was nudged over by Tavares in the box - moments before Arsenal's second goal.\nThe Gunners' quality eventually showed when Saka finished off a nice passing move, which also involved himself, Emile Smith Rowe and Tavares.\nMartinelli's glorious volley past the onrushing Martin Dubravka - making his first Newcastle appearance of the season - wrapped things up.\nArsenal are back to winning ways now, after last weekend's 4-0 thrashing by Liverpool ended a 10-game unbeaten run.\nThey should have won by more, with 23 shots - including Aubameyang hitting the upright after Dubravka had parried Smith Rowe's header when a goal looked inevitable.\nNext up for Newcastle are two huge ones - home games against Norwich City and Burnley, the other two teams in the relegation zone.

It was a fantastic away performance and I'm really pleased to have six points from six so far.\n\"We have Man City to come so we can enjoy tonight but we will go to work as soon as we can tomorrow to prepare the team. We are pleased with the start we have made but there is a lot of work still to do.\"\nThe travelling Villa support were treated to a confident performance in bitterly cold conditions in south London, with McGinn, Ezri Konsa and Tyrone Mings all having chances for the visitors in the first half after Targett's opener.\nPalace should have opened the scoring through Wilfried Zaha after the forward jinked past his marker on the edge of the Villa box but his left-footed effort was dragged just wide of the far post.\nThe Eagles saw a great opportunity to equalise after the break denied when referee Michael Salisbury blew his whistle for a foul by Marvelous Nakamba on Zaha and missed the advantage Christian Benteke and Conor Gallagher had created.\nVilla almost played out the final quarter of the game with 10 men as substitute Douglas Luiz was shown a red card for a challenge on Cheikhou Kouyate, but it was downgraded to a yellow after Salisbury consulted the pitchside monitor.\nThe win moves Villa up into 11th place, level on points with Palace in 10th. Gerrard faces Pep Guardiola next when champions Manchester City travel to Villa Park on Wednesday.\n\"We know it will be tough,\" added Gerrard. \"But we will give it our best shot. We are pleased with the start we have made but there is a lot of work still to do.\"\nA new battle for Gerrard and Vieira\nGerrard said before the match that former Arsenal captain Vieira was one of his toughest opponents during his days marshalling the Liverpool midfield, and their first competitive meeting as managers was keenly anticipated.\nVilla had only won once on the road this season - a 1-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September - and although it was a nervy end to proceedings for Gerrard, his team were worthy winners.\nFull-backs Matty Cash and Targett, plus Scotland midfielder McGinn, provided a constant threat for Villa, along with 36-year-old Young, who is now the oldest player to assist in consecutive Premier League games for the club.\nFor Vieira, one of his key tasks is surely to improve his side's ability to defend set pieces. Targett's first-half strike was the 10th goal Palace have conceded from either a corner or a free-kick out of the 19 they have shipped in the league this season.\nThe Eagles will have to regroup now and hope Saturday's defeat was just a temporary blip on what has otherwise been an excellent home record this season.\nGo to the Crystal Palace page\nGo to the Aston Villa page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Leicester 4-2 Watford: Jamie Vardy scores two on Claudio Ranieri's return to the King Power Stadium\nJamie Vardy scored twice as Leicester beat Watford in a hugely entertaining match to ruin Claudio Ranieri's return to the King Power Stadium.\nRanieri was in the opponents' dugout for the first time since guiding the Foxes to the 2015-16 Premier League title and received a great reception from the home fans.\nBut in a chaotic and thrilling game played in blizzard conditions, his current side played a big part in their own downfall.\nThere looked to be no danger when Jonny Evans launched a free-kick forward, but William Ekong ducked under the ball and that allowed James Maddison to fire the 16th-minute opener past Daniel Bachmann.\nWatford were gifted a chance to equalise in the 30th minute when Wilfred Ndidi clumsily chopped down Emmanuel Dennis and Joshua King fired his penalty into the top corner.\nBut the hosts retook the lead four minutes later as Vardy produced a fine lifted finish following Maddison's pass and the pair combined again just before half-time with Vardy glancing in a header from Maddison's corner.\nDennis then dispossessed Timothy Castagne and calmly finished to make it 3-2 in the 61st minute, but the hosts quickly restored their two-goal advantage after Harvey Barnes set up Ademola Lookman for a close-range tap-in.\nThe victory takes Leicester up from 13th into 10th, while Watford remain 16th, four points above the relegation zone.\nLeicester v Watford as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nThe love for Ranieri was relentless, but where next for Leicester and Rodgers?\nGo to the Leicester page\nGo to the Watford page\nWatford's defensive frailties on display in tough conditions\nLeicester's win was only their fifth of the season from 13 Premier League matches. Manager Brendan Rodgers will have been delighted with his side's effort in tough, sometimes farcical conditions, in their second game in four days after a 3-1 win over Legia Warsaw on Thursday.\nThe match began on a clear afternoon, but after 20 minutes the snow came and did not stop for the rest of the encounter.\nBurnley's home clash with Tottenham was postponed earlier on Sunday because of heavy snow at Turf Moor and in the second half at Leicester, the game was paused as ground staff used brooms to clear the snow just to see the lines of the penalty area.\nThat left seven minutes of injury time, but the game was able to be completed, although Vardy later claimed Bachmann was \"trying to get it called off with the ref\".\n\"You have to stay professional and we did that. Pitches have undersoil heating and we weren't worried,\" added Vardy.\nAsked if he feared the game would get called off, Rodgers said: \"I was hoping not. The last game I was involved in like that was Swansea away at Ipswich, at Portman Road.\n\"But the ground staff cleared the areas the referee wanted and the ball was moving fine. The snow lightened off and we were able to see the game through.\"\nWatford had beaten Manchester United 4-1 last time out - a result that cost United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer his job. But they looked fragile in defence throughout against the Foxes. Vardy nearly had a first-half hat-trick, but was denied by the legs of Bachmann.\nRanieri has now had six games in charge of Watford and lost four of them. His side have not had a clean sheet all season and need to dramatically improve at the back and do so quickly.\nEuropean champions Chelsea visit Vicarage Road on Wednesday and reigning Premier League title holders Manchester City follow on Saturday.\nIf Watford defend like they did at the King Power Stadium, they could well be on the end of two thrashings.\nReaction to Ranieri 'warms your heart', says Rodgers\nIt will have been an afternoon of mixed emotions for Ranieri as Leicester fans sang songs praising him throughout the match - a tribute to the club's achievements five years ago when they won the league after being written off as 5,000-1 no-hopers at the start of the campaign.\n\"The reception was fantastic,\" said the 70-year-old Italian. \"I want to say thank you to all the Leicester fans, but also the Watford fans as well. They came here on this difficult day and I hope they're proud of us.\n\"We fought until the end and tried to do our best. It was Christmas Day conditions but that's OK. We lost because we made mistakes.\"\nOn the reaction Ranieri received, Rodgers added: \"It was brilliant. Big applause to our supporters. It warms your heart when you see that reaction and I'm delighted for him.\n\"The Leicester City fans gave him a deserving, great ovation.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He was introduced in the 64th minute with United leading 1-0, but had minimal impact and was straight off down the tunnel when the final whistle sounded.\nAsked if Rangnick had played a part in Ronaldo being on the bench, Carrick replied: \"No, that's not the case.\"\nUnited at least showed the determination and resilience that had so often been glaringly absent in the dying embers of Solskjaer's reign although there was very little attacking intent or quality apart from the great composure shown by Sancho for his second successive goal.\nIt will do him the world of good as he seeks to establish himself following his \u00a373m summer move from Borussia Dortmund.\nAs for Carrick, if this is his final game in charge before Rangnick comes to Old Trafford, he can be well satisfied with his brief stint at the helm, winning against Villarreal in the Champions League and getting a share of the spoils here against a Chelsea side who have looked increasingly formidable in recent weeks.\nIt is a platform of sorts for Rangnick to begin his work and United will hope to continue their recovery against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Thursday.\nOn the equalising goal, Carrick said: \"I don't think it was a penalty at all. They have had a lot of shots. David had two saves, which we knew before the game he would have to make one or two. Other than that I have felt quite comfortable in the game.\n\"To come away disappointed and to feel like you have left something out there is a positive.\"\nChelsea suffer frustration\nRudiger summed up Chelsea's disappointment as he slumped to the turf at the final whistle knowing he could have been the match-winner.\nThe German defender saw a thunderous shot touched on to the crossbar by De Gea in the first half, but the big opportunity came with virtually the last kick of the game. He was unmarked at the far post to meet Christian Pulisic's cross but took the instant volley and lashed his finish high over the top.\nManager Thomas Tuchel was equally agonised as he will know Chelsea did not take advantage of their overwhelming domination in parts of a game where they had 24 attempts on goal compared to United's three.\nChelsea's work was too hurried as they chased the winner although they were also frustrated by a United defence without suspended captain Harry Maguire.\nTimo Werner is still too wayward, sending a very presentable chance well wide in the second half, but at least they have Romelu Lukaku fit again and Pulisic looked a lively threat when he came on.\nThis, in some ways, resembled many of Chelsea's performances last season when they were superior, but never made the most of that advantage. Tuchel will certainly feel his side let United off the hook.\nThe Blues remain top but in what looks like it will be a tight title race between Tuchel's side, Manchester City and Liverpool, they will regard this as two points dropped.\n\"It's hard to imagine this as a match where you can lose or drop points, because we were the better team who set the rhythm and intensity.\n\"We're disappointed but we have no regrets, this can happen in football. I just told the team I'm happy with our performance and the way we played.\"\nGo to the Chelsea page\nGo to the Manchester United page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

That is the seventh Premier League goal that right-back James has been involved in in six starts this season.\nThey ended with 25 shots - their most in a Premier League home game without winning since August 2015 - but only four on target.\nThe European champions had a host of chances in both halves - with headers from Andreas Christensen, Antonio Rudiger, Jorginho, Havertz and Silva all going close.\nRoss Barkley, on his first league start for the club since 2019-20, was wayward with several shots.\nBurnley created very little until the 70th minute when they started to improve and, while Vydra's goal was not inevitable, it was not completely against the run of play.\nThe visitors could have won it too.

Manager Brendan Rodgers will have been delighted with his side's effort in tough, sometimes farcical conditions, in their second game in four days after a 3-1 win over Legia Warsaw on Thursday.\nThe match began on a clear afternoon, but after 20 minutes the snow came and did not stop for the rest of the encounter.\nBurnley's home clash with Tottenham was postponed earlier on Sunday because of heavy snow at Turf Moor and in the second half at Leicester, the game was paused as ground staff used brooms to clear the snow just to see the lines of the penalty area.\nThat left seven minutes of injury time, but the game was able to be completed, although Vardy later claimed Bachmann was \"trying to get it called off with the ref\".\n\"You have to stay professional and we did that. Pitches have undersoil heating and we weren't worried,\" added Vardy.\nAsked if he feared the game would get called off, Rodgers said: \"I was hoping not. The last game I was involved in like that was Swansea away at Ipswich, at Portman Road.\n\"But the ground staff cleared the areas the referee wanted and the ball was moving fine. The snow lightened off and we were able to see the game through.\"\nWatford had beaten Manchester United 4-1 last time out - a result that cost United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer his job. But they looked fragile in defence throughout against the Foxes. Vardy nearly had a first-half hat-trick, but was denied by the legs of Bachmann.\nRanieri has now had six games in charge of Watford and lost four of them. His side have not had a clean sheet all season and need to dramatically improve at the back and do so quickly.\nEuropean champions Chelsea visit Vicarage Road on Wednesday and reigning Premier League title holders Manchester City follow on Saturday.\nIf Watford defend like they did at the King Power Stadium, they could well be on the end of two thrashings.\nReaction to Ranieri 'warms your heart', says Rodgers\nIt will have been an afternoon of mixed emotions for Ranieri as Leicester fans sang songs praising him throughout the match - a tribute to the club's achievements five years ago when they won the league after being written off as 5,000-1 no-hopers at the start of the campaign.\n\"The reception was fantastic,\" said the 70-year-old Italian. \"I want to say thank you to all the Leicester fans, but also the Watford fans as well. They came here on this difficult day and I hope they're proud of us.\n\"We fought until the end and tried to do our best. It was Christmas Day conditions but that's OK. We lost because we made mistakes.\"\nOn the reaction Ranieri received, Rodgers added: \"It was brilliant. Big applause to our supporters. It warms your heart when you see that reaction and I'm delighted for him.\n\"The Leicester City fans gave him a deserving, great ovation.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They did an incredible job so we could play the game today.\"\nJackson's reward was an effective home display, even if it was some way short of show-stopper.\nWest Ham keeper Lukasz Fabianski denied Gundogan a second and Bernardo Silva's excellent chipped finish counted for nothing thanks to an offside flag.\nAnd Ederson, whose only significant save was turning away a fierce Declan Rice shot, was denied his personal milestone with a goal out of virtually nothing from Lanzini, when West Ham had no time to even think about an equaliser.\nBelow-par Hammers\nDespite losing 22 out of 25 previous away games against the defending champions, West Ham can rarely have gone into such a fixture in more optimistic mood.\nYet they never really got going.\nFabianski was booed by the City fans inside the opening 10 minutes for apparent time-wasting and the experienced Poland goalkeeper was soon earning the wrath of David Moyes for a fluffed clearance that would have resulted in a goal had Mahrez not been offside when Raheem Sterling's block landed at his feet.\nArthur Masuaku's selection ahead of Jarrod Bowen was supposed to provide more protection down the West Ham left flank but City's array of attacking talent just found spaces elsewhere.\nBen Johnson's goalline clearance to deny Mahrez, who also hit the outside of the post, before half-time was followed up by Aaron Cresswell bravely sliding in to turn Gabriel Jesus' goal-bound effort away for a corner. It was effectively Cresswell's final contribution as he continued into the post with such force he needed to be replaced by Vladimir Coufal after hurting his back.\nIt made no fundamental difference to the flow of the game and West Ham will be thankful for the failings of others that their position in the table remains as it was.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City's next Premier League game is at Aston Villa on Wednesday, 1 December (20:15 GMT).

He ran into the box and forced a save from Sanchez's legs - and then the keeper denied him with a diving save in the bottom corner.\nMarch replaced Lamptey and had two good chances, including his effort off the post.\nBrighton have only scored 12 goals this season - fewer than two of the teams in the relegation zone and the same as 17th-placed Leeds.\nJurgen Locadia came on for his first Premier League appearance since August 2019, and teenage Ecuador winger Jeremy Sarmiento made his league debut - but neither could help them find the breakthrough.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We didn't deserve to lose but the reality is the team is giving everything on the pitch and you can see the togetherness of the players,\" he added.\n\"It is a question of confidence, missing players - but you could see what we were capable of doing at the beginning of the season. When we have everyone available, I am confident we will do it again.\"\nToney's spot-kick ignited a largely uneventful start to a meeting between the two clubs rooted to the bottom of the Premier League's form table.\nSalomon Rondon was denied an immediate equaliser by Bees goalkeeper Alvaro Fernandez at close range and Abdoulaye Doucoure produced a superb tackle to thwart Vitaly Janelt at the other end moments later.\nEverton dominated following half-time but Rondon - replacing the suspended Richarlison in attack - saw an attempt blocked and Iwobi shot straight at Fernandez as the visitors chased an equaliser to no avail.\nBrentford climbed to 12th in the table after surviving intense late pressure at the Brentford Community Stadium, above Benitez's side who slip to 14th.\nReaction to Brentford v Everton, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nBrentford pile pressure on Benitez\nBoth sides had managed to claim only a single point from their past five league matches - two fewer than any other side in the division.\nWinless in their last 35 away league games when trailing at the break, a stuttering Everton side were unable to launch a second-half comeback and consequently find themselves on their longest winless run since April 2016.\nTheir dip in form has been stark. Benitez's men were fifth in the table after taking 13 points from their opening six fixtures, however they have earned just two more since then.\nDoucoure's intervention to halt Janelt's progress gave his side hope for the second half, but in the continued absence of star striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin they were unable to make their superiority count after the interval.\nThey registered 14 shots and more than twice as many touches in their opponent's box than Brentford, but Iwobi's tame effort wasted the visitors' best chance.\nThe defeat - their fifth in six league games - will further increase the pressure on former Liverpool manager Benitez ahead of a meeting with their bitter Merseyside rivals on Wednesday.\nThe table paints a far rosier picture for Brentford following this result. Having put an end to a four-game losing run with a draw at Newcastle last time out, the promoted side sit seven points clear of the relegation places heading into December.\nIt is the Bees home form in particular which will have concerned manager Thomas Frank before kick-off, with just four points to show from six games since promotion.\nYet, despite failing to win in front of their own supporters since beating Arsenal on the opening day, Toney oozed confidence as he stepped up for his penalty - the 25-year-old taking two steps and maintaining eye contact with Pickford as he rolled the ball into the bottom left corner.\nIt proved to be Toney's only touch in the Everton box all afternoon, but it was enough to put the game beyond a toothless opposition.\n\"We hadn't won in five. We deserved more in those games and everyone knows it but to get the win you need to defend well and we got back to top-level defending today,\" Frank said.\nHe added: \"Finally we got the home win we have been searching for and fighting very hard to get. It was a fantastic atmosphere and especially at the end, so for many reasons it was a vital win.\"\nGo to the Brentford page\nGo to the Everton page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It was a fantastic away performance and I'm really pleased to have six points from six so far.\n\"We have Man City to come so we can enjoy tonight but we will go to work as soon as we can tomorrow to prepare the team. We are pleased with the start we have made but there is a lot of work still to do.\"\nThe travelling Villa support were treated to a confident performance in bitterly cold conditions in south London, with McGinn, Ezri Konsa and Tyrone Mings all having chances for the visitors in the first half after Targett's opener.\nPalace should have opened the scoring through Wilfried Zaha after the forward jinked past his marker on the edge of the Villa box but his left-footed effort was dragged just wide of the far post.\nThe Eagles saw a great opportunity to equalise after the break denied when referee Michael Salisbury blew his whistle for a foul by Marvelous Nakamba on Zaha and missed the advantage Christian Benteke and Conor Gallagher had created.\nVilla almost played out the final quarter of the game with 10 men as substitute Douglas Luiz was shown a red card for a challenge on Cheikhou Kouyate, but it was downgraded to a yellow after Salisbury consulted the pitchside monitor.\nThe win moves Villa up into 11th place, level on points with Palace in 10th.

Targett's first-half strike was the 10th goal Palace have conceded from either a corner or a free-kick out of the 19 they have shipped in the league this season.\nThe Eagles will have to regroup now and hope Saturday's defeat was just a temporary blip on what has otherwise been an excellent home record this season.\nGo to the Crystal Palace page\nGo to the Aston Villa page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Kane, fresh from scoring seven goals in two international appearances, never looked like adding to his solitary Premier League goal as he again struggled to make an impact at club level.\nLeeds, in contrast, looked like the team of last season as they attacked with pace and precision and belied their injury problems to put in a dominant performance.\nBut the game turned on its head in the second half as whatever Conte said at the interval worked wonders.\nSpurs came out looking considerably more alert, quicker to every ball, more direct with their attacks and could have won by a bigger margin but for the woodwork. Son also sent a dipping strike just wide in the closing stages.\nThere is still work to be done, most notably finding out how to get the best out of Kane.\nBut the manner in which Conte was able to rectify what was so wrong in the opening period bodes well for Tottenham fans' hopes of success under the Italian, who is yet to taste defeat since replacing Nuno Espirito Santo.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Brentford 1-0 Everton: Rafael Benitez 'understands fan frustration' as Ivan Toney's penalty ends Bees' winless run\nEverton manager Rafael Benitez says he understands the frustrations of supporters but believes his side can rediscover their early season form after defeat at Brentford left them winless in seven games.\nIvan Toney coolly slotted in a 24th-minute penalty, awarded after Andros Townsend's high challenge on Frank Onyeka was reviewed by referee Darren England on the pitch-side monitor, as Brentford ended their own five-match wait for a Premier League win.\n\"We can understand the frustration of the fans but we are also frustrated,\" Benitez said.\n\"Today you cannot complain about the effort and intensity the players put in. We didn't deserve to lose but the reality is the team is giving everything on the pitch and you can see the togetherness of the players,\" he added.\n\"It is a question of confidence, missing players - but you could see what we were capable of doing at the beginning of the season. When we have everyone available, I am confident we will do it again.\"\nToney's spot-kick ignited a largely uneventful start to a meeting between the two clubs rooted to the bottom of the Premier League's form table.\nSalomon Rondon was denied an immediate equaliser by Bees goalkeeper Alvaro Fernandez at close range and Abdoulaye Doucoure produced a superb tackle to thwart Vitaly Janelt at the other end moments later.\nEverton dominated following half-time but Rondon - replacing the suspended Richarlison in attack - saw an attempt blocked and Iwobi shot straight at Fernandez as the visitors chased an equaliser to no avail.\nBrentford climbed to 12th in the table after surviving intense late pressure at the Brentford Community Stadium, above Benitez's side who slip to 14th.\nReaction to Brentford v Everton, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nBrentford pile pressure on Benitez\nBoth sides had managed to claim only a single point from their past five league matches - two fewer than any other side in the division.\nWinless in their last 35 away league games when trailing at the break, a stuttering Everton side were unable to launch a second-half comeback and consequently find themselves on their longest winless run since April 2016.\nTheir dip in form has been stark. Benitez's men were fifth in the table after taking 13 points from their opening six fixtures, however they have earned just two more since then.\nDoucoure's intervention to halt Janelt's progress gave his side hope for the second half, but in the continued absence of star striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin they were unable to make their superiority count after the interval.\nThey registered 14 shots and more than twice as many touches in their opponent's box than Brentford, but Iwobi's tame effort wasted the visitors' best chance.\nThe defeat - their fifth in six league games - will further increase the pressure on former Liverpool manager Benitez ahead of a meeting with their bitter Merseyside rivals on Wednesday.\nThe table paints a far rosier picture for Brentford following this result. Having put an end to a four-game losing run with a draw at Newcastle last time out, the promoted side sit seven points clear of the relegation places heading into December.\nIt is the Bees home form in particular which will have concerned manager Thomas Frank before kick-off, with just four points to show from six games since promotion.\nYet, despite failing to win in front of their own supporters since beating Arsenal on the opening day, Toney oozed confidence as he stepped up for his penalty - the 25-year-old taking two steps and maintaining eye contact with Pickford as he rolled the ball into the bottom left corner.\nIt proved to be Toney's only touch in the Everton box all afternoon, but it was enough to put the game beyond a toothless opposition.\n\"We hadn't won in five. We deserved more in those games and everyone knows it but to get the win you need to defend well and we got back to top-level defending today,\" Frank said.\nHe added: \"Finally we got the home win we have been searching for and fighting very hard to get. It was a fantastic atmosphere and especially at the end, so for many reasons it was a vital win.\"\nGo to the Brentford page\nGo to the Everton page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He was introduced in the 64th minute with United leading 1-0, but had minimal impact and was straight off down the tunnel when the final whistle sounded.\nAsked if Rangnick had played a part in Ronaldo being on the bench, Carrick replied: \"No, that's not the case.\"\nUnited at least showed the determination and resilience that had so often been glaringly absent in the dying embers of Solskjaer's reign although there was very little attacking intent or quality apart from the great composure shown by Sancho for his second successive goal.\nIt will do him the world of good as he seeks to establish himself following his \u00a373m summer move from Borussia Dortmund.\nAs for Carrick, if this is his final game in charge before Rangnick comes to Old Trafford, he can be well satisfied with his brief stint at the helm, winning against Villarreal in the Champions League and getting a share of the spoils here against a Chelsea side who have looked increasingly formidable in recent weeks.\nIt is a platform of sorts for Rangnick to begin his work and United will hope to continue their recovery against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Thursday.\nOn the equalising goal, Carrick said: \"I don't think it was a penalty at all. They have had a lot of shots. David had two saves, which we knew before the game he would have to make one or two. Other than that I have felt quite comfortable in the game.\n\"To come away disappointed and to feel like you have left something out there is a positive.\"\nChelsea suffer frustration\nRudiger summed up Chelsea's disappointment as he slumped to the turf at the final whistle knowing he could have been the match-winner.\nThe German defender saw a thunderous shot touched on to the crossbar by De Gea in the first half, but the big opportunity came with virtually the last kick of the game. He was unmarked at the far post to meet Christian Pulisic's cross but took the instant volley and lashed his finish high over the top.\nManager Thomas Tuchel was equally agonised as he will know Chelsea did not take advantage of their overwhelming domination in parts of a game where they had 24 attempts on goal compared to United's three.\nChelsea's work was too hurried as they chased the winner although they were also frustrated by a United defence without suspended captain Harry Maguire.\nTimo Werner is still too wayward, sending a very presentable chance well wide in the second half, but at least they have Romelu Lukaku fit again and Pulisic looked a lively threat when he came on.\nThis, in some ways, resembled many of Chelsea's performances last season when they were superior, but never made the most of that advantage. Tuchel will certainly feel his side let United off the hook.\nThe Blues remain top but in what looks like it will be a tight title race between Tuchel's side, Manchester City and Liverpool, they will regard this as two points dropped.\n\"It's hard to imagine this as a match where you can lose or drop points, because we were the better team who set the rhythm and intensity.\n\"We're disappointed but we have no regrets, this can happen in football. I just told the team I'm happy with our performance and the way we played.\"\nGo to the Chelsea page\nGo to the Manchester United page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He felt something,\" said Gunners boss Mikel Arteta of Saka as they await news of what is wrong with the England international.\nBoth sides had hit the woodwork in an otherwise uninspiring first half.\nJonjo Shelvey's long-range drive was tipped on to the bar by the diving Aaron Ramsdale - and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hit a sitter off the post from six yards out.\nArsenal remain fifth in the Premier League, while Newcastle are five points adrift of safety with just over a third of the season gone.\nFollow live text coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nGo to the Arsenal page\nGo to the Newcastle page\nA lot to do for Howe and Newcastle\nNewcastle are on their longest ever winless run from the start of a league season. Only one side has ever stayed up in the Premier League after failing to win their opening 13 games - Derby County in 2000-01.\nThe Magpies know the further adrift they are on 1 January, when they have a chance to spend some of their Saudi owners' money, the harder it will be to attract quality players.\nIt is unlikely though that Howe will have identified Emirates Stadium as a place to pick up points. The Gunners have won their past 10 home games against Newcastle in all competitions, and have never lost a Premier League home game against the team bottom of the table.\nThe side he put out looked attacking on paper but on the actual pitch they sat in and tried to frustrate Arsenal.\nShelvey was their main threat when they went forward with five of their nine efforts on goal, including a fine strike tipped on to the crossbar by Ramsdale.\nCallum Wilson was isolated up front, with only 13 touches, but he felt he should have had a penalty when he was nudged over by Tavares in the box - moments before Arsenal's second goal.\nThe Gunners' quality eventually showed when Saka finished off a nice passing move, which also involved himself, Emile Smith Rowe and Tavares.\nMartinelli's glorious volley past the onrushing Martin Dubravka - making his first Newcastle appearance of the season - wrapped things up.\nArsenal are back to winning ways now, after last weekend's 4-0 thrashing by Liverpool ended a 10-game unbeaten run.\nThey should have won by more, with 23 shots - including Aubameyang hitting the upright after Dubravka had parried Smith Rowe's header when a goal looked inevitable.\nNext up for Newcastle are two huge ones - home games against Norwich City and Burnley, the other two teams in the relegation zone. They will have to face the Canaries without captain Jamaal Lascelles and Matt Ritchie, who both picked up their fifth bookings of the season at the Emirates.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We were down to 10 but still scored and the performance deserved that.\n\"It's a fantastic point. The trick is to turn possession into goal chances and it's not easy to do against West Ham as Soucek and Rice defend the box very well.\n\"You have no divine right to win matches, you have to earn them. But we're picking up points and you have to keep going on. We want to win and will try again on Saturday.\"\nAfter West Ham's goal, the visitors had chances to equalise but Jakub Moder's shot was saved by Lukasz Fabianski before Dunk headed just wide from the resulting corner.\nImmediately after the restart Solly March's deflected effort was tipped over by Fabianski with the Poland international also saving another Dunk header.\nBut they got their goal when a cross from substitute Tariq Lamptey found Maupay and his excellent finish secured a point.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We never found the right attitude. We were very lucky to escape with the win.\"\nWatford had twice gone close to taking the lead when England midfielder Mount broke the deadlock with a first-time finish at the end of a lovely move involving Marcos Alonso and Kai Havertz.\nThe Hornets equalised after Ruben Loftus-Cheek lost possession and Moussa Sissoko set up Dennis, who scored with a shot that deflected off Antonio Rudiger.\nBut having scored his side's first, Mount then set up the winner by providing the pass for Ziyech to fire past Daniel Bachmann.\nChelsea's fifth straight Premier League away win kept them one point clear at the top.\nThe game was halted for 32 minutes with the score 0-0 while a fan, who had suffered cardiac arrest in the stands, was stabilised.\nReaction from Watford v Chelsea, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League games\nMedical emergency in the crowd stops Watford-Chelsea game\nChelsea dig deep to stay top\nIn a bruising contest which featured seven yellow cards, Chelsea were a long way from their best.\nBut Tuchel's side found a way to secure a hard-fought three points and maintain their advantage at the summit.\nEven before the game was stopped in the 12th minute, Watford had twice gone close.

He's seen the close proximity he was in and didn't feel it was unnatural.\n\"If it takes 90 seconds to [overturn] a clear and obvious error - it's pathetic for me.\"\nThe Magpies had endured a nightmare start when Ciaran Clark was shown a ninth-minute red card for a professional foul on Norwich striker Pukki.\nHowe's team responded well to Clark's dismissal - although Wilson's spot-kick proved to be their only shot on target throughout the 90 minutes\nNorwich's best opportunity prior to Pukki's equaliser fell to Josh Sargent, whose far-post shot was blocked by former Canaries player Jamal Lewis.\nPierre Lees-Melou almost capitalised on a Fabian Schar error in second-half stoppage time, but the Frenchman was denied by Martin Dubravka.\nNewcastle remain rooted to the bottom of the table, while Norwich climb above Burnley into 18th place - three points from safety.\n\"I'm fortunate that I came into a club that had won their last game [under previous manager Daniel Farke],\" added Smith. \"We've managed to go three unbeaten since then, but we feel that we've lost two points here today.\"\nPlenty of effort, but no much-needed victory for Magpies\nNewcastle are just the fourth team to fail to win any of their first 14 games of a Premier League season - and none of the previous three managed to avoid relegation.\nHowe described Tuesday's game - his first in the Newcastle home dugout - as a \"memorable moment\" in his programme notes, but the early stages proved to be memorable for all the wrong reasons as Clark was given his marching orders.\nThe centre-back's clearance was blocked by Pukki, who was then hauled to the floor by Clark with only goalkeeper Dubravka to beat.\nHowe promptly replaced Ryan Fraser with defender Fernandez and switched to a 4-3-2 formation, which proved reasonably effective as the hosts continued to venture forward but failed to test Krul as Jonjo Shelvey, Joelinton and Wilson all blazed over the crossbar.\nNorwich, for their part, struggled to make their numerical advantage count, with Sargent's close-range effort their only clear-cut opening of the first half.\nUnderstandably perhaps, Newcastle began to tire as the second period wore on. Wilson's 61st-minute penalty put them within touching distance of a much-needed first win of the campaign, only for Pukki to salvage a precious point for the visitors.\nDubravka flapped at a 79th-minute cross into the Magpies penalty area and Dimitris Giannoulis picked out Pukki, who directed a fabulous strike into the top corner to silence the home crowd.\nWhile Howe will be pleased with his team's defensive resilience after Clark's dismissal, Saturday's game at home to second-bottom Burnley now takes on even greater importance.\nThe rest of December looks ominous for Newcastle, with games against Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Everton looming large on the horizon.\nThe Canaries, meanwhile, have collected eight points from a possible 12 in the league - their longest unbeaten run in the top flight since February 2013.\nRelive Tuesday's Premier League action\nGo to the Newcastle United page\nGo to the Norwich City page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

By the end, they must have wondered how they ended up with nothing.\nDe Gea saved superbly twice from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and also denied substitute Bukayo Saka, who also had a goalbound effort deflected wide.\nRangnick's issues\nRangnick is scheduled to speak to the media for the first time on Friday morning before he gets to work before his first game in charge against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\nHe did not need to watch this to know some of the issues that need resolving.\nFred was not great in that opening period, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof were unconvincing in central defence, and Ronaldo and Fernandes do not press in the modern manner.\nWhat Ronaldo, in particular, does is score goals. Lots of them.\nThere is the Czech football association's claim that Josef Bican scored 821 career goals. And there are further claims - also unverified - that Brazilian pair Pele and Romario both scored more than 1,000. But officially, no-one has ever scored as many as Ronaldo.\nThe notes Rangnick made throughout the game probably didn't include a simple 'I need to get the best out of my new number seven' but if he can, within a team structure that performs to the sum of its parts rather than the mess it turned into during the final two months of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's reign, United's results will improve.\nA banner was unfurled in Solskjaer's honour before kick-off but it is one of his coaches who has stabilised the situation. Now Rangnick follows David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer in trying to make United winners again.\nManchester United are next in action against Crystal Palace on Sunday, 5 December (14:00 GMT).

He got us the three points,\" said Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa.\n\"We haven't taken many points so far this season. Every game we see as an opportunity to balance this out.\n\"The opposing team had developed their play very well and it was very difficult to keep that clean sheet.\"\nLeeds v Crystal Palace as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nGo to the Leeds United page\nGo to the Crystal Palace page\nFrantic until the end\nIt was a dramatic finish to a match that was frantic throughout, played in wet and windy conditions at a packed and passionate Elland Road.\nIn injury time, Leeds had a corner from the left which was headed goalwards by captain Liam Cooper.\nGuehi also jumped but had his arm in front of his body and illegally blocked the ball, with the spot-kick eventually being given.\nRaphinha, who had been one of the best players on the pitch, with a wide range of brilliant long-range passes, showed great composure as he skipped in the air before sending his penalty into the corner amid jubilant scenes.\nPalace would have gone seventh with a win and manager Patrick Vieira was left wondering how they failed to pick up any points.\n\"I really believe we were the better team,\" said Vieira. \"It happened on the other side a couple of games ago and we have to deal with it.\n\"We're a little bit disappointed, we should create more chances and didn't make the right decisions.\n\"We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves, we just have to analyse how we create chances and how we can improve our last pass in the final 30 yards.\n\"We had the best chances in the final 10-15 minutes and didn't take it, so you leave the door open. It's important to stick together and work even harder. We showed some positives.\"\nBenteke was the main culprit for the Eagles as it looked easier to score when Tyrick Mitchell's cross found the Belgium striker unmarked, quite central and only a few yards out, but he could only send his header wide.\nPalace also thought they should have had a first-half penalty when Jordan Ayew went down under a challenge from Pascal Struijk, but Friend waved away Palace's appeals.\nRaphinha's penalty spared the blushes of team-mate Rodrigo, who should have done much better than shoot harmlessly wide when eight yards out and unmarked.\nRaphinha also had an effort deflected over from the edge of the penalty area, with England midfielder Kalvin Phillips firing just wide as well.\nPhillips had been replaced at half-time in Leeds' 0-0 draw against Brighton on Saturday, but played the full 90 minutes against Palace, with Phillips later playing down reports of a bust-up between him and Bielsa.\nWith Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate watching on, Phillips produced a superb 30-yard pass that released Raphinha, before it was played to Adam Forshaw, who shot low narrowly off target.\nBut Leeds' misses did not prove costly as Raphinha held his nerve to earn his side the three points and ease their relegation fears.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

He's seen the close proximity he was in and didn't feel it was unnatural.\n\"If it takes 90 seconds to [overturn] a clear and obvious error - it's pathetic for me.\"\nThe Magpies had endured a nightmare start when Ciaran Clark was shown a ninth-minute red card for a professional foul on Norwich striker Pukki.\nHowe's team responded well to Clark's dismissal - although Wilson's spot-kick proved to be their only shot on target throughout the 90 minutes\nNorwich's best opportunity prior to Pukki's equaliser fell to Josh Sargent, whose far-post shot was blocked by former Canaries player Jamal Lewis.\nPierre Lees-Melou almost capitalised on a Fabian Schar error in second-half stoppage time, but the Frenchman was denied by Martin Dubravka.\nNewcastle remain rooted to the bottom of the table, while Norwich climb above Burnley into 18th place - three points from safety.\n\"I'm fortunate that I came into a club that had won their last game [under previous manager Daniel Farke],\" added Smith. \"We've managed to go three unbeaten since then, but we feel that we've lost two points here today.\"\nPlenty of effort, but no much-needed victory for Magpies\nNewcastle are just the fourth team to fail to win any of their first 14 games of a Premier League season - and none of the previous three managed to avoid relegation.\nHowe described Tuesday's game - his first in the Newcastle home dugout - as a \"memorable moment\" in his programme notes, but the early stages proved to be memorable for all the wrong reasons as Clark was given his marching orders.\nThe centre-back's clearance was blocked by Pukki, who was then hauled to the floor by Clark with only goalkeeper Dubravka to beat.\nHowe promptly replaced Ryan Fraser with defender Fernandez and switched to a 4-3-2 formation, which proved reasonably effective as the hosts continued to venture forward but failed to test Krul as Jonjo Shelvey, Joelinton and Wilson all blazed over the crossbar.\nNorwich, for their part, struggled to make their numerical advantage count, with Sargent's close-range effort their only clear-cut opening of the first half.\nUnderstandably perhaps, Newcastle began to tire as the second period wore on. Wilson's 61st-minute penalty put them within touching distance of a much-needed first win of the campaign, only for Pukki to salvage a precious point for the visitors.\nDubravka flapped at a 79th-minute cross into the Magpies penalty area and Dimitris Giannoulis picked out Pukki, who directed a fabulous strike into the top corner to silence the home crowd.\nWhile Howe will be pleased with his team's defensive resilience after Clark's dismissal, Saturday's game at home to second-bottom Burnley now takes on even greater importance.\nThe rest of December looks ominous for Newcastle, with games against Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Everton looming large on the horizon.\nThe Canaries, meanwhile, have collected eight points from a possible 12 in the league - their longest unbeaten run in the top flight since February 2013.\nRelive Tuesday's Premier League action\nGo to the Newcastle United page\nGo to the Norwich City page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

He got us the three points,\" said Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa.\n\"We haven't taken many points so far this season. Every game we see as an opportunity to balance this out.\n\"The opposing team had developed their play very well and it was very difficult to keep that clean sheet.\"\nLeeds v Crystal Palace as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nGo to the Leeds United page\nGo to the Crystal Palace page\nFrantic until the end\nIt was a dramatic finish to a match that was frantic throughout, played in wet and windy conditions at a packed and passionate Elland Road.\nIn injury time, Leeds had a corner from the left which was headed goalwards by captain Liam Cooper.\nGuehi also jumped but had his arm in front of his body and illegally blocked the ball, with the spot-kick eventually being given.\nRaphinha, who had been one of the best players on the pitch, with a wide range of brilliant long-range passes, showed great composure as he skipped in the air before sending his penalty into the corner amid jubilant scenes.\nPalace would have gone seventh with a win and manager Patrick Vieira was left wondering how they failed to pick up any points.\n\"I really believe we were the better team,\" said Vieira. \"It happened on the other side a couple of games ago and we have to deal with it.\n\"We're a little bit disappointed, we should create more chances and didn't make the right decisions.\n\"We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves, we just have to analyse how we create chances and how we can improve our last pass in the final 30 yards.\n\"We had the best chances in the final 10-15 minutes and didn't take it, so you leave the door open. It's important to stick together and work even harder. We showed some positives.\"\nBenteke was the main culprit for the Eagles as it looked easier to score when Tyrick Mitchell's cross found the Belgium striker unmarked, quite central and only a few yards out, but he could only send his header wide.\nPalace also thought they should have had a first-half penalty when Jordan Ayew went down under a challenge from Pascal Struijk, but Friend waved away Palace's appeals.\nRaphinha's penalty spared the blushes of team-mate Rodrigo, who should have done much better than shoot harmlessly wide when eight yards out and unmarked.\nRaphinha also had an effort deflected over from the edge of the penalty area, with England midfielder Kalvin Phillips firing just wide as well.\nPhillips had been replaced at half-time in Leeds' 0-0 draw against Brighton on Saturday, but played the full 90 minutes against Palace, with Phillips later playing down reports of a bust-up between him and Bielsa.\nWith Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate watching on, Phillips produced a superb 30-yard pass that released Raphinha, before it was played to Adam Forshaw, who shot low narrowly off target.\nBut Leeds' misses did not prove costly as Raphinha held his nerve to earn his side the three points and ease their relegation fears.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

I thought a lot of people were clapping.\n\"A warm welcome back to this club. He loves this club more than any other.

By the end, they must have wondered how they ended up with nothing.\nDe Gea saved superbly twice from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and also denied substitute Bukayo Saka, who also had a goalbound effort deflected wide.\nRangnick's issues\nRangnick is scheduled to speak to the media for the first time on Friday morning before he gets to work before his first game in charge against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\nHe did not need to watch this to know some of the issues that need resolving.\nFred was not great in that opening period, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof were unconvincing in central defence, and Ronaldo and Fernandes do not press in the modern manner.\nWhat Ronaldo, in particular, does is score goals. Lots of them.\nThere is the Czech football association's claim that Josef Bican scored 821 career goals. And there are further claims - also unverified - that Brazilian pair Pele and Romario both scored more than 1,000. But officially, no-one has ever scored as many as Ronaldo.\nThe notes Rangnick made throughout the game probably didn't include a simple 'I need to get the best out of my new number seven' but if he can, within a team structure that performs to the sum of its parts rather than the mess it turned into during the final two months of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's reign, United's results will improve.\nA banner was unfurled in Solskjaer's honour before kick-off but it is one of his coaches who has stabilised the situation. Now Rangnick follows David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer in trying to make United winners again.\nManchester United are next in action against Crystal Palace on Sunday, 5 December (14:00 GMT). Arsenal play at Everton on Monday, 6 December (20:00 GMT).\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Moments after missing a great opportunity Canos fired the Bees ahead, combining with Bryan Mbeumo before lashing home.\nBamford struck deep into added time, scrambling home a corner from close range to save Leeds' blushes. The 28-year-old said he believed his chance would come right until the very end.\n\"I felt rusty as hell, but it was nice to be out there,\" he said. \"I always felt when I came on that I was going to get one chance. It didn't come for ages and ages and then [Adam] Forshaw said I was going to get one chance and so it happened.\"\nFollow live text of Leeds United v Brentford, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best Leeds content\nVisit our Brentford page\nLeeds' blushes saved despite second-half collapse\nAs well as both Cooper and Phillips to injury, Leeds lost their composure in a difficult second-half spell that almost proved costly.\nAt the break it looked like there would only be one winner, with Brentford having lost striker Ivan Toney to a positive Covid-19 test prior to kick-off and lacking presence without him.\nBut after Ayling's header something stirred inside Thomas Frank's men. They levelled and then took the lead in a flash but squandered other chances in the interim. Leeds didn't know what had hit them.\nRaphinha's impact dwindled as Bamford was summoned, and after a late victory over Crystal Palace in midweek there was another twist when the England forward popped up at the death after 11 weeks out.\nMarcelo Bielsa lauded Bamford but he was left frustrated that Leeds hadn't managed to win after such a positive start.\n\"Bamford scored a goalscorer's goal and his opportunism stood out. You can't teach that,\" he said. \"We deserved a point, perhaps we should have won, given the amount of time we dominated the play and in terms of how much danger we caused compared to the opponent.\"\nMeanwhile, Brentford boss Thomas Frank believed his side deserved more out of the game.\n\"I guess it is the round of cruel moments for different teams: Liverpool's late winner, Brighton's late equaliser and now Leeds' late equaliser. We know it can happen in football but I can't praise the players enough. They gave everything,\" he said.\n\"They had two chances in the game and scored two goals. There are positives to take from this game; we have big ambitions but we can't run away.

The situation can sap the confidence out of the team.\n\"The only threat against us in the first half was when the ball went dead. In the second half the corner we conceded from was hugely disappointing. It's an area we spoke about before the game.\n\"We don't get tight enough on the marking and he's able to squeeze it in the far post. These are undoing some really good parts of our game.

They last went on such a run between December 1982 and February 1983.\nStill, Brighton remain in the top half of the table in ninth place, while a share of the spoils leaves Saints 14th and winless in four games.\nFollow reaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best Southampton content\nVisit our Brighton page\nThe Seagulls' run of results prompted fans to jeer the team in last week's goalless draw with Leeds United. That left manager Graham Potter \"a little bit perplexed\", but the latest performance from his injury-hit side drew nothing but cheers.\nFour of the five changes made from the midweek draw with West Ham were through injury, with captain Lewis Dunk and the influential Adam Lallana among the players sidelined for the trip to St Mary's.\nSouthampton had an early double chance with Broja and Che Adams denied by Robert Sanchez.\nMoments later, Broja was foiled for a second time from a tight angle, while Valentino Livramento and Lyanco both had efforts blocked in quick succession as the hosts piled on the pressure.\nBrighton rarely threatened before the break, but Enock Mwepu and Trossard did test Alex McCarthy.\nTwo excellent touches from Broja proved to be a defining moment in the 29th minute after a weak clearance from goalkeeper Sanchez was quickly worked back up the field.\nHis first was to meet a flicked header from Nathan Redmond and cut the ball back, and under his body, which left Shane Duffy helplessly sliding past on his backside in defence. The second was a composed finish to put his side ahead.\nIt was rare clinical moment between two south coast rivals.\nAs two of the league's lowest-scoring teams - only Wolves and second-bottom Norwich had scored fewer than the 13 they had both netted before Saturday's game - the lack of clear-cut chances epitomised their recent struggles.\nAlbanian frontman Broja was guilty of sending a good second-half chance wide, while Maupay curled an effort off target and was denied by McCarthy before grabbing his second crucial equaliser in a week.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The England midfielder, who delivered another impressive showing, has now been directly involved in eight goals in his past six league games.\nChelsea started the second period on the front foot too, but West Ham remained a threat on the counter and struck when Bowen was given time and space to get his shot away despite Thiago and Andreas Christensen being in close proximity.\nThere appeared little danger when full-back Masuaku - a first-half substitute for the injured Ben Johnson - collected the ball near the sideline, but he somehow managed to beat Mendy with a powerful drive to inflict a first away league defeat of the season on Chelsea.\nHammers tactics pay dividends\nThe win ended West Ham's run of three league games without a win since their magnificent 3-2 victory over Liverpool before the international break.\nOperating with a back three of Craig Dawson, Moussa Diop and Kurt Zouma, West Ham soaked up Chelsea's pressure before attempting to strike on the counter.\nThe impressive Bowen almost made it 3-2 moments before Masuaku's winner when he failed to steer Michail Antonio's low cross on target.\nWest Ham are now only six points behind Chelsea in the table and four ahead of Arsenal, who face Everton at Goodison Park on Monday.\nReaction to West Ham v Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nVisit our Chelsea page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Moments after missing a great opportunity Canos fired the Bees ahead, combining with Bryan Mbeumo before lashing home.\nBamford struck deep into added time, scrambling home a corner from close range to save Leeds' blushes.

They levelled and then took the lead in a flash but squandered other chances in the interim. Leeds didn't know what had hit them.\nRaphinha's impact dwindled as Bamford was summoned, and after a late victory over Crystal Palace in midweek there was another twist when the England forward popped up at the death after 11 weeks out.\nMarcelo Bielsa lauded Bamford but he was left frustrated that Leeds hadn't managed to win after such a positive start.\n\"Bamford scored a goalscorer's goal and his opportunism stood out. You can't teach that,\" he said. \"We deserved a point, perhaps we should have won, given the amount of time we dominated the play and in terms of how much danger we caused compared to the opponent.\"\nMeanwhile, Brentford boss Thomas Frank believed his side deserved more out of the game.\n\"I guess it is the round of cruel moments for different teams: Liverpool's late winner, Brighton's late equaliser and now Leeds' late equaliser. We know it can happen in football but I can't praise the players enough. They gave everything,\" he said.\n\"They had two chances in the game and scored two goals.

Hard work.\"\nBrazil forward Moura opened the scoring by finding the top corner from 25 yards following a move in which he beat two Norwich players and played a one-two with Son Heung-min.\nNorwich should already have been ahead but Teemu Pukki fired straight at Hugo Lloris before Moura scored his first Premier League goal since February.\nDavinson Sanchez doubled the lead, the Colombian defender lashing home as Norwich failed to deal with a corner before Son made it 3-0 with a neat finish.\nAt 1-0, Harry Kane missed a chance to score his first top-flight goal under Conte when he spotted Tim Krul off his line, but the England captain's lob over the keeper fell wide of the target.\nThe Canaries are three points from safety after their first defeat under Dean Smith.\nThey missed a golden chance to equalise when 20-year-old Republic of Ireland forward Adam Idah fired wide from close range before Sanchez made it 2-0.\nReaction from Tottenham v Norwich, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Tottenham content\nVisit our Norwich page\nSpurs moving forward under Conte\nTottenham were drifting in eighth spot in the table when they sacked Nuno Espirito Santo last month, but are now two points off a Champions League spot with a game in hand after leapfrogging north London rivals Arsenal.\nYet they are far from the dominant force Conte wants them to be, and remain a work in progress.\nSpurs were fortunate not to concede, particularly when the defence opened up to allow Idah a chance he failed to take.\nIt proved a key moment as Spurs struck twice in the space of 10 minutes to take the game away from the Canaries.\nWhile Conte knows there is plenty of hard work ahead, at least Spurs are building momentum and rediscovering the habit of winning matches.\nWhile Kane's lack of goals remains a talking point, Son is flourishing under Conte after finishing the game with a goal and an assist, while Conte is looking for Moura to add to his first Premier League goal since 28 February.\n\"I think he scored an amazing goal but he has the quality to score more goals - and he has to score more goals in the rest of the season,\" added Conte.\nNorwich punished for bad misses\nThis was Norwich boss Smith's second defeat at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this season after overseeing Aston Villa's 2-1 loss at the venue before being sacked last month.\nSmith will be encouraged by the number of opportunities his side created but will also wonder how they did not score as Pukki, Idah and substitute Josh Sargent wasted good chances.\nHaving dropped to the bottom without playing on Saturday after Newcastle's win over Burnley, the Canaries now have back-to-back home games.\nSmith will spend the week with his players on the training pitch working on their finishing and defending before Manchester United's visit next Saturday.\n\"The performance is a step in the right direction, the result aside,\" said the Norwich boss. \"We have to learn how to defend better, especially from set-pieces.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

These are the things we must improve. We need to keep clean sheets. With just the one training session, I was really impressed.

At all other times we were trying to keep them away from our goal.\"\nPalace, who were looking to win for a third successive season at Old Trafford, came close to taking the lead themselves when Jordan Ayew turned James Tomkins header across the face of goal and narrowly wide of the far post.\nThe victory meant that Rangnick emulated three of United's other four new managers since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 by winning his first match at the helm, with Louis van Gaal the only man to fail.\nFollow live text and radio commentary of Manchester United v Crystal Palace, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best United content\nVisit our Palace page\nFred the enigma turns match-winner\nFred was one of the major focuses for criticism during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's reign as manager, which ended last month.\nAs Michael Carrick pointed out during his three-match spell as United's caretaker manager, the midfielder is a mainstay of a Brazil team that dominated World Cup qualification in South America.\nYet he has never given any indication, through either goalscoring or chance creation, that he is worthy of the \u00a347m United paid for him.\nHe is industrious, though. And, judging by his little dance after the celebrations of his goal broke up, he is not without personality, which may be helpful to Rangnick over the coming months.\nThe German has not had a full training session with his players yet but there was certainly an intensity about United's early pressing, with Cristiano Ronaldo among those doing it on a couple of occasions.\nIt did harry Palace into a couple of mistakes - but then, as happened so many times under Solskjaer, the fire went out of the hosts and they started to rely more on crosses and individual moments to cause the visitors problems.\nMarc Guehi managed to block a Ronaldo volley at close-range after the Portuguese had beaten the Palace offside trap and Tomkins headed a curling Fred shot away from danger.\nProbably the hosts' best opportunity in the opening period fell to Bruno Fernandes, who didn't hit his shot cleanly but still forced a low full-length save out of Guaita after Ronaldo had set up the chance with an elaborate header.\nUnited did not reach the same heights after the interval, although the introductions of Greenwood and Anthony Elanga at least kept them pushing forward until the decisive moment came.\n\"I had to ask my assistant coach if that was Fred's right foot,\" added Rangnick. \"I thought he could only shoot with his left. I'm happy for him.\n\"It's always easier to build on things after you're successful. We must produce further clean sheets and get better at creating chances for our attack. Overall, I was very pleased with the way we played today.\"\nAnother defeat for Palace\nPalace have now lost three Premier League games in a row for the first time under Patrick Vieira's management.\nThe Eagles are six points above the bottom three and clearly need to halt the slide before they end up in trouble.\nHaving achieved their previous victories in this stadium with 29% and 24% possession respectively, Palace actually did far better in this contest, with 39%.\nBut, other than Ayew's effort, an early Wilfried Zaha shot easily saved by David de Gea and a flurry of late set-pieces sent into the United box that were all cleared, Palace lacked conviction.\nZaha was a particular disappointment as he hardly got into the game, especially in the second-half when Cheikhou Kouyate and Conor Gallagher carried a greater threat.\n\"I'm disappointed - we gave them a tough game, we made it really difficult for them,\" manager Patrick Vieira told Match of the Day.\n\"At the end, conceding the goal, we are so disappointed. And we had the chance before [for Ayew], it is frustrating.\n\"When you get opportunities, you have to take them, and when you don't take them your are left vulnerable. I'm am disappointed for Jordan as he had a fantastic game. That is football.\n\"We need to change our mindset. How can we be more ruthless when we're in the opposition's box?

The England midfielder, who delivered another impressive showing, has now been directly involved in eight goals in his past six league games.\nChelsea started the second period on the front foot too, but West Ham remained a threat on the counter and struck when Bowen was given time and space to get his shot away despite Thiago and Andreas Christensen being in close proximity.\nThere appeared little danger when full-back Masuaku - a first-half substitute for the injured Ben Johnson - collected the ball near the sideline, but he somehow managed to beat Mendy with a powerful drive to inflict a first away league defeat of the season on Chelsea.\nHammers tactics pay dividends\nThe win ended West Ham's run of three league games without a win since their magnificent 3-2 victory over Liverpool before the international break.\nOperating with a back three of Craig Dawson, Moussa Diop and Kurt Zouma, West Ham soaked up Chelsea's pressure before attempting to strike on the counter.\nThe impressive Bowen almost made it 3-2 moments before Masuaku's winner when he failed to steer Michail Antonio's low cross on target.\nWest Ham are now only six points behind Chelsea in the table and four ahead of Arsenal, who face Everton at Goodison Park on Monday.\nReaction to West Ham v Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nVisit our Chelsea page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It took a few home truths at half-time to sort our issues out, to rejig our shape and a few other things.\n\"All you can ask of your players is to perform, we did that. I thought we were outstanding in the second half. But can we do it for a full 90 minutes without me having to get on the players' back at half-time?\"\nWhy Gerrard is heading back to Anfield on a high\nFollow reaction from Aston Villa v Leicester City, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nVisit our Leicester page\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers dropped Jamie Vardy to hand Patson Daka a first Premier League start and the Zambia striker set up Barnes to coolly slot through Konsa's legs and past Emi Martinez.\nThe advantage lasted just three minutes, Buendia craning his neck muscles to propel Matty Cash's cushioned header towards the bottom corner, with Konsa poking home to make sure.\nVilla thought they were ahead on the stroke of half-time as Kasper Schmeichel parried another Cash knockdown and Jacob Ramsey fired home but the keeper had one hand on the grounded ball and Michael Oliver correctly ruled the goal out after a check from the video assistant referee.\nIn the end, it mattered little as Konsa punished Leicester's ongoing set-piece shortcomings by nodding home John McGinn's corner to push Villa above the Foxes into 10th place.\nVilla should have won by more as Ollie Watkins and Ramsey wasted glorious chances on the break although the hosts needed a fantastic fingertip save from Martinez to thwart a Barnes header and seal the points.\nGerrard gets one over on his former boss\nRodgers was the manager who famously almost led Liverpool to an elusive top-flight title during Gerrard's playing career - and the student now has two wins out of three over the teacher after swapping Old Firm victories in the sole season their managerial stints at Celtic and Rangers overlapped.\nThat scenario looked unlikely early on at Villa Park, with the hosts frequently over-run by a frenetic Foxes start that was deservedly rewarded by Barnes' excellently-taken opener.\nBut after Villa got back on terms, the game became an end-to-end affair that they ultimately gained control of as proceedings wore on.\nLeicester still had their moments as Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall headed a great chance wide and James Maddison saw a goal-bound shot blocked by the all-action Cash, who was himself foiled by Schmeichel's legs at the other end.\nHowever, the Foxes' failings from set-plays - with 10 league goals conceded from such situations this term - again cost them as Konsa nodded in almost unchallenged.\nVilla had been fuming at half-time after Ramsey's effort was disallowed but Oliver's decision was correct as the laws of the game state the goalkeeper is deemed to be in possession if the ball is between his hands and the surface.\nThey quickly put the disappointment behind them and were on top for the majority of the second half, with only Barnes' late header and a Maddison effort that curled inches wide providing any alarms.\nLeicester, meanwhile, have won just three of their past 12 in the league and must fix the defensive woes that have seen them fail to keep a clean sheet since the opening day.\nFoxes boss Rodgers admitted: \"Our Achilles heel which has killed us is our defending of the set-piece. The situation can sap the confidence out of the team.\n\"The only threat against us in the first half was when the ball went dead. In the second half the corner we conceded from was hugely disappointing. It's an area we spoke about before the game.\n\"We don't get tight enough on the marking and he's able to squeeze it in the far post. These are undoing some really good parts of our game.

These are the things we must improve. We need to keep clean sheets. With just the one training session, I was really impressed. We did much better than expected.\n\"We always tried to be on the front foot. We were never not apart from maybe the last five minutes. At all other times we were trying to keep them away from our goal.\"\nPalace, who were looking to win for a third successive season at Old Trafford, came close to taking the lead themselves when Jordan Ayew turned James Tomkins header across the face of goal and narrowly wide of the far post.\nThe victory meant that Rangnick emulated three of United's other four new managers since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 by winning his first match at the helm, with Louis van Gaal the only man to fail.\nFollow live text and radio commentary of Manchester United v Crystal Palace, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best United content\nVisit our Palace page\nFred the enigma turns match-winner\nFred was one of the major focuses for criticism during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's reign as manager, which ended last month.\nAs Michael Carrick pointed out during his three-match spell as United's caretaker manager, the midfielder is a mainstay of a Brazil team that dominated World Cup qualification in South America.\nYet he has never given any indication, through either goalscoring or chance creation, that he is worthy of the \u00a347m United paid for him.\nHe is industrious, though. And, judging by his little dance after the celebrations of his goal broke up, he is not without personality, which may be helpful to Rangnick over the coming months.\nThe German has not had a full training session with his players yet but there was certainly an intensity about United's early pressing, with Cristiano Ronaldo among those doing it on a couple of occasions.\nIt did harry Palace into a couple of mistakes - but then, as happened so many times under Solskjaer, the fire went out of the hosts and they started to rely more on crosses and individual moments to cause the visitors problems.\nMarc Guehi managed to block a Ronaldo volley at close-range after the Portuguese had beaten the Palace offside trap and Tomkins headed a curling Fred shot away from danger.\nProbably the hosts' best opportunity in the opening period fell to Bruno Fernandes, who didn't hit his shot cleanly but still forced a low full-length save out of Guaita after Ronaldo had set up the chance with an elaborate header.\nUnited did not reach the same heights after the interval, although the introductions of Greenwood and Anthony Elanga at least kept them pushing forward until the decisive moment came.\n\"I had to ask my assistant coach if that was Fred's right foot,\" added Rangnick. \"I thought he could only shoot with his left. I'm happy for him.\n\"It's always easier to build on things after you're successful. We must produce further clean sheets and get better at creating chances for our attack. Overall, I was very pleased with the way we played today.\"\nAnother defeat for Palace\nPalace have now lost three Premier League games in a row for the first time under Patrick Vieira's management.\nThe Eagles are six points above the bottom three and clearly need to halt the slide before they end up in trouble.\nHaving achieved their previous victories in this stadium with 29% and 24% possession respectively, Palace actually did far better in this contest, with 39%.\nBut, other than Ayew's effort, an early Wilfried Zaha shot easily saved by David de Gea and a flurry of late set-pieces sent into the United box that were all cleared, Palace lacked conviction.\nZaha was a particular disappointment as he hardly got into the game, especially in the second-half when Cheikhou Kouyate and Conor Gallagher carried a greater threat.\n\"I'm disappointed - we gave them a tough game, we made it really difficult for them,\" manager Patrick Vieira told Match of the Day.\n\"At the end, conceding the goal, we are so disappointed. And we had the chance before [for Ayew], it is frustrating.\n\"When you get opportunities, you have to take them, and when you don't take them your are left vulnerable. I'm am disappointed for Jordan as he had a fantastic game. That is football.\n\"We need to change our mindset. How can we be more ruthless when we're in the opposition's box?

Villa also struggled to create any attacking impetus until it was too late, when they briefly threatened to snatch an unlikely point.\nHe will be satisfied, however, with many aspects of Villa's performance.

Referee Jon Moss had no choice other than to brandish a second yellow at Jimenez, who threw his skull cap down on a couple of occasions as he very slowly made his way off.\nThe dismissal condemned Wolves to a second-half rearguard effort in which Sa was particularly effective.\nSadly for Grealish, the same was not true of him.

They have conceded eight goals across their last three games following Wednesday's 3-3 Champions League draw with Zenit.\nAnd while Alonso atoned for his penalty error by dispossessing Stuart Dallas to assist Mount, there is much work for Tuchel to do if his side are to sustain their title challenge.\n\"We needed this win desperately, for the belief, for the mood and for the atmosphere,\" added Tuchel, who insisted neither team's players overstepped the mark as tempers frayed after the final whistle.\n\"I'm very happy with how we got it, how we played. Now we have two days off and it creates a good feeling for the boys.\"\nJorginho double denies Leeds valuable point\nA ninth-placed finish backed up with impressive, high-octane football, helped Leeds earn many admirers on their long-awaited Premier League return last season, but Marcelo Bielsa's side were yet to ignite this term.\nDespite the absence of captain Liam Cooper, midfield stalwart Kalvin Phillips and striker Patrick Bamford, the visitors hinted at a return to those levels as they made life rather uncomfortable for Chelsea after weathering early pressure.\nRaphinha twice tried to beat Mendy from a wide free-kick - the first drawing a fine save from the Chelsea goalkeeper - before James' pace forced Alonso's hand in the Chelsea penalty area.\nIt is Raphinha who appears most crucial to Leeds' chances of success over the next few games, as an increasingly stretched squad takes on Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool in the next fortnight.\nThe Brazil international has now scored seven of his side's 17 goals this term - with those contributions worth seven points. No other team-mate has managed to score more than twice in the league.\nOnce again he appeared the most likely to deliver for the visitors but, in a dramatic twist, his replacement - England youth international Gelhardt - displayed great determination to beat Thiago Silva at the near post and score his first senior goal for the club.\nHowever, Jorginho's second penalty after 94 minutes delivered a cruel blow to a Leeds side who remain six points above the relegation places in 15th.\n\"It was a game we deserved to draw and we lost it when it was finishing. That increases the disappointment,\" Bielsa told BBC Sport.\n\"It is very difficult to make a team like Chelsea play worse. It is also very difficult to attack a team like this. In a way we managed to achieve both things. We could attack and we managed to make them not play as well as they can do.\"\nGo straight to the best Chelsea content\nVisit our Leeds page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They last went on such a run between December 1982 and February 1983.\nStill, Brighton remain in the top half of the table in ninth place, while a share of the spoils leaves Saints 14th and winless in four games.\nFollow reaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best Southampton content\nVisit our Brighton page\nThe Seagulls' run of results prompted fans to jeer the team in last week's goalless draw with Leeds United. That left manager Graham Potter \"a little bit perplexed\", but the latest performance from his injury-hit side drew nothing but cheers.\nFour of the five changes made from the midweek draw with West Ham were through injury, with captain Lewis Dunk and the influential Adam Lallana among the players sidelined for the trip to St Mary's.\nSouthampton had an early double chance with Broja and Che Adams denied by Robert Sanchez.\nMoments later, Broja was foiled for a second time from a tight angle, while Valentino Livramento and Lyanco both had efforts blocked in quick succession as the hosts piled on the pressure.\nBrighton rarely threatened before the break, but Enock Mwepu and Trossard did test Alex McCarthy.\nTwo excellent touches from Broja proved to be a defining moment in the 29th minute after a weak clearance from goalkeeper Sanchez was quickly worked back up the field.\nHis first was to meet a flicked header from Nathan Redmond and cut the ball back, and under his body, which left Shane Duffy helplessly sliding past on his backside in defence. The second was a composed finish to put his side ahead.\nIt was rare clinical moment between two south coast rivals.\nAs two of the league's lowest-scoring teams - only Wolves and second-bottom Norwich had scored fewer than the 13 they had both netted before Saturday's game - the lack of clear-cut chances epitomised their recent struggles.\nAlbanian frontman Broja was guilty of sending a good second-half chance wide, while Maupay curled an effort off target and was denied by McCarthy before grabbing his second crucial equaliser in a week.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I'd rather tell them that than not. There's no point in me pussy-footing around it and not saying it. I want to win, I want us to play better and a few of them can certainly do that.\"\nMoyes' side could have fallen behind early on when Chris Wood headed over, but they began to take control and headers from Issa Diop and Said Benrahma drew fine saves from Burnley keeper Nick Pope either side of half-time.\nThe Hammers also had a strong claim for a penalty in the opening period when Dwight McNeil caught Craig Dawson in the box.\nBut Burnley, to their credit, failed to give the visitors a clear opening of any sort - and time and again well-placed defenders were on hand to make key interventions.\nJay Rodriguez was inches away from tapping in a late winner for the Clarets, who have drawn seven of their last 10 league games and sit 18th - two points adrift of Watford. Their grit is obvious, while West Ham may need to find a touch more craft in the final third if they are to maintain their position.\nReaction to Burnley v West Ham United, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League matches\nBurnley's Roberts in hospital with infection\nGo straight to all the best Burnley content\nVisit our West Ham page\nHammers frustration as Dyche calls for \"big moments\"\nHammers fans may wonder how a haul of 16 shots and 14 corners was not enough to deliver a winner but only three of their attempts found the target and Pope - who like his central defenders was excellent - dealt with them all.\nHe turned a Jarrod Bowen effort around the post in the dying minutes and West Ham were ultimately unable to equal their club record of nine wins in their first 16 games of a top-flight season.\nBut their pressure and impetus point to the unquestionable improvements they have made in recent months. Declan Rice impressed again and seemed intent on driving his side forward to a win, while Bowen, Benrahma and Manuel Lanzini buzzed around central striker Michail Antonio and linked neatly.\nMoyes' men attempted 32 crosses. Burnley left-back Charlie Taylor cleared from three yards out when Antonio looked set to tap in an Arthur Masuaku cross in the second half and Tarkowski also made a crucial intervention from a drilled Rice delivery.\nRice whistled a shot from distance over the bar late on but the draw means West Ham approach the busy Christmas period with 28 points, five more than they had after 16 games last season.\nBurnley, by contrast, are five points worse off than they were after the same number of games last season. A tally of just one victory from their 15 Premier League games is their lowest at this stage of a top-flight season since 1970-71, when they were relegated.\nSean Dyche has been calm over their position and holds faith in their Premier League experience shining through to deliver wins. His side have conceded fewer goals than Manchester United and Arsenal, but it is at the other end where they have shortcomings.\nThe Burnley boss felt his side were \"way off\" in their first-half performance and afterwards said they must \"find more big moments\" in attack.\nThey hit the target just once all day and yet could have earned a key win at the death when Rodriguez was unable to reach Taylor's fine low cross, allowing the ball to roll agonisingly across the face of goal.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Chelsea 3-2 Leeds United: Stoppage-time Jorginho penalty earns Blues dramatic victory\nJorginho's stoppage-time penalty ensured Chelsea avoided conceding further ground in the Premier League title race with a dramatic victory over Leeds United at Stamford Bridge.\nJorginho scored his second penalty after 94 minutes to decide a hugely entertaining encounter at Stamford Bridge, which featured three converted spot-kicks in all, to keep his side within two points of leaders Manchester City.\nTeenage substitute Joe Gelhardt appeared to have earned a late point for Leeds with his first touch, the 19-year-old sliding in to send Tyler Roberts' low cross past Edouard Mendy with seven minutes remaining.\nRaphinha put the visitors ahead with the game's first penalty after 28 minutes, following Marcos Alonso's mistimed challenge on Daniel James, but Mason Mount met Alonso's pass with a first-time finish to restore parity before the interval.\nThomas Tuchel's hosts were awarded their first spot-kick before the hour mark after referee Chris Kavanagh reviewed Raphinha's sliding challenge on Antonio Rudiger, allowing Jorginho to complete the turnaround.\nDespite Gelhardt's heroics, it was Jorginho who had the final say with another confident penalty after Mateusz Klich brought down Rudiger to keep third-placed Chelsea firmly in the title picture.\nChampions City beat Wolves 1-0 earlier on Saturday, while Liverpool, in second, defeated Aston Villa by the same scoreline.\nJorginho 'has sacrificed himself for many weeks', says Thomas Tuchel\nReaction to Chelsea v Leeds, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nDefensive problems continue to trouble Chelsea\nSuch is the unforgiving nature of this season's title race, defeat by West Ham was enough to cost Chelsea two places as they continue to wrestle with Manchester City and Liverpool in an already enthralling battle at the top.\nWith seven minutes remaining, it appeared the European champions would lose further ground at the beginning of a relentless Christmas schedule, yet despite letting another lead slip they remain within striking distance with this hard-fought win.\nTuchel admitted that, given the high standards expected at Stamford Bridge, his side's recent form of one win in four matches in all competitions has looked \"kind of horrible\" - adding his side had been \"trying to escape with 90% effort and intensity\" in recent matches.\nAfter a promising start, in which Mason Mount went close and Reece James attempted to catch out goalkeeper Illan Meslier with a disguised free-kick, the Blues were initially unable to make their early superiority count against a depleted Leeds.\nWing-back James displayed his versatility as he was given permission to roam around a midfield missing Mateo Kovacic and N'Golo Kante, while another obvious positive for Tuchel was Mount's continued run of form in front of goal as the England midfielder scored for a third successive league game.\nBut it is at the back where Chelsea's concerns remain. They have conceded eight goals across their last three games following Wednesday's 3-3 Champions League draw with Zenit.\nAnd while Alonso atoned for his penalty error by dispossessing Stuart Dallas to assist Mount, there is much work for Tuchel to do if his side are to sustain their title challenge.\n\"We needed this win desperately, for the belief, for the mood and for the atmosphere,\" added Tuchel, who insisted neither team's players overstepped the mark as tempers frayed after the final whistle.\n\"I'm very happy with how we got it, how we played. Now we have two days off and it creates a good feeling for the boys.\"\nJorginho double denies Leeds valuable point\nA ninth-placed finish backed up with impressive, high-octane football, helped Leeds earn many admirers on their long-awaited Premier League return last season, but Marcelo Bielsa's side were yet to ignite this term.\nDespite the absence of captain Liam Cooper, midfield stalwart Kalvin Phillips and striker Patrick Bamford, the visitors hinted at a return to those levels as they made life rather uncomfortable for Chelsea after weathering early pressure.\nRaphinha twice tried to beat Mendy from a wide free-kick - the first drawing a fine save from the Chelsea goalkeeper - before James' pace forced Alonso's hand in the Chelsea penalty area.\nIt is Raphinha who appears most crucial to Leeds' chances of success over the next few games, as an increasingly stretched squad takes on Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool in the next fortnight.\nThe Brazil international has now scored seven of his side's 17 goals this term - with those contributions worth seven points. No other team-mate has managed to score more than twice in the league.\nOnce again he appeared the most likely to deliver for the visitors but, in a dramatic twist, his replacement - England youth international Gelhardt - displayed great determination to beat Thiago Silva at the near post and score his first senior goal for the club.\nHowever, Jorginho's second penalty after 94 minutes delivered a cruel blow to a Leeds side who remain six points above the relegation places in 15th.\n\"It was a game we deserved to draw and we lost it when it was finishing. That increases the disappointment,\" Bielsa told BBC Sport.\n\"It is very difficult to make a team like Chelsea play worse. It is also very difficult to attack a team like this. In a way we managed to achieve both things. We could attack and we managed to make them not play as well as they can do.\"\nGo straight to the best Chelsea content\nVisit our Leeds page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Villa also struggled to create any attacking impetus until it was too late, when they briefly threatened to snatch an unlikely point.\nHe will be satisfied, however, with many aspects of Villa's performance. It was not the winning Anfield return he wanted but his impact can be seen already and he has raw materials to work with.\nLiverpool bandwagon rolls on\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's trademark triple fist pump in front of the Kop after the final whistle carried a touch of relief as well as celebration after a game in which their persistence and patience was tested by Villa's organisation and determination.\nThis was not the flowing Liverpool that has steamrollered so many teams so often, but they stuck at it and eventually got their reward in the shape of the decisive penalty.\nThe success of Villa's game plan was reflected in the Kop's frustration and the sound of regular penalty appeals until referee Stuart Attwell eventually pointed to the spot.\nLiverpool were rarely troubled at the back, although for long periods it looked like old boy Gerrard might just leave his former Anfield stage with a point.\nKlopp's side cannot inflict destruction on teams every week, and on a day when their rivals City and Chelsea also had penalties to thank for narrow victories, Liverpool will take his victory as it came and move on.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Howe\nSalah and Alexander-Arnold turn on the class\nFollowing two 1-0 victories - courtesy of a 90th-minute winner against Wolves and a debated penalty against Aston Villa - Liverpool's 2,000th top-flight win was a more confident affair, even though they were affected by coronavirus prior to kick-off.\nLosing Van Dijk and Fabinho made little difference to a blistering first half, in which Jota and Salah both should have had two goals each.\nDespite Newcastle choosing to sit deep and break on the counter attack, Jordan Henderson and Alexander-Arnold were able to keep their opponents on the back foot with an array of lofted passes a tour golfer would have been proud of.\nBut it was a mistake from Thiago, which led to Shelvey's surprise opener, when his clearance fell to the Newcastle midfielder, who clipped passed an unsighted Alisson from 20 yards.\nIt did not deter Liverpool, as they ruthlessly punished the prostrate Hayden before Salah continued his remarkable form with a 22nd goal from 23 appearances this season.\nWith Newcastle left-back Jamal Lewis withdrawn because of a hamstring injury, Salah found himself up against Matt Ritchie until he was replaced by Roberto Firmino after 74 minutes.\nAnd he took advantage with some clever combinations with Alexander-Arnold, with one pass with the outside of his foot leaving fans drooling.\nLiverpool kept their opponents at bay in the second half as their own pace dropped, but as Jota and Mane both missed chances, and Newcastle introduced Callum Wilson from the bench in search of a late equaliser, Alexander-Arnold's goal was welcomed by the home support.\nA fine evening's work was helped by Everton's draw at Chelsea, meaning Liverpool extended their advantage over Thomas Tuchel's third-placed team to three points.\nControversial goal and fragile defence prove costly\nIn Sunday's 4-0 defeat at Leicester, Howe said he did not understand how the hosts were awarded a penalty that led to the opening goal.\nAnd he might have a case to complain about Liverpool's equaliser too.\nHayden appeared to clash heads with a team-mate as the ball was crossed into the area, but referee Mike Dean waved play on, which led to Jota taking advantage.\nIt ruined a brilliant start for the visitors, who rested top scorer Wilson, Miguel Almiron and Joe Willock and opted for a 4-5-1 formation, seeking to counter attack at pace.\nThat approach helped create Shelvey's opener, even if it came from Thiago's mistake, and the midfielder sprinted the length of the field to celebrate with away fans after his first goal since February.\nIt was a welcome boost for Howe's side, who had another chance to score via Saint-Maximin but the forward again demonstrated his recent capacity for making the wrong decision at a vital point.\nNewcastle, who have conceded more goals than any other Premier League side this season, showed their defensive fragility by losing two goals in quick succession and they struggled to make many clear-cut opportunities to draw level, although they appealed for a penalty when they believed Ryan Fraser was brought down by Alexander-Arnold.\nThey firmed up in the second half, however, and Howe's tactics looked as if they might yield a point before Alexander-Arnold's strike took the game away from the visitors.\nThe sight of Saint-Maximin hobbling off to be replaced by Wilson was a concern too.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

Howe\nSalah and Alexander-Arnold turn on the class\nFollowing two 1-0 victories - courtesy of a 90th-minute winner against Wolves and a debated penalty against Aston Villa - Liverpool's 2,000th top-flight win was a more confident affair, even though they were affected by coronavirus prior to kick-off.\nLosing Van Dijk and Fabinho made little difference to a blistering first half, in which Jota and Salah both should have had two goals each.\nDespite Newcastle choosing to sit deep and break on the counter attack, Jordan Henderson and Alexander-Arnold were able to keep their opponents on the back foot with an array of lofted passes a tour golfer would have been proud of.\nBut it was a mistake from Thiago, which led to Shelvey's surprise opener, when his clearance fell to the Newcastle midfielder, who clipped passed an unsighted Alisson from 20 yards.\nIt did not deter Liverpool, as they ruthlessly punished the prostrate Hayden before Salah continued his remarkable form with a 22nd goal from 23 appearances this season.\nWith Newcastle left-back Jamal Lewis withdrawn because of a hamstring injury, Salah found himself up against Matt Ritchie until he was replaced by Roberto Firmino after 74 minutes.\nAnd he took advantage with some clever combinations with Alexander-Arnold, with one pass with the outside of his foot leaving fans drooling.\nLiverpool kept their opponents at bay in the second half as their own pace dropped, but as Jota and Mane both missed chances, and Newcastle introduced Callum Wilson from the bench in search of a late equaliser, Alexander-Arnold's goal was welcomed by the home support.\nA fine evening's work was helped by Everton's draw at Chelsea, meaning Liverpool extended their advantage over Thomas Tuchel's third-placed team to three points.\nControversial goal and fragile defence prove costly\nIn Sunday's 4-0 defeat at Leicester, Howe said he did not understand how the hosts were awarded a penalty that led to the opening goal.\nAnd he might have a case to complain about Liverpool's equaliser too.\nHayden appeared to clash heads with a team-mate as the ball was crossed into the area, but referee Mike Dean waved play on, which led to Jota taking advantage.\nIt ruined a brilliant start for the visitors, who rested top scorer Wilson, Miguel Almiron and Joe Willock and opted for a 4-5-1 formation, seeking to counter attack at pace.\nThat approach helped create Shelvey's opener, even if it came from Thiago's mistake, and the midfielder sprinted the length of the field to celebrate with away fans after his first goal since February.\nIt was a welcome boost for Howe's side, who had another chance to score via Saint-Maximin but the forward again demonstrated his recent capacity for making the wrong decision at a vital point.\nNewcastle, who have conceded more goals than any other Premier League side this season, showed their defensive fragility by losing two goals in quick succession and they struggled to make many clear-cut opportunities to draw level, although they appealed for a penalty when they believed Ryan Fraser was brought down by Alexander-Arnold.\nThey firmed up in the second half, however, and Howe's tactics looked as if they might yield a point before Alexander-Arnold's strike took the game away from the visitors.\nThe sight of Saint-Maximin hobbling off to be replaced by Wilson was a concern too.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

a decision brought further into focus by Robertson's own sending-off.\nFor all Liverpool's pressure, Tottenham could have been out of sight with Dele Alli - another awarded a chance by Conte - the next to fail to convert a glorious chance from Son's clever pass, although Alisson got a vital fingertip to his effort.\nLiverpool were also missing a number of key players, with Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho and Thiago among those absent following positive Covid tests, while Jordan Henderson had a cold, allowing a first Premier League start for 19-year-old Tyler Morton, who was 10 days old when midfielder partner James Milner made his league debut in 2002.\nKlopp could still call on his flying full-backs though and Robertson, after nodding wide from Trent Alexander-Arnold's smart ball in the second minute, picked out Jota who steered an excellent header beyond Hugo Lloris for his 10th Premier League goal of the season.\nThe Reds boss was furious Jota was not awarded a penalty following a clumsy challenge by Royal but the German will also have been frustrated by his side's continuing failure to deal with the Spurs threat after the break.\nThe visitors only survived going behind when Alli sold Kane short for a tap-in, allowing Alisson to make a decisive save, before Kane headed over from close range.\nIn a sequence that summed up the game, Spurs thought they should have had a penalty at one end only for Robertson to head in Alexander-Arnold's cross from close range at the other.\nSon then pounced on Alisson's error to roll into an empty net before Scotland international Robertson's kick on Royal was upgraded to a red card following referee Tierney's review.\nAmid the madness, Tottenham did stop Mohamed Salah scoring or assisting for what would have been a record 16th successive game.\nAnd while second-placed Liverpool may have slipped further behind leaders City, the Reds' impressive form continues and they have now lost just once in the past 35 games in all competitions.\nKlopp's side also scored their 50th Premier League goal of the season in what is their 18th match, reaching that landmark faster than in any other previous top-flight campaign.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

We didn't play in any rhythm and everyone had too many touches, losing balls.\n\"We were lucky, but Newcastle did not defend well for the first goal and it was a brilliant action from Joao Cancelo for the second goal.\"\nGuardiola described his side's second-half performance as \"much better\" and \"closer to who we are\" as Riyad Mahrez scored his 50th Premier League goal for the club in the 63rd minute, superbly volleying in Oleksandr Zinchenko's cross for City's third.\nIt got even worse for the hosts as Raheem Sterling tapped in from close range four minutes from time after a fine run down the left flank from Gabriel Jesus.\nThis victory ensures City will be top of the Premier League at Christmas for only the third time - and on both previous occasions in 2011-12 and 2017-18 they went on to be champions.\nNewcastle remain 19th in the table, three points behind 17th-placed Watford and with only goal difference keeping them above bottom club Norwich City.\nNewcastle United v Manchester City as it happened and reaction / analysis, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best Newcastle content\nVisit our City page\nCity turn on the style\nGuardiola had to cancel a pre-match news conference on Friday after he returned an inconclusive lateral flow coronavirus test, but a later negative PCR test allowed him to manage City from the touchline on Sunday.\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe had lost all his 10 previous games against City and would have been horrified with his side's start as miscommunication between goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and Clark saw the centre-back leave Cancelo's cross to present Dias with an easy goal.\nJoelinton had a chance to equalise but shot just wide from 20 yards, before Cancelo put City two ahead. Although it was a great strike from the Portugal international, Howe will have been unhappy with the ease he evaded two defenders and managed to get his shot off with a further three Newcastle players surrounding him.\nThe home fans thought they should have had a penalty when City goalkeeper Ederson slid into, and wiped out, Ryan Fraser but nothing, surprisingly, was given. Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, called it a \"disgusting decision\" to not award a spot-kick.\nIsaac Hayden almost pulled a goal back before the interval, but glanced a header wide with Jacob Murphy also shooting wastefully over.\nAt half-time, Howe brought on Allan Saint-Maximin, who had suffered a calf problem against Liverpool on Thursday, for Joe Willock in an attempt to get back into the game.\nCity nearly grabbed their third, but Dubravka made fine saves to tip over Jesus' close-range header and parry Sterling's curling effort.\nBut it was only a brief respite as Mahrez's goal, originally ruled out for offside before being overturned by the video assistant referee (VAR), stretched the visitors' lead further.\nNewcastle almost grabbed a late consolation, but Ederson tipped over Callum Wilson's powerful header and Sterling claimed his 101st Premier League goal to ensure another frustrating day for the hosts.\nCity secured their 34th league victory of 2021, establishing a new record for the most top-flight wins by a team in a calendar year.\n\"Records show the consistency we have as a team, it is not winning titles or finals, but it is winning and winning,\" added Guardiola. \"Records are there to be broken and we are happy to have them.\n\"I prefer to win titles, but when you break a record from a long time ago, in a calendar year, the most victories, you are consistent. You win games and this is the most precious value this team has.\"\nCity last failed to win in the league on 30 October, losing 2-0 at home to Crystal Palace, and since then have recorded victories over Manchester United, Everton, West Ham, Aston Villa, Watford, Wolves, Leeds and now Newcastle, scoring an impressive 24 goals in the process and conceding three.\nGuardiola's side are hoping to replicate their efforts of last season when they won 15 league games in a row on their way to picking up the title - City's fifth in 10 campaigns.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We didn't play in any rhythm and everyone had too many touches, losing balls.\n\"We were lucky, but Newcastle did not defend well for the first goal and it was a brilliant action from Joao Cancelo for the second goal.\"\nGuardiola described his side's second-half performance as \"much better\" and \"closer to who we are\" as Riyad Mahrez scored his 50th Premier League goal for the club in the 63rd minute, superbly volleying in Oleksandr Zinchenko's cross for City's third.\nIt got even worse for the hosts as Raheem Sterling tapped in from close range four minutes from time after a fine run down the left flank from Gabriel Jesus.\nThis victory ensures City will be top of the Premier League at Christmas for only the third time - and on both previous occasions in 2011-12 and 2017-18 they went on to be champions.\nNewcastle remain 19th in the table, three points behind 17th-placed Watford and with only goal difference keeping them above bottom club Norwich City.\nNewcastle United v Manchester City as it happened and reaction / analysis, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best Newcastle content\nVisit our City page\nCity turn on the style\nGuardiola had to cancel a pre-match news conference on Friday after he returned an inconclusive lateral flow coronavirus test, but a later negative PCR test allowed him to manage City from the touchline on Sunday.\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe had lost all his 10 previous games against City and would have been horrified with his side's start as miscommunication between goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and Clark saw the centre-back leave Cancelo's cross to present Dias with an easy goal.\nJoelinton had a chance to equalise but shot just wide from 20 yards, before Cancelo put City two ahead. Although it was a great strike from the Portugal international, Howe will have been unhappy with the ease he evaded two defenders and managed to get his shot off with a further three Newcastle players surrounding him.\nThe home fans thought they should have had a penalty when City goalkeeper Ederson slid into, and wiped out, Ryan Fraser but nothing, surprisingly, was given. Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, called it a \"disgusting decision\" to not award a spot-kick.\nIsaac Hayden almost pulled a goal back before the interval, but glanced a header wide with Jacob Murphy also shooting wastefully over.\nAt half-time, Howe brought on Allan Saint-Maximin, who had suffered a calf problem against Liverpool on Thursday, for Joe Willock in an attempt to get back into the game.\nCity nearly grabbed their third, but Dubravka made fine saves to tip over Jesus' close-range header and parry Sterling's curling effort.\nBut it was only a brief respite as Mahrez's goal, originally ruled out for offside before being overturned by the video assistant referee (VAR), stretched the visitors' lead further.\nNewcastle almost grabbed a late consolation, but Ederson tipped over Callum Wilson's powerful header and Sterling claimed his 101st Premier League goal to ensure another frustrating day for the hosts.\nCity secured their 34th league victory of 2021, establishing a new record for the most top-flight wins by a team in a calendar year.\n\"Records show the consistency we have as a team, it is not winning titles or finals, but it is winning and winning,\" added Guardiola. \"Records are there to be broken and we are happy to have them.\n\"I prefer to win titles, but when you break a record from a long time ago, in a calendar year, the most victories, you are consistent. You win games and this is the most precious value this team has.\"\nCity last failed to win in the league on 30 October, losing 2-0 at home to Crystal Palace, and since then have recorded victories over Manchester United, Everton, West Ham, Aston Villa, Watford, Wolves, Leeds and now Newcastle, scoring an impressive 24 goals in the process and conceding three.\nGuardiola's side are hoping to replicate their efforts of last season when they won 15 league games in a row on their way to picking up the title - City's fifth in 10 campaigns.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Norwich stay bottom on goal difference, three points from safety.\nRonaldo rescues United\nAfter making made a raft of changes for the midweek Champions League draw with Young Boys, Ralf Rangnick restored the XI that beat Crystal Palace in his first game in charge last weekend.\nBut despite having a full week to prepare, United looked sluggish and rarely threatened against a side who have conceded more goals than any other in the Premier League this season.\nRonaldo had to wait until the 38th minute to get his first sight of goal, running on to Scott McTominay's pass before cutting inside and curling in a left-foot shot that was palmed away by Krul.\nUnited faded further in the second half but, like against Palace, managed to find a way, with Ronaldo emphatically dispatching the match-winning spot-kick after Aarons had dragged him down while attempting to meet a right-wing cross.\nDe Gea also maintained his fine form this season, diving full stretch to tip a fizzing Pukki drive over the bar before clawing away Kabak's goalbound header late on.\nIt means the Red Devils have kept successive Premier League clean sheets for the first time since a run of four from February to March 2021, and have won three consecutive league games for only the second time this season.\nThere is also a bit of history for Rangnick, who became the second Manchester United manager to register a clean sheet in his first two league games in charge after Ernest Mangnall in 1903.\nReaction to Norwich City v Manchester United, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League matches\n'Man Utd refereed the game' - Dean Smith's Norwich reaction\n'We have a lot of work to do' - Ralf Rangnick's Man Utd reaction\nSpirited Norwich fall just short\nInjury, ineligibility and illness forced Norwich boss Dean Smith into five changes to the side that lost at Tottenham last week, including a first start of the season for Przemyslaw Plachet, and recalls for Kabak and Dimitrios Giannoulis - whose last start was the 7-0 defeat at Chelsea in October.\nThey suffered a further injury blow after 20 minutes when captain Grant Hanley was forced off with a shoulder injury, with midfielder Jacob Sorensen having to come on and play alongside Kabak in the Canaries' defence.\nBut despite the patched-up nature of the side it was a performance full of effort and endeavour.\nA lack of attacking threat again let them down - no team has scored fewer than Norwich's eight goals in the Premier League this season - though they can rightly point to an impressive performance by De Gea.\nThere was also some good news on the injury front when Todd Cantwell came off the bench in the second half for just his second appearance since September.\nDespite the disappointment of defeat it was a performance to build on as Smith prepares to welcome former club Aston Villa to Carrow Road next week.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They have now failed to score in each of their last four games and have managed only eight goals all season, while top scorer Teemu Pukki registered only 23 touches against the Gunners.\nThe Arsenal game was another dispiriting watch for Norwich supporters and with the trip to Selhurst Park to come, time is not on Smith's side as he tries to stop the club's current losing streak and reignite their hopes of hauling themselves off the foot of the table.\n\"We've got to be better than that and we are better than that,\" he added. \"Unfortunately the standards have dropped off massively from the Manchester United game.\n\"There are reasons for that but I'm not here to make excuses.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

a decision brought further into focus by Robertson's own sending-off.\nFor all Liverpool's pressure, Tottenham could have been out of sight with Dele Alli - another awarded a chance by Conte - the next to fail to convert a glorious chance from Son's clever pass, although Alisson got a vital fingertip to his effort.\nLiverpool were also missing a number of key players, with Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho and Thiago among those absent following positive Covid tests, while Jordan Henderson had a cold, allowing a first Premier League start for 19-year-old Tyler Morton, who was 10 days old when midfielder partner James Milner made his league debut in 2002.\nKlopp could still call on his flying full-backs though and Robertson, after nodding wide from Trent Alexander-Arnold's smart ball in the second minute, picked out Jota who steered an excellent header beyond Hugo Lloris for his 10th Premier League goal of the season.\nThe Reds boss was furious Jota was not awarded a penalty following a clumsy challenge by Royal but the German will also have been frustrated by his side's continuing failure to deal with the Spurs threat after the break.\nThe visitors only survived going behind when Alli sold Kane short for a tap-in, allowing Alisson to make a decisive save, before Kane headed over from close range.\nIn a sequence that summed up the game, Spurs thought they should have had a penalty at one end only for Robertson to head in Alexander-Arnold's cross from close range at the other.\nSon then pounced on Alisson's error to roll into an empty net before Scotland international Robertson's kick on Royal was upgraded to a red card following referee Tierney's review.\nAmid the madness, Tottenham did stop Mohamed Salah scoring or assisting for what would have been a record 16th successive game.\nAnd while second-placed Liverpool may have slipped further behind leaders City, the Reds' impressive form continues and they have now lost just once in the past 35 games in all competitions.\nKlopp's side also scored their 50th Premier League goal of the season in what is their 18th match, reaching that landmark faster than in any other previous top-flight campaign.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

And now we have to chase.\n\"I think I needed a performance like this today.

He had taken the ball past goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and with only defender Tyrone Mings guarding the net, the England midfielder fired wide.\nHudson-Odoi also had a late effort saved by Martinez, but those misses did not prove costly as Chelsea scored their third late on.\nIt came from a storming run from Lukaku, with the forward brought down by Ezri Konsa and Jorginho kept his cool to score his ninth goal of the season and his sixth in six games.\nVilla are 11th in the Premier League and McAllister said: \"I've been speaking to Steven [Gerrard] ever since he was diagnosed, he's obviously very frustrated.\n\"We're in this world of Zoom and there are ways of communicating.

To get those points is a good return for us and we need to keep working.\"\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League action\nGo to the Brighton page\nGo to the Brentford page\nBrighton dominated for long periods, with former Bees forward Maupay and Enock Mwepu both guilty of slashing good chances wildly wide, while Dan Burn headed against the crossbar early on.\nAlexis Mac Allister also went close to adding to the scoreline against a Brentford team that sporadically threatened but did not click into gear until it was too late.\nAside from early opportunities for Bryan Mbeumo and Shandon Baptiste, the visitors' best moments were contained to an eight-minute spell in the second half when home goalkeeper Robert Sanchez superbly saved Baptiste's deflected drive and turned away Ethan Pinnock's header.\nAnother goal-bound Pinnock effort was headed to safety by left-back Marc Cucurella, and Brighton deserved the win to complete the double over their opponents, who have dropped to 13th in the table.\nMaupay and Trossard star\nBrighton's longstanding problems in front of goal have been evident in a sequence containing eight draws, but this rarely looked like being one of those frustrating occasions.\nWith Burn's header instigating a sustained period of pressure, Potter saw his team record two first-half goals in a league game for the first time since their opening home fixture of the season against Watford.\nMaupay and Trossard's intelligent running troubled the visiting defence all evening, with Brentford goalkeeper Alvaro Fernandez having little chance with either finish.\nThe duo have now contributed almost 70% of the club's top-flight goals this term.\nPotter will also be buoyed by the return to fitness of Danny Welbeck and Pascal Gross, who were both given second-half run-outs and have the capacity to add some much-needed support to Brighton's leading marksmen.\nBlunt Bees\nBrentford have now lost as many Premier League games this season (seven) as they did in their entire Championship campaign last term.\nThomas Frank can have few complaints about the outcome here, with his side failing to capitalise on the chances they did carve out and only stepping up their intensity after falling two goals behind.\nMbeumo's early attempted lob lacked the power to reach the Brighton goal and was indicative of what was to follow in a game in which they did not do enough at either end of the pitch.\nHowever, Frank and his players will be heartened that, with almost half of the season gone, they have a healthy nine-point gap to the relegation zone and plenty to build on in the remainder of the season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

In all those areas we weren't at our best.\n\"You have to be ready and able to win those direct duels and this was not that often the case. When we were in possession we had too many giveaways and even with the goal, that doesn't make things easy.\n\"Today was not a question of body language, it was a question of body physicality. If you want to be competitive here you have to get physical and this was not the case in many parts of the game.\n\"Our biggest problem was the mistakes we made. Even when we scored the equaliser we were not really controlling the game and taking the right decisions.\n\"I didn't like the performance at all.\"\nHow Joelinton went from figure of fun to 'Newcastle's best player'\n, external\nWilson and Saint-Maximin face absences after injuries\nHow Newcastle v Manchester United unfolded\nIt was a cruel result on Newcastle, who defended superbly and counter-attacked with intensity to produce their finest display of the campaign.\nHad Saint-Maximin followed up his superb first-half run and finish with cleaner contact on a shot from point-blank range soon after the break, or Jacob Murphy's late effort found net instead of post, the home side would likely have the victory they deserved.\nDavid de Gea must also take some credit courtesy of a number of superb saves, none better than the one-handed tip over to deny Miguel Almiron's follow-up drive following the Murphy shot.\nThe point is scant reward for the Magpies and leaves them 19th on 11 points, two from safety but having played more games than all their rivals - and four more than Burnley in 18th.\nTo add to Newcastle's sense of injustice they also lost influential forwards Saint-Maximin and Callum Wilson to injury during the game.\nGo straight to all the best Newcastle content\nVisit our Man Utd page\n'Newcastle can be a force to be reckoned with'\nNewcastle played three times during Manchester United's Covid-enforced 16-day sabbatical, losing each and conceding 11 goals in the process, albeit against some daunting opponents.\nThe doom-mongers will point to the continued poor results, the fact that the Magpies have now conceded a Premier League-record 80 league goals in this calendar year and the dropping of a league-high 19 points from winning positions this season as evidence of their fate.\nBut those with glasses still half full can now draw on a performance of grit and occasional guile that not only outstrips all others they have produced this season but belies their lowly spot in the table.\nThey did not defend like a side that has conceded 42 times this season, offering a disciplined structure that frustrated one of the most elite forward lines in the division, especially for the first hour.\nIn midfield they have the unlikely emergence of the box-to-box Joelinton, who won tackles, drove forward and played sensible, incisive passes all night.\nUp top, Saint-Maximin and Wilson were a menace for the duration of their time on the pitch and will have every Newcastle fan crossing fingers that their injuries are not too serious.\nYes, it was another frustrating night for the division's most high-profile strugglers, but also one from which they can draw much-needed optimism before a January transfer window in which they are sure to be busy.\n\"I can't praise the players enough,\" Newcastle boss Eddie Howe told BBC Sport. \"It was an excellent performance. I'm really pleased. We deserved to win and you're left with the horrible feeling of not getting what you deserve.\n\"We are capable of beating anybody. We proved that today. I thought we all performed today.\n\"That's got the be the standard we've set ourselves. We can be a force to be reckoned with.\"\nSloppy Man Utd rescued by Cavani\nManchester United remain unbeaten under Rangnick, but this is one of few positives they can take from an evening full of defensive lapses, sloppy passes, weak shots and surly body language.\nWith their games at Brentford and at home to Brighton before Christmas both postponed by Covid cases that also saw the club's training ground closed for a time, this was their first game in more than two weeks - but rustiness can only account for so much.\nIt was Rafael Varane's hesitancy in the first half that allowed Sean Longstaff to nick the ball off him in a dangerous area to set up the opening goal, but the returning French centre-back was not alone with such calamitous play.\nHis partner Harry Maguire was, at times, like a bull in a china shop, ushering in panic wherever he wandered, with those further forward failing to provide that first line of defence Rangnick demands.\nThey improved in the second half, with Cavani the catalyst for earning a point, but his poacher's finish was the one landed punch on an evening of tame jabs and ill-judged, wild haymakers.\nThey have games in hand to try and close the gap to the Champions League places, but Rangnick has much still to do if he is to narrow the gulf in attacking efficiency between themselves and those above them.\n\"We shouldn't be looking for excuses,\" Rangnick told BBC Sport. \"We have to meet the demands in terms of speed, tempo, rhythm, transitions.\n\"We had chances to score but so did Newcastle. The good thing is we got the point after being 1-0 down but the performance has to get better.\n\"We still have steps to go. Today was not a step forward. We need to decrease the number of giveaways and unforced errors and those steps of development we need to take.\n\"We have to take it game by game. We have physical games coming up against Burnley and Wolves.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Burnley 0-0 West Ham United: David Moyes frustration as Clarets frustrate Hammers\nDavid Moyes urged some of his West Ham players to \"get back up to the high standards\" they have set after a frustrating goalless draw with relegation-threatened Burnley at Turf Moor.\nThe Hammers boss was frustrated as Burnley - who have won just once in the Premier League this season - repelled his side, with central defenders Ben Mee and James Tarkowski standing up to a stream of crosses at the heart of the resistance.\nMoyes admitted his team lacked quality in the final third and, after a run of one win in five league games, his side now sit a point clear of Manchester United in fourth spot.\n\"They're in really good spirits because we're in a good position, but once you set high standards, which a lot of them have, and they've seen the levels they can get to, I think some of them are playing below it,\" Moyes told Match of the Day.\n\"Some of them need to get back up to the high standards if they're going to remain in this position. I'd rather tell them that than not. There's no point in me pussy-footing around it and not saying it. I want to win, I want us to play better and a few of them can certainly do that.\"\nMoyes' side could have fallen behind early on when Chris Wood headed over, but they began to take control and headers from Issa Diop and Said Benrahma drew fine saves from Burnley keeper Nick Pope either side of half-time.\nThe Hammers also had a strong claim for a penalty in the opening period when Dwight McNeil caught Craig Dawson in the box.\nBut Burnley, to their credit, failed to give the visitors a clear opening of any sort - and time and again well-placed defenders were on hand to make key interventions.\nJay Rodriguez was inches away from tapping in a late winner for the Clarets, who have drawn seven of their last 10 league games and sit 18th - two points adrift of Watford. Their grit is obvious, while West Ham may need to find a touch more craft in the final third if they are to maintain their position.\nReaction to Burnley v West Ham United, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League matches\nBurnley's Roberts in hospital with infection\nGo straight to all the best Burnley content\nVisit our West Ham page\nHammers frustration as Dyche calls for \"big moments\"\nHammers fans may wonder how a haul of 16 shots and 14 corners was not enough to deliver a winner but only three of their attempts found the target and Pope - who like his central defenders was excellent - dealt with them all.\nHe turned a Jarrod Bowen effort around the post in the dying minutes and West Ham were ultimately unable to equal their club record of nine wins in their first 16 games of a top-flight season.\nBut their pressure and impetus point to the unquestionable improvements they have made in recent months. Declan Rice impressed again and seemed intent on driving his side forward to a win, while Bowen, Benrahma and Manuel Lanzini buzzed around central striker Michail Antonio and linked neatly.\nMoyes' men attempted 32 crosses. Burnley left-back Charlie Taylor cleared from three yards out when Antonio looked set to tap in an Arthur Masuaku cross in the second half and Tarkowski also made a crucial intervention from a drilled Rice delivery.\nRice whistled a shot from distance over the bar late on but the draw means West Ham approach the busy Christmas period with 28 points, five more than they had after 16 games last season.\nBurnley, by contrast, are five points worse off than they were after the same number of games last season. A tally of just one victory from their 15 Premier League games is their lowest at this stage of a top-flight season since 1970-71, when they were relegated.\nSean Dyche has been calm over their position and holds faith in their Premier League experience shining through to deliver wins. His side have conceded fewer goals than Manchester United and Arsenal, but it is at the other end where they have shortcomings.\nThe Burnley boss felt his side were \"way off\" in their first-half performance and afterwards said they must \"find more big moments\" in attack.\nThey hit the target just once all day and yet could have earned a key win at the death when Rodriguez was unable to reach Taylor's fine low cross, allowing the ball to roll agonisingly across the face of goal.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They have now failed to score in each of their last four games and have managed only eight goals all season, while top scorer Teemu Pukki registered only 23 touches against the Gunners.\nThe Arsenal game was another dispiriting watch for Norwich supporters and with the trip to Selhurst Park to come, time is not on Smith's side as he tries to stop the club's current losing streak and reignite their hopes of hauling themselves off the foot of the table.\n\"We've got to be better than that and we are better than that,\" he added. \"Unfortunately the standards have dropped off massively from the Manchester United game.\n\"There are reasons for that but I'm not here to make excuses.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The previous two occasions City rounded off December in first place in the Premier League - in 2011-12 and 2017-18 - they went on to win the title.\n\"There are 54 points to play for,\" Guardiola said.\n\"All of you, thank you for your nice words because we win but I am not going to believe any words you say about it is already done or expected because Chelsea and Liverpool are more than exceptional. One is champions of Europe and the other has been our big rivals over the years.\n\"The distance is not because they drop points but because we win 10 games in a row.\"\nCity were looking to equal the club's top-flight record of scoring at least four goals in four successive games set in 1905 but they rarely carved open a hard-working Bees side.\nIvan Toney was fortunate to go unpunished for catching Fernandinho with his studs as the City midfielder lay on the ground shortly before half-time.\nThe visitors went close to doubling their lead soon after the break when De Bruyne and Foden again linked up, with the latter heading his team-mate's cross just wide of the post.\nDe Bruyne struck the base of the upright with a fierce low drive from distance, while Aymeric Laporte had a header ruled out for a marginal offside, but in the end Foden's first-half strike was enough to seal the win.\nBrentford, meanwhile, remain 14th with 20 points - nine clear of the relegation zone as they look to ensure a second season in the top flight.\nRelive Wednesday's Premier League action\nTitle race and top-four premonitions\nGo to the Brentford page\nGo to the Manchester City page\nCity grind it out to keep on track\nWhat looked like being a three-horse title race at the start of the December now has City firmly out in front after an incredible run of form while their rivals faltered.\nCity have won every Premier League game they have played in December, scoring 24 goals in the process and conceding just five.\nBut while their previous three victories involved them scoring seven, four and six goals, this was a narrow but hard-fought win that arguably only serves to strengthen their credentials as favourites for the 2021-22 title.\nBeing able to grind out results is just as important as recording big wins and they managed to come out on top against a physical Brentford side who provided a stern test for Guardiola's team.\nThe only glimmer of hope for City's title rivals is that they did not look at their fluid best, particularly in the second half, but ultimately they had done enough to secure the points as Brentford rarely looked like threatening an equaliser.\nThe Bees certainly deserve credit for limiting a previously rampant City to just the solitary goal and despite the defeat it was a battling performance that suggests they have a good chance of preserving their Premier League status for another season.\nIndeed, the decisive strike had come just moments after the hosts came close to scoring themselves but Ederson reacted well to keep out a cross that bounced towards the City goal off Ruben Dias, before Yoane Wissa's deflected strike was cleared off the line.\nToo soon to write off rivals or is title race over?\nOnly five times before has there been a gap of at least eight points at the top of the Premier League table at the end of a year and on each of those occasions the leader has gone on to win the title.\nThe team at the top heading into January has also gone on to win the title in eight of the last 12 seasons.\n\"I wouldn't write Liverpool and Chelsea off just yet,\" former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"Liverpool have been on extraordinary runs but the standard City are setting is phenomenal.\"\nFormer Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha added: \"It's not game over, but it's pretty significant. City would need to have a mini calamity between now and the end of the season.\n\"Four or five weeks ago, it felt like Chelsea were on top, but all of a sudden Chelsea and Liverpool have had a little bit of a dip and City are looking pretty good.\"\nFormer Newcastle striker Alan Shearer believes if City win their next two games - away to Arsenal on Saturday and at home to Chelsea on 15 January - then the title race will be over.\n\"The impressive thing is the number of goals they are scoring,\" he said on Amazon Prime.\n\"But other than [the 6-3 win over] Leicester on Boxing Day, they are hardly conceding too, which is going to make it really difficult for Chelsea and Liverpool to get back into the race, particularly if you look at City's next two games then [if they win] it is pretty much over.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Now for sure we have to work a lot and it won't be easy to fight for something this season.\n\"We need to improve a lot. For sure it was an opportunity that we missed. When you have this type of situation you have to try to exploit, to try to get three points.\"\nSpurs twice had the ball in the net after the break, with Kane seeing a strike ruled out by VAR for a narrow offside and Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster spared own-goal blushes when it was judged he was fouled by Matt Doherty.\nTottenham felt aggrieved by the decision on Forster's foul but, in truth, they did not do enough after the break to pull and stretch a patched-up Saints back four, who repeatedly limited the visitors to crosses from wide areas.\nSouthampton boss Hasenhuttl punched the air in delight at the final whistle and said there was \"no chance to be more proud than today\".\nFollow reaction to Southampton v Tottenham Hotspur, plus the rest of Tuesday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Saints content\nVisit our Spurs page\nConte's record, Southampton's resolve\nConte has now overseen four Tottenham wins and three draws in the league, and the likes of Pierre Emile-Hojbjerg explained before kick-off that the boss has called on players to raise their game technically, physically and in how they live as professionals away from the training ground.\nTheir effort could not be questioned in the second half at St Mary's, with Doherty denied by a Forster save, Son seeing a header held, and substitute Bryan Gil having a stinging shot tipped over in injury time.\nForster made 10 saves in all - the most by a keeper to not end on the losing side in the Premier League this season.\nIf anything, Spurs simply took too long to build momentum with their one-man advantage, and Southampton - beaten only by Wolves at home in the league this season - ground out a point to move to 13th in the table.\nHasenhuttl made six changes from the Boxing Day win at West Ham and his side's grit and resilience in the second period was typified by Kyle Walker-Peters, who leapt to glance a header away from the lurking Kane before immediately taking a Ben Davies shot flush in the face.\nSpurs saw 53% of first-half possession, registering four shots. Those stats rose to 76% and 18 attempts in the second period - pointing to the significance of Salisu's dismissal.\nThe Ghanaian defender had appeared on edge in the first half, recording four fouls in 39 minutes as Southampton looked to play high up the pitch and harass Spurs into errors. His dismissal was Southampton's 11th since Hasenhuttl took charge in 2018, with only Arsenal having a higher tally, 13, in the same time frame.\nThe sharp Kane lashed his penalty high into the net and later came incredibly close to staying onside before applying a finish to a Harry Winks pass six minutes after the break.\nBut with the likes of the impressive Ward-Prowse winning all of his duels on the day, Southampton kept a solid shape to force Spurs wide. Conte's side delivered 28 second-half crosses compared with three in the first 45 minutes and had little to show for their approach.\nAnd Southampton could have won it in injury time when Armando Broja robbed Tottenham defender Eric Dier before firing over, sparing Spurs further frustration on a day when they could have taken more.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We should never be asked in the current climate to put players through that. Players will keep topping up the injury list.\n\"We had three who dropped out yesterday. Max Aarons, Teemu Pukki and Todd Cantwell all pulled out. It's a really hard time, not just for ourselves but for everyone at the moment.\n\"I just told the players the half-term report: it's not good enough and it needs to be better. If they want to maintain any kind of semblance of a Premier League team, we have to turn it around very quickly. It doesn't help we only have 10 senior players.\"\nThe visitors started brightly but found themselves a goal down after eight minutes when Kenny McLean fouled Will Hughes in the area and Edouard converted from the spot for his first goal since October.\nPalace took charge from there with Hughes their driving force. He sprung forward and slipped in Mateta, who could only find the side-netting.\nMateta made it 2-0 with his first goal of the season seven minutes before half-time. Edouard pulled out to the left and played in a low cross that Mateta placed past Angus Gunn with superb precision.\nJust seconds earlier, Jacob Sorensen squandered a superb chance for Norwich at the other end, and four minutes later, Schlupp added a third with a powerful finish from a tight angle.\nSam Byram clipped the top of the crossbar with a header in stoppage time, but Norwich's defensive issues had already given them a mountain to climb.\nGunn did his best to keep the score down with an excellent double save to deny Schlupp and then Mateta in the second half, while Vicente Guaita was forced into rare action by a Przemyslaw Placheta strike.\nReaction and analysis from Tuesday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Palace content\nVisit our Norwich page\nCanaries struggling badly at both ends\nSmith knew how difficult the job would be when he arrived at Carrow Road in November, but his side appear devoid of any inspiration at the moment.\nThere were good spells of possession, particularly early on, and a couple of half chances, but Palace were not really troubled at any point.\nWith no Pukki or Cantwell in the side, their task was made even tougher, but they have now lost five games in succession without scoring a goal and conceding 14.\nThe Norwich fans even resorted to singing \"Let's pretend we scored a goal!\" and it neatly summed up another tough afternoon in what is becoming a nightmarish season.\nEagles fly high without Zaha\nAlthough Covid-19 meant he could not be at the game, manager Patrick Vieira's influence on Palace was clearly on show again. They are much more energetic in attack this season, playing on the front foot rather than the counter-attack, particularly at home.\nIt is now nine successive games at Selhurst Park in which they've scored, and although they were helped by calamitous Norwich defending, there was a real purpose in their play.\nAnd while they were without the suspended Wilfried Zaha, on whom they have relied so heavily in recent years, and the always-impressive Conor Gallagher, the likes of Hughes, Edouard and Mateta picked up the baton seamlessly to deliver an accomplished performance.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The previous two occasions City rounded off December in first place in the Premier League - in 2011-12 and 2017-18 - they went on to win the title.\n\"There are 54 points to play for,\" Guardiola said.\n\"All of you, thank you for your nice words because we win but I am not going to believe any words you say about it is already done or expected because Chelsea and Liverpool are more than exceptional. One is champions of Europe and the other has been our big rivals over the years.\n\"The distance is not because they drop points but because we win 10 games in a row.\"\nCity were looking to equal the club's top-flight record of scoring at least four goals in four successive games set in 1905 but they rarely carved open a hard-working Bees side.\nIvan Toney was fortunate to go unpunished for catching Fernandinho with his studs as the City midfielder lay on the ground shortly before half-time.\nThe visitors went close to doubling their lead soon after the break when De Bruyne and Foden again linked up, with the latter heading his team-mate's cross just wide of the post.\nDe Bruyne struck the base of the upright with a fierce low drive from distance, while Aymeric Laporte had a header ruled out for a marginal offside, but in the end Foden's first-half strike was enough to seal the win.\nBrentford, meanwhile, remain 14th with 20 points - nine clear of the relegation zone as they look to ensure a second season in the top flight.\nRelive Wednesday's Premier League action\nTitle race and top-four premonitions\nGo to the Brentford page\nGo to the Manchester City page\nCity grind it out to keep on track\nWhat looked like being a three-horse title race at the start of the December now has City firmly out in front after an incredible run of form while their rivals faltered.\nCity have won every Premier League game they have played in December, scoring 24 goals in the process and conceding just five.\nBut while their previous three victories involved them scoring seven, four and six goals, this was a narrow but hard-fought win that arguably only serves to strengthen their credentials as favourites for the 2021-22 title.\nBeing able to grind out results is just as important as recording big wins and they managed to come out on top against a physical Brentford side who provided a stern test for Guardiola's team.\nThe only glimmer of hope for City's title rivals is that they did not look at their fluid best, particularly in the second half, but ultimately they had done enough to secure the points as Brentford rarely looked like threatening an equaliser.\nThe Bees certainly deserve credit for limiting a previously rampant City to just the solitary goal and despite the defeat it was a battling performance that suggests they have a good chance of preserving their Premier League status for another season.\nIndeed, the decisive strike had come just moments after the hosts came close to scoring themselves but Ederson reacted well to keep out a cross that bounced towards the City goal off Ruben Dias, before Yoane Wissa's deflected strike was cleared off the line.\nToo soon to write off rivals or is title race over?\nOnly five times before has there been a gap of at least eight points at the top of the Premier League table at the end of a year and on each of those occasions the leader has gone on to win the title.\nThe team at the top heading into January has also gone on to win the title in eight of the last 12 seasons.\n\"I wouldn't write Liverpool and Chelsea off just yet,\" former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"Liverpool have been on extraordinary runs but the standard City are setting is phenomenal.\"\nFormer Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha added: \"It's not game over, but it's pretty significant. City would need to have a mini calamity between now and the end of the season.\n\"Four or five weeks ago, it felt like Chelsea were on top, but all of a sudden Chelsea and Liverpool have had a little bit of a dip and City are looking pretty good.\"\nFormer Newcastle striker Alan Shearer believes if City win their next two games - away to Arsenal on Saturday and at home to Chelsea on 15 January - then the title race will be over.\n\"The impressive thing is the number of goals they are scoring,\" he said on Amazon Prime.\n\"But other than [the 6-3 win over] Leicester on Boxing Day, they are hardly conceding too, which is going to make it really difficult for Chelsea and Liverpool to get back into the race, particularly if you look at City's next two games then [if they win] it is pretty much over.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It's tough when you're not there and every player always wants to be involved but the manager has his reasons.\"\nTuchel criticises 'not fair' schedule\nReturning Lukaku makes the difference\nChelsea were top of the league after their 2-1 win against Watford on 1 December, before a run of only five points from four games saw them fall behind City in the title race, but this was a hard-earned and much needed victory.\nVilla were without manager Steven Gerrard after he tested positive for Covid-19, with assistant Gary McAllister issuing the instructions from the touchline.\nChelsea have also been affected by Covid-19 and boss Thomas Tuchel had unsuccessfully asked to have their goalless draw at Wolves on 19 December postponed.\nThey were still without Kai Havertz and Timo Werner, although Lukaku was back in the squad with Hudson-Odoi returning to the starting line-up.\nMason Mount nearly gave them a fortunate lead when a mis-hit cross hit the top of the bar, before Villa gained a slice of luck themselves.\nJames diverted Targett's cross into his own net, although Blues goalkeeper Mendy should have done better as he got his fingers to it, but could not keep the ball out.\nChelsea were soon level with Jorginho's first penalty.\nTuchel made a change at half-time with Lukaku coming on for defender Trevoh Chalobah, although the German was then forced into another substitution six minutes later when Thiago Silva went off injured with Andreas Christensen replacing him.\nAfter Lukaku's goal, Mount should have stretched Chelsea's lead further. He had taken the ball past goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and with only defender Tyrone Mings guarding the net, the England midfielder fired wide.\nHudson-Odoi also had a late effort saved by Martinez, but those misses did not prove costly as Chelsea scored their third late on.\nIt came from a storming run from Lukaku, with the forward brought down by Ezri Konsa and Jorginho kept his cool to score his ninth goal of the season and his sixth in six games.\nVilla are 11th in the Premier League and McAllister said: \"I've been speaking to Steven [Gerrard] ever since he was diagnosed, he's obviously very frustrated.\n\"We're in this world of Zoom and there are ways of communicating. We were in constant contact with each other during the game.\n\"He is due to be back on Friday and we have four or five days to work and try to correct the things which didn't go so well.\"\nAston Villa v Chelsea as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nGo to the Aston Villa page\nGo to the Chelsea page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It was a great performance,\" Martinelli told BBC Sport. \"I was trying to score more but the most important thing is the victory.\"\nThe scoreline could have been greater but for an impressive performance by Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier, who made fine stops to deny Saka, Alexandre Lacazette, Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney.\nReaction to Leeds United v Arsenal\nGo straight to all the best Leeds content\nVisit our Arsenal page\nYoungsters inspire Gunners to dominant win\nOn Christmas Day last year Arsenal were 15th in Premier League and only four points above relegation zone.

In addition, Timo Werner has not played since 11 December after testing positive for coronavirus, while N'Golo Kante came off the bench despite suffering a knee injury against Villa.\nWith Chelsea facing six matches in the Premier League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup in January, they can ill afford any more absences among key players.\nWhile the sight of Lukaku celebrating in front of Chelsea fans was pleasing for Tuchel, the German could now be forced to turn to the transfer window to ensure his side stays in the hunt for trophies.\nDeserved point for battling Brighton\nOn 26 December, Brighton gave their fans a late Christmas present by breaking their 12-match winless run in all competitions with a 2-0 victory over Brentford.\nAnd their travelling supporters were jubilant again after Welbeck's equaliser - the first time Brighton have scored at Stamford Bridge - sealed a thoroughly deserved point.\nIt was Welbeck's second Premier League goal against Chelsea, 11 years and 45 days since scoring on his first appearance against them in the competition in November 2010 for Sunderland.\nBrighton, who end the calendar year in a solid 10th position in the table, looked set for disappointment as Adam Lallana, Yves Bissouma and Alexis Mac Allister were all denied by Edouard Mendy.\nIn addition, Jakub Moder clipped the roof of Chelsea's net and Neal Maupay also went close before Welbeck scored in front of Brighton's supporters.\nIt is their ninth draw in 18 league games, and the Seagulls head into 2022 in confident mood and with 10 more points than they had at this stage last season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Those stats rose to 76% and 18 attempts in the second period - pointing to the significance of Salisu's dismissal.\nThe Ghanaian defender had appeared on edge in the first half, recording four fouls in 39 minutes as Southampton looked to play high up the pitch and harass Spurs into errors. His dismissal was Southampton's 11th since Hasenhuttl took charge in 2018, with only Arsenal having a higher tally, 13, in the same time frame.\nThe sharp Kane lashed his penalty high into the net and later came incredibly close to staying onside before applying a finish to a Harry Winks pass six minutes after the break.\nBut with the likes of the impressive Ward-Prowse winning all of his duels on the day, Southampton kept a solid shape to force Spurs wide. Conte's side delivered 28 second-half crosses compared with three in the first 45 minutes and had little to show for their approach.\nAnd Southampton could have won it in injury time when Armando Broja robbed Tottenham defender Eric Dier before firing over, sparing Spurs further frustration on a day when they could have taken more.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They will question their own game management.\nLiverpool still carried real danger until the final whistle but they were unable to beat the excellent Mendy and will now look back on two away games at Leicester City and Chelsea in which they picked up only one point - something which may prove very costly in a title race which would appear to have little or no margin for error.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Arguably the pick was a fingertip effort to touch over a volley from Neves, who had controlled a headed Jones clearance on the edge of the penalty area.\nWolves were forced onto the defensive more often after half-time but even though they weathered the storm, it seemed they would have to settle for a point when Romain Saiss clipped the bar with a free-kick in his final game before heading off on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Morocco.\nMoutinho had other ideas. And while Wolves' run of games involving no more than a single goal now extends to eight, few in the visitors' camp were worried about that.\nUnderwhelming United\nIt is becoming evident the issues that arose during the final weeks of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's reign will not disappear through a change of manager.\nRonaldo was a muted force and the United fans did not think Mason Greenwood deserved to be substituted for Fernandes given the boos that accompanied his exit.\nUnited were overrun in midfield during those opening stages and, as so often under Solskjaer, were left hoping for a moment of inspiration that did not come.\nAs it turned out, any fears about Jones playing instead of the injured Harry Maguire had long since been dispelled by the time Wolves scored. If anything, the defender was a galvanising presence.\nIt was a first United defeat since Solskjaer's final game in charge, at Watford, on 20 November.

They will question their own game management.\nLiverpool still carried real danger until the final whistle but they were unable to beat the excellent Mendy and will now look back on two away games at Leicester City and Chelsea in which they picked up only one point - something which may prove very costly in a title race which would appear to have little or no margin for error.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It's a really difficult job to get in the team but he's doing a great job for West Ham and that's what I'm interested in.\"\nThe Hammers' third consecutive top-flight win saw them move two points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, who have a game in hand, and four above Tottenham, who are sixth and have played three games less.\n\"We have to try to keep it going,\" Moyes added.\n\"As long as we are around the mix and European places, that will be really good but if we can hang on the coat tails of teams above, that is what we will try and do.\"\n\"I don't think being fourth this moment in time means an awful lot, apart from showing we have been consistent.\"\nBowen's strikes condemned Norwich to their sixth straight defeat in the Premier League, with his first coming from Vladimir Coufal's inviting cross just before the break and his second arriving in the 83rd minute when he turned in Arthur Masuaku's ball.\nThe hosts were below their best, but still created several other excellent chances that should have amounted to a more handsome margin of victory.\nBowen had an earlier effort ruled out by VAR, with Nikola Vlasic deemed to be offside and interfering with Norwich goalkeeper Tim Krul, and also hit the woodwork twice, while Michail Antonio blazed over from close range.\nOn a disappointing evening for the visitors, Adam Idah went close to levelling with the score at 1-0, but saw his drive pushed on to the post by home goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nBar that attempt, however, Dean Smith's side offered little in attack and have now failed to score a top-flight goal for 540 minutes.\nFollow live text coverage of West Ham v Norwich\nGo straight to all the best Hammers content\nGet the best Canaries content here\nHammers take control with more intensity\nAfter half an hour of this contest there was little to choose between either side, with the pre-match pyrotechnics arguably offering more excitement than the attacking play on show.\nHowever, the Hammers clicked into gear shortly after, with Moyes barking out instructions and urging his players to provide more intensity.\nBowen's first disallowed goal only served as a warning to Norwich, who quickly fell behind in the 42nd minute when he rose above Ben Gibson to direct a header into the bottom left corner.\nThe 25-year-old produced the kind of performance that is only likely to underline his credentials as a prospective England player.\nBowen's tally of being directly involved in an impressive 16 goals in all competitions this term is the most by an English player operating in the top flight.\nThe only complaint that could be levelled at Bowen against Norwich was that he didn't add to his two-goal tally, clipping an effort on to the bar and firing against the right-hand post when well placed.\nNorwich's dismal run continues\nOnly six sides in Premier League history have accumulated fewer points than Norwich after 20 games.\nAnd if their dismal run continues for much longer their hopes of survival look forlorn even if they are still currently within touching distance of fellow strugglers Watford, Newcastle and Burnley.\nSmith's side were neat and tidy in possession but produced just three shots on target, with Idah's the only one of any note.\nAside from Teemu Pukki, who has scored five times this season, only three other players have registered a top-flight goal.\nUnless the Canaries can add some firepower to support their Finland international frontman it is difficult to envisage them pulling off a great escape in their remaining 18 fixtures.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He also brought fist pumps and wild applause from his manager when he raced out of the area to head clear and snuff out Chelsea danger late on.\nCity closed out the win without any serious alarms, Guardiola and his team striking a huge blow as they try to see off the chasing pack - which is effectively Chelsea and Liverpool - at the top of the Premier League.\nChelsea show effort but no inspiration\nChelsea for long spells looked like they might leave Etihad Stadium with some reward for a performance in which they kept Manchester City at arm's length for long periods.\nIn the end, however, they were undone by that moment of De Bruyne genius and their own inability take the rare opportunities that came.\nLukaku, who looks to be struggling for form and confidence, had those opportunities that you simply must cash in on against a team going for their 12th successive league win.\nHe was in a good position to shoot in the first half as he broke clear but chose to pass up responsibility and play in Hakim Ziyech, who added to manager Tuchel's frustration by straying into an offside position.\nThe biggest chance of all came when Lukaku was played through by Kovacic in the second half with the scoreline still goalless. There was not too much wrong with his finish but it lacked a little conviction and Ederson was able to make a save that proved crucial.\nTuchel's discontent was clear throughout as he saw his team penned in by City but Chelsea could have got something, even if it may have been fortuitous in the context of the entire game.\nOnce De Bruyne ended the stalemate, Chelsea had little to offer and in reality any very slim title hopes they may have had have been extinguished completely by this defeat.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

If they want to believe they can believe,\" said Klopp after his side's 3-0 win.\n\"If you are with us, you will enjoy the ride and we will go for everything. We are ready to go as much as we can.\"\nFabinho's far-post header eased some of the tension that had built up at Anfield over 43 goalless minutes, but the home fans were relieved when Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo sliced wide from a fine position after the break.\nShortly afterwards, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain connected with an Andy Robertson cross to double the lead and Takumi Minamino came off the bench to side-foot home a third.\nIt will take a spectacular and sudden disintegration in Manchester City's form, and a near flawless run-in from Liverpool to reverse the teams' standings by May. City have dropped just 10 points so far this season.\n'Why Liverpool can climb Everest again' - Danny Murphy on why the title race is not over yet\nLiverpool find a way without star duo\nIt was the first time since May 2017 that Liverpool had lined up without either Mohamed Salah or Sadio Mane for a Premier League match. And, for a while, it showed.\nLiverpool had huffed and puffed to little effect against 10-man Arsenal in the Carabao Cup in midweek and once again they initially dominated possession without making an impression on the scoreline.\nWith Salah and Mane away on international duty, the hosts lacked the necessary guile and dexterity to prise apart the packed ranks of defenders.\nVirgil van Dijk had a close-range effort well saved by the spread-eagled Alvaro Fernandez, but otherwise Liverpool were restricted to long-range sighters, half-chance snap-shots and hopeful crosses which defenders Ethan Pinnock, Pontus Janssen and Kristoffer Ajer, all six foot four inches or more, cleared with ease.\nThe breakthrough came less than two minutes before the interval as Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner skidded through a crowded six-yard box for Fabinho to divert in at the far post.\nBrentford, with a skinny 25% of possession, had offered some threat before the opener. Ivan Toney and Vitaly Janelt were not far away with shots from a good distance out, while Liverpool's high defensive line left them looking with relief for the assistant referee's flag on a couple of other occasions.\nAnd after the break Mbeumo wasted a glaring opening. Having twisted inside Joel Matip, he had a clear sight of goal, but cracked his shot wide of the post from just inside the box.\nIt was the key moment in the game. Liverpool, stung into action, found another gear. Diogo Jota was denied by Fernandez and rattled the post before Oxlade-Chamberlain's diving header all but ended the visitors' hopes.\nOxlade-Chamberlain departed with an ankle injury and his replacement Minamino took advantage after Brentford attempted to play out from the back with calamitous consequences.\nThe final 10 minutes were played out in open style. The home fans greeted impending victory by singing the name of their former manager Rafael Benitez, who had been relieved of his duties at neighbours Everton, as 17-year-old Premier League debutant Kaide Gordon wasted a chance at one end for Liverpool and the impressive Toney did the same for the Bees at the other.\nWhile unable to match the draw they produced in the reverse fixture in September, Brentford are 10 points above the relegation zone and well on target to survive their first season in the top flight in 74 years.\nFollow live reaction to Liverpool's win, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nGo straight to the best Liverpool content\nVisit our Brentford page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

And while Wood looked short of confidence, his aerial presence occupied the Watford defence.\nIn Saint-Maximin, it looked like they had a match winner as he cut in from the left and fired past Ben Foster to light up St James' Park.\nThere was also a fine performance by Joelinton, who bossed former Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko, and hit the bar after Ryan Fraser's deflected cross.\nBut for all the plus-points, an inability to hang on to the lead proved costly once again as Lascelles and Fabian Schar were beaten to the ball. For the home side, the draw felt like a defeat.\nRecruiting in defence remains the priority for the new owners, and as boos met the final whistle, they may hasten their pursuit before a crucial game at Leeds next Saturday.\nWatford keep noses in front\nThe delight in snatching a point for Watford was in stark contrast to the bitter pill that Newcastle fans had to swallow after a scrappy affair that could have been easily filed as a relegation dogfight.\nBut for Ranieri's side, who included three new signings in Hassane Kamara, Samir and Edo Kayembe, and had Foster, Emmanuel Dennis and King back in the line-up, it was reward for their perseverance.\nFor much of the game, they conceded possession and looked like they would pay for several wasted chances from a counter-attacking approach that caused Newcastle's defence problems.\nPedro and King were a physical, rapid outlet up front and the pair, plus Sissoko, had good opportunities to equalise following Saint-Maximin's fifth goal of the season.\nBut once Newcastle weathered that response, a point looked beyond the visitors, especially with a run of six consecutive losses coming into this match.\nFemenia's cross was delicious, however, and Pedro, who had already angered the home fans after making the most of a first-half injury, had the last laugh in front of the Gallowgate End to keep Watford out of danger - with another key game against Burnley to come on Tuesday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

And while Wood looked short of confidence, his aerial presence occupied the Watford defence.\nIn Saint-Maximin, it looked like they had a match winner as he cut in from the left and fired past Ben Foster to light up St James' Park.\nThere was also a fine performance by Joelinton, who bossed former Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko, and hit the bar after Ryan Fraser's deflected cross.\nBut for all the plus-points, an inability to hang on to the lead proved costly once again as Lascelles and Fabian Schar were beaten to the ball. For the home side, the draw felt like a defeat.\nRecruiting in defence remains the priority for the new owners, and as boos met the final whistle, they may hasten their pursuit before a crucial game at Leeds next Saturday.\nWatford keep noses in front\nThe delight in snatching a point for Watford was in stark contrast to the bitter pill that Newcastle fans had to swallow after a scrappy affair that could have been easily filed as a relegation dogfight.\nBut for Ranieri's side, who included three new signings in Hassane Kamara, Samir and Edo Kayembe, and had Foster, Emmanuel Dennis and King back in the line-up, it was reward for their perseverance.\nFor much of the game, they conceded possession and looked like they would pay for several wasted chances from a counter-attacking approach that caused Newcastle's defence problems.\nPedro and King were a physical, rapid outlet up front and the pair, plus Sissoko, had good opportunities to equalise following Saint-Maximin's fifth goal of the season.\nBut once Newcastle weathered that response, a point looked beyond the visitors, especially with a run of six consecutive losses coming into this match.\nFemenia's cross was delicious, however, and Pedro, who had already angered the home fans after making the most of a first-half injury, had the last laugh in front of the Gallowgate End to keep Watford out of danger - with another key game against Burnley to come on Tuesday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He also brought fist pumps and wild applause from his manager when he raced out of the area to head clear and snuff out Chelsea danger late on.\nCity closed out the win without any serious alarms, Guardiola and his team striking a huge blow as they try to see off the chasing pack - which is effectively Chelsea and Liverpool - at the top of the Premier League.\nChelsea show effort but no inspiration\nChelsea for long spells looked like they might leave Etihad Stadium with some reward for a performance in which they kept Manchester City at arm's length for long periods.\nIn the end, however, they were undone by that moment of De Bruyne genius and their own inability take the rare opportunities that came.\nLukaku, who looks to be struggling for form and confidence, had those opportunities that you simply must cash in on against a team going for their 12th successive league win.\nHe was in a good position to shoot in the first half as he broke clear but chose to pass up responsibility and play in Hakim Ziyech, who added to manager Tuchel's frustration by straying into an offside position.\nThe biggest chance of all came when Lukaku was played through by Kovacic in the second half with the scoreline still goalless. There was not too much wrong with his finish but it lacked a little conviction and Ederson was able to make a save that proved crucial.\nTuchel's discontent was clear throughout as he saw his team penned in by City but Chelsea could have got something, even if it may have been fortuitous in the context of the entire game.\nOnce De Bruyne ended the stalemate, Chelsea had little to offer and in reality any very slim title hopes they may have had have been extinguished completely by this defeat.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Gabriel Jesus steered a header wide and Ruben Dias flicked another beyond the post, but the game turned in their favour after the break.\nCity have not lost in the league since October and have had to show resilience in their past two games to maintain their impressive winning run.\nBut, for all the goals and free-flowing football, it may just be the 1-0 win at Brentford on Wednesday and this victory - their latest winning goal in the league in more than three years - that gives City the edge come the end of the season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I'm sure it's going to help them find their confidence and to score once again.\"\nThe visitors did have chances of their own and Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier was forced into a point-blank save when Chris Wood latched on to Charlie Taylor's dangerous cross.\nDyche responded at half-time by bringing on a player who must be in the running for signing of the season, and he had an instant impact.\nIvory Coast international Cornet, bought from Lyon in the summer for \u00a312.85m, whipped a free-kick beyond Meslier from around 30 yards for his sixth goal in 10 league games.\nLeeds' own creative genius Raphinha was at his enigmatic best, almost catching Hennessey off his line from halfway with an effort that clipped the crossbar early on, but when presented a chance to win the game, the Brazilian could only steer James' teasing cross into the side-netting.\nIn the end it did not matter, with Dallas finding the corner with a well-placed left-footed effort and substitute James wrapping up the victory with a header in stoppage time.\nDyche dismissed the idea this game was more important than any other but Leeds' victory means the bottom four have been cut adrift and at this stage it looks as if only one of Watford, Burnley, Newcastle and Norwich will survive.\nDyche will be well aware Clarets need to address their away form if they are to be the ones remaining in the top flight, having not won on the road in the competition since May.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Jakub Moder fired just wide early on, Welbeck fluffed a couple of shots, crosses flew regularly through the box as the European champions dug in.\nWebster's equalising header from Alexis Mac Allister's corner was as good as any you will see - powerful and precise after a run to evade a marker and into space.\nThe harshest critic might suggest that Albion have once again failed to make their dominance count - something Potter's side were booed off the pitch for here not too long ago.\nBut this is a side punching way above its weight and on the up.\nChelsea a shadow of their former self\nThe last 21 days have been punishing for Chelsea. Seven games played in all competitions, three league points taken from a possible 12.\nTuchel reiterated afterwards the physical and mental tiredness that his injury-depleted side are suffering, showing that even one of the biggest, most expensively assembled squads is not immune to human frailty.\nAt their best last season, the Blues were a machine, strong-arming opponents into submission through a dominance of possession and tactical superiority. Here they struggled to match the intensity of their opponents and never looked in control.\nIt was telling that Ziyech did not celebrate his goal against the run of play, a reflection perhaps of the the fact the result was far from a foregone conclusion.\nAnd so it proved, with Webster evading sloppy marking to level and deny the visitors another clean sheet. They have now kept just two in their past 13 games.\nThe Blues have now also failed to win any of the past four Premier League games in which they have scored first - hardly the trait of potential champions.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He is working hard every single day,\" said Vieira.\n\"He needed a chance and he was at his best today. He showed all his potential. He deserved it for the way he has been working and waiting.\"\nPalace looked set to take all three points after Conor Gallagher scored in the 69th minute, before a late own goal from Joachim Andersen capped off an eventful encounter.\nBrighton were the better side throughout and, before Gallagher's composed finish from Jeffrey Schlupp's cut-back, they had tested Butland on a number of occasions.\nButland denied Gross from the spot in the first half, kept out Leandro Trossard following a huge error from defender Joel Ward and later tipped Jakub Moder's effort over the bar.\nBrighton's Moder also hit the crossbar within minutes of the restart after Neal Maupay had earlier bundled a finish over the line, only for the goal to be ruled out for a foul on Butland.\nBoth Maupay's disallowed effort and the awarded penalty decision came after referee Robert Jones consulted the pitchside VAR monitor effectively.\nIn a frenetic few minutes before half time, Jones awarded the spot-kick when Will Hughes had his arms around Joel Veltman but Gross' poor attempt was saved. From the resulting corner, Maupay had a high boot as he challenged Butland's grip on the ball on the goalline.\nWith three minutes left, Maupay's low cross was eventually deflected in by Andersen to seal the 1-1 draw.\nBut despite not coming away with a clean sheet, it was a pleasing night for Butland, who said his performance was \"rewarding\" and a reminder of his talent.\nThe 28-year-old, understudy to Jordan Pickford for England at the 2018 World Cup, lost his number one spot at Stoke before moving to Palace.\nThis was just his fourth Premier League start for the club and Butland said: \"I left Stoke and had been struggling confidence wise. Coming to Palace is a breath of fresh air.\n\"The chances have been few and far between and to have a night like this is rewarding and reminds me what I am capable of.\n\"There are still things to work on but it has been a long time, when you don't play as regularly as you like it is harder. This is a reminder. I feel like I have been ready for this.\"\nBrighton leave it late again\nThere had been a decisive 90th-minute goal in the previous three league encounters between these two rivals so it was inevitable late drama would feature again.\nBrighton had done everything but score when Gallagher sent the away end wild with a cool finish against the run of play.\nPalace had rarely troubled keeper Robert Sanchez - his best save was to deny team-mate Adam Webster who sent a deflection towards goal under pressure from Odsonne Edouard at the near post.\nBut Brighton, typically, did not give up and continued to put pressure on the visitors, eventually reaping the rewards when Maupay's low cross was flicked in by the unfortunate Andersen.\nManager Graham Potter had looked distraught when Gallagher scored for Palace, but he had clenched fists and a look of relief when his side hit back with time running out.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

If they want to believe they can believe,\" said Klopp after his side's 3-0 win.\n\"If you are with us, you will enjoy the ride and we will go for everything. We are ready to go as much as we can.\"\nFabinho's far-post header eased some of the tension that had built up at Anfield over 43 goalless minutes, but the home fans were relieved when Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo sliced wide from a fine position after the break.\nShortly afterwards, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain connected with an Andy Robertson cross to double the lead and Takumi Minamino came off the bench to side-foot home a third.\nIt will take a spectacular and sudden disintegration in Manchester City's form, and a near flawless run-in from Liverpool to reverse the teams' standings by May. City have dropped just 10 points so far this season.\n'Why Liverpool can climb Everest again' - Danny Murphy on why the title race is not over yet\nLiverpool find a way without star duo\nIt was the first time since May 2017 that Liverpool had lined up without either Mohamed Salah or Sadio Mane for a Premier League match. And, for a while, it showed.\nLiverpool had huffed and puffed to little effect against 10-man Arsenal in the Carabao Cup in midweek and once again they initially dominated possession without making an impression on the scoreline.\nWith Salah and Mane away on international duty, the hosts lacked the necessary guile and dexterity to prise apart the packed ranks of defenders.\nVirgil van Dijk had a close-range effort well saved by the spread-eagled Alvaro Fernandez, but otherwise Liverpool were restricted to long-range sighters, half-chance snap-shots and hopeful crosses which defenders Ethan Pinnock, Pontus Janssen and Kristoffer Ajer, all six foot four inches or more, cleared with ease.\nThe breakthrough came less than two minutes before the interval as Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner skidded through a crowded six-yard box for Fabinho to divert in at the far post.\nBrentford, with a skinny 25% of possession, had offered some threat before the opener. Ivan Toney and Vitaly Janelt were not far away with shots from a good distance out, while Liverpool's high defensive line left them looking with relief for the assistant referee's flag on a couple of other occasions.\nAnd after the break Mbeumo wasted a glaring opening. Having twisted inside Joel Matip, he had a clear sight of goal, but cracked his shot wide of the post from just inside the box.\nIt was the key moment in the game. Liverpool, stung into action, found another gear. Diogo Jota was denied by Fernandez and rattled the post before Oxlade-Chamberlain's diving header all but ended the visitors' hopes.\nOxlade-Chamberlain departed with an ankle injury and his replacement Minamino took advantage after Brentford attempted to play out from the back with calamitous consequences.\nThe final 10 minutes were played out in open style. The home fans greeted impending victory by singing the name of their former manager Rafael Benitez, who had been relieved of his duties at neighbours Everton, as 17-year-old Premier League debutant Kaide Gordon wasted a chance at one end for Liverpool and the impressive Toney did the same for the Bees at the other.\nWhile unable to match the draw they produced in the reverse fixture in September, Brentford are 10 points above the relegation zone and well on target to survive their first season in the top flight in 74 years.\nFollow live reaction to Liverpool's win, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nGo straight to the best Liverpool content\nVisit our Brentford page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They are fighting for each other and fighting for the club.\n\"They have belief that we're not dead and buried and there's more to come. I'm so pleased for everybody connected with Newcastle that we won the game. It was a big match and hopefully it can transform our season.\"\nLeeds had earlier wasted a great chance through Jack Harrison, whose goal-bound shot was well-blocked by Fabian Schar, and they paid for the absence of injured striker Patrick Bamford.\nIt proved a turning point as Newcastle resiliently held on, despite dropping 21 points from winning positions already this season.\nAfter Norwich's win over Watford, Howe's side failed to exit the bottom three, but such a victory provides a much-needed boost ahead of a two-week break where the team will travel to Saudi Arabia for a training trip.\nHowe's methods starting to bear fruit\nThe significance of Shelvey's goal and the three points for Newcastle cannot be underestimated in the context of what has been a difficult season for the visitors.\nFollowing the club's October takeover by new Saudi owners, it was hoped a poor start could be eliminated once Howe was appointed as the new manager.\nFurther hope came when they entered the transfer window as Kieran Trippier and Chris Wood joined the club. But a porous defence has hampered their attempts to move up the table and frustrations in the transfer market this week led to a feeling among some fans that relegation looked increasingly likely.\nQuestions about their upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia hardly helped the mood.\nBut to hang on for a precious success sparked delight at the final whistle among the players and Howe, as Trippier and the manager led the applause in front of their travelling fans.\nThere were some fine displays from the visitors, who were tested by Marcelo Bielsa's team in a, sometimes, frantic game where only poor finishing let both sides down.\nWillock, who replaced Sean Longstaff in the starting line-up, showed his quality with some fine ball-carrying which not only relieved pressure on the defence but added to Allan Saint-Maximin's presence in attack. The former Arsenal player could also have scored in stoppage-time but Meslier denied him with a good save.\nSchar's block proved crucial, while Longstaff - who replaced the injured Joelinton before the break - also contributed to a team performance which will give Howe hope for the future.\nThere have been questions about whether Howe was best suited to keep Newcastle in the top flight despite a previous relegation with Bournemouth. But after a positive display which only ended with a draw against Watford last week, this showed his team are moving in the right direction.\nHowe said the win was also down to the \"power of recruitment\" and said the club was still active in the transfer market.\nHe added: \"Wood and Trippier were magnificent for the team. I thought they made huge contributions to the match and that's the power if you can get [recruitment] right, you can elevate the team.\n\"We're still looking to do that, but I do back the players that we have here already.\"\nAlthough Leeds missed Bamford, they still created chances through Raphinha, who had Paul Dummett on toast, and Harrison, who caused problems for Trippier.\nJames also lacked the killer instinct up front even if his hard work and endeavour was appreciated by the partisan home support.\nFor the first 20 minutes, it was Leeds who looked most likely to score. But once Shelvey's left-footed volley was saved by Meslier, Newcastle brought a balance to the game which they did not relinquish.\nWood, facing a former side and targeted with \"greedy\" chants by the home fans after his \u00a325m move from Burnley, had another quiet match and twice failed to connect when set up by Trippier and Ryan Fraser.\nBut as the game became more feisty in the second half, Shelvey kept a cool head to send the Newcastle fans home with a rare moment this season to enjoy their Saturday night.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

In a game of few chances, Jarrod Bowen drove a shot into the side-netting before Tomas Soucek's glancing header bounced just wide of the far post with four minutes remaining.\nBut Rashford had the final word as United secured back-to-back wins for the first time under Ralf Rangnick.\nThe result takes United into the top four for the first time in three months, with the Hammers dropping down to fifth, although Tottenham and Arsenal could overtake them if they win their games on Sunday.\nUnited's season stabilised\nSuch has been the difficulty of United's season, entering the rare January international break on the back of one defeat in 13 games since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal on 21 November has to be seen as relative success.\nThere are still numerous problems for Rangnick to address, most immediately the futures of Martial, who was greeted with boos and cheers as he was introduced for the first time since Rangnick's arrival amid interest from Sevilla and his well-publicised desire to leave, and Jesse Lingard before the transfer window closes on 31 January.\nA season spiralling out of control has been stabilised to an extent but this latest effort was unconvincing and another of those days when Cristiano Ronaldo failed to live up to his superstar billing.\nThe neck injury Rangnick revealed Ronaldo was suffering from in the build-up to the game eased sufficiently to allow the 36-year-old to start but there was little in his performance to suggest he was happy with his situation.\nAn elaborate tee-up to a 25-yard free-kick only produced a shot straight into the wall and then he moaned at Mason Greenwood for not crossing the rebound into an area he had ventured into rather than shooting, which is what the youngster did.\nPasses went astray too frequently and a penalty claim was waved away by referee Jon Moss.\nRonaldo was still shaking his head minutes later but TV replays showed Kurt Zouma made little meaningful contact with the United forward, certainly not enough to send him flying in the box.\nThere was more elaborate complaining after half-time when he was penalised for a high kick on Craig Dawson, whose head, Ronaldo felt, was too low.\nRangnick stuck with the veteran though. And, with the rest of his team-mates, he was celebrating at the final whistle.\nRice unrewarded\nOf England's Euro 2020 heroes from last summer, none has kicked on in their club careers the way Declan Rice has.\nWest Ham fans will hate it and, as Moyes points out, the 23-year-old has a contract that runs to 2024. But Rice is hot property.\nWhen he strode from the tunnel first before kick-off, it was impossible not to think he might be doing that walk on a more regular basis in future.\nHis screening of the Hammers' defence was immaculate and the way he nipped in to dispossess Ronaldo, before racing away from his opponent as he tried to win the ball back, had a touch of impudence and authority in equal measure.\nAs Moyes' awful personal run of away games without a win at 'big six' teams extends to 45, Rice will know many of those clubs would take him right now.\nEven with a European campaign to look forward to in the second half of the season, West Ham know keeping their skipper will be the biggest task of the summer.\nManchester United's next game is in the FA Cup, against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford, on Friday, 4 February (20:00 GMT).

He didn't need to join a 17th club in his stellar career.\nBut football is Hodgson's life. The former England boss thrives on the challenge and he even joked afterwards that he did not notice the horrific weather conditions.\n\"I was aware of the wind and rain because of how it was affecting the game. It was only at half-time when I came in and saw how wet I'd got that I realised how much it was raining!\" he added.\nHe will be delighted with the clean sheet, even if he failed to join the company of Xisco Munoz, who remains alone among Watford's last 11 managers to win his first game.\nWatford did have chances. Joao Pedro should have done better with a second-half header that went straight to Nick Pope, who was tested to a far greater degree by Tom Cleverley's long-range effort in the final stages.\nIn Moussa Sissoko and Edo Kayembe, Watford were able to gain control in midfield, which meant Burnley were never able to generate a head of steam that might seriously threaten a home win.\nBurnley lack cutting edge\nDyche can only hope the Weghorst and Cornet combination eventually click into gear as the lack of goals is a clear threat to their five-year stay in the top flight.\nIn patches, both looked decent, without truly getting on top of the Watford backline.\nAnd Burnley's hopes were not helped by repeatedly gifting their opponents possession with poor passing under minimal pressure.\nMee was particularly wasteful, which was not the way he would have wanted to mark a decade of outstanding service.\nHe came perilously close to turning the ball into his own goal and was relieved that first, Aaron Lennon stopped the ball, before his central defensive partner Tarkowski cleared it.\nSubstitute Jay Rodriguez steered a header wide of the far post in the latter stages, although by then, it appeared both sides had settled for a point.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

In a game of few chances, Jarrod Bowen drove a shot into the side-netting before Tomas Soucek's glancing header bounced just wide of the far post with four minutes remaining.\nBut Rashford had the final word as United secured back-to-back wins for the first time under Ralf Rangnick.\nThe result takes United into the top four for the first time in three months, with the Hammers dropping down to fifth, although Tottenham and Arsenal could overtake them if they win their games on Sunday.\nUnited's season stabilised\nSuch has been the difficulty of United's season, entering the rare January international break on the back of one defeat in 13 games since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal on 21 November has to be seen as relative success.\nThere are still numerous problems for Rangnick to address, most immediately the futures of Martial, who was greeted with boos and cheers as he was introduced for the first time since Rangnick's arrival amid interest from Sevilla and his well-publicised desire to leave, and Jesse Lingard before the transfer window closes on 31 January.\nA season spiralling out of control has been stabilised to an extent but this latest effort was unconvincing and another of those days when Cristiano Ronaldo failed to live up to his superstar billing.\nThe neck injury Rangnick revealed Ronaldo was suffering from in the build-up to the game eased sufficiently to allow the 36-year-old to start but there was little in his performance to suggest he was happy with his situation.\nAn elaborate tee-up to a 25-yard free-kick only produced a shot straight into the wall and then he moaned at Mason Greenwood for not crossing the rebound into an area he had ventured into rather than shooting, which is what the youngster did.\nPasses went astray too frequently and a penalty claim was waved away by referee Jon Moss.\nRonaldo was still shaking his head minutes later but TV replays showed Kurt Zouma made little meaningful contact with the United forward, certainly not enough to send him flying in the box.\nThere was more elaborate complaining after half-time when he was penalised for a high kick on Craig Dawson, whose head, Ronaldo felt, was too low.\nRangnick stuck with the veteran though. And, with the rest of his team-mates, he was celebrating at the final whistle.\nRice unrewarded\nOf England's Euro 2020 heroes from last summer, none has kicked on in their club careers the way Declan Rice has.\nWest Ham fans will hate it and, as Moyes points out, the 23-year-old has a contract that runs to 2024. But Rice is hot property.\nWhen he strode from the tunnel first before kick-off, it was impossible not to think he might be doing that walk on a more regular basis in future.\nHis screening of the Hammers' defence was immaculate and the way he nipped in to dispossess Ronaldo, before racing away from his opponent as he tried to win the ball back, had a touch of impudence and authority in equal measure.\nAs Moyes' awful personal run of away games without a win at 'big six' teams extends to 45, Rice will know many of those clubs would take him right now.\nEven with a European campaign to look forward to in the second half of the season, West Ham know keeping their skipper will be the biggest task of the summer.\nManchester United's next game is in the FA Cup, against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford, on Friday, 4 February (20:00 GMT). West Ham are in FA Cup action the following day, at non-league Kidderminster (12:30 GMT).\nReaction to Manchester United v West Ham United, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to the best Manchester United content\nVisit our West Ham page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

To get your first goal and then your second after was pretty crazy,\" said Sargent. \"It was a big game for us so a great night overall.\n\"Obviously being in the relegation zone means every game is big for us, but to get a win against the team right in front of us is huge.\"\nSargent had endured a frustrating season in front of goal, failing to find the net in 18 league games, but acrobatically hooked Teemu Pukki's cross from behind him and saw it bounce in off the underside of the crossbar for Norwich's opener.\nHis thumping header made it 2-0 after a lengthy stoppage in play because of a floodlight fault and he celebrated wildly, before paying tribute to his newborn child.\n\"After the first one I didn't celebrate for my newborn baby so I knew the wife would be on my case. I thought I need to do it now!\" he added.\n\"It's been a crazy couple of weeks obviously but I'm very happy. It's been amazing.\"\nNorwich rubbed salt in Watford's wounds with a third goal late on - substitute Juraj Kucka poking past his own goalkeeper at the near post.\nWatford were further hampered by Emmanuel Dennis' sending off - the forward shown a second yellow card by referee Mike Dean for a rash challenge on Max Aarons.\nShortly before Kucka poked in Adam Idah's pull-back, Watford had a goal disallowed when Moussa Sissoko thumped in a stunning volley from an offside position, and Cucho Hernandez later hit the crossbar.\nClaudio Ranieri's side still have two games in hand but it was an 11th defeat in 13 games during his Watford tenure, while Dennis' sending-off means he will miss another crucial relegation battle with bottom side Burnley on 5 February.\nReaction to Norwich's win over Watford\nFootball Daily Podcast: All over for Ranieri?\nRanieri wants players to 'fight' for Watford\nPressure mounts on relegation rivals\nSargent's exuberant celebrations, echoed by the visiting Norwich supporters, showed how important this victory was to Dean Smith's side.\nIt is the first time this season Norwich have moved out of the bottom three, while defeat for Watford piles more pressure on manager Ranieri.\nNorwich were most people's favourites to go down at Christmas but back-to-back wins over Everton and Watford have seen them shoot up the table from bottom to 17th in just over a week.\nThe relegation battle promises to continue as Burnley, now propping up the table, have five games in hand on Norwich, having had numerous games postponed because of Covid-19 cases and injuries.\nWatford and Newcastle United also have games in hand, but with no side in the current bottom six winning more than five games this season, Norwich will be heavily boosted by their recent victories.\nThe Canaries face a tough February including games against Manchester City and Liverpool, but Watford are under pressure to bounce back against Burnley in their next match having already dropped points to relegation rivals Norwich and Newcastle in recent games.",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Leeds United 0-1 Newcastle United: Shelvey strikes winner at Elland Road\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe hopes his team's \"massive\" victory at Leeds can \"transform our season\" as they fight to avoid relegation.\nJonjo Shelvey's 20-yard free-kick earned what was only a second win of the season in an energetic and tempestuous encounter where both sides struggled to make the most of first-half chances.\nBut after Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka saved Dan James' point-blank shot and Illan Meslier palmed Shelvey's volley away, the visitors finally found a breakthrough.\nThe 75th-minute goal came from a brilliant run by substitute Javier Manquillo, who was brought down on the edge of the box.\nShelvey stepped up and fired past Meslier, who perhaps should have done better, given the ball went in on his side of the goal.\nHowe said: \"Today we learned that there's a resilience in the team. They are fighting for each other and fighting for the club.\n\"They have belief that we're not dead and buried and there's more to come. I'm so pleased for everybody connected with Newcastle that we won the game. It was a big match and hopefully it can transform our season.\"\nLeeds had earlier wasted a great chance through Jack Harrison, whose goal-bound shot was well-blocked by Fabian Schar, and they paid for the absence of injured striker Patrick Bamford.\nIt proved a turning point as Newcastle resiliently held on, despite dropping 21 points from winning positions already this season.\nAfter Norwich's win over Watford, Howe's side failed to exit the bottom three, but such a victory provides a much-needed boost ahead of a two-week break where the team will travel to Saudi Arabia for a training trip.\nHowe's methods starting to bear fruit\nThe significance of Shelvey's goal and the three points for Newcastle cannot be underestimated in the context of what has been a difficult season for the visitors.\nFollowing the club's October takeover by new Saudi owners, it was hoped a poor start could be eliminated once Howe was appointed as the new manager.\nFurther hope came when they entered the transfer window as Kieran Trippier and Chris Wood joined the club. But a porous defence has hampered their attempts to move up the table and frustrations in the transfer market this week led to a feeling among some fans that relegation looked increasingly likely.\nQuestions about their upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia hardly helped the mood.\nBut to hang on for a precious success sparked delight at the final whistle among the players and Howe, as Trippier and the manager led the applause in front of their travelling fans.\nThere were some fine displays from the visitors, who were tested by Marcelo Bielsa's team in a, sometimes, frantic game where only poor finishing let both sides down.\nWillock, who replaced Sean Longstaff in the starting line-up, showed his quality with some fine ball-carrying which not only relieved pressure on the defence but added to Allan Saint-Maximin's presence in attack. The former Arsenal player could also have scored in stoppage-time but Meslier denied him with a good save.\nSchar's block proved crucial, while Longstaff - who replaced the injured Joelinton before the break - also contributed to a team performance which will give Howe hope for the future.\nThere have been questions about whether Howe was best suited to keep Newcastle in the top flight despite a previous relegation with Bournemouth. But after a positive display which only ended with a draw against Watford last week, this showed his team are moving in the right direction.\nHowe said the win was also down to the \"power of recruitment\" and said the club was still active in the transfer market.\nHe added: \"Wood and Trippier were magnificent for the team. I thought they made huge contributions to the match and that's the power if you can get [recruitment] right, you can elevate the team.\n\"We're still looking to do that, but I do back the players that we have here already.\"\nAlthough Leeds missed Bamford, they still created chances through Raphinha, who had Paul Dummett on toast, and Harrison, who caused problems for Trippier.\nJames also lacked the killer instinct up front even if his hard work and endeavour was appreciated by the partisan home support.\nFor the first 20 minutes, it was Leeds who looked most likely to score. But once Shelvey's left-footed volley was saved by Meslier, Newcastle brought a balance to the game which they did not relinquish.\nWood, facing a former side and targeted with \"greedy\" chants by the home fans after his \u00a325m move from Burnley, had another quiet match and twice failed to connect when set up by Trippier and Ryan Fraser.\nBut as the game became more feisty in the second half, Shelvey kept a cool head to send the Newcastle fans home with a rare moment this season to enjoy their Saturday night.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

When play did eventually resume, 19 minutes were added on at the end of the first half.\n\"It was a strange first half,\" Wolves manager Bruno Lage said afterwards. \"They tried to understand what happened, tried to find the man who controlled the drone.\n\"We came inside and talked a little bit about the game. Sometimes we don't have that time during the game to chat.\"\nLage's opposite number Thomas Frank said: \"It was a crazy game - we 100% didn't deserve to lose at all.\n\"We started fantastic until the break with the drone and the two concussion things. We were aggressive, good on the break, but after that Wolves were better.\"\nThe visitors took a deserved lead three minutes into the second half when Joao Moutinho played a neat one-two with Nelson Semedo before finding the far corner with the outside of his right foot.\nIvan Toney steered home Bryan Mbeumo's free-kick to equalise against the run of play, moments after Bankes had overturned his decision to send off Wolves defender Toti Gomes for a challenge on Kristoffer Ajer.\nBut Neves restored the visitors' lead with a well-placed finish into the bottom corner from the edge of the box, before Adama Traore had a goal ruled out for offside in second-half stoppage time.\nBrentford manager Frank was shown a second yellow card for remonstrating with referee Bankes after the final whistle.\nThe win extends Wolves' unbeaten run in all competitions to six games, while Brentford have now lost their last four Premier League fixtures - although they remain eight points above the bottom three.\nWolves victorious on bizarre afternoon\nBrentford were starting to stamp their authority on the game when the collision between Janssen and Henry left both players covered in blood and requiring lengthy treatment on the pitch. The pair were eventually taken off as concussion substitutions.\nAn even longer stoppage followed when the drone was spotted near the roof of the stadium, resulting in the players being taken off.\nWhen the game restarted, Lage's team gradually began to pin the Bees inside their own half and broke the deadlock when Moutinho curled home his second goal in three league appearances.\nToney's clinical finish from Mbeumo's delivery - the striker's seventh goal in all competitions this season - was the hosts' first effort on target and looked for a while like it might earn them an unlikely point, but Frank's team were firmly second best and have their work cut out to arrest a worrying run.\nAddressing his dismissal after full-time, the 48-year-old manager said: \"I will put my hands up. I tell my players to keep their emotions in check and not get stupid cards and of course that was stupid of me.\n\"The first yellow was for confronting a Wolves player and then I, irritated, turned around and [the referee] said it was too aggressive.\"\nAs for Wolves, they have now won four of their past five league matches and trail fourth-placed Manchester United by just four points, with a game in hand on Ralf Rangnick's side.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Taking possession inside his own half close to the touchline, he spun round, away from a Burnley defender into space and was perfectly placed to switch play across the pitch.\nInstead, Pogba smashed the ball down the touchline to no-one. Those infuriating moments have happened far too frequently since he returned to Old Trafford for a second time in 2016 and explains why not many United fans will shed a tear if Pogba leaves the club for nothing for a second time when his contract expires at the end of the season.\nWhen United were chasing the game, Pogba didn't really step up either, although for the second successive game, interim boss Ralf Rangnick will wonder about a VAR decision that went against his team.\nThis time, it was Varane who had what would have been his first goal for the club ruled out.\nEven though the Frenchman was clearly onside as he ran onto a Bruno Fernandes free-kick before steering a header into the far corner, Harry Maguire was offside before he blocked Rodriguez's attempt to get back ad defend. After consulting the monitor, referee Mike Dean ruled the effort out.\nAnother goal, when Josh Brownhill turned in a Rashford cross, was disallowed by a foul from Pogba on Ben Mee in the build-up.\nFollow live text and radio commentary of Burnley v Manchester United, plus Tuesday's two other Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best Burnley content\nVisit our Man Utd page\nNew boy Weghorst shows his strengths\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche invested \u00a312m in Netherlands striker Weghorst last month as a replacement for Chris Wood, who left for relegation rivals Newcastle.\nAgainst Watford on Saturday and the first-half here, Weghorst was on the periphery, with a few decent touches but not much else to show for his efforts.\nWithin the first 10 minutes of the second period, though, the 29-year-old showed what an asset he could be.\nQuestions could be asked about Maguire letting Weghorst turn and run free in the build-up to Rodriguez's equaliser but the forward had the nimbleness to take advantage and his pass was perfect.\nWeghorst then brought an excellent full-length save out of De Gea with a shot from outside the box.\nIt was an object lesson in maximising what you have.\nAnd while Newcastle's win took the gloss off Burnley's result, Dyche's side have now avoided defeat against Arsenal and Manchester United in the past three games and provides some reason for optimism ahead of Liverpool's visit to Turf Moor on Sunday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The Denmark international made two stunning stops to deny Welbeck and Trossard either side of the equaliser.\nThe home side had started the brighter and had the best chance of the first half when Barnes seized onto a loose pass and played in Ademola Lookman, who could only side-foot straight at Sanchez.\nThey caught Brighton cold within seconds of the restart when James Maddison's shot deflected straight to Barnes, whose stabbed effort was then parried into the path of Daka who scored his ninth goal of an impressive first season at the King Power Stadium.\nBut instead of building on that goal Leicester appeared to retreat in their shell and instead it was Brighton who finished the game well on top.\nResilient Brighton score late yet again\nBrighton were second-best for large parts of this game but their resilience paid off, with Welbeck's goal the eighth time they have scored in the final 10 minutes of a Premier League game this season.\nIt is the 12th time the Seagulls have drawn in the Premier League this season and extends their unbeaten run to six games, with a top-10 finish and challenge for the European places now looking likely.\nThey suffered a blow before kick-off when it was confirmed assistant boss Billy Reid had joined manager Graham Potter in testing positive for Covid-19, with first-team coach Bjorn Hamberg in the dugout.\nThey recalled first-choice forward pair Maupay and Trossard after they only featured off the bench against Chelsea in midweek, but struggled to create many clear-cut opportunities.\nBut as the nerves started to creep into Leicester's play the arrival of Welbeck and Tariq Lamptey just after the hour changed the game.\nLamptey was a constant threat down the right, though it was Maupay who provided the cross from that flank for Welbeck to bury a fine header beyond Schmeichel.\nIt could have been even better for Brighton when Trossard broke clear inside the area, but Schmeichel did superbly to parry his drilled effort.\nReaction to Leicester v Brighton, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nGo straight to the best Leicester content\nVisit our Brighton page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment."

Trippier, Newcastle's first signing of the transfer window and a statement signing in many regards, stepped up to fire in a delicious free-kick to give the home fans breathing space and an exultant feeling that Premier League survival looks more likely.\nEverton dragged into a dogfight\nLampard had tried to urge calmness from his side heading into a pivotal week where they faced Newcastle and Leeds, but following a feel-good win against Brentford in the FA Cup last Saturday, this result brought Everton back down to earth.\nTwo wins in 16 matches tell of a side short of confidence after Rafael Benitez's unsuccessful reign, and they will need to show greater resilience in what will now be a fight to avoid relegation.\nThe squad that Lampard inherited has been boosted by the additions of Alli and Van de Beek, who both made their debuts, but they will need to find a rhythm soon as Lampard seeks to employ a more creative approach to the side.\nGordon was their most impressive player in a frantic first half, and it was his free-kick that set up their goal.\nBut there were two key moments in the build-up to that which Lampard may refer to as turning points in the game.\nHaving already lost Demarai Gray to injury, Yerry Mina was forced off as Gordon attacked down the left. And subsequently Shelvey was fortunate to stay on the pitch after wrapping his legs around the Everton winger.\nBeing unable to hold onto the lead will have been a disappointment, too, but other than half chances for Richarlison, and a Gordon shot which was saved, opportunities were rare.\nJordan Pickford did well to keep his cool after a barrage of abuse from the Newcastle fans and made a brilliant save to deny Joelinton.\nBut Everton's poor evening was summed up when the former Sunderland keeper made a hash of a clearance, which led to even worse from Jarrad Branthwaite, resulting in a corner which the home support relished.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

But on this form, he will make it tough for first-choice number nine Patrick Bamford to return to the side when he is fit.\nHis second goal was a sign that his small stature need not restrict him, with him leaping high above bigger Villa players in the box to head in after Rodrigo's cross had looped his way.\nHe was a solid Emiliano Martinez save and a few inches and a crossbar away from claiming the match ball.\nBetween his two goals, though, Villa's own mercurial pair had swung the game firmly the home side's way.\nCoutinho was a livewire, ghosting into space - most notably for his low finish from Matty Cash's cross to make it 1-1 - nutmegging opponents seemingly at will and threading defence-splitting passes.\nTwo of these found Ramsey, who underlined his growing reputation as a box-to-box midfielder of true elite potential. There is no greater praise than to suggest his driving runs and drilled finishes were reminiscent of the man under whom he is now learning - Villa boss Steven Gerrard.\nYou could have been forgiven for thinking Leeds' race was run, but they refused to lie down and forced themselves level.\nMings was fortunate to bundle a Pascal Struijk header from a corner wide with a combination of shoulder and cheek, but erred from another corner soon after, gifting Llorente the leveller with his dire attempted hack clear.\nVilla lost Emiliano Buendia to injury, Coutinho to tiring legs and then Konsa to a rush of blood and red card.\nLeeds had plenty of the ball and opportunities to fashion a winner, but six goals and a point each was probably a welcome return for both at the end of a classic encounter.\n\"Chaos is the right word,\" said Villa boss Steven Gerrard. \"Even I needed a breather at half time. It was a great advert for the Premier League but we need to improve defensively and stop giving sloppy goals away.\n\"A lot to be pleased about. Our goals were superb. We conceded at a poor time just before the break but Leeds probably deserved that. It was certainly not a game for coaches but for fans.\"\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa told BBC Match of the Day: \"It was a disputed game. The dominance was alternate with moments for one team with possibilities and then the other way around as well.\n\"At the start I don't know exactly when we were dominating until and were superior but some things we didn't continue doing and the game became unbalanced.\n\"It was difficult but we got a stimulus at the end of the first half which got us closer. In the second half we slowly started to deserve a draw.\n\"A draw was the fair result.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Trippier, Newcastle's first signing of the transfer window and a statement signing in many regards, stepped up to fire in a delicious free-kick to give the home fans breathing space and an exultant feeling that Premier League survival looks more likely.\nEverton dragged into a dogfight\nLampard had tried to urge calmness from his side heading into a pivotal week where they faced Newcastle and Leeds, but following a feel-good win against Brentford in the FA Cup last Saturday, this result brought Everton back down to earth.\nTwo wins in 16 matches tell of a side short of confidence after Rafael Benitez's unsuccessful reign, and they will need to show greater resilience in what will now be a fight to avoid relegation.\nThe squad that Lampard inherited has been boosted by the additions of Alli and Van de Beek, who both made their debuts, but they will need to find a rhythm soon as Lampard seeks to employ a more creative approach to the side.\nGordon was their most impressive player in a frantic first half, and it was his free-kick that set up their goal.\nBut there were two key moments in the build-up to that which Lampard may refer to as turning points in the game.\nHaving already lost Demarai Gray to injury, Yerry Mina was forced off as Gordon attacked down the left. And subsequently Shelvey was fortunate to stay on the pitch after wrapping his legs around the Everton winger.\nBeing unable to hold onto the lead will have been a disappointment, too, but other than half chances for Richarlison, and a Gordon shot which was saved, opportunities were rare.\nJordan Pickford did well to keep his cool after a barrage of abuse from the Newcastle fans and made a brilliant save to deny Joelinton.\nBut Everton's poor evening was summed up when the former Sunderland keeper made a hash of a clearance, which led to even worse from Jarrad Branthwaite, resulting in a corner which the home support relished.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

But on this form, he will make it tough for first-choice number nine Patrick Bamford to return to the side when he is fit.\nHis second goal was a sign that his small stature need not restrict him, with him leaping high above bigger Villa players in the box to head in after Rodrigo's cross had looped his way.\nHe was a solid Emiliano Martinez save and a few inches and a crossbar away from claiming the match ball.\nBetween his two goals, though, Villa's own mercurial pair had swung the game firmly the home side's way.\nCoutinho was a livewire, ghosting into space - most notably for his low finish from Matty Cash's cross to make it 1-1 - nutmegging opponents seemingly at will and threading defence-splitting passes.\nTwo of these found Ramsey, who underlined his growing reputation as a box-to-box midfielder of true elite potential. There is no greater praise than to suggest his driving runs and drilled finishes were reminiscent of the man under whom he is now learning - Villa boss Steven Gerrard.\nYou could have been forgiven for thinking Leeds' race was run, but they refused to lie down and forced themselves level.\nMings was fortunate to bundle a Pascal Struijk header from a corner wide with a combination of shoulder and cheek, but erred from another corner soon after, gifting Llorente the leveller with his dire attempted hack clear.\nVilla lost Emiliano Buendia to injury, Coutinho to tiring legs and then Konsa to a rush of blood and red card.\nLeeds had plenty of the ball and opportunities to fashion a winner, but six goals and a point each was probably a welcome return for both at the end of a classic encounter.\n\"Chaos is the right word,\" said Villa boss Steven Gerrard. \"Even I needed a breather at half time. It was a great advert for the Premier League but we need to improve defensively and stop giving sloppy goals away.\n\"A lot to be pleased about. Our goals were superb. We conceded at a poor time just before the break but Leeds probably deserved that. It was certainly not a game for coaches but for fans.\"\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa told BBC Match of the Day: \"It was a disputed game. The dominance was alternate with moments for one team with possibilities and then the other way around as well.\n\"At the start I don't know exactly when we were dominating until and were superior but some things we didn't continue doing and the game became unbalanced.\n\"It was difficult but we got a stimulus at the end of the first half which got us closer. In the second half we slowly started to deserve a draw.\n\"A draw was the fair result.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Taking possession inside his own half close to the touchline, he spun round, away from a Burnley defender into space and was perfectly placed to switch play across the pitch.\nInstead, Pogba smashed the ball down the touchline to no-one. Those infuriating moments have happened far too frequently since he returned to Old Trafford for a second time in 2016 and explains why not many United fans will shed a tear if Pogba leaves the club for nothing for a second time when his contract expires at the end of the season.\nWhen United were chasing the game, Pogba didn't really step up either, although for the second successive game, interim boss Ralf Rangnick will wonder about a VAR decision that went against his team.\nThis time, it was Varane who had what would have been his first goal for the club ruled out.\nEven though the Frenchman was clearly onside as he ran onto a Bruno Fernandes free-kick before steering a header into the far corner, Harry Maguire was offside before he blocked Rodriguez's attempt to get back ad defend. After consulting the monitor, referee Mike Dean ruled the effort out.\nAnother goal, when Josh Brownhill turned in a Rashford cross, was disallowed by a foul from Pogba on Ben Mee in the build-up.\nFollow live text and radio commentary of Burnley v Manchester United, plus Tuesday's two other Premier League matches\nGo straight to all the best Burnley content\nVisit our Man Utd page\nNew boy Weghorst shows his strengths\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche invested \u00a312m in Netherlands striker Weghorst last month as a replacement for Chris Wood, who left for relegation rivals Newcastle.\nAgainst Watford on Saturday and the first-half here, Weghorst was on the periphery, with a few decent touches but not much else to show for his efforts.\nWithin the first 10 minutes of the second period, though, the 29-year-old showed what an asset he could be.\nQuestions could be asked about Maguire letting Weghorst turn and run free in the build-up to Rodriguez's equaliser but the forward had the nimbleness to take advantage and his pass was perfect.\nWeghorst then brought an excellent full-length save out of De Gea with a shot from outside the box.\nIt was an object lesson in maximising what you have.\nAnd while Newcastle's win took the gloss off Burnley's result, Dyche's side have now avoided defeat against Arsenal and Manchester United in the past three games and provides some reason for optimism ahead of Liverpool's visit to Turf Moor on Sunday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

When he did, a sublime curling strike rattled the crossbar.\nLeicester will rue the missed opportunity from James Maddison at 0-0 as the Englishman found space down the left edge of the area but his rising shot was pushed over the bar by Alisson.\nLeicester's poor season sees them stay in 12th place in the table, 10 points adrift of a Europa Conference League spot.\nFootball Daily podcast: Diogo's double, another Arsenal red & Rooney's darkest moments\nRelive Liverpool's victory over Leicester\nReds show their strength in depth\nLiverpool's season was going to be derailed once Salah and Sadio Mane went off to the Africa Cup of Nations - well that was the theory anyway. But it has not materialised that way.\nKlopp's side are growing in confidence and swatted aside Leicester with ease to stretch their run to just one defeat in their last 19 games in all competitions - ironically a loss at the Foxes on 28 December.\nIn reaching the Carabao Cup final, still in both the Champions League and FA Cup, and sitting second in the top flight, Liverpool remain in contention for an unprecedented quadruple of trophies.\nAnd the options available to Klopp now mean an already fearsome attacking line is further bolstered by the arrival of Diaz, who was making his first start for the club.\nThe former Porto man showed good touches in the final third and was unfortunate not to get on the scoresheet in front of the Kop, seeing a swerving shot and close-range drive batted out by Schmeichel.\nIf the Colombian needs any inspiration from a new signing at Liverpool, he needs to look no further than Jota, who has now scored 17 goals in all competitions this season.\nArriving from Wolves for a hefty \u00a345m at the start of last season, Jota's goalscoring performances are not only highlighting the depth of the team, but giving Klopp a good headache of who to select in the front three.\nSalah was on the bench this time after his run to the Afcon final with Egypt, beaten by team-mate Mane's Senegal on penalties, and introduced in the second half.\nOn another day he might have had a hat-trick, but a shot at the near post and a one-on-one effort was kept out by the impressive Schmeichel, as well as hitting the woodwork with another classy attempt.\nFamiliar frailties for Foxes\nLeicester are enduring a difficult season and were humiliated by Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest on Sunday, as the holders were knocked out of the FA Cup with a 4-1 loss.\nAfter that game, a furious Brendan Rodgers described the performance as \"awful\" and one that left him \"embarrassed\", and suggesting \"time could be up\" for some players in the squad.\nAlthough Thursday's defeat was not another crushing loss, Leicester were clearly second best throughout the contest and failed to get near the opposition for large periods.\nThey had just one shot on target, Maddison's early effort, but familiar frailties came to the fore once more as they conceded from a set-piece yet again for Jota's 34th-minute opener.\nIncluding penalties, Leicester have now let in 18 goals from set-pieces this season, while Wolves have conceded just 17 times in the entire campaign.\nLeicester's last clean sheet away from home came at Wolves, but that was a year ago.\nFollowing two fifth-placed finishes in the league under Rodgers, a top-half spot might be deemed success this term, while they do still have the opportunity to win silverware in the Europa Conference League.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

When he did, a sublime curling strike rattled the crossbar.\nLeicester will rue the missed opportunity from James Maddison at 0-0 as the Englishman found space down the left edge of the area but his rising shot was pushed over the bar by Alisson.\nLeicester's poor season sees them stay in 12th place in the table, 10 points adrift of a Europa Conference League spot.\nFootball Daily podcast: Diogo's double, another Arsenal red & Rooney's darkest moments\nRelive Liverpool's victory over Leicester\nReds show their strength in depth\nLiverpool's season was going to be derailed once Salah and Sadio Mane went off to the Africa Cup of Nations - well that was the theory anyway. But it has not materialised that way.\nKlopp's side are growing in confidence and swatted aside Leicester with ease to stretch their run to just one defeat in their last 19 games in all competitions - ironically a loss at the Foxes on 28 December.\nIn reaching the Carabao Cup final, still in both the Champions League and FA Cup, and sitting second in the top flight, Liverpool remain in contention for an unprecedented quadruple of trophies.\nAnd the options available to Klopp now mean an already fearsome attacking line is further bolstered by the arrival of Diaz, who was making his first start for the club.\nThe former Porto man showed good touches in the final third and was unfortunate not to get on the scoresheet in front of the Kop, seeing a swerving shot and close-range drive batted out by Schmeichel.\nIf the Colombian needs any inspiration from a new signing at Liverpool, he needs to look no further than Jota, who has now scored 17 goals in all competitions this season.\nArriving from Wolves for a hefty \u00a345m at the start of last season, Jota's goalscoring performances are not only highlighting the depth of the team, but giving Klopp a good headache of who to select in the front three.\nSalah was on the bench this time after his run to the Afcon final with Egypt, beaten by team-mate Mane's Senegal on penalties, and introduced in the second half.\nOn another day he might have had a hat-trick, but a shot at the near post and a one-on-one effort was kept out by the impressive Schmeichel, as well as hitting the woodwork with another classy attempt.\nFamiliar frailties for Foxes\nLeicester are enduring a difficult season and were humiliated by Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest on Sunday, as the holders were knocked out of the FA Cup with a 4-1 loss.\nAfter that game, a furious Brendan Rodgers described the performance as \"awful\" and one that left him \"embarrassed\", and suggesting \"time could be up\" for some players in the squad.\nAlthough Thursday's defeat was not another crushing loss, Leicester were clearly second best throughout the contest and failed to get near the opposition for large periods.\nThey had just one shot on target, Maddison's early effort, but familiar frailties came to the fore once more as they conceded from a set-piece yet again for Jota's 34th-minute opener.\nIncluding penalties, Leicester have now let in 18 goals from set-pieces this season, while Wolves have conceded just 17 times in the entire campaign.\nLeicester's last clean sheet away from home came at Wolves, but that was a year ago.\nFollowing two fifth-placed finishes in the league under Rodgers, a top-half spot might be deemed success this term, while they do still have the opportunity to win silverware in the Europa Conference League.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Again.\nHammers fall below high standards\nWest Ham manager David Moyes will have been relieved to earn a point so late on, but also feel his side wasted an opportunity to earn a vital victory.\nThe Hammers were in control without sparkling in the first half only to throw away a position of power via Cresswell's handball moments before the break.\nThe goal, coming at such a crucial time, threw West Ham off course and few could have complained had Leicester hung on at the end.\nThe Hammers were poor after the interval but deserve credit for at least sticking at it to stage another late show.\nMoyes can point to the reshuffle that robbed him of Zouma just before the kick-off, but he will also know his side let Leicester off the hook when they had them down, in arrears, and with the crowd restless in the opening period.\nIt may prove an important point in the final reckoning, and West Ham stay in the top four - albeit having played a game more than Manchester United.\nMoyes will know, however, that high standards have been set this season and this was a performance that fell below them.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

What we did today was something special in terms of the performance. It showed an attitude, aggression and work-rate,\" Lampard told BBC Sport.\n\"I can see the talent. Individually you go through the team and there's ability in there. It was about being a strong unit and fighting for the fans.\n\"The fans would have enjoyed it - I certainly did.

It'll be a big moment in world football when he steps out on to the pitch to play.\n\"We're pleased he's with us, but we'd have supported him whichever club he was with.\"\nThis game could have done with a player of Eriksen's calibre, as both teams struggled to assert their authority in an underwhelming first half.

Sadly for the German, the first half had far more evidence of the latter, evil, side.\nWhen United were pressed with any great intensity, they gave the ball away. Restored to the starting line-up ahead of Paul Pogba, Fred was one culprit when he delivered a straight pass intended for Ronaldo straight to Adam Webster, who was not much more than a couple of yards away.\nBut the Brazilian was not on his own. Indeed, as Ronaldo drove a free-kick in a promising situation at the end of that disappointing opening period into the wall, it was hard to think of a redeeming feature for the hosts.\nThey did create one decent chance, when Ronaldo's backheel sent Jadon Sancho running into the box. But once Brighton keeper Sanchez had turned the England man's shot away, the best bit of United play was De Gea's excellent save to deny Moder's header.\nThe boos that accompanied the half-time whistle were predictable and when Pogba emerged late after the break and missed the start of his warm-up, it appeared United's shambolic evening would continue.\nInstead, the Frenchman was on the touchline to join the applause as Ronaldo struck the crucial 51st-minute opener.\nRonaldo knew he should have had more goals, though, and kicked an advertising hoarding in frustration as a header from a corner went narrowly wide.\nHowever, after an unsatisfactory period for both player and team as leads have been lost in three successive games, at least this time they were able to secure a much-needed victory.\nFamiliar losing feeling in Manchester for Brighton\nGiven they have now drawn two and lost 12 in 14 away games at Manchester United - and not won in 20 trips to face either City or United - the final outcome cannot have been a surprise to Brighton.\nYet, despite the scoreline and losing centre-back Dunk, there had to be an element of this being a missed opportunity for the visitors.\nFor long periods in the first half, they were by far the better side but, not for the first time, the lack of a potent finisher cost Graham Potter's men.\nModer could not have done much more with the header that De Gea turned away, nor the shot that hit the bar.\nBut Yves Bissouma fired wide before the break when placed to do much better. Danny Welbeck then came agonisingly close to snatching a draw against his former club when he sent his header over from eight yards after being picked out by fellow substitute Tariq Lamptey in the final minute.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

At the moment, that's a step forward we need to make as a team.\"\nBrentford, who were without top scorer Ivan Toney through injury, just about shaded the first half and went closest to breaking the deadlock when Bryan Mbeumo was denied by Palace keeper Vicente Guaita in a one-on-one.\nGuaita made another fine save to keep out Pontus Jansson's powerful header in the second half, but there was precious little to shout about in an encounter that lacked both quality and urgency.\nThe draw lifts Palace above Leicester into 12th - two places and points above Brentford, who sit seven points above the relegation zone.\nRelive all of Saturday's Premier League action\nVisit our Brentford page\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\nBees halt slide as Eriksen introduced\nThere were jubilant scenes before kick-off as the Bees' January signing Christian Eriksen was introduced to the Brentford Community Stadium crowd.\nThe Dane received a warm reception from both sets of supporters - eight months to the day since he suffered a cardiac arrest in a match against Finland at Euro 2020 - but Bees boss Thomas Frank admitted it would be \"too early\" to play his 29-year-old compatriot against Patrick Vieira's side. He will instead feature in a friendly on Monday.\n\"I hope someone could record [Eriksen's reception],\" Frank told BBC Match of the Day. \"I'm pleased that the Crystal Palace fans applauded him. It'll be a big moment in world football when he steps out on to the pitch to play.\n\"We're pleased he's with us, but we'd have supported him whichever club he was with.\"\nThis game could have done with a player of Eriksen's calibre, as both teams struggled to assert their authority in an underwhelming first half. Mbeumo almost poked Brentford ahead from Sergi Canos' pass just before the half-hour mark, before Ayew sliced horribly wide at the other end after Odsonne Edouard dispossessed Christian Norgaard.\nBrentford also felt they should have been given a penalty when Palace defender Marc Guehi handled the ball under pressure from Norgaard, but Simon Hooper's decision to award the visitors a free-kick for Norgaard's shove was confirmed by the video assistant referee.\nBoth teams appeared increasingly content to settle for a point the longer the second half wore on. Wilfried Zaha went to ground under Rico Henry's tug-back in stoppage time, but the challenge was not deemed worthy of a penalty by VAR.\nFrank's side were offered more warm applause at full-time after picking up their first point since 2 January - not to mention a first clean sheet since a 1-0 victory over Everton on 28 November.\n\"We created good opportunities,\" said Frank. \"We gave one chance away which was our only mistake, I'd say. If we can keep that up, we'll be in a good place.\n\"There are a lot of positives to take from this game.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

But once Brighton keeper Sanchez had turned the England man's shot away, the best bit of United play was De Gea's excellent save to deny Moder's header.\nThe boos that accompanied the half-time whistle were predictable and when Pogba emerged late after the break and missed the start of his warm-up, it appeared United's shambolic evening would continue.\nInstead, the Frenchman was on the touchline to join the applause as Ronaldo struck the crucial 51st-minute opener.\nRonaldo knew he should have had more goals, though, and kicked an advertising hoarding in frustration as a header from a corner went narrowly wide.\nHowever, after an unsatisfactory period for both player and team as leads have been lost in three successive games, at least this time they were able to secure a much-needed victory.\nFamiliar losing feeling in Manchester for Brighton\nGiven they have now drawn two and lost 12 in 14 away games at Manchester United - and not won in 20 trips to face either City or United - the final outcome cannot have been a surprise to Brighton.\nYet, despite the scoreline and losing centre-back Dunk, there had to be an element of this being a missed opportunity for the visitors.\nFor long periods in the first half, they were by far the better side but, not for the first time, the lack of a potent finisher cost Graham Potter's men.\nModer could not have done much more with the header that De Gea turned away, nor the shot that hit the bar.\nBut Yves Bissouma fired wide before the break when placed to do much better. Danny Welbeck then came agonisingly close to snatching a draw against his former club when he sent his header over from eight yards after being picked out by fellow substitute Tariq Lamptey in the final minute.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We are dreaming big.\"\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Tottenham content\nVisit our Wolves page\nSpurs solve Wolves' goal struggles\nDespite their solid form Wolves have struggled for goals this season and arrived at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with only Burnley and Norwich having scored fewer times in the league.\nThey have one of the division's best defensive records but that lack of ruthlessness has cost them points - as it did in the 1-0 defeat by 10-man Arsenal on Thursday - so Lage's side will have welcomed the hosts' early generosity.\nIt was from Wolves' first attack that Lloris palmed out a fizzing Ruben Neves effort, but he then weakly jabbed Dendoncker's follow-up into Jimenez's path and the Mexico striker coolly finished.\nThe visitors soon added a second when loose passes from Lloris and Ben Davies in quick succession turned over possession and Dendoncker pounced after the ball ricocheted off a number of defenders and the post and fell into the Belgium midfielder's path.\nSpurs captain Lloris made partial amends for his earlier errors with a good stop from the dangerous Daniel Podence from distance and was out quickly to deny Jimenez early in the second half to prevent Wolves extending their lead.\nThe visitors had to deal with growing pressure from the home side as the game progressed but did so confidently as Jose Sa claimed his ninth clean sheet of the season.\nThe Champions League may feel like an unlikely target for Lage, who got the better of a manager he called \"one of the best in the world\", but with no team taking control in the race for fourth spot his side has edged their way into contention.\nWolves have now won four away games in a row in the top flight for the first time since April 1980, when they finished sixth and also won the League Cup under John Barnwell.\nConte left with plenty to do\nTottenham needed to return to winning ways in the Premier League to stop their own Champions League hopes fading further after successive defeats, but they were left to rue another fragile and ill-disciplined defensive performance.\nConte has won four league titles since he last managed a side that lost three league games on the bounce more than 12 years ago, and this run comes after a promising start under the Italian that saw Spurs go unbeaten in nine league games.\nHe switched both wing-backs following the defeat by Southampton on Wednesday but in the 28th minute, at 2-0 down, withdrew Ryan Sessegnon for new signing Dejan Kulusevski in order to change to a more attacking shape.\nFellow new arrival Rodrigo Bentancur got his first start, after showing promise in a couple of cameos last week, and the Uruguay midfielder slid Son Heung-min through on goal in the first half only for the South Korea forward to delay and give Wolves goalkeeper Sa a comfortable save.\nThe hosts did improve after Conte's tactical switch, at least in an attacking sense, but Wolves dealt with the threat relatively comfortably, despite Harry Winks skimming the post with a deflected effort from outside the box.\nSubstitute Kulusevski also volleyed wide and Sa made a strong stop from Cristian Romero's header as Spurs pressed late on.\nThere was to be no comeback for Conte's men though and now the Italian has the task of coming up with a way to end his side's losing run at league leaders Manchester City next Saturday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Many people doubted us this season but we are still positive and a great bunch of lads.\"\nFor the hosts, however, it was a tough blow.\nThe first serious questions were being asked about manager Brendan Rodgers after the FA Cup fourth-round thrashing at Nottingham Forest was followed by defeat at Liverpool.\nZouma actions should not 'blight' good work - Moyes\nThe Foxes made a slow start and were punished by Bowen's 10th-minute strike. But they were gifted a lifeline right on half-time when Aaron Cresswell needlessly handled James Maddison's corner, Youri Tielemans drilling home the penalty.\nLeicester were galvanised and further rewarded for their improvement when Ricardo Pereira headed home a Harvey Barnes cross after 57 minutes, only for Dawson to deny them late in the game.\nLeicester miss big chance\nThe fragile state of affairs at Leicester was illustrated by the sound of groans and jeers as they passed the ball around at the back after West Ham took an early lead.\nFrustration was in the air and returned at the final whistle when the Foxes lost the advantage late on, for the third time recently after losing to Tottenham and drawing with Brighton.\nIt was a desperate body blow for Rodgers and his players who looked like stepping out of their malaise as they were moments away from coming from behind to win.\nThe pain was etched on faces all around the King Power Stadium as this was a movie they have seen before.\nLeicester have a soft centre without key defenders Jonny Evans and Wesley Fofana.\nIt was exposed by Issa Diop's pass for Bowen's goal and then again in stoppage time, even after Rodgers had sent on the giant figure of Jannik Vestergaard late on, presumably to guard against such an eventuality as Dawson's goal.\nSo near and yet so far for the Foxes. Again.\nHammers fall below high standards\nWest Ham manager David Moyes will have been relieved to earn a point so late on, but also feel his side wasted an opportunity to earn a vital victory.\nThe Hammers were in control without sparkling in the first half only to throw away a position of power via Cresswell's handball moments before the break.\nThe goal, coming at such a crucial time, threw West Ham off course and few could have complained had Leicester hung on at the end.\nThe Hammers were poor after the interval but deserve credit for at least sticking at it to stage another late show.\nMoyes can point to the reshuffle that robbed him of Zouma just before the kick-off, but he will also know his side let Leicester off the hook when they had them down, in arrears, and with the crowd restless in the opening period.\nIt may prove an important point in the final reckoning, and West Ham stay in the top four - albeit having played a game more than Manchester United.\nMoyes will know, however, that high standards have been set this season and this was a performance that fell below them.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

All of a sudden we had better positions and were a proper threat. Our reaction was just brilliant.\"\nThe extra attacking body seemed to briefly throw Norwich out of their stride and a fine switch of play from the impressive Jordan Henderson allowed Tsimikas to tee up the unmarked Mane, who swept home.\nHenderson completed 97% of his 123 passes - including a sublime through ball for Diaz's late strike - but again Salah made a crucial contribution, pulling down Alisson's kick, beating Gunn and finishing past two Norwich players on the goalline.\nThe Egyptian had eight shots and created six chances - both game highs. Only Roger Hunt - in 226 matches - has reached 150 Liverpool goals in fewer games than the 233 Salah has needed.\nDiaz's late finish will only add to the feel-good factor as the Reds continue to chase four trophies, while their ability to hold their nerve with so little margin for error in their pursuit of leaders City underlines the qualities Klopp's side possess.\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nVisit our Norwich City page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

the control of the first half, the shock of Leeds United's quick one-two, then the recovery to finally close out the victory they deserved.\nThis was always going to be a test of mettle and for a spell after the break when Leeds scored those two quick goals and were winning all the 50-50s in this most raucous of environments, it looked like they would not come through the examination unscathed.\nManchester United's players looked shell-shocked at the turn of events that allowed Leeds, who looked deflated at half-time, to revive themselves and even threaten a victory that would have been the sweetest of all for the home fans, who made their dislike of the visitors clear before, during and after this game.\nManager Rangnick, however, deserves credit for the changes that restored Manchester United's equilibrium, Fred coming on to put them back in front and another substitute, Elanga, snuffing out any hope Leeds had of a point with the fourth.\nManchester United will feel they deserved the win over the whole piece, but they were fragile at times and were rocking under Leeds attacks until Fred silenced the crowd, albeit temporarily.\nThere were unsavoury scenes when Elanga needed to be attended to after being hit by missiles thrown from the crowd following Fred's goal, but he was able to regain his composure to such an extent that he struck the final blow in the closing moments.\nManchester United enjoyed their second win in a week and sit fourth, four points behind Chelsea and four ahead of fifth-placed West Ham, but know they need to keep winning with Arsenal four points behind in sixth with three games in hand.\nLeeds show all their faces\nLeeds United demonstrated every facet of exactly what they are in another Elland Road thrill ride.\nMarcelo Bielsa's side can be called many things but never dull.\nLeeds showed their defensive frailty in the first half when Diego Llorente failed miserably to mark Maguire at a corner, the situation not helped by keeper Meslier's 'in-out' hokey-cokey that left him in no man's land.\nThey were exposed again when Victor Lindelof strode out of defence to tee up Sancho for the perfect cross on to Fernandes' head to send clouds of gloom over Elland Road, to accompany those depositing constant heavy rain on a pitch left carrying surface water.\nWhat we saw then was the bold, attacking bravery that has made Leeds, under Bielsa, one of the most exciting teams to watch since their return to the Premier League.\nThey pulled the situation around but there was never a sense that they were in complete control, secure against an attacking counterpunch and so it proved as Manchester United inflicted further punishment.\nLeeds and Bielsa cannot get midfield lynchpin Kalvin Phillips, main marksman Patrick Bamford and defender Liam Cooper back quick enough, just to ease those worries of dropping into relegation trouble.\nAnd they could be without defender Robin Koch, who was taken off after suffering a head wound in a collision with Scott McTominay.\nThey are five points off the relegation places with a trip to Liverpool on the horizon this week, so it will not get any easier for Bielsa and his players.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

Goal-wise, this was one of the more entertaining encounters this season at Molineux, which has seen only one top-flight game yield more than today's three-goal tally.\nWolves carried all the early threat and had Neves' clinical opener to show for it.\nRayan Ait-Nouri should have done better when Daniel Podence's brilliant piece of trickery on the side of the area offered enough space to roll a pass into the wing-back's path, which he fired wide.\nNevertheless, thanks to Podence, Wolves were able to extend a bizarre top-flight record this season of winning 12 of the 13 games in which they have scored, drawing the other one.\nAnd, beyond the victory, there was good news in the return of Pedro Neto, who has been out for 10 months with a major knee injury.\nNeto couldn't mark the occasion with a goal as he chipped over with the last kick as Wolves broke from a Leicester corner Kasper Schmeichel had gone forward for - but he will be delighted to be back nonetheless.\nAnother loss for Leicester\nLeicester are now on their worst top-flight run since their six-game streak without a win under Claude Puel early in 2019.\nAnd, while Brendan Rodgers' injury-hit side can still salvage their season through the Europa Conference League, they need to start winning soon to avoid getting dragged closer to the relegation zone than they would like.\nJames Maddison was not far away with a late free-kick and Youri Tielemans' injury-time strike was heading in until Jose Sa flung himself to the right to turn it round the post.\nBut too many of Leicester's players are either missing - or are shadows of those who spent two seasons battling to get into the Champions League - leaving Rodgers to again answer the same questions about disappointing results.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

In the two games at Goodison I have seen some really good thing - in the two games away, not so much.\n\"The players need to understand that second half is not good enough. It is not good enough to lose second balls consistently; it is not good enough to try and miss out [midfield] and play to the strikers.\n\"It has to be an option but it can't be the way we play. We will have days like this. It is important to learn the lessons.\"\nEverton's failings were underlined by their inability to register a shot on target as their dismal away record continued - they have won only once in 12 games on their travels this season.\nSouthampton remain 10th in the table while Everton sit 16th, four points above the bottom three.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Southampton content\nVisit our Everton page\nSaints continue on positive note\nSouthampton appear to be hitting form at the right time to push for a European place or, at worst, a first top-half finish since 2017.\nThis result, part of an impressive sequence including victory at Tottenham and draws against both Manchester clubs that could have amounted to more, underlined their upward trajectory.\nAside from the opening periods of both halves Southampton were completely dominant.\nJan Bednarek and Tino Livramento drew excellent saves from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during a concerted spell of pressure in the first half, while Kyle Walker-Peters clipped the outside of a post.\nThat largely continued after the break as Armstrong and Long gave Southampton the reward they richly deserved.\nEverton fall flat on travels again\nEverton's high-tempo start to each half was in keeping with their victories over Brentford in the FA Cup and against Leeds last weekend.\nOn another occasion they may have been awarded at least one penalty from two early appeals, and Richarlison was unable to turn in after losing control of the ball in front of goal.\nWith Dominic Calvert-Lewin causing Southampton problems at the back, Everton at that stage appeared capable of securing their first back-to-back league wins since September.\nHowever, once the hosts assumed control, Donny van de Beek, Allan and replacement Andre Gomes were easily bypassed and unable to stem the flow of attacks.\nVan de Beek's decision to pass backwards to Seamus Coleman contributed to Southampton's opener, with Gomes played into trouble and the ball finding the back of the Everton net moments later.\nAndros Townsend and Alli were brought on by manager Frank Lampard to add impetus, but there was little additional thrust.\nEverton's haul of 22 points from their first 23 games represents their worst tally at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1950-51, when they also had 22 and were relegated.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

All of a sudden we had better positions and were a proper threat. Our reaction was just brilliant.\"\nThe extra attacking body seemed to briefly throw Norwich out of their stride and a fine switch of play from the impressive Jordan Henderson allowed Tsimikas to tee up the unmarked Mane, who swept home.\nHenderson completed 97% of his 123 passes - including a sublime through ball for Diaz's late strike - but again Salah made a crucial contribution, pulling down Alisson's kick, beating Gunn and finishing past two Norwich players on the goalline.\nThe Egyptian had eight shots and created six chances - both game highs. Only Roger Hunt - in 226 matches - has reached 150 Liverpool goals in fewer games than the 233 Salah has needed.\nDiaz's late finish will only add to the feel-good factor as the Reds continue to chase four trophies, while their ability to hold their nerve with so little margin for error in their pursuit of leaders City underlines the qualities Klopp's side possess.\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nVisit our Norwich City page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

the control of the first half, the shock of Leeds United's quick one-two, then the recovery to finally close out the victory they deserved.\nThis was always going to be a test of mettle and for a spell after the break when Leeds scored those two quick goals and were winning all the 50-50s in this most raucous of environments, it looked like they would not come through the examination unscathed.\nManchester United's players looked shell-shocked at the turn of events that allowed Leeds, who looked deflated at half-time, to revive themselves and even threaten a victory that would have been the sweetest of all for the home fans, who made their dislike of the visitors clear before, during and after this game.\nManager Rangnick, however, deserves credit for the changes that restored Manchester United's equilibrium, Fred coming on to put them back in front and another substitute, Elanga, snuffing out any hope Leeds had of a point with the fourth.\nManchester United will feel they deserved the win over the whole piece, but they were fragile at times and were rocking under Leeds attacks until Fred silenced the crowd, albeit temporarily.\nThere were unsavoury scenes when Elanga needed to be attended to after being hit by missiles thrown from the crowd following Fred's goal, but he was able to regain his composure to such an extent that he struck the final blow in the closing moments.\nManchester United enjoyed their second win in a week and sit fourth, four points behind Chelsea and four ahead of fifth-placed West Ham, but know they need to keep winning with Arsenal four points behind in sixth with three games in hand.\nLeeds show all their faces\nLeeds United demonstrated every facet of exactly what they are in another Elland Road thrill ride.\nMarcelo Bielsa's side can be called many things but never dull.\nLeeds showed their defensive frailty in the first half when Diego Llorente failed miserably to mark Maguire at a corner, the situation not helped by keeper Meslier's 'in-out' hokey-cokey that left him in no man's land.\nThey were exposed again when Victor Lindelof strode out of defence to tee up Sancho for the perfect cross on to Fernandes' head to send clouds of gloom over Elland Road, to accompany those depositing constant heavy rain on a pitch left carrying surface water.\nWhat we saw then was the bold, attacking bravery that has made Leeds, under Bielsa, one of the most exciting teams to watch since their return to the Premier League.\nThey pulled the situation around but there was never a sense that they were in complete control, secure against an attacking counterpunch and so it proved as Manchester United inflicted further punishment.\nLeeds and Bielsa cannot get midfield lynchpin Kalvin Phillips, main marksman Patrick Bamford and defender Liam Cooper back quick enough, just to ease those worries of dropping into relegation trouble.\nAnd they could be without defender Robin Koch, who was taken off after suffering a head wound in a collision with Scott McTominay.\nThey are five points off the relegation places with a trip to Liverpool on the horizon this week, so it will not get any easier for Bielsa and his players.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

It is a special moment.\"\nSeagulls porous and toothless\nDunk and Webster were badly missed, but Brighton fell into old habits at the other end. They had 69% of the ball but failed to make it count, with Maupay cutting a frustrated figure up front.\nKeeping Lamptey relatively quiet on his return to Brighton's starting XI was huge for Burnley, but there was a general lack of intensity in Graham Potter's side's play from the start.

In the two games at Goodison I have seen some really good thing - in the two games away, not so much.\n\"The players need to understand that second half is not good enough. It is not good enough to lose second balls consistently; it is not good enough to try and miss out [midfield] and play to the strikers.\n\"It has to be an option but it can't be the way we play. We will have days like this. It is important to learn the lessons.\"\nEverton's failings were underlined by their inability to register a shot on target as their dismal away record continued - they have won only once in 12 games on their travels this season.\nSouthampton remain 10th in the table while Everton sit 16th, four points above the bottom three.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Southampton content\nVisit our Everton page\nSaints continue on positive note\nSouthampton appear to be hitting form at the right time to push for a European place or, at worst, a first top-half finish since 2017.\nThis result, part of an impressive sequence including victory at Tottenham and draws against both Manchester clubs that could have amounted to more, underlined their upward trajectory.\nAside from the opening periods of both halves Southampton were completely dominant.\nJan Bednarek and Tino Livramento drew excellent saves from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during a concerted spell of pressure in the first half, while Kyle Walker-Peters clipped the outside of a post.\nThat largely continued after the break as Armstrong and Long gave Southampton the reward they richly deserved.\nEverton fall flat on travels again\nEverton's high-tempo start to each half was in keeping with their victories over Brentford in the FA Cup and against Leeds last weekend.\nOn another occasion they may have been awarded at least one penalty from two early appeals, and Richarlison was unable to turn in after losing control of the ball in front of goal.\nWith Dominic Calvert-Lewin causing Southampton problems at the back, Everton at that stage appeared capable of securing their first back-to-back league wins since September.\nHowever, once the hosts assumed control, Donny van de Beek, Allan and replacement Andre Gomes were easily bypassed and unable to stem the flow of attacks.\nVan de Beek's decision to pass backwards to Seamus Coleman contributed to Southampton's opener, with Gomes played into trouble and the ball finding the back of the Everton net moments later.\nAndros Townsend and Alli were brought on by manager Frank Lampard to add impetus, but there was little additional thrust.\nEverton's haul of 22 points from their first 23 games represents their worst tally at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1950-51, when they also had 22 and were relegated.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The 22-year-old midfielder was alert and scored his first goal of the season from a tight angle as Hammers goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski failed to scramble his shot off the line.\nThe former Arsenal midfielder also zipped an effort wide from distance in the pouring rain in a second half that saw both sides struggle to assert themselves, and Newcastle will no doubt be the more satisfied with a point.\nHammers' stuttering form continues\nDavid Moyes opted to bring Kurt Zouma back in after the defender dropped out during the warm-up at Leicester last week with illness, and with his inclusion still a talking point following the furore over the video of him kicking a cat.\nHis early touches were booed by the visiting fans, but that was countered by a song in support from the home faithful at London Stadium, and the centre-back did not seem fazed during a physical battle with Newcastle forward Chris Wood.\nAnother worry for Moyes is the Hammers' stuttering form, and he must have hoped their late equaliser at Leicester would give his side renewed belief and momentum.\nIt was the man who rescued them a point in stoppage time at the King Power Stadium who put them ahead here after 32 minutes.\nNewcastle started confidently, but when Emil Krafth fouled Michail Antonio in a dangerous position, Moyes' eyes must have lit up. His side are renowned for their threat from set-pieces, with only Liverpool and Manchester City scoring more than their 11 goals from such situations this season.\nCresswell duly delivered a superb free-kick and the diving Dawson got ahead of the Newcastle defensive line to head into the corner beyond Dubravka.\nWillock's leveller sparked a reaction from the home side after the interval, but they were unable to create any meaningful chances and are one point behind fourth-placed Manchester United, having played a game more and with several sides below them having a number of games in hand.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Then Vardy was there and did what Vardy does best.\n\"He is a real catalyst for the team. You see his energy. He makes runs and presses and is normally in the right areas to score. He is a huge boost for us. To have that quality and mentality back in the team will help us.\n\"We have to stay focused on the football and not look too far ahead.

Getting 20 minutes it is good for myself there is no more issues.\n\"I don't think you can lose that [scoring touch]. It is instinct.\"\nIt had been a largely even game before Maddison's opener, although the Foxes did fashion the greater number of chances, finding home keeper Nick Pope in fine form.\nThe Clarets had the ball in the net in the first half, but Maxwel Cornet was adjudged to have moved a fraction early to tap in Aaron Lennon's low cross.\nThe win takes the Foxes to 30 points and allows them to breathe more easily after a poor recent run of league results.\nThere is no respite for Sean Dyche's side, who have seen their recent crucial revival checked and stay in the bottom three, a point behind 17th-placed Everton.\nFollow live text commentary of Burnley v Leicester in the Premier League\nVisit our Burnley page\nGo straight to our best Leicester City content\nCity show grit and Vardy brings the guile\nAfter two fifth-place finishes for Leicester in the past two seasons, this league campaign is now one of earning Premier League respectability while continuing to challenge for the last remaining piece of silverware on offer - the inaugural Europa Conference League.\nThere have been extenuating circumstances for the Foxes' downturn this season, not least Vardy's extended absence, but they have looked a soft touch at times at the back, with the gradual sapping of confidence taking away their attacking verve.\nPrior to this game, they were the only side without an away clean sheet in the top flight this season, shipping 25 goals in 11 games on the road as part of a run of 18 top-flight matches away from the King Power Stadium without stopping the opposition scoring.\nThey had also conceded a league-high 18 times from set-pieces.\nThis result - and the performance to earn it - was crucial then, coming against a side with two wins and a draw from the past three matches, scrapping for every point and providing of the sternest of tests to a defence from corners and free-kicks.\nAs pleasing for Brendan Rodgers as the two goals - both superbly taken by two substitutes providing that requisite touch of class from the bench - will be the way his side kept the Clarets contained.\nAside from Cornet's disallowed tap-in, the home side were kept to half-chances, with the Ivorian poking another effort wide in the second-half and Wout Weghorst failing to convert at the back post shortly after Leicester's opener.\nBetter chances came at the other end, with Nick Pope required to demonstrate his strong positioning and reflexes on a number of occasions to deny Ricardo Pereira, Patson Daka and Harvey Barnes.\nThe icing on the cake was Vardy's sharpness after coming on. He acrobatically volleyed one effort over, was quick and smart to stay onside and latch on to Kasper Schmeichel's clearance to set up Maddison and perfectly placed to claim his goal.\nThe finish means he has now surpassed Ian Wright's record for most Premier League goals scored after turning 30, with the Leicester man taking his tally to 94.\n\"It is great, probably just means I didn't score enough before 30,\" he added. \"Fingers crossed there's more to come.\"\nHe will now be champing at the bit to start against Leeds on Saturday.

Koch rattled the post with a side-footed effort in the first half, while Luke Ayling sent a header narrowly wide of the top corner as the hosts pushed for a goal back before the break.\nDallas should have got his team on the scoresheet after rounding Hugo Lloris, but Ben Davies managed to get back in time to block the Northern Irishman's shot. Raphinha was also denied by the woodwork from a trademark free-kick.\nBielsa's side have now conceded 60 league goals this season - five more than bottom club Norwich - and 20 in February alone. They are only the second team in Premier League history to ship three or more goals in five consecutive matches.\nThe Argentine says abandoning Leeds' all-action style in favour of a more pragmatic approach is not an option, but it is hard to see the club arresting their dreadful form without a change of system.\nSpurs return to winning ways in emphatic style\nConte cast doubt on his Spurs future in an emotional interview following Wednesday's defeat at lowly Burnley, but the Italian - like his opposite number Bielsa - reiterated his commitment to the club before Saturday's encounter, insisting he retains the full support of chairman Daniel Levy.\nDespite losing four of their previous five league matches prior to the trip to Elland Road, his team remain firmly in the mix for a top-four finish, with games in hand on fourth-placed Manchester United and West Ham, in sixth.\nLeeds applied pressure late in the first half and were perhaps unfortunate not to make the scoresheet in the second, but the visitors never looked like leaving West Yorkshire with anything other than three points once Kulusevski had doubled their early advantage.\nThe only disappointment from Conte's perspective will be that they failed to add further gloss to the scoreline after taking such an early three-goal lead.\nSon's late strike means the South Korean and Kane have combined more than any other pair in Premier League history, moving clear of former Chelsea duo Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard on 37 goals.\nWith games against the Red Devils and the Hammers coming up in mid-March, the next few weeks could go a long way to defining Spurs' and Conte's season."

He should have struck with a first-half header but the goals are coming from elsewhere and with Howe's side now up to 14th in the table, the clouds that were gathering over Tyneside for so much of this season look to be rolling away.\nIt was all done without three of their most influential performers in Allan Saint-Maximin, Kieran Trippier and Callum Wilson - which all bodes well for Howe and his team.\nEriksen's return the only good news for Brentford\nIn the wider context, this was a day about the return of Eriksen and it was a moment of real emotion and joy when he made his entrance early in the second half.\nThe whole ground rose to welcome the 30-year-old Dane and he was greeted warmly by players from both sides, happy to see this classy player and personality fit and healthy once more and doing what he loves.\nHe was swiftly into the action and showed some trademark touches, which will be crucial to Brentford's fight against relegation once he is up to full speed.\nAnd make no mistake, the Bees need him because they are sinking down the table after eight games without a win, looking like a side who have run out of momentum and energy after such a promising start to the season.\nDasilva's early dismissal was a heavy blow but there was a lack of spark about Brentford's response. The manner in which they were caught on the break by Schar for Willock's crucial second smacked of naivety.\nEriksen's presence prompted a response but Newcastle were never in serious trouble and he must somehow help them rediscover that early season inspiration, otherwise a campaign that held so much hope will descend even further into a relegation scrap.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Then Vardy was there and did what Vardy does best.\n\"He is a real catalyst for the team. You see his energy. He makes runs and presses and is normally in the right areas to score. He is a huge boost for us. To have that quality and mentality back in the team will help us.\n\"We have to stay focused on the football and not look too far ahead. Stay calm, play our football and keep focused and then we came here and got a result.\n\"A long way to go in the season. We want to go far as we can in the European competition and see where we are at the end of the season.\"\nVardy has been absent with a hamstring injury since the 1-0 win at Liverpool - the last time the Foxes had won before the trip to Turf Moor.\n\"It has been a long nine weeks resting and then four weeks getting the muscles back up,\" Vardy told BBC Sport. \"The main thing was to get back on and put a performance in.\n\"You always want to come on but you always have to listen to the medical team as well and I've been back in training just the last four days. Getting 20 minutes it is good for myself there is no more issues.\n\"I don't think you can lose that [scoring touch]. It is instinct.\"\nIt had been a largely even game before Maddison's opener, although the Foxes did fashion the greater number of chances, finding home keeper Nick Pope in fine form.\nThe Clarets had the ball in the net in the first half, but Maxwel Cornet was adjudged to have moved a fraction early to tap in Aaron Lennon's low cross.\nThe win takes the Foxes to 30 points and allows them to breathe more easily after a poor recent run of league results.\nThere is no respite for Sean Dyche's side, who have seen their recent crucial revival checked and stay in the bottom three, a point behind 17th-placed Everton.\nFollow live text commentary of Burnley v Leicester in the Premier League\nVisit our Burnley page\nGo straight to our best Leicester City content\nCity show grit and Vardy brings the guile\nAfter two fifth-place finishes for Leicester in the past two seasons, this league campaign is now one of earning Premier League respectability while continuing to challenge for the last remaining piece of silverware on offer - the inaugural Europa Conference League.\nThere have been extenuating circumstances for the Foxes' downturn this season, not least Vardy's extended absence, but they have looked a soft touch at times at the back, with the gradual sapping of confidence taking away their attacking verve.\nPrior to this game, they were the only side without an away clean sheet in the top flight this season, shipping 25 goals in 11 games on the road as part of a run of 18 top-flight matches away from the King Power Stadium without stopping the opposition scoring.\nThey had also conceded a league-high 18 times from set-pieces.\nThis result - and the performance to earn it - was crucial then, coming against a side with two wins and a draw from the past three matches, scrapping for every point and providing of the sternest of tests to a defence from corners and free-kicks.\nAs pleasing for Brendan Rodgers as the two goals - both superbly taken by two substitutes providing that requisite touch of class from the bench - will be the way his side kept the Clarets contained.\nAside from Cornet's disallowed tap-in, the home side were kept to half-chances, with the Ivorian poking another effort wide in the second-half and Wout Weghorst failing to convert at the back post shortly after Leicester's opener.\nBetter chances came at the other end, with Nick Pope required to demonstrate his strong positioning and reflexes on a number of occasions to deny Ricardo Pereira, Patson Daka and Harvey Barnes.\nThe icing on the cake was Vardy's sharpness after coming on. He acrobatically volleyed one effort over, was quick and smart to stay onside and latch on to Kasper Schmeichel's clearance to set up Maddison and perfectly placed to claim his goal.\nThe finish means he has now surpassed Ian Wright's record for most Premier League goals scored after turning 30, with the Leicester man taking his tally to 94.\n\"It is great, probably just means I didn't score enough before 30,\" he added. \"Fingers crossed there's more to come.\"\nHe will now be champing at the bit to start against Leeds on Saturday.

That is a new feeling here I think.\"\nWhile they let a one-goal lead slip to lose the reverse fixture between the sides, the hosts rarely looked like relinquishing control on this occasion with the scoreline not a true reflection of their total dominance.\nMohamed Elyounoussi and Kyle Walker-Peters both had powerful efforts saved by Gunn, while Adams headed wide when well placed from a James Ward-Prowse corner.\nAbject Norwich slip closer to relegation\nNorwich had appeared to turn a corner with positive results against Everton, Watford and Crystal Palace.\nHowever, they have now slipped to three consecutive defeats, shipped nine goals in the process and worryingly only three teams have avoided relegation from the Premier League after losing as many matches (17) as Norwich at this stage of the season.\nAnd unlike their heavier losses to Manchester City and Liverpool, where they acquitted themselves well at times, this was an abject display.\nWith 30 minutes on the clock Dean Smith's side had barely stepped foot out of their own half as they allowed Southampton to play around them, cross and shoot seemingly at will.\n\"The better team won on the night, we can't argue with that,\" said Smith. \"If we only have six or seven-out-of-10 performances we won't win games in the Premier League.\"\nRemarkably Josh Sargent had arguably the best chance early in the game, seeing his shot blocked following good play by Teemu Pukki, but they had to wait until the 73rd minute before Grant Hanley finally registered an effort on target.\nBy then Southampton's pressure had told with Adams' 36th-minute opener - and the Canaries could have few complaints when Romeu lashed in from 18 yards with two minutes remaining.\nRomeu stars for superb Saints\nPrior to kick-off, Saints' Austrian boss Hasenhuttl expressed the view that positive results against clubs near the top of the table had instilled confidence in his team.\nSouthampton came into this contest with just one defeat from their last 12 matches in all competitions and not having lost at home since September.\nThat was clearly evident once play got under way, as they stroked the ball around confidently with Romeu and Ward-Prowse setting the tone in midfield.\nThe Spaniard made more accurate passes than any other player on the pitch (65) - followed closely by England international Ward-Prowse (60) - and almost double the number made by any Norwich midfielder.\nAnd Romeu's first goal in 41 league appearances - dating back to October 2020 against West Brom - was apt reward for a fine evening's work.\nPremier League: Follow Southampton v Norwich City\nGo straight to all the best Southampton content\nVisit our Norwich City page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He should have struck with a first-half header but the goals are coming from elsewhere and with Howe's side now up to 14th in the table, the clouds that were gathering over Tyneside for so much of this season look to be rolling away.\nIt was all done without three of their most influential performers in Allan Saint-Maximin, Kieran Trippier and Callum Wilson - which all bodes well for Howe and his team.\nEriksen's return the only good news for Brentford\nIn the wider context, this was a day about the return of Eriksen and it was a moment of real emotion and joy when he made his entrance early in the second half.\nThe whole ground rose to welcome the 30-year-old Dane and he was greeted warmly by players from both sides, happy to see this classy player and personality fit and healthy once more and doing what he loves.\nHe was swiftly into the action and showed some trademark touches, which will be crucial to Brentford's fight against relegation once he is up to full speed.\nAnd make no mistake, the Bees need him because they are sinking down the table after eight games without a win, looking like a side who have run out of momentum and energy after such a promising start to the season.\nDasilva's early dismissal was a heavy blow but there was a lack of spark about Brentford's response. The manner in which they were caught on the break by Schar for Willock's crucial second smacked of naivety.\nEriksen's presence prompted a response but Newcastle were never in serious trouble and he must somehow help them rediscover that early season inspiration, otherwise a campaign that held so much hope will descend even further into a relegation scrap.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

If we win all our games pretty much there will be a chance for us.\n\"I think for people outside it is better to have a three or six-point gap than to have a 20 or 30-point gap so it is more exciting but we have to win a lot of the games against all the difficult opponents and that will be a tricky task.\n\"We will give it a try.\"\nReaction as Liverpool cut Manchester City's lead to three points\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nVisit our Leeds United page\nRuthless Reds warm up for Wembley in style\nLiverpool were looking for the perfect preparation before this weekend's Carabao Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley - and they eventually turned on the style against struggling Leeds.\nKlopp said before the game he was not thinking about the title race and only concentrating on picking up three more league points.\nYet the Reds, who are in the fifth round of the FA Cup next week and have one foot in the Champions League quarter-finals after establishing a 2-0 first-leg lead against Inter Milan, remain very much in the hunt for four trophies after a ninth straight win in all competitions.\nCity were 14 points clear of Liverpool after beating Chelsea on 15 January, albeit Guardiola's side had played two games more.\nBut Klopp's men have impressively clawed back 11 of those to create the prospect of an exciting title race with 12 games left.\nLiverpool have now scored 70 Premier League goals this season - two more than they managed in 38 games on their way to finishing third last season - and Salah has 19 of those in another impressive season for the Egypt forward.\nHe opened the scoring from the spot after Stuart Dallas handled inside the box before Salah's pass allowed centre-back Matip to double the lead with a sweeping finish any of Liverpool's front three would have been proud of.\nSalah made it 3-0 when Mane was fouled by Luke Ayling and then missed a couple of chances to complete his hat-trick.\nHowever, Mane - playing through the middle with Luis Diaz on the left - added the fourth after an assist by substitute Jordan Henderson before the Senegal forward made it 5-0 when he was left unmarked on the edge of the six-yard area.\nVan Dijk's late header means Liverpool head to Wembley on the back of scoring six goals at home in the Premier League for the first time since November 2016, when they hammered Watford 6-1.\n\"We have 10 days until we play the next league game and we have two games in between in completely different competitions,\" Klopp added.\n\"One is a final and the other I don't even know, a quarter-final or a last 16 and they will be different games and we have to be ready for them as well.\"\nAlarm bells sounding for Leeds\nLeeds are as deeply in a relegation battle as Liverpool are in a title race after a humiliating defeat on Merseyside.\nMarcelo Bielsa's side started the day with a five-point cushion but this dispiriting result - coupled with Burnley's win over Tottenham - means they are just three points above the bottom three having played more games than the trio immediately below them.\nWith forward Patrick Bamford - who scored 17 goals last season - England midfielder Kalvin Phillips and captain Liam Cooper all out with long-term injuries, it all points to worrying times at Elland Road.\nLeeds actually started brightly with Brazil forward Raphinha having a goal ruled out for offside.\nBut their defensive frailties were always evident and the game was all but lost by half-time.\nBielsa's side have conceded 56 goals this season - the highest number in the Premier League - including 31 in the past nine matches.\nIt is an alarming statistic that urgently requires addressing if their second season in the Premier League since winning promotion in 2020 is not to end in a return to a division they spent so long trying to escape.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

However, it will feel as though there is something more solid to build on.\nWatford had gone 30 games without keeping a clean sheet when Roy Hodgson took over as manager - now they have three in six games, to go with the five points collected in the former England boss's short time in charge.\nDennis spurned their best chance but Hodgson will be delighted Foster was not really stretched, with another former United player, Craig Cathcart, outstanding in the Hornets' defence.\nIt might not be pretty, but Hodgson will doubtless feel if his side can get to the period in the spring when they play four fellow relegation candidates in the space of six games, they will give themselves a chance of survival.\nA call for peace\nIt was Rangnick's idea to stand behind the \"Peace\" banner before kick-off.\nThe German, who was working in Russia for Lokomotiv Moscow before the call came from United in November, spoke eloquently about the unfolding situation in Ukraine on Friday.\nIt is clearly something Rangnick cares passionately about, and he also wore a \"No War\" badge on his coat.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Koch rattled the post with a side-footed effort in the first half, while Luke Ayling sent a header narrowly wide of the top corner as the hosts pushed for a goal back before the break.\nDallas should have got his team on the scoresheet after rounding Hugo Lloris, but Ben Davies managed to get back in time to block the Northern Irishman's shot. Raphinha was also denied by the woodwork from a trademark free-kick.\nBielsa's side have now conceded 60 league goals this season - five more than bottom club Norwich - and 20 in February alone. They are only the second team in Premier League history to ship three or more goals in five consecutive matches.\nThe Argentine says abandoning Leeds' all-action style in favour of a more pragmatic approach is not an option, but it is hard to see the club arresting their dreadful form without a change of system.\nSpurs return to winning ways in emphatic style\nConte cast doubt on his Spurs future in an emotional interview following Wednesday's defeat at lowly Burnley, but the Italian - like his opposite number Bielsa - reiterated his commitment to the club before Saturday's encounter, insisting he retains the full support of chairman Daniel Levy.\nDespite losing four of their previous five league matches prior to the trip to Elland Road, his team remain firmly in the mix for a top-four finish, with games in hand on fourth-placed Manchester United and West Ham, in sixth.\nLeeds applied pressure late in the first half and were perhaps unfortunate not to make the scoresheet in the second, but the visitors never looked like leaving West Yorkshire with anything other than three points once Kulusevski had doubled their early advantage.\nThe only disappointment from Conte's perspective will be that they failed to add further gloss to the scoreline after taking such an early three-goal lead.\nSon's late strike means the South Korean and Kane have combined more than any other pair in Premier League history, moving clear of former Chelsea duo Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard on 37 goals.\nWith games against the Red Devils and the Hammers coming up in mid-March, the next few weeks could go a long way to defining Spurs' and Conte's season.",

He was right up there with his Liverpool form of old today and he was above the game at times,\" Gerrard, who played alongside the 29-year-old at Liverpool, told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"I witnessed that at close quarters when I played with him. The goal he scored today, he was sending the defenders one way and the other, and he used to do that to me most days in training.\n\"He probably finished my career a couple of years early - he's the reason I've got screws in my knees and groin!\"\nThe win sees Villa climb to 11th, just outside the top half on goal difference, while Southampton remain ninth.\nAs at all Premier League games this weekend, there was a show of solidarity and support for Ukraine after the invasion by Russia, with the Aston Villa fans applauding and Southampton fans holding up blue and yellow scarves.\nFollow reaction to Aston Villa's win over Southampton\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nVisit our Southampton page\nCoutinho brings a spark that Saints lack\nWhen Coutinho joined Villa, Gerrard called him a \"special footballer\", but said they would have to be \"patient with him\".\nA return of two goals and two assists in his opening 440 minutes was encouraging, but there was a sense that this was Coutinho properly reintroducing himself to English football.\nHe linked up superbly with Watkins, who scored his seventh league goal of the season, both seeing golden opportunities set up by the other saved by Fraser Forster in the first half.\nCoutinho also latched on to a Watkins flick-on before slotting wide, but the partnership will give Gerrard food for thought after rumours emerged this week\n, external\nthat he was willing to listen to offers for Watkins in the summer.\nThe question remains whether Villa can keep hold of Coutinho in the summer, but based on the rapturous reception he got from the Villa Park faithful when he was substituted he may have found a place where he can start enjoying his football again.\nHe offered Villa something that Southampton, who had only lost once in 10 games, lacked. They struggled to break down Villa and create clear-cut opportunities, with a Che Adams drive their only effort on target.\nThe visitors' midfield trio of Oriol Romeu, Stuart Armstrong and James Ward-Prowse can lack a creative edge, meaning Saints become reliant on their full-backs and set pieces which Villa stifled throughout the game.\nTheir recent run has drawn admirers, and this, while only likely to be a bump in the road, will concern Hasenhuttl with a top-half finish on offer and an FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester City in two weeks' time.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Eriksen, rightly, received a yellow card for bringing down Brandon Williams - but once the Norwich defender realised who had fouled him, he simply embraced his opponent.\nOn Eriksen's performance, Brentford boss Frank said: \"You could see it was a top delivery for the first goal. There were top passes where he tried to find his team-mates in behind. You can also see there's more to come from him, which of course is a positive.\"\nOn hat-trick scorer Toney, Frank added: \"It is world-class. I have said this before but for me Ivan Toney is the best penalty taker in the world at this moment in time.\"\nNorwich boss Dean Smith labelled the meeting with his former club as a \"must-not-lose\" encounter and this dismal home defeat means time is quickly running out for his side.\nSmith bemoaned the officiating at full-time but the fact is a fourth successive loss means the Canaries are five points adrift of 17th-placed Everton.\nThey were unable to capitalise on a purposeful start when Rashica was denied at close range by David Raya, and Billy Gilmour shot over from the rebound inside the opening two minutes.\nRaya was again called upon to stop Pukki's low strike finding the bottom corner before half-time, but Norwich capitulated in the second half as Toney twice got the better of Tim Krul from the spot despite the goalkeeper's best efforts to put him off.\nPukki eventually converted one of the home side's 15 attempts but it was a mere consolation for a side edging closer to relegation.\n\"It was a bad day at the office for the officials unfortunately, and we've also made some bad decisions in our penalty box,\" said Smith.\n\"I can understand the disappointment of the supporters.

He was right up there with his Liverpool form of old today and he was above the game at times,\" Gerrard, who played alongside the 29-year-old at Liverpool, told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"I witnessed that at close quarters when I played with him. The goal he scored today, he was sending the defenders one way and the other, and he used to do that to me most days in training.\n\"He probably finished my career a couple of years early - he's the reason I've got screws in my knees and groin!\"\nThe win sees Villa climb to 11th, just outside the top half on goal difference, while Southampton remain ninth.\nAs at all Premier League games this weekend, there was a show of solidarity and support for Ukraine after the invasion by Russia, with the Aston Villa fans applauding and Southampton fans holding up blue and yellow scarves.\nFollow reaction to Aston Villa's win over Southampton\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nVisit our Southampton page\nCoutinho brings a spark that Saints lack\nWhen Coutinho joined Villa, Gerrard called him a \"special footballer\", but said they would have to be \"patient with him\".\nA return of two goals and two assists in his opening 440 minutes was encouraging, but there was a sense that this was Coutinho properly reintroducing himself to English football.\nHe linked up superbly with Watkins, who scored his seventh league goal of the season, both seeing golden opportunities set up by the other saved by Fraser Forster in the first half.\nCoutinho also latched on to a Watkins flick-on before slotting wide, but the partnership will give Gerrard food for thought after rumours emerged this week\n, external\nthat he was willing to listen to offers for Watkins in the summer.\nThe question remains whether Villa can keep hold of Coutinho in the summer, but based on the rapturous reception he got from the Villa Park faithful when he was substituted he may have found a place where he can start enjoying his football again.\nHe offered Villa something that Southampton, who had only lost once in 10 games, lacked. They struggled to break down Villa and create clear-cut opportunities, with a Che Adams drive their only effort on target.\nThe visitors' midfield trio of Oriol Romeu, Stuart Armstrong and James Ward-Prowse can lack a creative edge, meaning Saints become reliant on their full-backs and set pieces which Villa stifled throughout the game.\nTheir recent run has drawn admirers, and this, while only likely to be a bump in the road, will concern Hasenhuttl with a top-half finish on offer and an FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester City in two weeks' time.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Potter's well-drilled side created space down the flanks but were thwarted by former Brighton defender Dan Burn, who had an excellent game.\nPascal Gross, who threatened with set-pieces all afternoon, almost found Shane Duffy but the centre-back headed wide from five yards under pressure from Murphy.\nBut after an encouraging start, the game switched Newcastle's way as Wood sold Duffy a dummy, sent Murphy away and Fraser tucked in the rebound.\nSchar's header then established a lead that looked comfortable, thanks to more smart defending from Burn and another impressive midfield display from Joelinton, whose limbs seemed to be everywhere.\nBut the hosts' lacklustre start to the second half led to Dunk pulling a goal back when he lost Wood, who is still yet to score in seven games since his \u00a325m move from Burnley.\nThat led to a period where Newcastle lost control of the game. They were let off because Brighton failed to find the killer pass as the home fans began to show their nerves and frustration as the likes of Joe Willock gave the ball away.\nThe Magpies have given away more points than any other Premier League team from winning positions, and it looked like they might concede an equaliser.\nBut when Bruno Guimaraes came on to help in midfield it offered an improvement despite Leandro Trossard's late effort being saved by Dubravka.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Liverpool 1-0 West Ham United: Sadio Mane earns narrow win for Reds\nSadio Mane's first-half goal was enough to give Liverpool victory over West Ham at Anfield and move them back within three points of Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nJurgen Klopp's men deserved the win but it did not come without the odd scare as Pablo Fornals and Manuel Lanzini both wasted excellent chances to equalise.\nThe Hammers' frustrations were compounded by the loss of in-form Jarrod Bowen to what looked like a significant injury, the forward helped off the pitch and down the tunnel following a collision with former Hull team-mate Andy Robertson.\nFive days before the Europa League last-16 first-leg trip to Sevilla, it was not what manager David Moyes needed.\nLiverpool had chances to extend their lead, with new signing Luis Diaz particularly impressive.\nHowever, with the title race as it is, victory was all that mattered. And now Liverpool fans are in the unusual position of hoping for a United victory in Sunday's Manchester derby at Etihad Stadium.\n\"We could have done better. We did pretty well first half, but in the second half if you are not better, you need quick legs, big heart and passion and that's what we needed to get the result,\" Klopp told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"In the end it was open, we needed a bit of luck, but you cannot win as many games in a row as we have without a bit of luck.\"\nReaction to Liverpool v West Ham and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nVisit our Liverpool page\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nDazzling Diaz\nLife might have been far less stressful for Liverpool's fans had Mohamed Salah taken the first-minute chance that came his way, instead of firing straight at goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nAt times, Liverpool's attack is so fast and fluid it is impossible for opposition defences to cope. And in Diaz, their \u00a337.5m January arrival from Porto, they have a player that fits that template perfectly.\nThe Colombian produced a wonderous piece of skill to create an early chance for himself which he drove into Craig Dawson's face.\nDiaz then came close twice in the second half too, with the first of those particularly impressive in the way he manipulated Mane's pass into a scoring chance that went narrowly wide. When he was replaced in the final minute of injury time, his standing ovation was fully deserved.\n\"He is a top player - a most easy player to coach because all the things he is doing are pretty natural to him,\" added Klopp. \"There is not a lot of coaching necessary. Of course he needs to work on one or two things we do defensively, but he is very football smart, has a big heart and wants to fight extremely hard for the team.\"\nIn the end, though, Trent Alexander-Arnold's precise low cross created the one moment that mattered.\nThe England man's 16th assist of a stellar season was one of his best, leaving Mane to turn home his fourth goal in five games from close range.\nHammers worries\nWest Ham have lost 70 league matches against Liverpool, have now won once at Anfield in 52 attempts, and Moyes is without a win in 66 away league games against Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United, so perhaps the outcome of the match was not a surprise.\nBut the Scot will nevertheless wonder how his side failed to capitalise on some excellent chances.\nArguably Fornals had the best when he was put through by Bowen just before the break, but instead of trying to beat Alisson in a conventional manner, he lofted a chip over the Brazilian that lacked pace and Alexander-Arnold was able to get back and clear.\nLanzini then undid all his good work in creating space on the edge of the area by blazing over with only Alisson to beat, while in the final stages Michail Antonio was bearing down on goal only for Naby Keita to get back to deny him.\n\"The players played really well today, I don't think a draw would have been off the mark but we didn't get it,\" Moyes told Match of the Day.\n\"We needed one to go in. We had to ride our luck at the start but we grew into the game and had three big chances, plus one or two other opportunities on top of that.\"\nThose frustrations were only compounded by the loss of Bowen, who was heavily tipped to make Gareth Southgate's England squad for the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast.\nMoyes, clearly, will be more concerned about that trip to Sevilla and in addition to sweating on Bowen's fitness, must hope skipper Declan Rice has recovered from the illness that kept him out of this game in time to be available.\n\"I think Jarrod will have a scan on his heel area. He has been playing really well for us so it would be a blow if we go into the Sevilla game without him,\" added the Scot.\n\"Declan had illness that came on on Thursday and through Friday. We are hoping it will not be too bad but I can't tell at the minute.\""

Eriksen, rightly, received a yellow card for bringing down Brandon Williams - but once the Norwich defender realised who had fouled him, he simply embraced his opponent.\nOn Eriksen's performance, Brentford boss Frank said: \"You could see it was a top delivery for the first goal. There were top passes where he tried to find his team-mates in behind. You can also see there's more to come from him, which of course is a positive.\"\nOn hat-trick scorer Toney, Frank added: \"It is world-class. I have said this before but for me Ivan Toney is the best penalty taker in the world at this moment in time.\"\nNorwich boss Dean Smith labelled the meeting with his former club as a \"must-not-lose\" encounter and this dismal home defeat means time is quickly running out for his side.\nSmith bemoaned the officiating at full-time but the fact is a fourth successive loss means the Canaries are five points adrift of 17th-placed Everton.\nThey were unable to capitalise on a purposeful start when Rashica was denied at close range by David Raya, and Billy Gilmour shot over from the rebound inside the opening two minutes.\nRaya was again called upon to stop Pukki's low strike finding the bottom corner before half-time, but Norwich capitulated in the second half as Toney twice got the better of Tim Krul from the spot despite the goalkeeper's best efforts to put him off.\nPukki eventually converted one of the home side's 15 attempts but it was a mere consolation for a side edging closer to relegation.\n\"It was a bad day at the office for the officials unfortunately, and we've also made some bad decisions in our penalty box,\" said Smith.\n\"I can understand the disappointment of the supporters.

City were always going to dip a little bit at some point this season because the standards they have set have been nothing short of amazing - it is credit to Liverpool that they are even still near the Premier League leaders after the run that Pep Guardiola's side were on until they lost to Tottenham two weeks ago.\nSo, after seeing City lose one game - in the last minute - to Spurs, and then scrape through against Everton with a bit of luck last weekend, it was no surprise to me to see them come out for a huge game like a Manchester derby and absolutely batter United, because that is what great teams do.\nThe way United collapsed at Etihad Stadium was unacceptable, and Ralf Rangnick's side deserve criticism for the way they finished the game, but you also have to recognise United were playing against a phenomenal City team that has some unbelievably talented players and also possesses an amazing work ethic too.\nYou cannot only play for half a game against City and United found that out, the hard way.\nMan City outclass Man Utd to restore six-point lead at top\nFootball Daily podcast: Man City's derby stroll leaves Man Utd feeling blue\n'Either they're not good enough or they don't care' - pundits react to Man Utd's derby display\nUnited start well - but finish badly\nI actually thought United did well for the first half-hour on Sunday.\nThey committed lots of men forward on the counter-attack and they even tried to win the ball back high up the pitch, which was quite impressive to watch.\nIt was a risky way of playing, but it was probably what United's fans wanted to see - their side having a go, and trying to be competitive in the game.\nIt worked - United caused City problems in that opening period, and had some decent chances.\nOf course, when you take the game to City like that, their quality means you are going to give chances away yourself when they break through your lines.\nAs the first half wore on, City had more and more possession and were 2-1 up, but United still looked dangerous and were right in the game. It set us up for a great second half - but United just didn't turn up.\nOne of the most disappointing things about their display after the break was their lack of concentration. It led to Riyad Mahrez scoring City's third goal, and it was the same with lots of other chances they gave away. Their players kept switching off at key times.\nEven worse than that, though, was seeing their reaction after going 3-1 down. It seemed like they didn't have the desire or the fitness to get back into the game, or even have a go at City.\nI don't know if that was down to complete fatigue because of who they were playing against, or if it was a demonstration of their lack of belief.\nEither way, United didn't just lose the game, they capitulated. It looked like they realised they were done and, whatever the reason, had nothing more to give. Seeing that happen must be a real worry for Rangnick.\nDe Bruyne was a joy to watch\nEven before City scored their third and fourth goals, it felt like there was an inevitability about the result because of how dominant they had become.\nIt's hard to pick out individuals from a display like that because it was a collective effort from some wonderful players, and I loved how none of them ever stopped working.\nBernardo Silva and Rodri's work ethic in the middle of the pitch, to always get back and help their defenders, and then to also press and do all the other things you want from your midfielders, was just incredible.\nIt was going forward where City were really impressive, though. I'm not surprised Guardiola praised Kevin de Bruyne afterwards, because he was at his absolute best and it was a joy to watch.\nDe Bruyne is like poetry in motion when he is on top of his game like that, and it is difficult to stop him however you are set up, especially when you have got the attacking players around him that City do.\nAgain, Silva contributed in that way too - he set up their first goal - while Jack Grealish looked full of confidence and Mahrez just came alive as the game went on.\nPhil Foden also impressed me, playing as a false nine, and demonstrated his ability to understand the game in that area of the pitch and make a real impact.\nIt felt like Foden and De Bruyne were leading City's attack, and United could not cope with either of them.\nA shock if Man Utd finish fourth\nCity now have 10 league games to go and we already know Liverpool are the only team that can stop them retaining their title.\nWe are all looking at 10 April, when Jurgen Klopp's side come to Etihad Stadium, and of course that will be a massive game between two fantastic teams who are going head to head again.\nThat's the big one, and I can't wait, but I just feel there will be some other twists and turns along the way as well.\nEveryone expects both teams to win every other game apart from that one, when they play each other, but football is not like that, and it is going to be fascinating to see where they do drop points over the coming weeks.\nAs for United, well they have got much bigger problems.\nArsenal are above them and have got three games in hand but, more importantly, United are not playing particularly well and they have got a tough run-in.\nThey still have Chelsea and Liverpool to play and, on this evidence, they are going to struggle against them. It would be a huge shock now for them to finish fourth and make next season's Champions League that way.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

He is going to be a huge player for us.\"\nSaints had taken a deserved 25th-minute lead when Stuart Armstrong nodded home Mohamed Elyounoussi's knock-back via a deflection off Dan Burn.\nBut Newcastle, who were without Allan Saint-Maximin and Joelinton on the south coast, equalised seven minutes later courtesy of Chris Wood's first goal for the club, the New Zealand striker powering Jonjo Shelvey's inswinging cross past the stranded Fraser Forster.\nChe Adams rattled the crossbar with a thunderous first-half volley and Martin Dubravka was the busier of the two goalkeepers late on, but Guimaraes' superb strike from Burn's cushioned header ultimately proved decisive.\n\"I thought it was 'welcome to the Premier League' for Bruno - an end-to-end game, high in transitions and very physical,\" added Howe. \"It will be a really good experience for him.\n\"He's a defensive midfielder, but a creative one. The reason we signed him was because we loved his way of playing, his eye for a pass and composure.\"\nNewcastle were three points from safety following a 4-0 home defeat to Manchester City in December, but are now in 14th place and 10 clear of third-bottom Burnley.

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Liverpool 1-0 West Ham United: Sadio Mane earns narrow win for Reds\nSadio Mane's first-half goal was enough to give Liverpool victory over West Ham at Anfield and move them back within three points of Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nJurgen Klopp's men deserved the win but it did not come without the odd scare as Pablo Fornals and Manuel Lanzini both wasted excellent chances to equalise.\nThe Hammers' frustrations were compounded by the loss of in-form Jarrod Bowen to what looked like a significant injury, the forward helped off the pitch and down the tunnel following a collision with former Hull team-mate Andy Robertson.\nFive days before the Europa League last-16 first-leg trip to Sevilla, it was not what manager David Moyes needed.\nLiverpool had chances to extend their lead, with new signing Luis Diaz particularly impressive.\nHowever, with the title race as it is, victory was all that mattered. And now Liverpool fans are in the unusual position of hoping for a United victory in Sunday's Manchester derby at Etihad Stadium.\n\"We could have done better. We did pretty well first half, but in the second half if you are not better, you need quick legs, big heart and passion and that's what we needed to get the result,\" Klopp told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"In the end it was open, we needed a bit of luck, but you cannot win as many games in a row as we have without a bit of luck.\"\nReaction to Liverpool v West Ham and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nVisit our Liverpool page\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nDazzling Diaz\nLife might have been far less stressful for Liverpool's fans had Mohamed Salah taken the first-minute chance that came his way, instead of firing straight at goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nAt times, Liverpool's attack is so fast and fluid it is impossible for opposition defences to cope. And in Diaz, their \u00a337.5m January arrival from Porto, they have a player that fits that template perfectly.\nThe Colombian produced a wonderous piece of skill to create an early chance for himself which he drove into Craig Dawson's face.\nDiaz then came close twice in the second half too, with the first of those particularly impressive in the way he manipulated Mane's pass into a scoring chance that went narrowly wide. When he was replaced in the final minute of injury time, his standing ovation was fully deserved.\n\"He is a top player - a most easy player to coach because all the things he is doing are pretty natural to him,\" added Klopp. \"There is not a lot of coaching necessary. Of course he needs to work on one or two things we do defensively, but he is very football smart, has a big heart and wants to fight extremely hard for the team.\"\nIn the end, though, Trent Alexander-Arnold's precise low cross created the one moment that mattered.\nThe England man's 16th assist of a stellar season was one of his best, leaving Mane to turn home his fourth goal in five games from close range.\nHammers worries\nWest Ham have lost 70 league matches against Liverpool, have now won once at Anfield in 52 attempts, and Moyes is without a win in 66 away league games against Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United, so perhaps the outcome of the match was not a surprise.\nBut the Scot will nevertheless wonder how his side failed to capitalise on some excellent chances.\nArguably Fornals had the best when he was put through by Bowen just before the break, but instead of trying to beat Alisson in a conventional manner, he lofted a chip over the Brazilian that lacked pace and Alexander-Arnold was able to get back and clear.\nLanzini then undid all his good work in creating space on the edge of the area by blazing over with only Alisson to beat, while in the final stages Michail Antonio was bearing down on goal only for Naby Keita to get back to deny him.\n\"The players played really well today, I don't think a draw would have been off the mark but we didn't get it,\" Moyes told Match of the Day.\n\"We needed one to go in. We had to ride our luck at the start but we grew into the game and had three big chances, plus one or two other opportunities on top of that.\"\nThose frustrations were only compounded by the loss of Bowen, who was heavily tipped to make Gareth Southgate's England squad for the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast.\nMoyes, clearly, will be more concerned about that trip to Sevilla and in addition to sweating on Bowen's fitness, must hope skipper Declan Rice has recovered from the illness that kept him out of this game in time to be available.\n\"I think Jarrod will have a scan on his heel area. He has been playing really well for us so it would be a blow if we go into the Sevilla game without him,\" added the Scot.\n\"Declan had illness that came on on Thursday and through Friday. We are hoping it will not be too bad but I can't tell at the minute.\"",

He is going to be a huge player for us.\"\nSaints had taken a deserved 25th-minute lead when Stuart Armstrong nodded home Mohamed Elyounoussi's knock-back via a deflection off Dan Burn.\nBut Newcastle, who were without Allan Saint-Maximin and Joelinton on the south coast, equalised seven minutes later courtesy of Chris Wood's first goal for the club, the New Zealand striker powering Jonjo Shelvey's inswinging cross past the stranded Fraser Forster.\nChe Adams rattled the crossbar with a thunderous first-half volley and Martin Dubravka was the busier of the two goalkeepers late on, but Guimaraes' superb strike from Burn's cushioned header ultimately proved decisive.\n\"I thought it was 'welcome to the Premier League' for Bruno - an end-to-end game, high in transitions and very physical,\" added Howe. \"It will be a really good experience for him.\n\"He's a defensive midfielder, but a creative one. The reason we signed him was because we loved his way of playing, his eye for a pass and composure.\"\nNewcastle were three points from safety following a 4-0 home defeat to Manchester City in December, but are now in 14th place and 10 clear of third-bottom Burnley. They are also just four points off Southampton, who slipped to only their second home defeat of the season.\nRelive Southampton v Newcastle plus the rest of Thursday's Premier League action\nVisit our Southampton page\nGo straight to all the best Newcastle United content\nBruno impact delights travelling Toon Army\nReluctant to destabilise a team that has yet to lose in the Premier League in 2022, Howe had exercised caution with Guimaraes prior to Thursday's visit to St Mary's, restricting the January signing to just 41 minutes across five cameo appearances.\nThe Brazil international was brought into the side in place of in-form Joelinton, who was ruled out with a groin problem but could recover in time to feature against Chelsea on Sunday.\nOperating next to Shelvey in central midfield, Guimaraes registered the game's first attempt - a long-range drive that was blocked - and almost set up Joe Willock for a Magpies' second late in the first half.\nBut the 24-year-old's most important contribution came seven minutes after half-time, when he beat Forster with an outrageous flick that combined power, precision and sheer audacity.\nUnderstandably perhaps, Guimaraes ran out of steam midway through the second half but was given a rapturous reception by the travelling Newcastle fans when he was replaced by Sean Longstaff.\nLike Brighton at St James' Park on Saturday, Saints enjoyed the majority of possession but failed to trouble Dubravka enough until the latter stages of the contest.\nA Tino Livramento cross-shot almost caught out the Magpies goalkeeper as the game entered the final quarter of an hour, but the Slovakia international was able to prevent the ball from dipping underneath the crossbar.\nDubravka was called into action again from the resulting corner, denying fit-again Mohammed Salisu with a smart intervention, before producing arguably his best save of the match to stop another Salisu header from creeping in at the far post.\nArmstrong also had a dipping effort tipped over by Dubravka deep into stoppage time as Newcastle held out to take another huge step towards safety.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He has scored or assisted 13 Premier League goals this season, with only Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz (17) involved in more in Europe's top five leagues among players under the age of 21.\nGunners boss Mikel Arteta had a big hand in the third goal, too, grabbing the ball after it went out of play and quickly passing it to Saka, who took the throw-in that led to the goal.\nWatford played their part in an engaging contest - Arsenal's Aaron Ramsdale was the much busier goalkeeper - but have won just once under Roy Hodgson.\nThey become the fourth team to lose eight successive Premier League home matches, after Sunderland, Wolves and Norwich.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Leeds remain two points above the bottom three, having played two games more than 18th-placed Burnley.\nVisit our Leicester City page\nGo straight to all the best Leeds United content\nNo points but plenty of positives for Marsch\nWhether you have Bielsa, Marsch or any other manager in charge, the old adage remains true: if you don't take your chances when on top, you risk being punished.\nIt was a recurring failing of Leeds under Bielsa that they failed to make good on the bountiful chances they often produced in games long before they were shipping goals to the tune of 20 in a month.\nWhile Marsch changed a number of things in his first game in charge - a new 4-2-2-2 formation and quicker play through the middle - it was the old problem of conversion that cost Leeds.\nKasper Schmeichel can take some credit for repelling the visitors, producing saves to deny Dan James, Harrison, Rodrigo and, in the best of all from close range, Raphinha.\nCaglar Soyuncu was also on hand to brilliantly block Junior's goalbound shot from inside the box.\nThis all set up Leicester, who until then had offered very little barring the occasional threat of the returning Jamie Vardy getting in on goal with long balls over the top.\nBarnes is a player building his reputation weekly and, after sharing a one-two with Kelechi Iheanacho, he slotted a low shot across goal and past the diving Illan Meslier.\nLeeds continued to press forward, but their moment had passed and Leicester were able to see the game out to add another three points to those earned at Burnley on Tuesday.\nMarsch gathered his players in a huddle in the centre circle at full-time. His message will surely have been to focus on the multiple positives.\nNo points, but plenty to take forward into a run of crucial games beginning with Aston Villa and Norwich at home next week.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

City were always going to dip a little bit at some point this season because the standards they have set have been nothing short of amazing - it is credit to Liverpool that they are even still near the Premier League leaders after the run that Pep Guardiola's side were on until they lost to Tottenham two weeks ago.\nSo, after seeing City lose one game - in the last minute - to Spurs, and then scrape through against Everton with a bit of luck last weekend, it was no surprise to me to see them come out for a huge game like a Manchester derby and absolutely batter United, because that is what great teams do.\nThe way United collapsed at Etihad Stadium was unacceptable, and Ralf Rangnick's side deserve criticism for the way they finished the game, but you also have to recognise United were playing against a phenomenal City team that has some unbelievably talented players and also possesses an amazing work ethic too.\nYou cannot only play for half a game against City and United found that out, the hard way.\nMan City outclass Man Utd to restore six-point lead at top\nFootball Daily podcast: Man City's derby stroll leaves Man Utd feeling blue\n'Either they're not good enough or they don't care' - pundits react to Man Utd's derby display\nUnited start well - but finish badly\nI actually thought United did well for the first half-hour on Sunday.\nThey committed lots of men forward on the counter-attack and they even tried to win the ball back high up the pitch, which was quite impressive to watch.\nIt was a risky way of playing, but it was probably what United's fans wanted to see - their side having a go, and trying to be competitive in the game.\nIt worked - United caused City problems in that opening period, and had some decent chances.\nOf course, when you take the game to City like that, their quality means you are going to give chances away yourself when they break through your lines.\nAs the first half wore on, City had more and more possession and were 2-1 up, but United still looked dangerous and were right in the game. It set us up for a great second half - but United just didn't turn up.\nOne of the most disappointing things about their display after the break was their lack of concentration. It led to Riyad Mahrez scoring City's third goal, and it was the same with lots of other chances they gave away. Their players kept switching off at key times.\nEven worse than that, though, was seeing their reaction after going 3-1 down. It seemed like they didn't have the desire or the fitness to get back into the game, or even have a go at City.\nI don't know if that was down to complete fatigue because of who they were playing against, or if it was a demonstration of their lack of belief.\nEither way, United didn't just lose the game, they capitulated. It looked like they realised they were done and, whatever the reason, had nothing more to give. Seeing that happen must be a real worry for Rangnick.\nDe Bruyne was a joy to watch\nEven before City scored their third and fourth goals, it felt like there was an inevitability about the result because of how dominant they had become.\nIt's hard to pick out individuals from a display like that because it was a collective effort from some wonderful players, and I loved how none of them ever stopped working.\nBernardo Silva and Rodri's work ethic in the middle of the pitch, to always get back and help their defenders, and then to also press and do all the other things you want from your midfielders, was just incredible.\nIt was going forward where City were really impressive, though. I'm not surprised Guardiola praised Kevin de Bruyne afterwards, because he was at his absolute best and it was a joy to watch.\nDe Bruyne is like poetry in motion when he is on top of his game like that, and it is difficult to stop him however you are set up, especially when you have got the attacking players around him that City do.\nAgain, Silva contributed in that way too - he set up their first goal - while Jack Grealish looked full of confidence and Mahrez just came alive as the game went on.\nPhil Foden also impressed me, playing as a false nine, and demonstrated his ability to understand the game in that area of the pitch and make a real impact.\nIt felt like Foden and De Bruyne were leading City's attack, and United could not cope with either of them.\nA shock if Man Utd finish fourth\nCity now have 10 league games to go and we already know Liverpool are the only team that can stop them retaining their title.\nWe are all looking at 10 April, when Jurgen Klopp's side come to Etihad Stadium, and of course that will be a massive game between two fantastic teams who are going head to head again.\nThat's the big one, and I can't wait, but I just feel there will be some other twists and turns along the way as well.\nEveryone expects both teams to win every other game apart from that one, when they play each other, but football is not like that, and it is going to be fascinating to see where they do drop points over the coming weeks.\nAs for United, well they have got much bigger problems.\nArsenal are above them and have got three games in hand but, more importantly, United are not playing particularly well and they have got a tough run-in.\nThey still have Chelsea and Liverpool to play and, on this evidence, they are going to struggle against them. It would be a huge shock now for them to finish fourth and make next season's Champions League that way.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

He timed his run to perfection as Jadon Sancho made the most of Sergio Reguilon's struggles within the Tottenham defensive line to deliver the low cross that his vastly experienced team-mate turned home with ease.\nAnd if anyone was likely to get a winner, it was United's number seven.\nWhen he did, Ronaldo was immediately replaced to a standing ovation that was totally deserved.\nLWLWLWL - Tottenham's consistent inconsistency\nTottenham's season was summed up by Antonio Conte's reaction to what he thought was a first-half equaliser from Ben Davies.\nAs the ball hit the net, there was wild celebration. Then the assistant's flag went up and Conte was stopped in his tracks.\nTottenham's past seven results have alternated between wins and defeats - with three victories punctuating four losses. And their tendency to wobble let them down again here.\nHaving gone behind, they worked their way back into the game once - and there was never much doubt Kane would drive home the spot-kick after Telles had handled in the area. But the manner in which they went 2-1 down three minutes later highlighted obvious deficiencies, with Reguilon switching off on the far side of the pitch.\nTottenham then got back into the game a second time, and deserved to, even if Maguire scored for them.\nBut such is Spurs' inconsistency, few would believe they can genuinely overhaul Arsenal to seal a top four berth even if, mathematically, they still have a better chance of doing so than United.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Our history obliges to be there but we are not there yet and there are still a lot of games to play.\n\"We have an excellent group of people at the club who believe in what we do. Then you have to put performance into results. The last few months, we have been more consistent.\"\nPartey headed in unchallenged from Gabriel Martinelli's corner after 11 minutes as the hosts capitalised on their dominant start.\nThe midfielder also struck the crossbar as Arsenal pressed for a second, while goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale was twice called upon to deny Harvey Barnes - including a superb reaction save from a header - as the visitors threatened before half-time.\nBut, after Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu was penalised for handball following a lengthy video assistant referee review, Lacazette fired in a 59th-minute penalty to put the Gunners in control.\nSoyuncu received only a yellow card as Partey's still goal-bound header was cleared off the line by the alert Luke Thomas.\nHowever, there was to be no way back for Brendan Rodgers's side, who remain 12th in the table.\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nVisit our Leicester City page\nArsenal on course to end Champions League wait\nSeeking to end a five-year absence from Europe's elite club competition, Arsenal ensured they remain in pole position in the race to qualify with a ninth win in 11 league games.\nWith three games in hand over fifth-placed United from which to further strengthen their position, Arteta's men - unlike their immediate rivals - have achieved consistency in both performances and results to emerge as favourites for fourth.\nThe opening goal was a familiar tale for Leicester, who have now conceded a league-high 15 goals from set-pieces - excluding penalties - after Partey's run to the near post went ignored.\nArsenal had amassed six shots before Leicester, sorely missing injured talisman Jamie Vardy, managed their first attempt after 24 minutes.\nBut, just as he was in October's reverse fixture, which Arsenal also won 2-0, the inspired Ramsdale was up to the task when the Foxes eventually gained a foothold in the contest.\nMartinelli and Bukayo Saka impressed in attack for Arsenal, while Partey was influential in midfield, but it was the slick Martin Odegaard who stood out as he created five big chances for his team-mates in the first half alone.\nLacazette's confidently converted spot-kick ultimately moved the game beyond Leicester, after referee Anthony Taylor also took his time to review Soyuncu's subtle handball on the pitch-side monitor.\n\"We have seen so many decisions with VAR and things that have gone against us this season in similar situations,\" said Rodgers.\n\"Cags is reacting, he is moving his body, he can't move his body like a mannequin and have his arms straight down. Hugely disappointing.\"\nRodgers' side must quickly dust themselves down as focus switches to securing a place in the last eight of the Europa Conference League, as they take a 2-0 lead into their second leg against Rennes on Thursday.\nFor Arsenal, a meeting with title-chasing Liverpool on Wednesday will provide an acid test of their progress since a 4-0 loss at Anfield earlier this season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Meanwhile, Newcastle, beaten for the first time in nine Premier League matches, are 14th, 10 points clear of the relegation zone.\nThe relief and delight shown from Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, both at the goal and again at the final whistle, showed what this meant to him by screaming at the fans and punching the air.\nAnd it was easy to see why he was so emotional with the club's very existence potentially under threat.\nAbramovich has been the Chelsea owner for nearly 19 years, a period in which they have won 21 trophies, including the Premier League on five occasions and the Champions League twice.\nBut the current sanctions against him have stopped him selling Chelsea, and mean the club are unable to buy or sell players, cannot sell any more tickets for games, have had their credit cards suspended and have had to close the club shop.\nThe government said it would issue a special licence that allowed fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches, although the club's wage bill stands at \u00a328m a month.\nIt seemed fitting that Newcastle, another side with hugely controversial owners following their takeover in October by the Saudi Arabian-backed Public Investment Fund (PIF), were Chelsea's opponents on a day when events off the field were talked about as much as those on it.\nNewcastle's takeover and the potential huge investment into the club was celebrated by their fans a few months ago, although Amnesty International said \"it represented a clear attempt by the Saudi authorities to sportswash their appalling human rights record with the glamour of top-flight football\".\nPlenty of positives for Newcastle\nDespite the late defeat, this was another sign of the progress Newcastle are making on the pitch. There was plenty for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe to be positive about given his side were only a few minutes away from securing a point away at the current European and world champions.\nArriving at a club without a league win and with only six points from 12 matches, he began with five defeats in his first eight games in all competitions, including a humiliating home loss to third-tier Cambridge United in the FA Cup third round.\nBut, after spending \u00a380m in the January transfer window, the Magpies had been on a run of eight games unbeaten, including six victories, before this narrow loss.\nThe visitors had defended superbly up until Jorginho's excellent ball over the defence found Havertz, who showed his class to control it and then score the winner to delight the packed crowd at Stamford Bridge.\nHowe said he thought Havertz could have been sent off but was also disappointed his side did not get a second-half penalty when Trevoh Chalobah had a hold of Jacob Murphy's shirt.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Dean Smith's Norwich players wore a look of how key this remarkable finish may prove to their survival hopes.\nNorwich's hopes of survival have been hindered greatly by what is now a six-game losing run, but none of them are likely to sting as much as this.\nIn the final moments Smith sent goalkeeper Tim Krul forward for a corner in search of another equaliser and striker Teemu Pukki forced a vital save from Illan Meslier in the kind of frenetic ending that pointed to what was at stake.\nMarsch deserves credit for his role in the late mayhem as he moved to introduce Gelhardt for Mateusz Klich at a point where the life had been sucked out of the stadium.\nWhen Raphinha rounded Krul the Brazilian was able to give Gelhardt a simple task to lift the gloom that had set in after a 3-0 midweek defeat to Aston Villa.\nAgainst Villa, Leeds suffered the blow of losing four top-flight games in a row without scoring for the first time since March 1982.\nIt prompted Marsch to state \"this is a business for men\" and that the way out of relegation trouble would be paved with \"courage and belief\".\nThey showed plenty early on as Rodrigo drilled home via a deflection, Raphinha volleyed against the bar and Pascal Struijk turned over from close range after seeing an initial header saved.\nRodrigo's goal did not come without controversy as a long ball in the build-up was pursued by Bamford, who appeared offside.\nThe striker - making his first start since September - was chasing the ball but did not make a challenge, as a poor headed clearance allowed the energetic James to tee up Rodrigo.\nJames whipped an effort at goal after the break to prompt a superb save and Raphinha's sublime free-kick hit the bar before Norwich started their late push. Milot Rashica went down in the box under the challenge of Luke Ayling but the penalty awarded was overturned when replays showed the Norwich player had stood on Ayling's leg.\nTo their credit, Norwich refused to let the blow slow their momentum and their leveller was beautifully worked, with Pukki getting on the end of a fine long diagonal pass to fire a cross into the six-yard box for McLean to turn home.\nA draw might have been harsh on Leeds, who showed more energy than their visitors in the final third and ultimately created the better chances.\nNorwich are now increasingly staring at the prospect of relegation.\nSmith put three games without defeat together when he was appointed in November and another three-game run of form helped their cause in January. They will need to show character and find more than a pocket of good form after this harsh ending.\nLeeds, by contrast, will surely be filled with survival optimism.\nGo straight to all the best Leeds United content\nVisit our Norwich City page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

To West Ham fans, they also support me and Ukrainian people and also to all British people, because we feel you support us.\n\"I felt the support from the fans and I tried to give everything on the pitch because I know how important the game was for us today.

What happened in the boxes was a different story, that's where we lost the game.\n\"I think the whole team played fantastically well. I don't think the result reflects the performance, but in the box they had the decisive moments. They put the ball in the net twice.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC MOTD: \"Coming here and winning against Arsenal is already special, but winning the game like it was - more special. We started really well then it became an open game. We wanted to improve in the second half.\n\"I'm very excited about the team and the situation we are in but that does not change everything.

Our history obliges to be there but we are not there yet and there are still a lot of games to play.\n\"We have an excellent group of people at the club who believe in what we do. Then you have to put performance into results. The last few months, we have been more consistent.\"\nPartey headed in unchallenged from Gabriel Martinelli's corner after 11 minutes as the hosts capitalised on their dominant start.\nThe midfielder also struck the crossbar as Arsenal pressed for a second, while goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale was twice called upon to deny Harvey Barnes - including a superb reaction save from a header - as the visitors threatened before half-time.\nBut, after Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu was penalised for handball following a lengthy video assistant referee review, Lacazette fired in a 59th-minute penalty to put the Gunners in control.\nSoyuncu received only a yellow card as Partey's still goal-bound header was cleared off the line by the alert Luke Thomas.\nHowever, there was to be no way back for Brendan Rodgers's side, who remain 12th in the table.\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nVisit our Leicester City page\nArsenal on course to end Champions League wait\nSeeking to end a five-year absence from Europe's elite club competition, Arsenal ensured they remain in pole position in the race to qualify with a ninth win in 11 league games.\nWith three games in hand over fifth-placed United from which to further strengthen their position, Arteta's men - unlike their immediate rivals - have achieved consistency in both performances and results to emerge as favourites for fourth.\nThe opening goal was a familiar tale for Leicester, who have now conceded a league-high 15 goals from set-pieces - excluding penalties - after Partey's run to the near post went ignored.\nArsenal had amassed six shots before Leicester, sorely missing injured talisman Jamie Vardy, managed their first attempt after 24 minutes.\nBut, just as he was in October's reverse fixture, which Arsenal also won 2-0, the inspired Ramsdale was up to the task when the Foxes eventually gained a foothold in the contest.\nMartinelli and Bukayo Saka impressed in attack for Arsenal, while Partey was influential in midfield, but it was the slick Martin Odegaard who stood out as he created five big chances for his team-mates in the first half alone.\nLacazette's confidently converted spot-kick ultimately moved the game beyond Leicester, after referee Anthony Taylor also took his time to review Soyuncu's subtle handball on the pitch-side monitor.\n\"We have seen so many decisions with VAR and things that have gone against us this season in similar situations,\" said Rodgers.\n\"Cags is reacting, he is moving his body, he can't move his body like a mannequin and have his arms straight down.

What happened in the boxes was a different story, that's where we lost the game.\n\"I think the whole team played fantastically well. I don't think the result reflects the performance, but in the box they had the decisive moments. They put the ball in the net twice.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC MOTD: \"Coming here and winning against Arsenal is already special, but winning the game like it was - more special. We started really well then it became an open game. We wanted to improve in the second half.\n\"I'm very excited about the team and the situation we are in but that does not change everything.

Jack Harrison turned home the loose ball after Ayling had first struck a post to make it 2-1, then had the rebound cleared off the line.\nAnd three minutes later, after a Dan James effort had come back off the woodwork, Rodrigo's shot flew in as Conor Coady tried to clear off the line.\nThen, just as eight minutes of injury time was being signalled, Ayling reacted quickest as the ball bounced on the edge of the six-yard box and smashed it home before being mobbed by ecstatic team-mates.\nBreathless, bruising, brilliant - controversy and drama in Leeds' win at Wolves\nThe incident-packed game also included a protestor attempting to tie themselves to the Wolves goal when the ball was at the other end of the pitch in the second half.\nUnlike at Everton on Thursday, this time the stewards reacted quickly enough and dragged the culprit away.\nLeeds triumph amid the tension\nThe desire for victory was seen in the melee on the touchline that followed Leeds' winner.\nBoth sets of coaching staff got themselves in a push and shove, with Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips and Wolves defender Marcal continuing the verbals after order had been restored.\nPhillips had run across the pitch to celebrate Ayling's winner and was the only one pumped up as proceedings unfolded.\nBy the end, Wolves coach Bruno Lage was reacting with fury at every decision from referee Friend that was not to his liking.\nWhen he has cooled down, Lage will realise his side were the architects of their own downfall.\nJimenez will argue he was unlucky to be sent off but it was a challenge the Mexican did not have to make, with his side already two goals ahead, controlling midfield and Leeds running out of personnel and ideas.\nAt that stage, Joao Moutinho was running midfield and Willy Boly was outstanding at the back, Wolves having survived a couple of early scares as Rodrigo and Bamford failed to take their chances.\nThe result cost them a place in the top six and ended a two-match winning sequence.\nThey also lost the services of Ruben Neves as the midfielder was forced off halfway through the opening period.\nBamford injury blow\nAfter an excellent week, Leeds' decision to replace the much-loved Marcelo Bielsa with Jesse Marsch is now looking like a masterstroke.\nBack-to-back last-gasp wins for only the second time this season has been a pretty impressive way to bounce back from six straight defeats and after such a long struggle, Leeds' top-flight future is looking more secure than it has done for some time.\nHowever, this victory, as memorable as it was, came with a heavy price, particularly for striker Bamford, who did not reach half-time in the third game of his latest comeback.\nWhen he made his England debut at the beginning of September, Bamford must have been looking forward to another memorable campaign after scoring 17 times on Leeds' triumphant return to the top flight.\nWithin a fortnight, he suffered an ankle injury that ruled him out for three months and then immediately sustained a hamstring problem that kept him on the sidelines for another three months.\nHis latest setback came as he landed awkwardly as he led a charge into the Wolves penalty area.\nBamford immediately knew he could not continue and after walking slowly back to the dugout, slumped in his seat and pulled his shirt over his head in obvious disappointment.\nHad that been the only injury issue Marsch had to deal with, it would have been bad enough.\nThat he also lost Diego Llorente and Mateusz Klich before half-time and goalkeeper Meslier after the collision that resulted in Jimenez's dismissal made a difficult situation totally disruptive.\nKlich's exit at least allowed for a concussion substitution but it was little surprise that the visitors lost their way after a bright start.\nWhen the half-time whistle sounded, it seemed to be a brief interlude in what would be a depressingly long night for Leeds.\nBut Jimenez's exit provided the spark they needed to ignite an amazing comeback that sends them into the international break in very good spirits.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

We really want [to finish in the top four] and we are going to give it a go.\"\nVilla improved after the break and went close when Ollie Watkins' deflected shot clipped the outside of the post, before substitute Danny Ings sent a looping header on to the roof of the net.\nFootball Daily podcast: Arsenal gunning for top four\nSaka stars as Arsenal secure vital win\nArsenal's jubilant celebrations at the final whistle showed just how significant they feel this result could be as the north London club seek to return to the Champions League for the first time in five years.\nThe win was based on a vibrant first-half display, followed up by a resilient defensive performance after the break.\nSaka was excellent during the opening 45 minutes, tormenting 36-year-old Ashley Young who was in the Villa side for the injured Lucas Digne.\nSaka got in behind Young inside the opening two minutes to create a chance for Emile Smith Rowe, while another cross struck Ezri Konsa and needed a fine stop from Emiliano Martinez to prevent an own goal.\nThe goal came from a quickly taken free-kick that caught Villa out down the right, with Cedric's cross only cleared to Saka at the edge of the box, who fired home through a crowd of players for his 10th goal of the season in all competitions.\nArsenal tired after the break which allowed Villa to get more of a grip on the game, but they prevented the home side from having a shot on target until the final minute of stoppage time, when Philippe Coutinho's free-kick was pushed away by Bernd Leno.\nReaction to Aston Villa v Arsenal\nRamsdale ruled out of England friendlies\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nVisit our Aston Villa page\nVilla stifled in narrow defeat\nSteven Gerrard's side went into this game having lost nine of their 11 top-flight fixtures this season against the current top eight, most recently a 2-1 defeat at West Ham last week that brought a run of three successive wins without conceding to an end.\nThe gap between the Midlands side and those above them again looked significant during a poor first half that saw them fail to muster a shot on or off target.\n\"It was a tough first half because we allowed it to be tough,\" Gerrard told BT Sport. \"I think we were indecisive in the things we tried to do. I think our performance lacked belief. It wasn't until after half-time that we showed we can be better.\"\nVilla did improve after the break but failed to put the Arsenal backline under any sustained pressure, with the attacking threat of forwards Coutinho and Emiliano Buendia stifled by the visitors.\nJohn McGinn went close with a curling effort from distance while their best opportunity fell to Watkins, whose effort from inside the area struck Kieran Tierney's knee before clipping the outside of the post.\nThe defeat means any European challenge now looks unlikely, with 10 points separating them and Wolves in eighth.\nBut a first Premier League top-10 finish in 11 years is definitely achievable and would be a sign of the progress made under Gerrard, given they were two points above the relegation zone in 16th when he was appointed in November.\n\"I don't think teams like Arsenal are a step too far,\" added the former Rangers boss. \"But there is a gap we need to close. We are working on that.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Meanwhile, Newcastle, beaten for the first time in nine Premier League matches, are 14th, 10 points clear of the relegation zone.\nThe relief and delight shown from Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, both at the goal and again at the final whistle, showed what this meant to him by screaming at the fans and punching the air.\nAnd it was easy to see why he was so emotional with the club's very existence potentially under threat.\nAbramovich has been the Chelsea owner for nearly 19 years, a period in which they have won 21 trophies, including the Premier League on five occasions and the Champions League twice.\nBut the current sanctions against him have stopped him selling Chelsea, and mean the club are unable to buy or sell players, cannot sell any more tickets for games, have had their credit cards suspended and have had to close the club shop.\nThe government said it would issue a special licence that allowed fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches, although the club's wage bill stands at \u00a328m a month.\nIt seemed fitting that Newcastle, another side with hugely controversial owners following their takeover in October by the Saudi Arabian-backed Public Investment Fund (PIF), were Chelsea's opponents on a day when events off the field were talked about as much as those on it.\nNewcastle's takeover and the potential huge investment into the club was celebrated by their fans a few months ago, although Amnesty International said \"it represented a clear attempt by the Saudi authorities to sportswash their appalling human rights record with the glamour of top-flight football\".\nPlenty of positives for Newcastle\nDespite the late defeat, this was another sign of the progress Newcastle are making on the pitch. There was plenty for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe to be positive about given his side were only a few minutes away from securing a point away at the current European and world champions.\nArriving at a club without a league win and with only six points from 12 matches, he began with five defeats in his first eight games in all competitions, including a humiliating home loss to third-tier Cambridge United in the FA Cup third round.\nBut, after spending \u00a380m in the January transfer window, the Magpies had been on a run of eight games unbeaten, including six victories, before this narrow loss.\nThe visitors had defended superbly up until Jorginho's excellent ball over the defence found Havertz, who showed his class to control it and then score the winner to delight the packed crowd at Stamford Bridge.\nHowe said he thought Havertz could have been sent off but was also disappointed his side did not get a second-half penalty when Trevoh Chalobah had a hold of Jacob Murphy's shirt.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Cristian Romero had earlier put the visitors in front, deflecting in Dejan Kulusevski's shot past the helpless Brighton goalkeeper, and into the bottom left corner.\nThe result sees Conte's side move up to seventh in the table with 48 points three points adrift of fourth-placed Arsenal having played a game more.\nHowever, they are only two points behind fifth-placed Manchester United, level on points with West Ham and have a game in hand on both before they host the Hammers on Sunday.\nFollow all Wednesday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion content\nVisit our Tottenham page\nKane goes fifth in Premier League goals list\nIn the build-up to the game Conte had challenged his senior players to help deliver Champions League qualification and, in a show of faith, he named the same starting XI that began their defeat at Old Trafford.\nKane did not disappoint, putting a glaring early miss behind him to ensure a favourable outcome for his side.\nHaving charged down an attempted Sanchez clearance the 28-year-old could not contain his look of disappointment as he placed a side-footed effort wide of a vacant Brighton goal.\nHowever, it was not to last for long and his influence grew throughout the match.\nHe repeatedly dropped into pockets of space in midfield, but also showed the nous to run beyond the Brighton backline as he raced onto Rodrigo Bentancur's pass to drive a low effort past Sanchez just before the hour.\nHis goal leaves him in distinguished company with only Alan Shearer (260), Wayne Rooney (208), Andrew Cole (187) and Sergio Aguero (184) having scored more Premier League goals.\nA Sanchez save prevented him from curling his second of the night into the top corner, while he also had a late penalty claim turned down.\nBrighton's dismal run continues\nWhile Tottenham give the appearance of a side getting close to fulfilling their manager's expectations, Brighton look shorn of confidence after a dismal run of form.\nThe Seagulls have now lost six consecutive league games for the first time since 2006, when they were in the Championship, and will come up against a Norwich side fighting for top-flight survival on Saturday 2 April in their first match after the international break.\nThat is followed by tough assignments at Arsenal, Spurs and Manchester City and they have the feel of a team wondering where their next points are coming from.\nWhile they improved significantly after the break they rarely looked like cutting open the Spurs defence and unsurprisingly failed to register a single effort on target.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Dean Smith's Norwich players wore a look of how key this remarkable finish may prove to their survival hopes.\nNorwich's hopes of survival have been hindered greatly by what is now a six-game losing run, but none of them are likely to sting as much as this.\nIn the final moments Smith sent goalkeeper Tim Krul forward for a corner in search of another equaliser and striker Teemu Pukki forced a vital save from Illan Meslier in the kind of frenetic ending that pointed to what was at stake.\nMarsch deserves credit for his role in the late mayhem as he moved to introduce Gelhardt for Mateusz Klich at a point where the life had been sucked out of the stadium.\nWhen Raphinha rounded Krul the Brazilian was able to give Gelhardt a simple task to lift the gloom that had set in after a 3-0 midweek defeat to Aston Villa.\nAgainst Villa, Leeds suffered the blow of losing four top-flight games in a row without scoring for the first time since March 1982.\nIt prompted Marsch to state \"this is a business for men\" and that the way out of relegation trouble would be paved with \"courage and belief\".\nThey showed plenty early on as Rodrigo drilled home via a deflection, Raphinha volleyed against the bar and Pascal Struijk turned over from close range after seeing an initial header saved.\nRodrigo's goal did not come without controversy as a long ball in the build-up was pursued by Bamford, who appeared offside.\nThe striker - making his first start since September - was chasing the ball but did not make a challenge, as a poor headed clearance allowed the energetic James to tee up Rodrigo.\nJames whipped an effort at goal after the break to prompt a superb save and Raphinha's sublime free-kick hit the bar before Norwich started their late push. Milot Rashica went down in the box under the challenge of Luke Ayling but the penalty awarded was overturned when replays showed the Norwich player had stood on Ayling's leg.\nTo their credit, Norwich refused to let the blow slow their momentum and their leveller was beautifully worked, with Pukki getting on the end of a fine long diagonal pass to fire a cross into the six-yard box for McLean to turn home.\nA draw might have been harsh on Leeds, who showed more energy than their visitors in the final third and ultimately created the better chances.\nNorwich are now increasingly staring at the prospect of relegation.\nSmith put three games without defeat together when he was appointed in November and another three-game run of form helped their cause in January. They will need to show character and find more than a pocket of good form after this harsh ending.\nLeeds, by contrast, will surely be filled with survival optimism.\nGo straight to all the best Leeds United content\nVisit our Norwich City page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Jack Harrison turned home the loose ball after Ayling had first struck a post to make it 2-1, then had the rebound cleared off the line.\nAnd three minutes later, after a Dan James effort had come back off the woodwork, Rodrigo's shot flew in as Conor Coady tried to clear off the line.\nThen, just as eight minutes of injury time was being signalled, Ayling reacted quickest as the ball bounced on the edge of the six-yard box and smashed it home before being mobbed by ecstatic team-mates.\nBreathless, bruising, brilliant - controversy and drama in Leeds' win at Wolves\nThe incident-packed game also included a protestor attempting to tie themselves to the Wolves goal when the ball was at the other end of the pitch in the second half.\nUnlike at Everton on Thursday, this time the stewards reacted quickly enough and dragged the culprit away.\nLeeds triumph amid the tension\nThe desire for victory was seen in the melee on the touchline that followed Leeds' winner.\nBoth sets of coaching staff got themselves in a push and shove, with Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips and Wolves defender Marcal continuing the verbals after order had been restored.\nPhillips had run across the pitch to celebrate Ayling's winner and was the only one pumped up as proceedings unfolded.\nBy the end, Wolves coach Bruno Lage was reacting with fury at every decision from referee Friend that was not to his liking.\nWhen he has cooled down, Lage will realise his side were the architects of their own downfall.\nJimenez will argue he was unlucky to be sent off but it was a challenge the Mexican did not have to make, with his side already two goals ahead, controlling midfield and Leeds running out of personnel and ideas.\nAt that stage, Joao Moutinho was running midfield and Willy Boly was outstanding at the back, Wolves having survived a couple of early scares as Rodrigo and Bamford failed to take their chances.\nThe result cost them a place in the top six and ended a two-match winning sequence.\nThey also lost the services of Ruben Neves as the midfielder was forced off halfway through the opening period.\nBamford injury blow\nAfter an excellent week, Leeds' decision to replace the much-loved Marcelo Bielsa with Jesse Marsch is now looking like a masterstroke.\nBack-to-back last-gasp wins for only the second time this season has been a pretty impressive way to bounce back from six straight defeats and after such a long struggle, Leeds' top-flight future is looking more secure than it has done for some time.\nHowever, this victory, as memorable as it was, came with a heavy price, particularly for striker Bamford, who did not reach half-time in the third game of his latest comeback.\nWhen he made his England debut at the beginning of September, Bamford must have been looking forward to another memorable campaign after scoring 17 times on Leeds' triumphant return to the top flight.\nWithin a fortnight, he suffered an ankle injury that ruled him out for three months and then immediately sustained a hamstring problem that kept him on the sidelines for another three months.\nHis latest setback came as he landed awkwardly as he led a charge into the Wolves penalty area.\nBamford immediately knew he could not continue and after walking slowly back to the dugout, slumped in his seat and pulled his shirt over his head in obvious disappointment.\nHad that been the only injury issue Marsch had to deal with, it would have been bad enough.\nThat he also lost Diego Llorente and Mateusz Klich before half-time and goalkeeper Meslier after the collision that resulted in Jimenez's dismissal made a difficult situation totally disruptive.\nKlich's exit at least allowed for a concussion substitution but it was little surprise that the visitors lost their way after a bright start.\nWhen the half-time whistle sounded, it seemed to be a brief interlude in what would be a depressingly long night for Leeds.\nBut Jimenez's exit provided the spark they needed to ignite an amazing comeback that sends them into the international break in very good spirits.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

He timed his run to perfection as Jadon Sancho made the most of Sergio Reguilon's struggles within the Tottenham defensive line to deliver the low cross that his vastly experienced team-mate turned home with ease.\nAnd if anyone was likely to get a winner, it was United's number seven.\nWhen he did, Ronaldo was immediately replaced to a standing ovation that was totally deserved.\nLWLWLWL - Tottenham's consistent inconsistency\nTottenham's season was summed up by Antonio Conte's reaction to what he thought was a first-half equaliser from Ben Davies.\nAs the ball hit the net, there was wild celebration. Then the assistant's flag went up and Conte was stopped in his tracks.\nTottenham's past seven results have alternated between wins and defeats - with three victories punctuating four losses. And their tendency to wobble let them down again here.\nHaving gone behind, they worked their way back into the game once - and there was never much doubt Kane would drive home the spot-kick after Telles had handled in the area. But the manner in which they went 2-1 down three minutes later highlighted obvious deficiencies, with Reguilon switching off on the far side of the pitch.\nTottenham then got back into the game a second time, and deserved to, even if Maguire scored for them.\nBut such is Spurs' inconsistency, few would believe they can genuinely overhaul Arsenal to seal a top four berth even if, mathematically, they still have a better chance of doing so than United.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Their half was summed up when the effervescent Anthony Gordon missed a kick on the edge of the area.\nThe second half took a bizarre twist when a protestor tied himself to a goalpost at the Gwladys Street End, which led to an eight-minute delay.\nBut the break did not lead to an improvement as Demarai Gray shot wide and Guimaraes then mis-hit a shot which was saved before the game turned in Newcastle's favour with Allan was sent off just as his team were in the ascendancy.\nGordon had tested Dubravka with a curling effort, with Seamus Coleman appealing for a penalty shortly afterwards.\nBut as Newcastle broke away Allan took out Saint-Maximin, which led to a booking, which was soon overturned as Pawson was directed to the monitor by the video assistant referee Stuart Attwell.\nThat led to a feeling of acrimony inside Goodison, in tune with Everton's recent form.\nThe late reprieve and the host's ability to hold on as Newcastle pressed for an equaliser, turned the mood on its head, however.\nLampard will hope it can now lead to his team's Premier League survival.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Their half was summed up when the effervescent Anthony Gordon missed a kick on the edge of the area.\nThe second half took a bizarre twist when a protestor tied himself to a goalpost at the Gwladys Street End, which led to an eight-minute delay.\nBut the break did not lead to an improvement as Demarai Gray shot wide and Guimaraes then mis-hit a shot which was saved before the game turned in Newcastle's favour with Allan was sent off just as his team were in the ascendancy.\nGordon had tested Dubravka with a curling effort, with Seamus Coleman appealing for a penalty shortly afterwards.\nBut as Newcastle broke away Allan took out Saint-Maximin, which led to a booking, which was soon overturned as Pawson was directed to the monitor by the video assistant referee Stuart Attwell.\nThat led to a feeling of acrimony inside Goodison, in tune with Everton's recent form.\nThe late reprieve and the host's ability to hold on as Newcastle pressed for an equaliser, turned the mood on its head, however.\nLampard will hope it can now lead to his team's Premier League survival.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Michail Antonio burst clear of the Everton defence and his shot was blocked by Pickford but the rebound fell to Jarrod Bowen, back in the side after recovering from a fractured foot, and he steered the ball into the unguarded net.\nThings then got worse for the visitors when captain Michael Keane was sent off midway through the half for his second bookable offence, following his second late challenge on Antonio.

Spurs, who beat Newcastle 5-1 later on Sunday, have a game in hand while fifth-placed Arsenal have played three games fewer than the Hammers.\nThis result continues a hugely impressive season for David Moyes' side, who face Lyon in the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Europa League on Thursday with Barcelona a potential semi-final opponent if they get there.\nIf they win that competition it would be their first European trophy since lifting the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965 and would secure a Champions League spot, regardless of their final Premier League position.\nAt a packed London Stadium, Cresswell's brilliant free-kick gave them the lead and they had chances to make it 2-0 but Pablo Fornals shot just over and Antonio, after rounding Pickford, could only shoot into the side-netting from a tight angle.\nThose misses looked to have been costly when Holgate, a last-minute addition to the Everton side after Donny van de Beek was injured in the warm-up, hit a half-volley after Richarlison had nudged the ball into his path, with it bouncing off Fornals and past Lukasz Fabianski.\nBut only a few minutes later Everton's Alex Iwobi lost possession, Antonio broke clear and Bowen scored the follow-up for his 13th goal of the season in all competitions.\nEverton's miserable away run continues\nThe result continued a terrible run of form for Everton in matches played outside Goodison Park. Indeed, their total of six points from 14 away games this season is the lowest from any of the 92 sides in the Premier League or the EFL.\nTheir past two away games had seen them thrashed 5-0 and 4-0 by Tottenham and Crystal Palace respectively, with boss Frank Lampard challenging his side's players to show their character after the second of those losses.\nHe will be pleased with how they started the second half and their equaliser, but equally frustrated by the manner in which they quickly fell behind again and the dismissal of Keane after he had given Michael Oliver no choice but to send him off with a rash sliding challenge on Antonio when already on a yellow card.\nEverton, who recently announced losses of \u00a3120.9m for the 2020-21 season, have played in English football's top flight in every season since 1954-55, but they face a battle to keep that run going with 10 games of their season remaining.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It was made worse when defender Godfrey also sliced a clearance from Matej Vydra's cross, allowing Cornet to finish.\nEverton now face a daunting task to stay in the league - and relegation would cause huge problems for a team that has registered heavy losses over the past three years.\nCornet hands Clarets a lifeline\nBurnley's stay in the Premier League has been less established than their opponents, but they showed the grit and determination needed to stay up.\nIn both halves they started well and caused all sorts of problems from set-pieces, scoring for the first time in five games through Collins' early goal.\nThey might have had cause to complain about both penalties, which the home fans certainly felt were soft. The second, via VAR, saw them vent their frustrations at referee Dean.\nBut Rodriguez's goal was crucial in re-affirming their status in the game, and they defended well to deny Everton another.\nThe fact they were gifted the winner will matter little to Dyche or Burnley's support, with fireworks being let off outside the stadium in celebration at the end.\nThey also know they have a run-in which appears more favourable than that faced by Everton.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

And, asked to occupy the number nine position when he was introduced for the final 35 minutes, Rashford continued to look ill at ease.\nRangnick provided detailed instructions as Rashford waited to come on and then, together with technical director Darren Fletcher, offered more as the game entered its final 20 minutes.\nFleetingly, it looked like Rashford's world would turn. Deep into stoppage time, he picked the ball up just outside the box and drove at the Leicester defence. But just as space opened up to shoot, an offside Anthony Elanga got in his way and the chance was gone.\nLeicester come close to landmark win\nGiven Leicester's only hope of salvaging something tangible out of this injury-ravaged campaign comes through the Europa Conference League, starting with Thursday's quarter-final first leg with PSV Eindhoven, they could be forgiven their listless start.\nBrendan Rodgers was buoyed by the return of Jonny Evans and Wesley Fofana, who started together in defence for the first time since last May's FA Cup final.\nGiven the paucity of what the home side presented them with, Leicester grew in confidence and Iheanacho should really have put them in front before the break when he screwed a shot from the edge of the area wide after the Nigerian had been left totally unmarked.\nVictory would have been the first time Leicester had won successive away games at Old Trafford and the disappointment from Rodgers' perspective would be that his team did not hold on to their lead long enough.\nYet, even after United's equaliser, they carried the greater threat. Iheanacho chipped over from an acute angle after Jadon Sancho's stray backpass had sent him through before Fofana brought a superb save out of David de Gea with a header that was bound for the top corner.\nRodgers thought Maddison had won it and questioned fourth official Martin Atkinson when the goal was ruled out. He was still unconvinced even after the decision had been explained.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The margin of the scoreline did not flatter them.\nThomas Frank's side took the fight to Chelsea from the first whistle, with striker Ivan Toney having three presentable chances as they went right on the front foot.\nIf there was any disappointment, it was the fact they did not cash in on that superiority, and they paid for it when Rudiger fired Chelsea in front.\nBrentford's response was truly outstanding, giving them the result that surely means they will stay in the Premier League next season.\nAnd there is no doubt Eriksen's presence has lifted those around him. Brentford have won all three games he has started since making his comeback as a substitute against Newcastle United in late February.\nEriksen may be the star name but this was the complete all-round display, with Toney giving Chelsea's vulnerable defence a torrid time and Janelt providing the cutting edge.\nBrentford were also resolute in defence, with Frank and his players fully deserving the huge ovation they received from their ecstatic fans after the final whistle.\nChelsea get what they deserve\nChelsea can have no complaints about this defeat or the embarrassing scoreline as they were abject in a performance that was completely out of character with their recent efforts.\nTuchel's side won their six matches in March but were never fully switched on from first to last and paid the price.\nIf there is any consolation for Tuchel - and he will have to search very hard to find any - it is that this did not come in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge.\nIf they repeat this horrible defensive performance, and indeed their entire shambolic effort, their hopes of retaining the trophy they won last June might be over.\nDespite the usually reliable presence of Rudiger and Thiago Silva, Chelsea were never unable to control Brentford, who ran them ragged and actually should have scored more than four goals.\nChelsea must hope this is a blip, rather like their 5-2 home loss to the eventually relegated West Brom last season, because they cannot afford this when Real Madrid come here this week.\nThe likes of Karim Benzema would have been licking their lips watching this defensive fiasco.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

When you come here you have to compete, you have to win duels and second balls and be aggressive and we were none of those.\"\nThe Gunners would have moved above rivals Tottenham with victory or even a draw but fell behind early on through Jean-Philippe Mateta's header following a free-kick.\nThings got worse for the visitors a few minutes later when Jordan Ayew got away from two Arsenal defenders and bent a shot beyond Aaron Ramsdale.\nArsenal showed some improvement after the break and should have at least got one back as Martin Odegaard shot wide when unmarked inside the box, while Eddie Nketiah hit the woodwork.\nPalace made sure of a hugely impressive win when Wilfried Zaha was brought down inside the box late on and the forward stepped up to convert the penalty.\nThe victory, Palace's first at home in the league in 2022, moves them up to ninth while Arsenal remain fifth and outside the top four on goal difference, albeit with a game in hand.\nTierney injury does not look good - Arteta\nRead reaction to Crystal Palace's game with Arsenal\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\nVisit our Arsenal page\nAn opportunity missed by Arsenal\nA dreadful start to the season had seen the Gunners briefly flirting with the relegation places but they have been transformed as the campaign has gone on.\nThey went into this game knowing they had a huge opportunity to put themselves in the driving seat for Champions League football next season with a win and they had every right to feel confident of getting it on the back of six wins in their last seven games.\nBut they never got going against a tenacious Palace side as they lacked the same level of aggression as their hosts.\nListen: Football Daily podcast - reaction as Palace thrash Arsenal\nArsenal have that game in a hand over Tottenham, so still have the opportunity to make amends for this poor performance and recent form suggests this display was an outlier.\nHowever, Arteta knows they will need to show significant improvement in the coming games to ensure they end the season in the top four, particularly after Spurs thrashed Newcastle 5-1 on Sunday.\nTo make matters worse, Arsenal could be without full-back Kieran Tierney for a period of time as he missed the game with a knee injury, while midfielder Thomas Partey went off injured in the second half.\nVieira gets one over his old team in some style\nPalace boss Vieira is a club legend at Arsenal following many years of dominating the middle of the park for the Gunners, and he came within seconds of a famous win at the home of his former side in October.\nBack then, an injury-time equaliser by Alexandre Lacazette broke Palace fans' hearts but there was nothing to spoil the party this time as Palace produced a stunning display.\nThey were more aggressive than Arsenal and showed more desire, with every single member of the Palace team playing their part in what is undoubtedly one of the standout results of Vieira's impressive reign at Selhurst Park.\n\"It was a really good team performance,\" said Vieria. \"There have been games where we performed well but didn't take our chances but in this game we performed well from the start and we managed to win the game and not concede.\n\"I don't think it is the best performance, it is the performance we want and expect.

Norwich, meanwhile, remain eight points adrift of safety after a passive display.\nMaupay's big chance came just shy of the half-hour mark, after Sam Byram's handball was spotted by referee Simon Hooper.\nThe French striker, though, shot high over the bar to mocking cheers from the travelling supporters.\nBrighton had created chances before that, with good play down the left from Leandro Trossard leading to a mishit shot from Maupay, before Danny Welbeck saw a close-range effort blocked.\nThe hosts' lack of cutting edge continued to frustrate them after Maupay's spot-kick miss. Solly March and Alexis Mac Allister failed to hit the target numerous times, and the final ball was badly lacking.\nTrossard's attempts to spark the hosts into life led to a glorious chance for Joel Veltman 10 minutes after the restart. His quick feet won a corner, which the Dutchman headed goalwards, only to be denied by fellow countryman Tim Krul at point-blank range.\nMaupay and Veltman were denied by a Norwich rearguard marshalled superbly by Grant Hanley, in the face of relentless second-half pressure from the hosts.\nIn the end, the Seagulls could find no way through, and remain goalless at home since mid-January. Indeed, Norwich almost stole victory when Milot Rashica blazed Teemu Pukki's cross over the bar inside the area.\nGoal-shy Brighton left to rue Maupay miss\nBrighton had 29 shots and more than 60% possession but crucially only hit the target four times. That has been a long-running issue for Potter's side, who again showcased their quality in the build-up, but were let down in front of goal.\nIt simply wasn't Maupay's day, from the moment he miscued his effort with the goal gaping in the first half. Goalkeeper Krul's mind-games before his spot-kick clearly paid off before it sailed over the bar.\nThere were bright moments from Trossard and Mac Allister, while Tariq Lamptey clearly thrives in a more advanced role on the right, but this was not the way Brighton will have wanted to end their losing run.\nNorwich work hard but look toothless up front\nThere was plenty of commitment on show from Norwich; they battled well and remained strong in defence.\nKrul and Hanley in particular were superb in keeping Brighton at bay, as the Canaries ended their own run of six successive league defeats.\nBut they remain far from safety and although there were a couple of chances to win it, they couldn't sustain an attacking threat as Brighton put them under intense pressure.\nWhile they will take a point, their long-term prospects look ominous - and it increasingly looks as if they will see a third successive Premier League stint ended after just one season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

I've got to fix it and I will fix it.\n\"The players in the building have to help me fix it now. If not, we will get players in who will help me fix it.\"\nThe victory took Wolves above West Ham and five points behind fourth-placed Arsenal in the final Champions League spot - although the Gunners have three games in hand.\nWolves dreaming of European return\nFor Wolves, it was a third victory in seven games, even if in the end it was tighter than they might have liked.\nThey are now seventh in the Premier League and, if they stay there, will qualify for next season's Europa Conference League - as long as Crystal Palace do not win the FA Cup (in which case the Eagles would play in Europe instead).\nWolves are trying to secure European football for the second time in four seasons after reaching the Europa League quarter-finals in 2019-20.\nDespite being without midfielder Ruben Neves, out for a month with a knee injury, and suspended striker Raul Jimenez after his red card against Leeds, Bruno Lage's side looked a threat every time they attacked against a surprisingly vulnerable Villa defence.\nWolves went ahead after only seven minutes when Villa's John McGinn slipped and lost possession before team-mate Ezri Konsa also fell over. That enabled the hosts to counter, with Jonny scoring with a great strike after Lucas Digne had blocked Fabio Silva's shot.\nIt was Jonny's second goal in consecutive matches in only his sixth appearance of the season, after being out for 10 months with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.\nThe hosts doubled their lead in the 36th minute in fortunate circumstances when Young, on in place of the injured Digne, slipped when trying to deal with Marcal's left-wing cross and headed into his own net.\nNo Wolves collapse this week, just\nWolves threw away a 2-0 lead against Leeds before losing 3-2 on 18 March, and their fans would have been fearing a repeat late on at Molineux.\nVilla's best chances in the first half came from long distance, with Philippe Coutinho narrowly firing a free-kick over and Leon Bailey having an excellent effort tipped over by goalkeeper Jose Sa.\nWatkins, who scored for England in their 3-0 win over Ivory Coast on Tuesday, twice had chances to halve the deficit before Wolves substitute Hwang Hee-chan almost added another for the hosts within two minutes of coming on, but shot wide.\nWhen Watkins was fouled by Sa, he converted the penalty for his eighth Premier League goal of the season to set up a frantic finale. Poland right-back Cash had the chance to equalise, but his injury-time volley was excellently saved by Sa.\n\"It's the same feeling we had against Leeds,\" said Wolves boss Bruno Lage. \"That's why 2-0 is so dangerous, especially in this competition.\n\"I'm happy because we won. We played the way we wanted to play. The game plan was perfect.\n\"We need that mentality to kill the game, score the third goal and not to give hope to the opponent.\"\nVilla dropped to 10th in the Premier League but do not have much to play for, now 13 points behind Wolves and 14 clear of the relegation zone.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

And, asked to occupy the number nine position when he was introduced for the final 35 minutes, Rashford continued to look ill at ease.\nRangnick provided detailed instructions as Rashford waited to come on and then, together with technical director Darren Fletcher, offered more as the game entered its final 20 minutes.\nFleetingly, it looked like Rashford's world would turn. Deep into stoppage time, he picked the ball up just outside the box and drove at the Leicester defence. But just as space opened up to shoot, an offside Anthony Elanga got in his way and the chance was gone.\nLeicester come close to landmark win\nGiven Leicester's only hope of salvaging something tangible out of this injury-ravaged campaign comes through the Europa Conference League, starting with Thursday's quarter-final first leg with PSV Eindhoven, they could be forgiven their listless start.\nBrendan Rodgers was buoyed by the return of Jonny Evans and Wesley Fofana, who started together in defence for the first time since last May's FA Cup final.\nGiven the paucity of what the home side presented them with, Leicester grew in confidence and Iheanacho should really have put them in front before the break when he screwed a shot from the edge of the area wide after the Nigerian had been left totally unmarked.\nVictory would have been the first time Leicester had won successive away games at Old Trafford and the disappointment from Rodgers' perspective would be that his team did not hold on to their lead long enough.\nYet, even after United's equaliser, they carried the greater threat. Iheanacho chipped over from an acute angle after Jadon Sancho's stray backpass had sent him through before Fofana brought a superb save out of David de Gea with a header that was bound for the top corner.\nRodgers thought Maddison had won it and questioned fourth official Martin Atkinson when the goal was ruled out. He was still unconvinced even after the decision had been explained.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The margin of the scoreline did not flatter them.\nThomas Frank's side took the fight to Chelsea from the first whistle, with striker Ivan Toney having three presentable chances as they went right on the front foot.\nIf there was any disappointment, it was the fact they did not cash in on that superiority, and they paid for it when Rudiger fired Chelsea in front.\nBrentford's response was truly outstanding, giving them the result that surely means they will stay in the Premier League next season.\nAnd there is no doubt Eriksen's presence has lifted those around him. Brentford have won all three games he has started since making his comeback as a substitute against Newcastle United in late February.\nEriksen may be the star name but this was the complete all-round display, with Toney giving Chelsea's vulnerable defence a torrid time and Janelt providing the cutting edge.\nBrentford were also resolute in defence, with Frank and his players fully deserving the huge ovation they received from their ecstatic fans after the final whistle.\nChelsea get what they deserve\nChelsea can have no complaints about this defeat or the embarrassing scoreline as they were abject in a performance that was completely out of character with their recent efforts.\nTuchel's side won their six matches in March but were never fully switched on from first to last and paid the price.\nIf there is any consolation for Tuchel - and he will have to search very hard to find any - it is that this did not come in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge.\nIf they repeat this horrible defensive performance, and indeed their entire shambolic effort, their hopes of retaining the trophy they won last June might be over.\nDespite the usually reliable presence of Rudiger and Thiago Silva, Chelsea were never unable to control Brentford, who ran them ragged and actually should have scored more than four goals.\nChelsea must hope this is a blip, rather like their 5-2 home loss to the eventually relegated West Brom last season, because they cannot afford this when Real Madrid come here this week.\nThe likes of Karim Benzema would have been licking their lips watching this defensive fiasco.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Michail Antonio burst clear of the Everton defence and his shot was blocked by Pickford but the rebound fell to Jarrod Bowen, back in the side after recovering from a fractured foot, and he steered the ball into the unguarded net.\nThings then got worse for the visitors when captain Michael Keane was sent off midway through the half for his second bookable offence, following his second late challenge on Antonio. There was no way back for the visitors after that.\nEverton are 17th in the Premier League, three points clear of 18th-placed Watford.

Spurs, who beat Newcastle 5-1 later on Sunday, have a game in hand while fifth-placed Arsenal have played three games fewer than the Hammers.\nThis result continues a hugely impressive season for David Moyes' side, who face Lyon in the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Europa League on Thursday with Barcelona a potential semi-final opponent if they get there.\nIf they win that competition it would be their first European trophy since lifting the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965 and would secure a Champions League spot, regardless of their final Premier League position.\nAt a packed London Stadium, Cresswell's brilliant free-kick gave them the lead and they had chances to make it 2-0 but Pablo Fornals shot just over and Antonio, after rounding Pickford, could only shoot into the side-netting from a tight angle.\nThose misses looked to have been costly when Holgate, a last-minute addition to the Everton side after Donny van de Beek was injured in the warm-up, hit a half-volley after Richarlison had nudged the ball into his path, with it bouncing off Fornals and past Lukasz Fabianski.\nBut only a few minutes later Everton's Alex Iwobi lost possession, Antonio broke clear and Bowen scored the follow-up for his 13th goal of the season in all competitions.\nEverton's miserable away run continues\nThe result continued a terrible run of form for Everton in matches played outside Goodison Park. Indeed, their total of six points from 14 away games this season is the lowest from any of the 92 sides in the Premier League or the EFL.\nTheir past two away games had seen them thrashed 5-0 and 4-0 by Tottenham and Crystal Palace respectively, with boss Frank Lampard challenging his side's players to show their character after the second of those losses.\nHe will be pleased with how they started the second half and their equaliser, but equally frustrated by the manner in which they quickly fell behind again and the dismissal of Keane after he had given Michael Oliver no choice but to send him off with a rash sliding challenge on Antonio when already on a yellow card.\nEverton, who recently announced losses of \u00a3120.9m for the 2020-21 season, have played in English football's top flight in every season since 1954-55, but they face a battle to keep that run going with 10 games of their season remaining.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Norwich, meanwhile, remain eight points adrift of safety after a passive display.\nMaupay's big chance came just shy of the half-hour mark, after Sam Byram's handball was spotted by referee Simon Hooper.\nThe French striker, though, shot high over the bar to mocking cheers from the travelling supporters.\nBrighton had created chances before that, with good play down the left from Leandro Trossard leading to a mishit shot from Maupay, before Danny Welbeck saw a close-range effort blocked.\nThe hosts' lack of cutting edge continued to frustrate them after Maupay's spot-kick miss. Solly March and Alexis Mac Allister failed to hit the target numerous times, and the final ball was badly lacking.\nTrossard's attempts to spark the hosts into life led to a glorious chance for Joel Veltman 10 minutes after the restart. His quick feet won a corner, which the Dutchman headed goalwards, only to be denied by fellow countryman Tim Krul at point-blank range.\nMaupay and Veltman were denied by a Norwich rearguard marshalled superbly by Grant Hanley, in the face of relentless second-half pressure from the hosts.\nIn the end, the Seagulls could find no way through, and remain goalless at home since mid-January. Indeed, Norwich almost stole victory when Milot Rashica blazed Teemu Pukki's cross over the bar inside the area.\nGoal-shy Brighton left to rue Maupay miss\nBrighton had 29 shots and more than 60% possession but crucially only hit the target four times. That has been a long-running issue for Potter's side, who again showcased their quality in the build-up, but were let down in front of goal.\nIt simply wasn't Maupay's day, from the moment he miscued his effort with the goal gaping in the first half. Goalkeeper Krul's mind-games before his spot-kick clearly paid off before it sailed over the bar.\nThere were bright moments from Trossard and Mac Allister, while Tariq Lamptey clearly thrives in a more advanced role on the right, but this was not the way Brighton will have wanted to end their losing run.\nNorwich work hard but look toothless up front\nThere was plenty of commitment on show from Norwich; they battled well and remained strong in defence.\nKrul and Hanley in particular were superb in keeping Brighton at bay, as the Canaries ended their own run of six successive league defeats.\nBut they remain far from safety and although there were a couple of chances to win it, they couldn't sustain an attacking threat as Brighton put them under intense pressure.\nWhile they will take a point, their long-term prospects look ominous - and it increasingly looks as if they will see a third successive Premier League stint ended after just one season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It was made worse when defender Godfrey also sliced a clearance from Matej Vydra's cross, allowing Cornet to finish.\nEverton now face a daunting task to stay in the league - and relegation would cause huge problems for a team that has registered heavy losses over the past three years.\nCornet hands Clarets a lifeline\nBurnley's stay in the Premier League has been less established than their opponents, but they showed the grit and determination needed to stay up.\nIn both halves they started well and caused all sorts of problems from set-pieces, scoring for the first time in five games through Collins' early goal.\nThey might have had cause to complain about both penalties, which the home fans certainly felt were soft. The second, via VAR, saw them vent their frustrations at referee Dean.\nBut Rodriguez's goal was crucial in re-affirming their status in the game, and they defended well to deny Everton another.\nThe fact they were gifted the winner will matter little to Dyche or Burnley's support, with fireworks being let off outside the stadium in celebration at the end.\nThey also know they have a run-in which appears more favourable than that faced by Everton.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

This win, though, saw them take their opportunities and Potter later praised the way they were able to \"hang on and suffer\".\nArsenal were simply lacklustre and showed little in the way of a response to what Arteta described as an \"unacceptable\" display in Monday's 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace.\nIt took 25 minutes for an attempt of note when Gabriel headed wide and, other than Martinelli's ruled-out finish from a yard out, they were largely limited to minor glimpses of goal until the closing stages.\nLewis Dunk blocked brilliantly to deny Emile Smith Rowe at 1-0 and substitute Nicolas Pepe at 2-0, Yves Bissouma diligently broke up attacks and Marc Cucurella mixed his role in a back three with well-timed forays forward.\nMwepu - who only returned from three months out with injury last week - showed exactly what Brighton have been missing. He produced an assist and a goal, won nine duels - a game high - and intercepted the ball more than anyone on the pitch.\nPotter called on Mwepu and Bissouma to drop into his defensive line for parts of the second half in a fluid tactical display and they shouldered the responsibility admirably.\nThe game saw seven bookings - as many as there were shots on target - and Arteta may point to a stop-start match as a reason for his side's struggle to find momentum.\nWhen they did in the closing 10 minutes, Albert Sambi Lokonga whistled a shot wide, Odegaard and substitute Eddie Nketiah both hit the bar during the same attack and seconds later the deficit was halved.\nOdegaard's long-range effort deflected beyond the diving Sanchez, prompting a final few minutes in which Arsenal pressed keenly for a point they did not deserve.\nThey saw 65% of the ball and had 20 shots - 16 off target - but Brighton's poise for long spells merited this win.\nArsenal will need to put two abject displays behind them quickly if they are to claim that crucial fourth-place at the end of their eight-game run-in.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The supporters warm to him because of his attitude and his deflected strike was a fitting reward.\nRicharlison is another who has been exempt from criticism, apart from the fact he might have scored more goals. The Brazil striker's work-rate is exceptional, chasing down every lost cause and he brought Goodison Park to its feet in the second half when he juggled the ball on his head by the touchline before winning a corner. He reacted by pumping his fists at the Gwladys Street End to raise the temperature inside an already frantic stadium.\nAnd, once more, goalkeeper Pickford made a vital contribution, denying Rashford twice early on as well as Paul Pogba and Ronaldo after the break.\nThe deafening noise at the final whistle told the story, as Lampard joined in celebrations with the fans at the conclusion of a win that cannot be over-valued.\nEmbarrassing display by Red Devils\nManchester United were still chasing a place in the top four and a slot in next season's Champions League at kick-off. They played as if no-one had told them.\nUnited's display was embarrassingly mediocre, a gift for an Everton side looking anywhere for assistance to ease their own troubles.\nIt seems certain Ajax coach Erik ten Hag will be United's next manager, and if he was watching this he will have a notebook full of uncomplimentary references and names crossed out of his plans.\nEverton were nervous and tense but were ultimately placed under no serious pressure by a United side strolling around without the slightest sense of urgency, without any sense they still had something to fight for this season.\nThe passing was sloppy, so many physical challenges were lost. It was a flat performance that suggests these players have given up on getting any inspiration from interim manager Ralf Rangnick - and he could be forgiven for giving up on them, so abject was this performance.\nIt was only in the final minutes that Everton showed any serious signs of panic in defence, and the biggest condemnation of United is that Lampard's struggling side were themselves average but still deserved the win because they were prepared to fight to earn it.\nRonaldo's late yellow card for kicking the ball away could also be marked down as a rare act of aggression rather than the petulance it was, such was the timid, desperate nature of their performance.\nIf, as is expected, Ten Hag is the next United manager, what a task he is taking on.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Three of their final seven matches include teams challenging for Europe - West Ham (home), Tottenham (home) and Manchester United (away).\n\"We want to take it to the last game, but we know how hard it could be,\" added Smith. \"Hopefully we can find that resilience in the results.\"\nEven before Lees-Melou's goal, Milot Rashica forced Nick Pope into a diving save, while the Burnley keeper denied Pukki with his legs.\nJust as impressive for Smith was his side's performance at the back.\nNorwich made several vital blocks to frustrate Burnley, including one by former Clarets defender Ben Gibson to keep out Ashley Westwood's volley.\nIn the closing stages, Norwich's Grant Hanley headed against the bar while Pope denied Rashica before Pukki had home fans celebrating a rare win.\nBurnley's survival hopes suffer major setback\nCornet will have nightmares about his 65th-minute miss, just days after he left the pitch at Turf Moor with fans singing his name following his late winner against Everton.\nHe looked certain to equalise as he slid to meet Dwight McNeil's lovely pass, but somehow put it wide as Burnley failed to score for the 15th time in the league this season.\n\"We can't miss chances like that,\" Dyche said. \"He's done well for us this season. But we have to take the game on and be better than that in the front third.\"\nEarlier, Cornet was denied by Tim Krul, but the Norwich keeper was not tested nearly enough in what was a high-stakes game.\nDyche will still believe his side can climb out of trouble in the closing weeks, and they still have to meet fellow strugglers Watford on 30 April. But despite beating Everton on Wednesday, Burnley's task has become more difficult after this defeat at Carrow Road.\n\"It was a huge setback after a huge step forward,\" added Dyche.\n\"It might come easier in a strange way when people write you off.

This win, though, saw them take their opportunities and Potter later praised the way they were able to \"hang on and suffer\".\nArsenal were simply lacklustre and showed little in the way of a response to what Arteta described as an \"unacceptable\" display in Monday's 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace.\nIt took 25 minutes for an attempt of note when Gabriel headed wide and, other than Martinelli's ruled-out finish from a yard out, they were largely limited to minor glimpses of goal until the closing stages.\nLewis Dunk blocked brilliantly to deny Emile Smith Rowe at 1-0 and substitute Nicolas Pepe at 2-0, Yves Bissouma diligently broke up attacks and Marc Cucurella mixed his role in a back three with well-timed forays forward.\nMwepu - who only returned from three months out with injury last week - showed exactly what Brighton have been missing. He produced an assist and a goal, won nine duels - a game high - and intercepted the ball more than anyone on the pitch.\nPotter called on Mwepu and Bissouma to drop into his defensive line for parts of the second half in a fluid tactical display and they shouldered the responsibility admirably.\nThe game saw seven bookings - as many as there were shots on target - and Arteta may point to a stop-start match as a reason for his side's struggle to find momentum.\nWhen they did in the closing 10 minutes, Albert Sambi Lokonga whistled a shot wide, Odegaard and substitute Eddie Nketiah both hit the bar during the same attack and seconds later the deficit was halved.\nOdegaard's long-range effort deflected beyond the diving Sanchez, prompting a final few minutes in which Arsenal pressed keenly for a point they did not deserve.\nThey saw 65% of the ball and had 20 shots - 16 off target - but Brighton's poise for long spells merited this win.\nArsenal will need to put two abject displays behind them quickly if they are to claim that crucial fourth-place at the end of their eight-game run-in.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We are well aware we need to continue to get points. I think it's results over performances at the moment. There will be a time when we can evolve.\"\nSloppy Wolves let Newcastle profit\nHowe had reason to be ecstatic, having taken over a side who were 19th in the table and five points from safety in November.\nThe Newcastle boss has a quote which reads \"make each day your masterpiece\" on a wall in his office. This display was by no means joyful or pretty in its crafting, but it was one where Newcastle were always the likelier winners thanks to their consistent effort and sporadic quality across the 90 minutes.\nWolves were fortunate when VAR chalked off Wood's close-range finish in the first half. Guimaraes raced on to a superb flick by substitute Miguel Almiron - on for the injured Ryan Fraser - and was fractionally offside.\nIn the aftermath, Wolves captain Conor Coady could be seen screaming at team-mates in a bid to rise some kind of energy and application.\nIt never really arrived and, gradually, the home side started to create half-chances after the break until Saint-Maximin and Joelinton combined to send Wood clear in the game's key moment.\nWood's finish ensured Newcastle beat a side in the top half of the table for the first time this season and also carried them to a fourth successive home win - their best run since March 2019.\nLage was left wondering how his side - with eight away wins to their name this season - could be so poor, particularly in the first half.\n\"In the second half we had clearer ideas,\" said Lage. \"The first five minutes of the second half, we were more aggressive in the final third than in the first 45 minutes. I think we missed a big opportunity.\"\nWolves are one win away from equalling their record mark of 16 victories in a Premier League-era top-flight season - set in 2018-19 - but their first-half display here set the tone for a night of despair.\nThey delivered one cross in the first 45 minutes, compared with 14 after the break. In the opening half they completed 31% of their passes in the final third compared to 74% in the second period.\nIt was a bemusing showing. A Europa League campaign is still well within reach but Wolves will need to find much more than they did here on a night where Newcastle took advantage to earn a key win in their bid for survival.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I have dreamt it since I was a little boy. I have come close but I am so happy today.\"\nThe 23-year-old's moments of quality proved telling in a fixture both sides could have been forgiven for looking past given their mid-table status and with key cup fixtures in the coming week.\nPalace - who missed early chances through Wilfried Zaha, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Joachim Andersen - refused to give in after the break and Youri Tielemans' foul on Jordan Ayew in the penalty area offered them a route back into the match.\nZaha saw his penalty saved and when VAR pointed to encroachment in the area by home defender Caglar Soyuncu, his retaken penalty was also palmed away by Kasper Schmeichel, only for the Ivory Coast international to head in the rebound.\nIt prompted a spirited 10 minutes from Palace - who went close through a Jeffrey Schlupp flick - but their seven-game unbeaten run ends. Leicester now have four wins and a draw from their past six league games - form that lifts them to ninth in the table, one place above the beaten visitors.\nVisit our Leicester City page\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\n'He typifies everything we want to be'\nA closely matched game - possession was 50-50, while Leicester managed just one more shot than their visitors - was arguably to be expected given two sides enjoying very similar fortunes.\nLeicester did not pick up a league win for all of January and February but have found late-season form. Palace won just once over the same period and have themselves found momentum deep in the campaign.\nThrow in the fact that Leicester face a key Europa Conference League second leg against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday while Palace have one eye on next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea and it would be easy to see why either side might have opted to preserve energy.\nAnd Leicester's seven changes from their 0-0 first-leg draw with PSV appeared to cause a lack of cohesion that Palace might have exploited.\nBut the visitors were unable to take half-chances and Dewsbury-Hall made them pay by reversing a defence-splitting pass into Lookman's path for the opener before patiently creating shooting space of his own for a rifled second.\nThe 23-year-old was certainly not coasting. He ran further than anyone else on the pitch - clocking 11.3km - and hit a higher top speed than anyone in his sprints.\n\"Since he's broken into the team I felt throughout the season it was what we were missing,\" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said of Dewsbury-Hall.\n\"The team was missing intensity and pressure and he has brought that. He typifies everything we want to be. He has good industry, a cultured left foot and he's very honest.\"\nPalace, who have not ended a top-flight campaign higher than 10th since finishing third 1990-91, will rue a period late in the first half when they slackened off and let the Foxes in.\nDewsbury-Hall's assist saw them opened too easily, while his goal owed much to a missed clearance by Marc Guehi in the build-up.\nWhen they did rally, Zaha was integral to the improvement and his form will offer confidence for next week's semi-final.\nAfter scoring, he fought admirably to conjure an equaliser, notably when teeing up Schlupp who saw his flick blocked by a sea of Leicester bodies.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Three of their final seven matches include teams challenging for Europe - West Ham (home), Tottenham (home) and Manchester United (away).\n\"We want to take it to the last game, but we know how hard it could be,\" added Smith. \"Hopefully we can find that resilience in the results.\"\nEven before Lees-Melou's goal, Milot Rashica forced Nick Pope into a diving save, while the Burnley keeper denied Pukki with his legs.\nJust as impressive for Smith was his side's performance at the back.\nNorwich made several vital blocks to frustrate Burnley, including one by former Clarets defender Ben Gibson to keep out Ashley Westwood's volley.\nIn the closing stages, Norwich's Grant Hanley headed against the bar while Pope denied Rashica before Pukki had home fans celebrating a rare win.\nBurnley's survival hopes suffer major setback\nCornet will have nightmares about his 65th-minute miss, just days after he left the pitch at Turf Moor with fans singing his name following his late winner against Everton.\nHe looked certain to equalise as he slid to meet Dwight McNeil's lovely pass, but somehow put it wide as Burnley failed to score for the 15th time in the league this season.\n\"We can't miss chances like that,\" Dyche said. \"He's done well for us this season. But we have to take the game on and be better than that in the front third.\"\nEarlier, Cornet was denied by Tim Krul, but the Norwich keeper was not tested nearly enough in what was a high-stakes game.\nDyche will still believe his side can climb out of trouble in the closing weeks, and they still have to meet fellow strugglers Watford on 30 April. But despite beating Everton on Wednesday, Burnley's task has become more difficult after this defeat at Carrow Road.\n\"It was a huge setback after a huge step forward,\" added Dyche.\n\"It might come easier in a strange way when people write you off. Virtually everyone will think we're done, but we don't think that.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

There is still the capacity for too many potential twists and turns to call it so soon.\nLiverpool came into the game in outstanding form, on the back of 10 straight league wins and a club record eight successive away wins in all competitions.\nAnd yet, they started with uncharacteristic unease and hesitancy, especially at the back where there were several nervous moments.\nEven when they are off their best, Liverpool still possess ever-present menace and the poacher supreme Jota settled Jurgen Klopp's side with a trademark finish for his 15th Premier League goal of the season.\nLiverpool were fortunate to be only 2-1 down at half-time, although City keeper Ederson sent palpitations around Etihad Stadium when he lost control of the ball on his goal-line with Jota in close attendance, recovering to show nerves of steel and regain his poise.\nKlopp clearly delivered some stern messages to his players at the break and Liverpool were much more themselves in the second half, Mane striking almost immediately and their pressing game finally rushing City into mistakes.\nLiverpool may still be in second place but they are right in this title hunt. Like Guardiola, Klopp would have preferred all three points but he will not be unhappy with one from this wonderful Premier League spectacle.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He has also moved on to 99 career Premier League goals.\nUnited can move level on points with fourth-placed Spurs if they win at Liverpool on Tuesday.\nFor Norwich the outcome was a major blow to their faint hopes of avoiding the drop. The Canaries are now seven points behind fourth-bottom Everton, having played two games more and with only six matches to do something about it.\n'Fans shouldn't target individuals' - Rangnick criticises Pogba boos\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRonaldo the hero again\nIt is a question without an answer, but it keeps being posed nevertheless: is Ronaldo the cause of United's problems or the solution?\nOn this occasion, he was certainly the latter.\nNot that he had to do much for his first goal. Ben Gibson was dispossessed in his own penalty area as Norwich tried to move the ball forward from a goal-kick, allowing Anthony Elanga to find Ronaldo who applied the first-time finish.\nRonaldo's second was one of the towering headers he has produced so often down the years, climbing highest to reach Alex Telles' corner and power past Tim Krul.\nThe winner was typical of the man. With the pressure on and all eyes trained on him, Ronaldo puffed his chest out after Elanga had been fouled on the edge of the area, ran up and belted his shot into the net off the inside of a post.\nIt was a quite sensational effort and brought a crowd simmering with discontent to their feet.\nNorwich expose poor defending\nThe celebrations at the final whistle must have felt like a dagger to the heart for Norwich boss Smith.\nThey also masked some pretty shocking defending from the hosts, the type of stuff seen all too often down the years and which has left many of the club's fans in such a state of fury - some even missed the start of the game as part of a pre-match protest.\nMan Utd fans protest against Glazer Family ownership before Norwich match\nNorwich's opener was a case in point.\nPukki was on his own when he took possession on the right-hand side of the area, then picked out Dowell, who was also totally unmarked as he put the ball past David de Gea from six yards.\nPukki was then similarly alone seven minutes after the re-start as he pulled the visitors level.\nMilton Rashica had a shot turned round the post at full stretch by De Gea and Sam Byram headed over at the far post. At that point, Smith must have thought a famous win was on the cards.\nRonaldo had other ideas. Norwich's fight for survival continues. But the odds against them being successful are growing.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

I want to be a legend here.\"\nGuimaraes was Newcastle's first big signing under their new owners, joining from Lyon in the January transfer window for an initial \u00a335m.\nHe has helped provide the impetus to push the Magpies towards safety and despite arriving as a defensive midfielder, the 24-year-old now has three goals from five Premier League starts.\n\"Goals weren't necessarily one of the areas where we felt he would enhance us as a team, but he's scored some key goals for us,\" said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe.\n\"I'm really pleased with him today.

Manager Brendan Rodgers, though, made eight changes to freshen the team up.\nThe Foxes have struggled to defend set-pieces this season yet they opened the scoring with a training-ground routine of their own, Lookman's eighth goal in all competitions this season capping a bright start.\nAyoze Perez superbly laid on James Maddison's equaliser in Eindhoven and the Spaniard repeated the trick against his former club.\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall drilled a corner low towards the near post, where Perez's run put him in front of his marker and his deft flick with the outside of his right foot ran straight into the path of an unmarked Lookman. The forward's low strike was too powerful for Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka to keep out.\nBut the visitors' Achilles heel was exposed again just 11 minutes later, from the very first corner they conceded.\nNewcastle centre-half Dan Burn leaned his 6ft 7in frame over Daniel Amartey to head down Jonjo Shelvey's inswinging delivery, before Guimaraes poked the ball goalwards from right in front of Schmeichel and then bundled in while both players were on the turf.\nAt first glance it looked as though Guimaraes had knocked the ball from the Denmark keeper's grasp. However, the video assistant referee, Lee Mason, recommended referee Jarred Gillett looked at his pitchside monitor and replays showed the ball had been stuck between Schmeichel's legs, rather than his hands.\nLeicester have now conceded 17 goals from set-pieces in the Premier League this season - more than any other team.\nThat leveller lifted the hosts and they finished the first half on top, before Leicester dominated possession after the break with Newcastle still the more threatening.\nBut they failed to create any clear-cut chances until Burn sent a free header wide from a late corner, while Leicester substitute Kelechi Iheanacho went close at the other end.\nWillock then burst down the left wing and into the Leicester box, where Guimaraes was rewarded for his supporting run by sending the home crowd at St James' Park into raptures.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I have dreamt it since I was a little boy. I have come close but I am so happy today.\"\nThe 23-year-old's moments of quality proved telling in a fixture both sides could have been forgiven for looking past given their mid-table status and with key cup fixtures in the coming week.\nPalace - who missed early chances through Wilfried Zaha, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Joachim Andersen - refused to give in after the break and Youri Tielemans' foul on Jordan Ayew in the penalty area offered them a route back into the match.\nZaha saw his penalty saved and when VAR pointed to encroachment in the area by home defender Caglar Soyuncu, his retaken penalty was also palmed away by Kasper Schmeichel, only for the Ivory Coast international to head in the rebound.\nIt prompted a spirited 10 minutes from Palace - who went close through a Jeffrey Schlupp flick - but their seven-game unbeaten run ends. Leicester now have four wins and a draw from their past six league games - form that lifts them to ninth in the table, one place above the beaten visitors.\nVisit our Leicester City page\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\n'He typifies everything we want to be'\nA closely matched game - possession was 50-50, while Leicester managed just one more shot than their visitors - was arguably to be expected given two sides enjoying very similar fortunes.\nLeicester did not pick up a league win for all of January and February but have found late-season form. Palace won just once over the same period and have themselves found momentum deep in the campaign.\nThrow in the fact that Leicester face a key Europa Conference League second leg against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday while Palace have one eye on next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea and it would be easy to see why either side might have opted to preserve energy.\nAnd Leicester's seven changes from their 0-0 first-leg draw with PSV appeared to cause a lack of cohesion that Palace might have exploited.\nBut the visitors were unable to take half-chances and Dewsbury-Hall made them pay by reversing a defence-splitting pass into Lookman's path for the opener before patiently creating shooting space of his own for a rifled second.\nThe 23-year-old was certainly not coasting. He ran further than anyone else on the pitch - clocking 11.3km - and hit a higher top speed than anyone in his sprints.\n\"Since he's broken into the team I felt throughout the season it was what we were missing,\" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said of Dewsbury-Hall.\n\"The team was missing intensity and pressure and he has brought that. He typifies everything we want to be. He has good industry, a cultured left foot and he's very honest.\"\nPalace, who have not ended a top-flight campaign higher than 10th since finishing third 1990-91, will rue a period late in the first half when they slackened off and let the Foxes in.\nDewsbury-Hall's assist saw them opened too easily, while his goal owed much to a missed clearance by Marc Guehi in the build-up.\nWhen they did rally, Zaha was integral to the improvement and his form will offer confidence for next week's semi-final.\nAfter scoring, he fought admirably to conjure an equaliser, notably when teeing up Schlupp who saw his flick blocked by a sea of Leicester bodies.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The supporters warm to him because of his attitude and his deflected strike was a fitting reward.\nRicharlison is another who has been exempt from criticism, apart from the fact he might have scored more goals. The Brazil striker's work-rate is exceptional, chasing down every lost cause and he brought Goodison Park to its feet in the second half when he juggled the ball on his head by the touchline before winning a corner. He reacted by pumping his fists at the Gwladys Street End to raise the temperature inside an already frantic stadium.\nAnd, once more, goalkeeper Pickford made a vital contribution, denying Rashford twice early on as well as Paul Pogba and Ronaldo after the break.\nThe deafening noise at the final whistle told the story, as Lampard joined in celebrations with the fans at the conclusion of a win that cannot be over-valued.\nEmbarrassing display by Red Devils\nManchester United were still chasing a place in the top four and a slot in next season's Champions League at kick-off. They played as if no-one had told them.\nUnited's display was embarrassingly mediocre, a gift for an Everton side looking anywhere for assistance to ease their own troubles.\nIt seems certain Ajax coach Erik ten Hag will be United's next manager, and if he was watching this he will have a notebook full of uncomplimentary references and names crossed out of his plans.\nEverton were nervous and tense but were ultimately placed under no serious pressure by a United side strolling around without the slightest sense of urgency, without any sense they still had something to fight for this season.\nThe passing was sloppy, so many physical challenges were lost. It was a flat performance that suggests these players have given up on getting any inspiration from interim manager Ralf Rangnick - and he could be forgiven for giving up on them, so abject was this performance.\nIt was only in the final minutes that Everton showed any serious signs of panic in defence, and the biggest condemnation of United is that Lampard's struggling side were themselves average but still deserved the win because they were prepared to fight to earn it.\nRonaldo's late yellow card for kicking the ball away could also be marked down as a rare act of aggression rather than the petulance it was, such was the timid, desperate nature of their performance.\nIf, as is expected, Ten Hag is the next United manager, what a task he is taking on.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They are 12 points clear of the relegation zone after enjoying several highs this season, including twice coming from behind to win at Tottenham and holding leaders Manchester City home and away.\nBut this was definitely a day to forget as they surrendered without a fight.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

There is still the capacity for too many potential twists and turns to call it so soon.\nLiverpool came into the game in outstanding form, on the back of 10 straight league wins and a club record eight successive away wins in all competitions.\nAnd yet, they started with uncharacteristic unease and hesitancy, especially at the back where there were several nervous moments.\nEven when they are off their best, Liverpool still possess ever-present menace and the poacher supreme Jota settled Jurgen Klopp's side with a trademark finish for his 15th Premier League goal of the season.\nLiverpool were fortunate to be only 2-1 down at half-time, although City keeper Ederson sent palpitations around Etihad Stadium when he lost control of the ball on his goal-line with Jota in close attendance, recovering to show nerves of steel and regain his poise.\nKlopp clearly delivered some stern messages to his players at the break and Liverpool were much more themselves in the second half, Mane striking almost immediately and their pressing game finally rushing City into mistakes.\nLiverpool may still be in second place but they are right in this title hunt.

We're hoping he's OK - our thoughts are with him.\n\"You could see it wasn't good from the reaction of the players. He looked distraught, but fingers crossed.\n\"When you see Declan Rice come over and say it's not good, you know it's not. The lad himself put his hand up, and he doesn't usually go down.\n\"It could be the end of his season, but there is a squad here ready to play. Josh Brownhill came in and has done really well.\"\nNo-one was more visibly upset than Vlasic, who dropped to his knees with concern, but the incident appeared to galvanise the lowly visitors. Three minutes after Westwood's departure, Burnley scored the opener.\nMaxwel Cornet's corner was met by Jay Rodriguez, who could only divert the ball against the crossbar, before Weghorst rose highest to head in the rebound.\nCornet had the chance to double the visitors' lead after being brought down inside the area by Lukasz Fabianksi, but his poorly hit penalty went wide.\nThe Clarets sacked boss Sean Dyche on Friday but remained resolute under the interim guidance of Under-23s coach Jackson and injured club captain Ben Mee until Soucek salvaged a draw for the hosts.\nThe result means Burnley move to within three points of safety, although they have played a game more than 17th-placed Everton, while West Ham remain seventh, five points outside the Champions League places.\nRelive Sunday's Premier League action as it happened\nDefiant Burnley running out of time\nBurnley made headlines on Friday after they dismissed Dyche, who was the Premier League's longest-serving current manager, having taken over at Turf Moor in October 2012.\nTwo days later, the Clarets headed to an in-form West Ham side who had just booked their place in the Europa League semi-final.\nThe Hammers started brightly and Jarrod Bowen's whipped effort was well kept out by an acrobatic save from the influential Pope.\nThe seriousness of Westwood's injury was noted almost instantly as the midfielder, who fell to the ground after a fair coming together for possession, waved on the medical staff frantically.\nIt seemed to hand Burnley the impetus, as they went down the other end and opened the scoring, while Weghorst's celebrations were muted in testament to his team-mate's misfortune.\nWhen Cornet was released from inside his own half before running clear and rounding Fabianski, they had the chance to double their lead with their first penalty of the season, but it was missed.\nThose are the chances that will need to be converted if Burnley are to achieve the unlikely and retain the top-flight status.\nIn the end, the Clarets were punished, courtesy of Soucek's shoulder as he connected with Manuel Lanzini's free-kick.\nAs the Hammers pushed on for the winner, Pope stood firm and showed the form that resulted in an England call-up last month. Two excellent saves to deny Michail Antonio came either side of a Gordon Banks-esque dive to keep out Issa Diop's header.\nShould Burnley fail to survive, they will have a battle on their hands to retain Pope's services.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

What an occasion that promises to be.\nArteta's decision to show Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang the door by giving him away to Barcelona in January was coming under understandable scrutiny with Alexandre Lacazette misfiring and no replacement brought in.\nHe needed to pull something out of the bag and his answer was to relegate the struggling Lacazette to the bench and go with 22-year-old Eddie Nketiah.\nArteta says he has not been fair on Nketiah\nNketiah double earns win for Arsenal at Chelsea\nReaction to Chelsea v Arsenal and Wednesday's other Premier League games\nArteta was richly rewarded as Nketiah was in predatory mood, scoring twice, both times taking advantage of horrendous Chelsea defending and fully meriting a standing ovation from Arsenal's fans when he was substituted.\nArsenal now have it in their hands to make the top four but can they gather the belief to make it?\nThat depends on which Arsenal turns up. If it is the team who shrank in recent games then it is likely they will fall short. If they play like they did here then they will have a great chance.\nAnd in the wider context, Arsenal demonstrated once again that there is the foundation of a very good side here if they can recruit smartly in the summer - with getting the right replacement for Aubameyang key.\nAaron Ramsdale is a developing goalkeeper, Ben White and Gabriel form a good central defensive partnership and in Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe they have two Premier League gems for now and the future.\nThese are the cornerstones Arsenal should build on and the reasons why were on show here.\nSaka was simply outstanding, especially in a frantic first half when he tormented Chelsea's left flank, setting up Smith Rowe's goal, creating further openings and finally getting the goal he deserved to wrap the win up from the spot in the dying seconds after he was fouled by Cesar Azpilicueta.\nThis must be the result and performance that kick-starts Arsenal into the decisive phase of the season.\nAs for Chelsea, this was another miserable night at Stamford Bridge and another example of the defensive frailties that are creeping into their game.\nChelsea should have enough points to ensure they finish third and have the FA Cup final against Liverpool to come but flaws in defence must be a growing concern for Tuchel.\nThey have now conceded 11 goals in their last three games at Stamford Bridge, four against both Brentford and Arsenal in the league either side of losing 3-1 to Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final.\nChelsea, as they were against Brentford, struggled from the first whistle with Antonio Rudiger out injured and Thiago Silva on the bench.\nAndreas Christensen is expected to move to Barcelona in the summer and performed like his head was already in Las Ramblas in a dreadful 45 minutes, sending a terrible backpass to Nketiah for Arsenal's opener before he was mercifully removed at half-time.\nAnd then we come to Romelu Lukaku.\nLukaku's \u00a397.5m signing from Inter Milan in the summer was meant to be the final piece of Chelsea's jigsaw after the Champions League win. He increasingly looks like part of another puzzle.\nHe was laboured, lost too many physical and aerial challenges, snatching at too many chances before he was also substituted. Lukaku has to produce soon but shows no signs.\nThis was Arsenal's night, the night when belief returned, the night when at least one of the top four contenders woke up to the possibility it is all still up for grabs.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He deserves sympathy rather than criticism because this was the very definition of a hiding to nothing and it was no surprise when he was replaced at half-time.\nLiverpool were vastly superior, which can happen, but what was inexcusable was United's lack of fight, heart and even tackling as they looked a beaten team from the moment Diaz put them behind.\nThere was a very slight improvement after the break - it could not get worse - but even so this was a performance coupled with a dreadful attitude that was an embarrassment to a club of Manchester United's stature.\nAll the United reaction, in one place\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We all know the situation when it comes to how the last two or three seasons have looked and that high, high level of player that he reached for a big period of time at Tottenham.\n\"So I don't think it was a case of things being simple and sometimes you have to work and fight through things and we're in that process with him.\"\nThe draw denied Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers a first win at Goodison Park, and it wasted a good start for the visitors, who also squandered several good chances towards the end via Maddison.\nThe Foxes have already reached a Europa Conference League semi-final this season, but they now sit 11 points behind seventh-placed West Ham, who have played two more games.\nA draw that felt like a win\nEverton could not turn successive home victories into a third, but after a poor first half, this will feel as good as a win.\nWithout Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who suffered a training-ground injury that could keep him out for two weeks, their front three of Richarlison, Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon struggled to link together.\nGordon's passing and set-piece delivery was particularly woeful, but once Rondon came on to provide a focal point to the attack, and Alli offered some assistance to the impressive Alex Iwobi, the game began to take a different path.\nThe early goal and dominance by Leicester led to a subdued atmosphere in the first half where despite Richarlison's miscued shot, the home fans were not lifted off their seats until just before the break when Gray fired inches wide from a clever corner.\nLeicester had already gone close when Seamus Coleman tackled Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall before the Foxes took the lead.\nWith Rodgers making seven changes to the side that lost at Newcastle on Sunday, the visitors were able to cut through the Everton defence easily. Dewsbury-Hall and Maddison both caused problems for the Everton defence, who had Yerry Mina back for the first time since February following a hamstring injury.\nBy contrast, Fabian Delph and Allan were ponderous in midfield with only Iwobi providing the thrust that Everton and their fans craved. But that soon changed in the second half as Alli came on to replace Allan.\nUnfortunately for the hosts, Gordon's passing was still off, and Richarlison, who had scored only three goals since the turn of the year, wasted another chance after good work by Rondon and a free header from a corner.\nAs Everton pressed for an equaliser, gaps opened up for Leicester to exploit and Maddison went close three times.\nThat ultimately proved costly as Richarlison and his team's persistence earned a crucial point to keep Lampard's side on the right side of the drop zone, regardless of Thursday's results.\nFollow Everton v Leicester and the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nVisit our Everton page\nGo straight to all the best Leicester City content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The Algerian profited from a couple of fortunate deflections, first to give him the shooting opportunity before a second took it past Robert Sanchez.\nThis was the Algerian's 250th Premier League appearance and he helped boss Guardiola to his 250th win as City's boss - achieved 52 games quicker than any other manager in English top-flight history.\nAfter Foden doubled the hosts' lead, De Bruyne was the key man again as Bernardo added a third, deftly flicking on Oleksandr Zinchenko's pass after the Ukrainian - earlier given a warm reception on only his second home appearance since the Russian invasion of his homeland - had taken advantage of Brighton hesitancy inside their own half.\nAfter his injury scare during the Champions League quarter-final second leg with Atletico Madrid, Guardiola will want to keep De Bruyne as safe as possible for the remainder of the campaign.\nThe same, presumably, is also true of central defender Ruben Dias, who was introduced at half-time after a seven-week absence with a hamstring injury and seemed to shrug off fears from the bench he had suffered a recurrence.\nDogged Brighton's plan finally undone\nBrighton's awful record against City, eight defeats out of nine Premier League meetings and no away wins in their entire history, offered hardly any cause for optimism.\nHowever, buoyed by fabulous recent wins against Tottenham and Arsenal, Potter showed what a side could do with a gameplan that players willingly adhere to.\nA three-man defence which Lewis Dunk led with his customary authority, was bolstered by a further three in front of them, with limited space in between for City's talented playmakers to exhibit their skills.\nTrue, visiting attacking opportunities were rare - the nearest they came in the first half was down to pressure exerted by a Pascal Gross corner that dropped into a dangerous position inside the six-yard box where it was booted clear by Aymeric Laporte.\nBut their efforts were another notable achievement by Potter, who has guided Brighton so close to their highest ever finish.\nSadly for the visitors, they were only able to repel City for eight minutes of the second period and after that, it was a familiar story.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Ismaila Sarr and Dennis were trying to combine and restore parity for Watford, but they struggled to impose themselves.\nBut the tide turned in the first 10 minutes of the second half. At one end, Ivan Toney squandered a chance to double Brentford's lead, before Dennis fired home from a tight angle to make it 1-1.\nInitially disallowed for offside after Sarr's flick on from Moussa Sissoko's cross, VAR intervened and the goal counted to give Vicarage Road an entirely new impetus.\nThe home side pushed for a crucial winner, and after hitting the bar with a free-kick through Dennis, Louza somehow failed to score from an open goal before Jansson provided the Bees' sting in the tail.\nWatford pay the price for poor first half\nThere was enough character and energy in the Watford second half performance to take something from the game, and they will rue Louza's chance for a long time, but in truth, their first-half display summed up their issues.\nBoss Roy Hodgson looked dismayed on the touchline as his side failed to show the sort of desire and purpose required in their position.\nIn Sarr and Dennis, the Hornets have two potent attacking players, but once again, they showed their soft underbelly, particularly with the goal they conceded.\nThey hit the bar and the post, so there was bad luck - but evidence of why they are struggling was there once again.\nHodgson bemoaned his side's luck in front of goal but admitted time is running out for his side.\n\"Someone up there doesn't like us,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Our first-half performance was nowhere near good enough, we conceded a very poor goal so that was very disappointing considering how much we built the game up with the players during the week. They recognised the game needed to be built up because it was one of the last-chance games we'd have.\n\"We haven't been lucky, but that doesn't alter the fact we haven't been good enough either. Today we should have been congratulating ourselves, if that is the right word, on a 1-1 draw.

That doesn't say much.\"\nBees can prepare for another top-flight campaign\nRelegation looked a real possibility for Brentford some weeks ago, and it wasn't really an issue coming into this game, but now they really can look forward to another season.\nChristian Eriksen has made the difference since his arrival, and he again showed why he was such a key player, even if his impact waned as the game progressed.\nThomas Frank praised his side's character after they secured three points in the latter stages once again.\n\"[It was a] crazy, crazy finish,\" he said. \"The third time we've won in the last minute; that is a credit to the boys and their character. Through the game, we gave very little away. First half, we were slightly better; second half, Watford were better than us, no doubt. Then you think, 'okay, take a point. If you can't win, don't lose'.\n\"I am very pleased with [Christian] Norgaard; he is a key player but adding goals is fantastic.

He has also moved on to 99 career Premier League goals.\nUnited can move level on points with fourth-placed Spurs if they win at Liverpool on Tuesday.\nFor Norwich the outcome was a major blow to their faint hopes of avoiding the drop. The Canaries are now seven points behind fourth-bottom Everton, having played two games more and with only six matches to do something about it.\n'Fans shouldn't target individuals' - Rangnick criticises Pogba boos\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRonaldo the hero again\nIt is a question without an answer, but it keeps being posed nevertheless: is Ronaldo the cause of United's problems or the solution?\nOn this occasion, he was certainly the latter.\nNot that he had to do much for his first goal. Ben Gibson was dispossessed in his own penalty area as Norwich tried to move the ball forward from a goal-kick, allowing Anthony Elanga to find Ronaldo who applied the first-time finish.\nRonaldo's second was one of the towering headers he has produced so often down the years, climbing highest to reach Alex Telles' corner and power past Tim Krul.\nThe winner was typical of the man. With the pressure on and all eyes trained on him, Ronaldo puffed his chest out after Elanga had been fouled on the edge of the area, ran up and belted his shot into the net off the inside of a post.\nIt was a quite sensational effort and brought a crowd simmering with discontent to their feet.\nNorwich expose poor defending\nThe celebrations at the final whistle must have felt like a dagger to the heart for Norwich boss Smith.\nThey also masked some pretty shocking defending from the hosts, the type of stuff seen all too often down the years and which has left many of the club's fans in such a state of fury - some even missed the start of the game as part of a pre-match protest.\nMan Utd fans protest against Glazer Family ownership before Norwich match\nNorwich's opener was a case in point.\nPukki was on his own when he took possession on the right-hand side of the area, then picked out Dowell, who was also totally unmarked as he put the ball past David de Gea from six yards.\nPukki was then similarly alone seven minutes after the re-start as he pulled the visitors level.\nMilton Rashica had a shot turned round the post at full stretch by De Gea and Sam Byram headed over at the far post. At that point, Smith must have thought a famous win was on the cards.\nRonaldo had other ideas. Norwich's fight for survival continues. But the odds against them being successful are growing.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Only Norwich (10) and Watford (nine) have drawn blanks in more away fixtures in the competition this term.\nVieira, whose side were beaten by Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday, cut a frustrated figure at full-time, but his opposite number Howe could not hide his delight after guiding the Magpies to their ninth win in 13 league games.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We are well aware we need to continue to get points. I think it's results over performances at the moment. There will be a time when we can evolve.\"\nSloppy Wolves let Newcastle profit\nHowe had reason to be ecstatic, having taken over a side who were 19th in the table and five points from safety in November.\nThe Newcastle boss has a quote which reads \"make each day your masterpiece\" on a wall in his office. This display was by no means joyful or pretty in its crafting, but it was one where Newcastle were always the likelier winners thanks to their consistent effort and sporadic quality across the 90 minutes.\nWolves were fortunate when VAR chalked off Wood's close-range finish in the first half. Guimaraes raced on to a superb flick by substitute Miguel Almiron - on for the injured Ryan Fraser - and was fractionally offside.\nIn the aftermath, Wolves captain Conor Coady could be seen screaming at team-mates in a bid to rise some kind of energy and application.\nIt never really arrived and, gradually, the home side started to create half-chances after the break until Saint-Maximin and Joelinton combined to send Wood clear in the game's key moment.\nWood's finish ensured Newcastle beat a side in the top half of the table for the first time this season and also carried them to a fourth successive home win - their best run since March 2019.\nLage was left wondering how his side - with eight away wins to their name this season - could be so poor, particularly in the first half.\n\"In the second half we had clearer ideas,\" said Lage. \"The first five minutes of the second half, we were more aggressive in the final third than in the first 45 minutes. I think we missed a big opportunity.\"\nWolves are one win away from equalling their record mark of 16 victories in a Premier League-era top-flight season - set in 2018-19 - but their first-half display here set the tone for a night of despair.\nThey delivered one cross in the first 45 minutes, compared with 14 after the break. In the opening half they completed 31% of their passes in the final third compared to 74% in the second period.\nIt was a bemusing showing. A Europa League campaign is still well within reach but Wolves will need to find much more than they did here on a night where Newcastle took advantage to earn a key win in their bid for survival.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Chelsea 2-4 Arsenal: Mikel Arteta vindicated as Eddie Nketiah inspires stunning Gunners win\nThe battle for a place in the Premier League's top four and a spot in next season's Champions League was starting to resemble a race to the bottom as Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United all stumbled in pursuit of the prize.\nIt was there waiting for someone to grab the initiative and Arsenal made a decisive move with an outstanding 4-2 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\nThe Gunners were in prime position in fourth place with games in hand weeks ago only to fall into a spell of three defeats away to Crystal Palace, at home to Brighton then at Southampton on Saturday.\nArsenal's old failings - a lack of battling quality, a tendency to choke when the pressure is on - were all revisited in the build-up to this visit to Chelsea, where they started as underdogs with the pressure building.\nOne win, however significant, does not answer all the questions but this was a night when Arsenal showed they do have hope for development under manager Mikel Arteta - but they must show they can do this again if they are to achieve their goals.\nHow they needed this and how delighted they will be at the way in which they cashed in on the gifts Chelsea's defence handed them.\nArsenal are still in fifth but they are now only behind Spurs on goal difference with a north London derby to come at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 12 May. What an occasion that promises to be.\nArteta's decision to show Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang the door by giving him away to Barcelona in January was coming under understandable scrutiny with Alexandre Lacazette misfiring and no replacement brought in.\nHe needed to pull something out of the bag and his answer was to relegate the struggling Lacazette to the bench and go with 22-year-old Eddie Nketiah.\nArteta says he has not been fair on Nketiah\nNketiah double earns win for Arsenal at Chelsea\nReaction to Chelsea v Arsenal and Wednesday's other Premier League games\nArteta was richly rewarded as Nketiah was in predatory mood, scoring twice, both times taking advantage of horrendous Chelsea defending and fully meriting a standing ovation from Arsenal's fans when he was substituted.\nArsenal now have it in their hands to make the top four but can they gather the belief to make it?\nThat depends on which Arsenal turns up. If it is the team who shrank in recent games then it is likely they will fall short. If they play like they did here then they will have a great chance.\nAnd in the wider context, Arsenal demonstrated once again that there is the foundation of a very good side here if they can recruit smartly in the summer - with getting the right replacement for Aubameyang key.\nAaron Ramsdale is a developing goalkeeper, Ben White and Gabriel form a good central defensive partnership and in Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe they have two Premier League gems for now and the future.\nThese are the cornerstones Arsenal should build on and the reasons why were on show here.\nSaka was simply outstanding, especially in a frantic first half when he tormented Chelsea's left flank, setting up Smith Rowe's goal, creating further openings and finally getting the goal he deserved to wrap the win up from the spot in the dying seconds after he was fouled by Cesar Azpilicueta.\nThis must be the result and performance that kick-starts Arsenal into the decisive phase of the season.\nAs for Chelsea, this was another miserable night at Stamford Bridge and another example of the defensive frailties that are creeping into their game.\nChelsea should have enough points to ensure they finish third and have the FA Cup final against Liverpool to come but flaws in defence must be a growing concern for Tuchel.\nThey have now conceded 11 goals in their last three games at Stamford Bridge, four against both Brentford and Arsenal in the league either side of losing 3-1 to Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final.\nChelsea, as they were against Brentford, struggled from the first whistle with Antonio Rudiger out injured and Thiago Silva on the bench.\nAndreas Christensen is expected to move to Barcelona in the summer and performed like his head was already in Las Ramblas in a dreadful 45 minutes, sending a terrible backpass to Nketiah for Arsenal's opener before he was mercifully removed at half-time.\nAnd then we come to Romelu Lukaku.\nLukaku's \u00a397.5m signing from Inter Milan in the summer was meant to be the final piece of Chelsea's jigsaw after the Champions League win. He increasingly looks like part of another puzzle.\nHe was laboured, lost too many physical and aerial challenges, snatching at too many chances before he was also substituted. Lukaku has to produce soon but shows no signs.\nThis was Arsenal's night, the night when belief returned, the night when at least one of the top four contenders woke up to the possibility it is all still up for grabs.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We're hoping he's OK - our thoughts are with him.\n\"You could see it wasn't good from the reaction of the players. He looked distraught, but fingers crossed.\n\"When you see Declan Rice come over and say it's not good, you know it's not. The lad himself put his hand up, and he doesn't usually go down.\n\"It could be the end of his season, but there is a squad here ready to play. Josh Brownhill came in and has done really well.\"\nNo-one was more visibly upset than Vlasic, who dropped to his knees with concern, but the incident appeared to galvanise the lowly visitors. Three minutes after Westwood's departure, Burnley scored the opener.\nMaxwel Cornet's corner was met by Jay Rodriguez, who could only divert the ball against the crossbar, before Weghorst rose highest to head in the rebound.\nCornet had the chance to double the visitors' lead after being brought down inside the area by Lukasz Fabianksi, but his poorly hit penalty went wide.\nThe Clarets sacked boss Sean Dyche on Friday but remained resolute under the interim guidance of Under-23s coach Jackson and injured club captain Ben Mee until Soucek salvaged a draw for the hosts.\nThe result means Burnley move to within three points of safety, although they have played a game more than 17th-placed Everton, while West Ham remain seventh, five points outside the Champions League places.\nRelive Sunday's Premier League action as it happened\nDefiant Burnley running out of time\nBurnley made headlines on Friday after they dismissed Dyche, who was the Premier League's longest-serving current manager, having taken over at Turf Moor in October 2012.\nTwo days later, the Clarets headed to an in-form West Ham side who had just booked their place in the Europa League semi-final.\nThe Hammers started brightly and Jarrod Bowen's whipped effort was well kept out by an acrobatic save from the influential Pope.\nThe seriousness of Westwood's injury was noted almost instantly as the midfielder, who fell to the ground after a fair coming together for possession, waved on the medical staff frantically.\nIt seemed to hand Burnley the impetus, as they went down the other end and opened the scoring, while Weghorst's celebrations were muted in testament to his team-mate's misfortune.\nWhen Cornet was released from inside his own half before running clear and rounding Fabianski, they had the chance to double their lead with their first penalty of the season, but it was missed.\nThose are the chances that will need to be converted if Burnley are to achieve the unlikely and retain the top-flight status.\nIn the end, the Clarets were punished, courtesy of Soucek's shoulder as he connected with Manuel Lanzini's free-kick.\nAs the Hammers pushed on for the winner, Pope stood firm and showed the form that resulted in an England call-up last month. Two excellent saves to deny Michail Antonio came either side of a Gordon Banks-esque dive to keep out Issa Diop's header.\nShould Burnley fail to survive, they will have a battle on their hands to retain Pope's services.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The Algerian profited from a couple of fortunate deflections, first to give him the shooting opportunity before a second took it past Robert Sanchez.\nThis was the Algerian's 250th Premier League appearance and he helped boss Guardiola to his 250th win as City's boss - achieved 52 games quicker than any other manager in English top-flight history.\nAfter Foden doubled the hosts' lead, De Bruyne was the key man again as Bernardo added a third, deftly flicking on Oleksandr Zinchenko's pass after the Ukrainian - earlier given a warm reception on only his second home appearance since the Russian invasion of his homeland - had taken advantage of Brighton hesitancy inside their own half.\nAfter his injury scare during the Champions League quarter-final second leg with Atletico Madrid, Guardiola will want to keep De Bruyne as safe as possible for the remainder of the campaign.\nThe same, presumably, is also true of central defender Ruben Dias, who was introduced at half-time after a seven-week absence with a hamstring injury and seemed to shrug off fears from the bench he had suffered a recurrence.\nDogged Brighton's plan finally undone\nBrighton's awful record against City, eight defeats out of nine Premier League meetings and no away wins in their entire history, offered hardly any cause for optimism.\nHowever, buoyed by fabulous recent wins against Tottenham and Arsenal, Potter showed what a side could do with a gameplan that players willingly adhere to.\nA three-man defence which Lewis Dunk led with his customary authority, was bolstered by a further three in front of them, with limited space in between for City's talented playmakers to exhibit their skills.\nTrue, visiting attacking opportunities were rare - the nearest they came in the first half was down to pressure exerted by a Pascal Gross corner that dropped into a dangerous position inside the six-yard box where it was booted clear by Aymeric Laporte.\nBut their efforts were another notable achievement by Potter, who has guided Brighton so close to their highest ever finish.\nSadly for the visitors, they were only able to repel City for eight minutes of the second period and after that, it was a familiar story.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It also confirmed they will play Champions League football next season.\nUnited, who could have moved level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham, remain sixth. On Saturday, the Red Devils go to fifth-placed Arsenal.\n'Good luck Erik - Man Utd have become a monstrosity'\nLiverpool loss 'humiliating' - Man Utd boss Rangnick\nFollow all the reaction to Liverpool's comfortable win against Manchester United\nLiverpool a class apart\nLiverpool are on an ominous roll and, as against Manchester City in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final, the game was effectively won by half-time following a blistering first 45 minutes.\nUnited were on the rack from the first whistle and were swept away by wave after wave of Liverpool attacks, all conducted from midfield by the master orchestrator Thiago Alcantara.\nUrged on by an exultant Kop, Liverpool simply overwhelmed United as they were quicker, slicker and simply in a different class to their fallen rivals.\nThiago's midfield masterclass earned him a standing ovation when he was replaced by Naby Keita but the performances of Diaz, Mane and Salah were of a similar standard.\nLiverpool have thrown down the gauntlet to reigning champions City before their next game and it is hard to see who will find a way to beat them in this type of form.\nThey have won the Carabao Cup, will face Chelsea in the FA Cup final, are breathing down City's neck in the league and are favourites to progress against Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final.\nAnd the way Liverpool are approaching the decisive stage of the season in such prime condition, nothing looks beyond them.\nAll the best Liverpool analysis and reaction, in one place\nUnited left humiliated by old enemy\nThere can be no consolation for United in this abject performance, apart from maybe the fact that Liverpool finished a goal short of inflicting their second 5-0 defeat of the season on the old enemy.\nIt was still Liverpool's biggest \"aggregate\" victory over two games in a league season against United, a statistic that does not exaggerate just how far they are adrift.\nMake no mistake, it could have been five and more, Liverpool going off the boil for the early part of the second half before returning to the rampant form of the first half to finish United off.\nInterim manager Ralf Rangnick has been brutal about his side's failings and they will soon be Ten Hag's problem - and this was so bad it is hard to know where to start.\nUnited were without Ronaldo and were so reduced that defender Phil Jones was drafted in for a rare start. He deserves sympathy rather than criticism because this was the very definition of a hiding to nothing and it was no surprise when he was replaced at half-time.\nLiverpool were vastly superior, which can happen, but what was inexcusable was United's lack of fight, heart and even tackling as they looked a beaten team from the moment Diaz put them behind.\nThere was a very slight improvement after the break - it could not get worse - but even so this was a performance coupled with a dreadful attitude that was an embarrassment to a club of Manchester United's stature.\nAll the United reaction, in one place\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We all know the situation when it comes to how the last two or three seasons have looked and that high, high level of player that he reached for a big period of time at Tottenham.\n\"So I don't think it was a case of things being simple and sometimes you have to work and fight through things and we're in that process with him.\"\nThe draw denied Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers a first win at Goodison Park, and it wasted a good start for the visitors, who also squandered several good chances towards the end via Maddison.\nThe Foxes have already reached a Europa Conference League semi-final this season, but they now sit 11 points behind seventh-placed West Ham, who have played two more games.\nA draw that felt like a win\nEverton could not turn successive home victories into a third, but after a poor first half, this will feel as good as a win.\nWithout Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who suffered a training-ground injury that could keep him out for two weeks, their front three of Richarlison, Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon struggled to link together.\nGordon's passing and set-piece delivery was particularly woeful, but once Rondon came on to provide a focal point to the attack, and Alli offered some assistance to the impressive Alex Iwobi, the game began to take a different path.\nThe early goal and dominance by Leicester led to a subdued atmosphere in the first half where despite Richarlison's miscued shot, the home fans were not lifted off their seats until just before the break when Gray fired inches wide from a clever corner.\nLeicester had already gone close when Seamus Coleman tackled Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall before the Foxes took the lead.\nWith Rodgers making seven changes to the side that lost at Newcastle on Sunday, the visitors were able to cut through the Everton defence easily. Dewsbury-Hall and Maddison both caused problems for the Everton defence, who had Yerry Mina back for the first time since February following a hamstring injury.\nBy contrast, Fabian Delph and Allan were ponderous in midfield with only Iwobi providing the thrust that Everton and their fans craved. But that soon changed in the second half as Alli came on to replace Allan.\nUnfortunately for the hosts, Gordon's passing was still off, and Richarlison, who had scored only three goals since the turn of the year, wasted another chance after good work by Rondon and a free header from a corner.\nAs Everton pressed for an equaliser, gaps opened up for Leicester to exploit and Maddison went close three times.\nThat ultimately proved costly as Richarlison and his team's persistence earned a crucial point to keep Lampard's side on the right side of the drop zone, regardless of Thursday's results.\nFollow Everton v Leicester and the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nVisit our Everton page\nGo straight to all the best Leicester City content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Dalot twice struck the woodwork and Ramsdale was called into action often, so the commitment could not be questioned here.\nThere was much that was good about United's display but the decisive moment was that second-half penalty miss by Fernandes with Arsenal hanging on desperately at 2-1.\nHe went through an elaborate jig before carelessly rolling his spot-kick against the post.

The atmosphere is now good. This is good for confidence.\"\nWest Ham will be distraught they did not get anything from the game after a sterling display, with Declan Rice, Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio all starting on the bench.\nDawson, who was otherwise excellent with a number of blocks, will also feel aggrieved as West Ham remain seventh, eight points behind Arsenal.\nStuttering Chelsea saved by Pulisic\nChelsea's recent woes on the pitch have mirrored their uncertainty off it as the club waits for new owners to take charge and give it new direction.\nRecent defensive problems have not been helped by news that Antonio Rudiger is set to leave at the end of the season after failing to agree a new deal despite being offered a contract of more than \u00a3200,000 a week.\nBut this late victory gave Stamford Bridge a huge lift even if it looked as if Jorginho had thrown away Chelsea's best chance when his under-hit penalty was easily gathered by the West Ham goalkeeper.\nA clean sheet for the hosts was also welcome, particularly as they were without the injured Rudiger and Reece James, and forced into a late reshuffle when Andreas Christensen was replaced by Trevoh Chalobah, despite the Dane initially being named in the starting line-up.\nJames was missed in a lacklustre first half. Ruben Loftus-Cheek filled in at right wing-back but Chelsea could not penetrate West Ham's defensive wall under the expert marshalling of the evergreen Mark Noble.\nIn front of another restricted crowd of 32,231 because of sanctions against owner Roman Abramovich, and with striker Lukaku starting the game back on the bench, there was little to rouse the crowd before the break with only an off-target effort by N'golo Kante coming anywhere close.\nWest Ham were happy to soak up the pressure and went closer to scoring through Andriy Yarmolenko and Said Benrahma, although the latter's saved effort was deemed offside.\nThe first shot on target did not come until close to the hour mark, when the home fans finally got off their seats. Dawson brilliantly blocked Timo Werner's effort before Kante and Chalobah had shots saved by Fabianski.\nTuchel also woke from a slumber to berate the officials after Rice was deemed to have been fouled shortly after coming on to replace Noble.\nAfter Werner went close twice more, Tuchel made a triple substitution with Lukaku, Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech all coming on.\nAnd it was not long before it made an impact. Lukaku was slipped through and pulled back by Dawson. Referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty and a yellow card, but after a VAR review upgraded it to a red.\nThat looked like it would lead to a home win when Jorginho, who had converted his last 13 spot-kicks, stepped up.\nBut his embarrassment was spared by Pulisic, who scored his seventh goal of the season from Alonso's cut-back, leading to Tuchel and the fans punching the air in delight.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They were last in the relegation zone this far into the season in 1998-99.\nBest action and reaction from Liverpool v Everton in the Premier League\nLiverpool's run of results 'insane', says Klopp\n'Relegation threat a grim reality for Everton'\nLiverpool get the job done\nThis was not the flowing, blistering Liverpool that effectively won the FA Cup semi-final in the first 45 minutes against Manchester City at Wembley and who dismantled a hapless Manchester United at Anfield.\nEverton's rearguard action and determination to disrupt Liverpool infuriated and frustrated Anfield in the first 45 minutes but eventually the dam broke and for all the visitors' courage they were not able to hold out.\nManager Klopp may well take as much pleasure from how Liverpool were forced to dig deep and overcome Everton's determined challenge as he would from the way they have swept so many teams aside this season.\nLiverpool had to fight for control and, in truth, they were never in their normal level of command and still had to survive one or two anxious moments before the final whistle.\nIt puts the Reds right back in City's rearview mirror after Pep Guardiola's side thrashed Watford 5-1, and still on course for their ambition of adding the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup to the EFL Cup.\nLiverpool now face Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final first leg at Anfield on Wednesday as firm favourites and their challenge continues to gather huge momentum.\nEverton must take heart despite defeat\nEverton find themselves in a very hazardous position in the relegation places after this loss at Liverpool followed Burnley's win against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nFrank Lampard's side are now in serious danger of relegation and their 17% possession displays how on the back foot they were, but there were other elements of this game that must encourage them as they try to avoid the drop into the Championship.\nThey will certainly believe they should have had a penalty when the outstanding Anthony Gordon tumbled under a challenge from Joel Matip with the score 0-0 after 53 minutes.\nIt looked like a clear penalty but was waved away by Stuart Attwell, who had earlier booked the talented youngster for diving.\nGordon also shot across the face of goal with a good chance before Liverpool took the lead and Gray fired a rising drive inches off target as his side looked to equalise.\nRobertson also made a vital goalline clearance with Alex Iwobi poised to turn home Dele Alli's cross.\nEverton were fiercely well-drilled until Liverpool went ahead. It was not pretty but Everton do not have to make excuses for that. They could hardly be expected to play an open, expansive game and make themselves lambs to the slaughter.\nWhat is beyond doubt, though, is that Everton are now in serious peril, especially with Burnley seemingly completely reinvigorated after Sean Dyche was sacked and Mike Jackson appointed as caretaker.\nJackson has hauled in seven points in three games in charge and the momentum is now with Burnley. This is something Lampard and Everton must address, quickly.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They suffered more misery this time, with Jesus the man most responsible.\nThe Brazilian put City ahead inside four minutes when he turned in Oleksandr Zinchenko's driven cross, then doubled their lead when he headed home a precise Kevin de Bruyne delivery from close range.\nHassane Kamara pulled a goal back when his powerful angled drive eluded Ederson, but Rodri restored City's two-goal advantage before the break with a thunderous shot into the top corner after Jesus found him on the edge of the area.\nAny hope of a Hornets comeback was ended right at the start of the second half, when Kamara's mistake allowed Jesus to run in at goal and he was felled by visiting keeper Ben Foster.\nReferee Kevin Friend pointed at the spot and, after a lengthy VAR check not helped by a problem with Friend's microphone, the decision stood - allowing Jesus to slam home the penalty and complete his first Premier League hat-trick since arriving in Manchester in 2016.\nJesus was not done yet, rounding off a superb team move soon afterwards when he ran on to a De Bruyne pass, and although no more goals followed in the final half hour, City had long since wrapped up the points.\nAre Man City facing summer Jesus dilemma?\nEvery goal counts for City now\nCity's advantage over second-placed Liverpool is the biggest it has been since 16 March, but that might only last until Sunday's Merseyside derby, when the Reds have a chance to respond.\nIn a title race as tight as this one, goal difference could well play a part and the size of this win means City's is now on +59, just two behind Liverpool on +61.\nWhile City were expected to improve those numbers against the struggling Hornets, to see Jesus lead their charge was something of a surprise.\nBefore Saturday, the 25-year-old Brazilian had scored only seven goals all season, with just three of those in the league, and he was being used more often as a right winger than a striker.\nHis future was uncertain too, with his contract up in 2023 and talk of a possible switch to Arsenal this summer emerging this week, so this was a reminder of his value of Pep Guardiola's side.\nYou would not quite describe Jesus as an unlikely hero - he has played a big part in too many of City's previous successes for that, but this was a timely return to scoring form, especially with Real Madrid the next visitors to the Etihad in the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday.\nWatford face crunch Burnley match\nWatford's gameplan was to frustrate City by defending in numbers and attacking on the break, but the scoreline tells you how successful it turned out.\nTheir counter-attack did work on occasions, with Emmanuel Dennis only denied by a last-ditch Zinchenko challenge when he escaped with the score at 1-0, but stopping City proved impossible despite the Hornets' hard work.\nWhen Watford last won, at Southampton on 13 March, only goal difference kept them in the bottom three but four successive defeats have left them well adrift, with the games running out.\nNext up for Roy Hodgson's side are fellow strugglers Burnley, and defeat then would surely end their hopes of staying up.\nThe Clarets are much more beatable than City, of course, but the problem for Watford is that they face them at Vicarage Road, where they have lost their past 10 games.\nReaction from Man City v Watford and all of Saturday's games\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We will try to create an aggressive gameplan but one that can also help us find a way to get a result.\n\"I know what this game will require and how good the opponent is, but, whatever, let's go for it.\"\nHard-to-beat Leeds get the point their fight deserves\nOnly bottom-of-the-table Norwich City (69) have conceded more Premier League goals this season than Leeds' 68 but in the seven games since Marsch replaced the sacked Marcelo Bielsa in February, the American has turned Leeds into a team that is hard to beat.\nAided by superb defending, with Cooper and Diego Llorente repeatedly making crucial blocks, tackles or interceptions, Leeds will feel they got the point their hard work merited, and, with a tough run of fixtures coming up, will be happy with the result.\nFor Palace, who lost in the FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea at Wembley earlier this month, the draw takes them on to 38 points and surely secures what will be a 10th successive season in the top flight.\nThe match at a packed and passionate Selhurst Park was played at a frenetic pace throughout, but with both sides repeatedly lacking quality in the final areas.\nThe hosts had an early chance when Leeds failed to deal with a ball forward and Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta got to it before the advancing Meslier but did not get enough power on the shot and Llorente was able to clear.\nMateta also headed at Meslier and another opportunity saw him unable to get a clean connection on Jordan Ayew's superb cross from the right wing.\nFor Leeds, who handed a first start in 2022 to England midfielder Kalvin Phillips after a hamstring injury, Cooper's tame header at the back post from Jack Harrison's corner was their only attempt on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nThings threatened to boil over in the last few minutes of the first half, with Leeds players incensed when the often-fouled Zaha pushed his hand into the face of Raphinha, but avoided a booking, before Palace defender Joachim Andersen was shown a yellow card when sliding in late on Rodrigo.\nThe bad-tempered nature of the match continued early in the second half with Leeds' Daniel James catching Joel Ward, with the defender reacting angrily and both players getting cautioned.\nPalace ended the game strongly with Leeds forced to defend deep as they battled to secure the point.\nBut Leeds got the draw they deserved and have now picked up 11 points from the seven games under Marsch.\n'He's a good player, but he dives too much'\nPhillips, back in the starting 11 for the first time since 5 December, said: \"My first start in almost four months and I was happy to be out there.\n\"We started OK first half but disappointed not to get three points. We go into every game wanting three points but if we can't score, we have to shut up shop and we did that.\"\nHowever, the Leeds and England midfielder was unhappy with Crystal Palace's Zaha and added: \"He is a good player, but we defended against him well as a team.\n\"The ref complained at us for fouling him but I think he dives a lot to be honest with you.\"\nVieira defended the Ivory Coast international, saying: \"I was happy Wilf Zaha kept his cool because it looked like they planned to stop him by fouling him.\n\"That won't be the first time teams try to frustrate him.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The draw sees them drop to 10th in the table.\n\"In the last couple of games, we played really well, but in the final third we couldn't find the killer pass,\" Rodgers told Match of the Day.\n\"Maybe that is a lack of energy because of the number of games we've played - the speed of our attacking combinations is not quite as we want it.

This is the first time since May 2014 that Newcastle have been as high as ninth this far into a season - and that is despite them spending 150 days in the relegation zone.\nFollow live coverage of Saturday's Premier League action here\nNewcastle turnaround has been incredible - Shearer\nFive months a long time in football\nWhen these sides met in November, a 1-1 draw at St James' Park, Newcastle were bottom of the table with no wins from 14 games. No team had ever stayed up from that position.\nNorwich were three points and two places above them.\nBut Newcastle's fortunes have turned entirely with the Saudi Arabian takeover, Howe's management and several big January signings.\nOne of Howe's biggest successes has been changing Joelinton from a goal-shy striker to a combative midfielder - although he was back up front in this game as \u00a325m Chris Wood was left on the bench.\nHis first goal came when Norwich defenders failed to clear Saint-Maximin's pass after good wing play by Murphy, a goal which eventually stood after a video assistant referee check for a possible Murphy offside.\nGuimaraes sent Murphy and Joe Willock through with a lovely through ball - as both got in behind the Norwich defence - with Joelinton scoring from Murphy's ball at the back post.\nNorwich were well beaten by the time Krul's lazy pass to Kenny McLean was cut out by \u00a335m winter recruit Guimaraes, who lofted the ball over the Dutch keeper.\nJoelinton had one chance for a hat-trick, shooting at Krul from outside the box, before he was replaced by Miguel Almiron in the 67th minute.\nAt one stage Newcastle fans were dreaming of 17th place and safety. Now they are 15 points clear of the relegation zone.\nThings could have been different had Dowell taken either of his first-half chances for Norwich. First he lobbed over from Mathias Normann's pass and then he sliced over from Teemu Pukki's cut-back.\nDean Smith's side's fate is all but sealed now with eight points to catch up in five games - plus a worse goal difference and more games played than most of the teams above them.\nEven if Pukki had scored a chance when he fired wide of the far post, they never looked like coming back.\nHouse of Maxwell: The story of one of the most extraordinary family sagas the world has ever seen\n'A band of oddities, gentlemen and pirates': Your first look at the exciting new drama SAS Rogue Heroes from the creator of Peaky Blinders"

We will try to create an aggressive gameplan but one that can also help us find a way to get a result.\n\"I know what this game will require and how good the opponent is, but, whatever, let's go for it.\"\nHard-to-beat Leeds get the point their fight deserves\nOnly bottom-of-the-table Norwich City (69) have conceded more Premier League goals this season than Leeds' 68 but in the seven games since Marsch replaced the sacked Marcelo Bielsa in February, the American has turned Leeds into a team that is hard to beat.\nAided by superb defending, with Cooper and Diego Llorente repeatedly making crucial blocks, tackles or interceptions, Leeds will feel they got the point their hard work merited, and, with a tough run of fixtures coming up, will be happy with the result.\nFor Palace, who lost in the FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea at Wembley earlier this month, the draw takes them on to 38 points and surely secures what will be a 10th successive season in the top flight.\nThe match at a packed and passionate Selhurst Park was played at a frenetic pace throughout, but with both sides repeatedly lacking quality in the final areas.\nThe hosts had an early chance when Leeds failed to deal with a ball forward and Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta got to it before the advancing Meslier but did not get enough power on the shot and Llorente was able to clear.\nMateta also headed at Meslier and another opportunity saw him unable to get a clean connection on Jordan Ayew's superb cross from the right wing.\nFor Leeds, who handed a first start in 2022 to England midfielder Kalvin Phillips after a hamstring injury, Cooper's tame header at the back post from Jack Harrison's corner was their only attempt on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nThings threatened to boil over in the last few minutes of the first half, with Leeds players incensed when the often-fouled Zaha pushed his hand into the face of Raphinha, but avoided a booking, before Palace defender Joachim Andersen was shown a yellow card when sliding in late on Rodrigo.\nThe bad-tempered nature of the match continued early in the second half with Leeds' Daniel James catching Joel Ward, with the defender reacting angrily and both players getting cautioned.\nPalace ended the game strongly with Leeds forced to defend deep as they battled to secure the point.\nBut Leeds got the draw they deserved and have now picked up 11 points from the seven games under Marsch.\n'He's a good player, but he dives too much'\nPhillips, back in the starting 11 for the first time since 5 December, said: \"My first start in almost four months and I was happy to be out there.\n\"We started OK first half but disappointed not to get three points. We go into every game wanting three points but if we can't score, we have to shut up shop and we did that.\"\nHowever, the Leeds and England midfielder was unhappy with Crystal Palace's Zaha and added: \"He is a good player, but we defended against him well as a team.\n\"The ref complained at us for fouling him but I think he dives a lot to be honest with you.\"\nVieira defended the Ivory Coast international, saying: \"I was happy Wilf Zaha kept his cool because it looked like they planned to stop him by fouling him.\n\"That won't be the first time teams try to frustrate him.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They suffered more misery this time, with Jesus the man most responsible.\nThe Brazilian put City ahead inside four minutes when he turned in Oleksandr Zinchenko's driven cross, then doubled their lead when he headed home a precise Kevin de Bruyne delivery from close range.\nHassane Kamara pulled a goal back when his powerful angled drive eluded Ederson, but Rodri restored City's two-goal advantage before the break with a thunderous shot into the top corner after Jesus found him on the edge of the area.\nAny hope of a Hornets comeback was ended right at the start of the second half, when Kamara's mistake allowed Jesus to run in at goal and he was felled by visiting keeper Ben Foster.\nReferee Kevin Friend pointed at the spot and, after a lengthy VAR check not helped by a problem with Friend's microphone, the decision stood - allowing Jesus to slam home the penalty and complete his first Premier League hat-trick since arriving in Manchester in 2016.\nJesus was not done yet, rounding off a superb team move soon afterwards when he ran on to a De Bruyne pass, and although no more goals followed in the final half hour, City had long since wrapped up the points.\nAre Man City facing summer Jesus dilemma?\nEvery goal counts for City now\nCity's advantage over second-placed Liverpool is the biggest it has been since 16 March, but that might only last until Sunday's Merseyside derby, when the Reds have a chance to respond.\nIn a title race as tight as this one, goal difference could well play a part and the size of this win means City's is now on +59, just two behind Liverpool on +61.\nWhile City were expected to improve those numbers against the struggling Hornets, to see Jesus lead their charge was something of a surprise.\nBefore Saturday, the 25-year-old Brazilian had scored only seven goals all season, with just three of those in the league, and he was being used more often as a right winger than a striker.\nHis future was uncertain too, with his contract up in 2023 and talk of a possible switch to Arsenal this summer emerging this week, so this was a reminder of his value of Pep Guardiola's side.\nYou would not quite describe Jesus as an unlikely hero - he has played a big part in too many of City's previous successes for that, but this was a timely return to scoring form, especially with Real Madrid the next visitors to the Etihad in the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday.\nWatford face crunch Burnley match\nWatford's gameplan was to frustrate City by defending in numbers and attacking on the break, but the scoreline tells you how successful it turned out.\nTheir counter-attack did work on occasions, with Emmanuel Dennis only denied by a last-ditch Zinchenko challenge when he escaped with the score at 1-0, but stopping City proved impossible despite the Hornets' hard work.\nWhen Watford last won, at Southampton on 13 March, only goal difference kept them in the bottom three but four successive defeats have left them well adrift, with the games running out.\nNext up for Roy Hodgson's side are fellow strugglers Burnley, and defeat then would surely end their hopes of staying up.\nThe Clarets are much more beatable than City, of course, but the problem for Watford is that they face them at Vicarage Road, where they have lost their past 10 games.\nReaction from Man City v Watford and all of Saturday's games\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They were last in the relegation zone this far into the season in 1998-99.\nBest action and reaction from Liverpool v Everton in the Premier League\nLiverpool's run of results 'insane', says Klopp\n'Relegation threat a grim reality for Everton'\nLiverpool get the job done\nThis was not the flowing, blistering Liverpool that effectively won the FA Cup semi-final in the first 45 minutes against Manchester City at Wembley and who dismantled a hapless Manchester United at Anfield.\nEverton's rearguard action and determination to disrupt Liverpool infuriated and frustrated Anfield in the first 45 minutes but eventually the dam broke and for all the visitors' courage they were not able to hold out.\nManager Klopp may well take as much pleasure from how Liverpool were forced to dig deep and overcome Everton's determined challenge as he would from the way they have swept so many teams aside this season.\nLiverpool had to fight for control and, in truth, they were never in their normal level of command and still had to survive one or two anxious moments before the final whistle.\nIt puts the Reds right back in City's rearview mirror after Pep Guardiola's side thrashed Watford 5-1, and still on course for their ambition of adding the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup to the EFL Cup.\nLiverpool now face Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final first leg at Anfield on Wednesday as firm favourites and their challenge continues to gather huge momentum.\nEverton must take heart despite defeat\nEverton find themselves in a very hazardous position in the relegation places after this loss at Liverpool followed Burnley's win against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nFrank Lampard's side are now in serious danger of relegation and their 17% possession displays how on the back foot they were, but there were other elements of this game that must encourage them as they try to avoid the drop into the Championship.\nThey will certainly believe they should have had a penalty when the outstanding Anthony Gordon tumbled under a challenge from Joel Matip with the score 0-0 after 53 minutes.\nIt looked like a clear penalty but was waved away by Stuart Attwell, who had earlier booked the talented youngster for diving.\nGordon also shot across the face of goal with a good chance before Liverpool took the lead and Gray fired a rising drive inches off target as his side looked to equalise.\nRobertson also made a vital goalline clearance with Alex Iwobi poised to turn home Dele Alli's cross.\nEverton were fiercely well-drilled until Liverpool went ahead. It was not pretty but Everton do not have to make excuses for that. They could hardly be expected to play an open, expansive game and make themselves lambs to the slaughter.\nWhat is beyond doubt, though, is that Everton are now in serious peril, especially with Burnley seemingly completely reinvigorated after Sean Dyche was sacked and Mike Jackson appointed as caretaker.\nJackson has hauled in seven points in three games in charge and the momentum is now with Burnley.

The atmosphere is now good. This is good for confidence.\"\nWest Ham will be distraught they did not get anything from the game after a sterling display, with Declan Rice, Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio all starting on the bench.\nDawson, who was otherwise excellent with a number of blocks, will also feel aggrieved as West Ham remain seventh, eight points behind Arsenal.\nStuttering Chelsea saved by Pulisic\nChelsea's recent woes on the pitch have mirrored their uncertainty off it as the club waits for new owners to take charge and give it new direction.\nRecent defensive problems have not been helped by news that Antonio Rudiger is set to leave at the end of the season after failing to agree a new deal despite being offered a contract of more than \u00a3200,000 a week.\nBut this late victory gave Stamford Bridge a huge lift even if it looked as if Jorginho had thrown away Chelsea's best chance when his under-hit penalty was easily gathered by the West Ham goalkeeper.\nA clean sheet for the hosts was also welcome, particularly as they were without the injured Rudiger and Reece James, and forced into a late reshuffle when Andreas Christensen was replaced by Trevoh Chalobah, despite the Dane initially being named in the starting line-up.\nJames was missed in a lacklustre first half. Ruben Loftus-Cheek filled in at right wing-back but Chelsea could not penetrate West Ham's defensive wall under the expert marshalling of the evergreen Mark Noble.\nIn front of another restricted crowd of 32,231 because of sanctions against owner Roman Abramovich, and with striker Lukaku starting the game back on the bench, there was little to rouse the crowd before the break with only an off-target effort by N'golo Kante coming anywhere close.\nWest Ham were happy to soak up the pressure and went closer to scoring through Andriy Yarmolenko and Said Benrahma, although the latter's saved effort was deemed offside.\nThe first shot on target did not come until close to the hour mark, when the home fans finally got off their seats. Dawson brilliantly blocked Timo Werner's effort before Kante and Chalobah had shots saved by Fabianski.\nTuchel also woke from a slumber to berate the officials after Rice was deemed to have been fouled shortly after coming on to replace Noble.\nAfter Werner went close twice more, Tuchel made a triple substitution with Lukaku, Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech all coming on.\nAnd it was not long before it made an impact. Lukaku was slipped through and pulled back by Dawson. Referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty and a yellow card, but after a VAR review upgraded it to a red.\nThat looked like it would lead to a home win when Jorginho, who had converted his last 13 spot-kicks, stepped up.\nBut his embarrassment was spared by Pulisic, who scored his seventh goal of the season from Alonso's cut-back, leading to Tuchel and the fans punching the air in delight.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Dalot twice struck the woodwork and Ramsdale was called into action often, so the commitment could not be questioned here.\nThere was much that was good about United's display but the decisive moment was that second-half penalty miss by Fernandes with Arsenal hanging on desperately at 2-1.\nHe went through an elaborate jig before carelessly rolling his spot-kick against the post. In that moment Arsenal were reprieved and United struggling, before Xhaka finished them off.\nRonaldo reaches 100 Premier League goals - can you name others to do it?\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

However, the Frenchman's challenge was deemed to be outside the box and McNeil struck the subsequent free-kick straight into the Hornets wall.\nEmmanuel Dennis forced Nick Pope into a smart save at his near post following yet another Tarkowski deflection, as Watford continued to threaten.\nBurnley improved after the interval, though, and a lapse in concentration early in the second half from Ismaila Sarr almost gifted Lennon an equaliser, but Foster produced a fine save low to his left to snuff out the danger.\nThe home side had opportunities to add to their lead on the counter-attack, but a combination of poor passing and wasteful finishing set up a nervous finish as Burnley slowly turned the screw.\nFoster managed to tip Barnes' powerful header on to the crossbar, but the warning went unheeded as Cork's header restored parity with seven minutes remaining.\nBrownhill completed the turnaround three minutes later, guiding a right-footed strike into the bottom corner after Watford had failed to properly clear McNeil's free-kick.\nThis is the first time Burnley have won three Premier League games in a row since 2019, while Jackson also becomes the first manager to stay unbeaten in his first four top-flight matches in charge of the Clarets.\nThe last manager not to lose any of their first four league games with the club was Owen Coyle in 2007.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

From the resulting corner, Pickford then took Antonio Rudiger's shot fully in his face, needing medical treatment.\nIt was an incredible effort from the England stopper, who also saved from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but typified Everton's approach as they dug in to thwart Thomas Tuchel's side, even if that raw approach drew complaints from the German.\nDemarai Gray and Anthony Gordon could have made the game safe late on, but Frank Lampard saw his side hold out against his former employers, to earn only his fourth win in 13 Premier League games in charge.\nThe victory was vital, reducing the gap behind Leeds and Burnley, with the Toffees having a game in hand on their relegation rivals.\nChelsea, meanwhile, will rue the fact they could not turn their possession into goals, with their preparations hampered by fireworks being set off during the night outside their hotel.\nTuchel said they had not affected his team, but was left to reflect on a defeat that could harm their chances of finishing third after Arsenal climbed to within three points of Chelsea by beating West Ham.\nEverton earn famous win with full-blooded approach\nIf Everton and their fans were attempting to rattle their opponents, it worked, for what could prove to be a crucial step towards safety.\nWith so much at stake, once again the supporters helped boost a struggling but spirited team to earn a third win in four home matches, which will be key to their chances of survival.\nChelsea's build-up had been disrupted, with midfielder Jorginho admitting he was woken by the fireworks outside the Chelsea hotel on Saturday night.\nBefore kick-off, thousands of Everton fans lined the streets outside Goodison Park, attempting to lift the mood that had been dampened by relegation rivals Burnley's 2-1 victory at Watford on Saturday.\nAnd in a full-blooded match, that noise helped set the tone as the hosts tore into their opponents with an aggression which was met with approval from their fans.\nAt times, it spilled over. Fabian Delph was fortunate not to go in the book for a foul on Jorginho, and then did shortly before half-time with a late challenge on Mount.\nSeamus Coleman and Yerry Mina, back in the side, unsettled Azpilicueta, who was also booked after taking issue with Everton's Colombian defender. Tuchel was furious with some of the treatment handed out to his players on his first visit to Goodison Park.\nThe football on show was limited in the first half, but it did not deter from a raucous occasion.\nMount curled an effort over after eight minutes. Loftus-Cheek, who replaced N'Golo Kante in midfield, made some dangerous runs from deep, and Gordon was a lively presence, shooting wide of the near post with a left-footed effort.\nBut no sooner had fans taken their seats for the second half, Everton went ahead and it was a goal made as a result of their tactics.\nAzpilicueta dawdled on the edge of the penalty box, allowing Richarlison to pinch the ball from him, receive it back from Gray and slot in at the Gwladys Street End to send the stadium into ecstasy.\nThree minutes later, Mykolenko hit the side netting from close range.\nBut around the hour mark, the home fans were rewarded with more good defensive play from their team, which was cheered as strongly as if Everton had scored.\nMount's initial effort somehow stayed out after he hit both posts, before Pickford produced the first of two miraculous saves, firstly to deny Azpilicueta who had the goal at his mercy.\nFrom the resulting corner, Pickford blocked Rudiger's point-blank effort to keep his goal intact.\nFollowing that commotion, and with Chelsea desperately searching for an equaliser, the game opened up, leading to further chances for Gray and Richarlison.\nPickford was called into further action to deny Loftus-Cheek and Mateo Kovacic.

No side has a lower-scoring top scorer in the league.\nIt is in some ways remarkable Wolves can be sat eighth having scored just 33 goals this term. Only Burnley, Watford and Norwich have fewer. The blunt nature of their attack showed here on a day they must quickly put behind them if they are to finish the season positively.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

However, the Frenchman's challenge was deemed to be outside the box and McNeil struck the subsequent free-kick straight into the Hornets wall.\nEmmanuel Dennis forced Nick Pope into a smart save at his near post following yet another Tarkowski deflection, as Watford continued to threaten.\nBurnley improved after the interval, though, and a lapse in concentration early in the second half from Ismaila Sarr almost gifted Lennon an equaliser, but Foster produced a fine save low to his left to snuff out the danger.\nThe home side had opportunities to add to their lead on the counter-attack, but a combination of poor passing and wasteful finishing set up a nervous finish as Burnley slowly turned the screw.\nFoster managed to tip Barnes' powerful header on to the crossbar, but the warning went unheeded as Cork's header restored parity with seven minutes remaining.\nBrownhill completed the turnaround three minutes later, guiding a right-footed strike into the bottom corner after Watford had failed to properly clear McNeil's free-kick.\nThis is the first time Burnley have won three Premier League games in a row since 2019, while Jackson also becomes the first manager to stay unbeaten in his first four top-flight matches in charge of the Clarets.\nThe last manager not to lose any of their first four league games with the club was Owen Coyle in 2007.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Liverpool put the pressure on Manchester City by going to in-form Newcastle United and winning in the lunchtime game.\nFor the late game, manager Pep Guardiola had to consider not only the challenges posed by the traditional fearsome atmosphere inside Elland Road and a Leeds United side desperate for the points, but also this coming Wednesday's Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid.\nGuardiola left Kevin de Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez on the bench to keep them fresh for the test of protecting a 4-3 lead in Spain.\nThe strategy worked as City came through in relative comfort in what was always going to be a tough physical examination.\nCity were helped by Leeds' struggles to defend those set-pieces, with Rodri glancing home the first goal with ease early on and Ake being allowed too much time to turn in the second.\nThe pressure will be on every game for City now, with Liverpool also showing no signs of slipping up, but this was imperious from Guardiola's men, who were simply too good for a Leeds side who showed lots of commitment but lacked quality and threat.\nFoden was behind all of City's best work, a spectacular talent, a creator who adds a tireless work-rate and strength to his many other qualities.\nWith their Premier League lead restored, City's pursuit of glory now moves on to the Bernabeu.\nLeeds still in trouble\nPremier League relegation run-in: Everton, Leeds, Burnley - fixtures & who will go down?\nLeeds have experienced something of a bounce since the sacking of the beloved Marcelo Bielsa in February, and his replacement with Marsch, but they are still in real danger of the drop.\nBurnley's remarkable renaissance since sacking Sean Dyche and replacing him with Mike Jackson has set nerves jangling at Elland Road - and even louder at Everton.\nLeeds showed their spirit was intact and the magnificent, noisy support of their followers can never be doubted as they continued to give deafening backing to their side even with the game gone.\nMarsch, however, needs to somehow find goals in the latest absence of main striker Patrick Bamford and the loss of the influential Stuart Dallas to what looked like a serious injury when he flew into a challenge on Jack Grealish.\nDallas, under-rated outside Leeds, is the glue which helps to hold the side together and he will be a major loss.\nLeeds cannot allow this comprehensive defeat by a side of City's class to inflict too much damage on morale. There is no time for that and there is no shame in being beaten by such quality.\nThey must refocus for two tough upcoming games, away to Arsenal and at home to Chelsea. Everton may have two games in hand, but have a tough run-in of their own - and Leeds have what might be five crucial extra points on the board.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

From the resulting corner, Pickford then took Antonio Rudiger's shot fully in his face, needing medical treatment.\nIt was an incredible effort from the England stopper, who also saved from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but typified Everton's approach as they dug in to thwart Thomas Tuchel's side, even if that raw approach drew complaints from the German.\nDemarai Gray and Anthony Gordon could have made the game safe late on, but Frank Lampard saw his side hold out against his former employers, to earn only his fourth win in 13 Premier League games in charge.\nThe victory was vital, reducing the gap behind Leeds and Burnley, with the Toffees having a game in hand on their relegation rivals.\nChelsea, meanwhile, will rue the fact they could not turn their possession into goals, with their preparations hampered by fireworks being set off during the night outside their hotel.\nTuchel said they had not affected his team, but was left to reflect on a defeat that could harm their chances of finishing third after Arsenal climbed to within three points of Chelsea by beating West Ham.\nEverton earn famous win with full-blooded approach\nIf Everton and their fans were attempting to rattle their opponents, it worked, for what could prove to be a crucial step towards safety.\nWith so much at stake, once again the supporters helped boost a struggling but spirited team to earn a third win in four home matches, which will be key to their chances of survival.\nChelsea's build-up had been disrupted, with midfielder Jorginho admitting he was woken by the fireworks outside the Chelsea hotel on Saturday night.\nBefore kick-off, thousands of Everton fans lined the streets outside Goodison Park, attempting to lift the mood that had been dampened by relegation rivals Burnley's 2-1 victory at Watford on Saturday.\nAnd in a full-blooded match, that noise helped set the tone as the hosts tore into their opponents with an aggression which was met with approval from their fans.\nAt times, it spilled over. Fabian Delph was fortunate not to go in the book for a foul on Jorginho, and then did shortly before half-time with a late challenge on Mount.\nSeamus Coleman and Yerry Mina, back in the side, unsettled Azpilicueta, who was also booked after taking issue with Everton's Colombian defender. Tuchel was furious with some of the treatment handed out to his players on his first visit to Goodison Park.\nThe football on show was limited in the first half, but it did not deter from a raucous occasion.\nMount curled an effort over after eight minutes. Loftus-Cheek, who replaced N'Golo Kante in midfield, made some dangerous runs from deep, and Gordon was a lively presence, shooting wide of the near post with a left-footed effort.\nBut no sooner had fans taken their seats for the second half, Everton went ahead and it was a goal made as a result of their tactics.\nAzpilicueta dawdled on the edge of the penalty box, allowing Richarlison to pinch the ball from him, receive it back from Gray and slot in at the Gwladys Street End to send the stadium into ecstasy.\nThree minutes later, Mykolenko hit the side netting from close range.\nBut around the hour mark, the home fans were rewarded with more good defensive play from their team, which was cheered as strongly as if Everton had scored.\nMount's initial effort somehow stayed out after he hit both posts, before Pickford produced the first of two miraculous saves, firstly to deny Azpilicueta who had the goal at his mercy.\nFrom the resulting corner, Pickford blocked Rudiger's point-blank effort to keep his goal intact.\nFollowing that commotion, and with Chelsea desperately searching for an equaliser, the game opened up, leading to further chances for Gray and Richarlison.\nPickford was called into further action to deny Loftus-Cheek and Mateo Kovacic. But after seven minutes of stoppage time, the relief and delight inside Goodison was almost tangible as Lampard and his players celebrated a famous win.\nVisit our Everton page\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content"

They created limited openings, while Villa hit the woodwork in each half.\nDanny Ings added a late goal in stoppage time to add to Norwich's misery.\nManager Dean Smith said \"plans are already in place\" for their bid to return to the top flight.\n\"I think over the past four to five weeks, there's probably been an inevitability about it,\" he added.\n\"I'm disappointed that we got relegated today because I thought our performance was good, but unfortunately over the season, the performances have not been good enough and we've lacked the quality required in this league.\n\"[The players] are very down, very dejected.\"\nThe low-key win for Villa ended a five-match winless run, lifted them to 13th in the table and took them to the 40-point mark.\nPremier League relegation run-in: Everton, Leeds, Burnley - fixtures & who will go down?\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nVisit our Norwich City page\nNorwich head back to the Championship - again\nThis is the third successive time Norwich have been immediately relegated following promotion to the Premier League.\nThe afternoon was particularly painful for Smith, given that he left Villa earlier this season.\nIn truth, Norwich's slide back to the second tier has looked likely throughout a season when they have rarely reached the standard required of a top-flight team.\nAgain, they were spirited and had good spells in possession, but their lack of threat in front of goal was once again laid bare, a diving stop to deny Milot Rashica from distance the only serious save Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez had to make.\nNorwich have the fewest shots (336), fewest shots on target (100) and lowest shot conversion rate (7%) of all Premier League sides this season.\nThere were issues at the back too, with Villa's opener coming from a long, hopeful ball that was not cleared, even before Williams' slip. The full-back was also outmuscled by Watkins, whose finish was aided by a slight deflection.\nAt full-time the Norwich fans applauded their side's effort and there was no outpouring of emotion.\nThe club's joint majority shareholder Delia Smith watched from the stands and some may again question the hierarchy's resistance to spending big following promotion.\nBut their prudency, and manager Smith's previous promotion with Villa, should leave Norwich well placed to bounce back once again.\n\"We will try everything to come up again,\" said Smith. \"It is a very difficult league to stay in. I spent \u00a3125m at Villa [after promotion in 2019] to keep us up.\nFor Villa this was a much-needed boost. It all but ends any fears of an unlikely slip towards relegation themselves, their winless run having seen them drop from ninth to 15th.\nManager Steven Gerrard handed a full debut to 18-year-old England Under-19 midfielder Tim Iroegbunam, who was solid in a holding role.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Liverpool put the pressure on Manchester City by going to in-form Newcastle United and winning in the lunchtime game.\nFor the late game, manager Pep Guardiola had to consider not only the challenges posed by the traditional fearsome atmosphere inside Elland Road and a Leeds United side desperate for the points, but also this coming Wednesday's Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid.\nGuardiola left Kevin de Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez on the bench to keep them fresh for the test of protecting a 4-3 lead in Spain.\nThe strategy worked as City came through in relative comfort in what was always going to be a tough physical examination.\nCity were helped by Leeds' struggles to defend those set-pieces, with Rodri glancing home the first goal with ease early on and Ake being allowed too much time to turn in the second.\nThe pressure will be on every game for City now, with Liverpool also showing no signs of slipping up, but this was imperious from Guardiola's men, who were simply too good for a Leeds side who showed lots of commitment but lacked quality and threat.\nFoden was behind all of City's best work, a spectacular talent, a creator who adds a tireless work-rate and strength to his many other qualities.\nWith their Premier League lead restored, City's pursuit of glory now moves on to the Bernabeu.\nLeeds still in trouble\nPremier League relegation run-in: Everton, Leeds, Burnley - fixtures & who will go down?\nLeeds have experienced something of a bounce since the sacking of the beloved Marcelo Bielsa in February, and his replacement with Marsch, but they are still in real danger of the drop.\nBurnley's remarkable renaissance since sacking Sean Dyche and replacing him with Mike Jackson has set nerves jangling at Elland Road - and even louder at Everton.\nLeeds showed their spirit was intact and the magnificent, noisy support of their followers can never be doubted as they continued to give deafening backing to their side even with the game gone.\nMarsch, however, needs to somehow find goals in the latest absence of main striker Patrick Bamford and the loss of the influential Stuart Dallas to what looked like a serious injury when he flew into a challenge on Jack Grealish.\nDallas, under-rated outside Leeds, is the glue which helps to hold the side together and he will be a major loss.\nLeeds cannot allow this comprehensive defeat by a side of City's class to inflict too much damage on morale. There is no time for that and there is no shame in being beaten by such quality.\nThey must refocus for two tough upcoming games, away to Arsenal and at home to Chelsea.

He has now overseen two draws against Liverpool, and the north London club are undefeated in their four league games against arguably Europe's two top sides.\nThere was a sense of anti-climax around Anfield at the final whistle. That the home fans were subdued was understandable given the game began draped in an air of celebration in the wake of Liverpool reaching the Champions League final, where they will meet Real Madrid in Paris.\nIt has for several weeks been a case of who would blink first between Liverpool and City and it was Jurgen Klopp's side who dropped points - but this was as much down to the excellence of Spurs as a rare night when they failed to touch their usual heights.\nIn the wider context, it was a result that was not ideal for either team, as City have the opportunity to strengthen their position and return to an enhanced position at the top of the table against Newcastle United at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, while Arsenal can assert their authority in the race for the top four at home to struggling Leeds United. The Gunners currently stand in fourth place, a point ahead of Spurs, who have played a game more.\nSpurs, however, will be happier with the draw because any point at Anfield is precious with Liverpool such a fearsome proposition. The manner in which Spurs acquitted themselves should give them huge confidence about where they could end up if they keep Conte.\nLiverpool were not at their best and looked tired late on, the expected surge in front of the Kop once Luis Diaz levelled Son Heung-min's opener with 16 minutes left failing to materialise.\nSpurs actually had the best chance in the closing seconds when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg failed to realise what time and space he had in front of the exposed Alisson Becker, doing neither one thing nor the other when faced with the choice of heading on target or finding the unmarked Harry Kane.\nKlopp was unable to indulge in his traditional celebratory fist pump in front of the home fans after the final whistle but he will know this title race is not over yet. The pressure now shifts to City to cash in on the window of opportunity Liverpool have opened for them.\nFor Spurs, the need to back Conte and keep him in north London was emphasised by how he organised his side to carry out their Anfield task with fierce discipline, defensive courage, streetwise game management and a genuine threat on the counter-attack.\nAnd, with a full week to prepare for what is arguably football's most formidable task at present, Conte showed once again he is a man with a plan and with the ability to get his players to carry it out to the letter.\nIt takes something special to unlock Liverpool's defence and a sweeping move between Kane, Ryan Sessegnon and scorer Son delivered it after 56 minutes.\nThere is still talk that Conte may not be in it at Spurs for the long haul and there is no question he will demand serious backing from chairman Daniel Levy to keep him happy.\nThe bottom line is Spurs will get no-one better than the Italian, a world-class manager who would be coveted by any of the major football powers seeking a coach or manager - apart from Manchester United, obviously, as they bizarrely decided this fiercely-driven winner was not for them.\nYes, Conte is unquestionably high maintenance - as his previous clubs would testify - but he is proven at the highest level and Spurs might realise he only wants what they and their supporters desire, namely success.\nAs for Liverpool, they are still in a golden spell, with appearances in the FA Cup final and Champions League final to come within three weeks and with three games left in the title race.\nCity might be in a stronger position but this result demonstrates there could still be twists to come and Guardiola's side have to demonstrate they have recovered from the trauma of letting a Champions League final place that was in their hands slip away at the Bernabeu.\nLiverpool will not be going away on the back of one draw - now it is over to Manchester City.\nCould an afternoon nap boost your memory?: Dr Michael Mosley looks at the benefits of a siesta\nDid fame contribute to their deaths?: Legends Never Die explores what happened to three Gen Z hip-hop stars"

a reward for both his persistent pressing and recent performances leading the Arsenal line.\nThe 22-year-old's forward's future is yet to be determined, with his contract expiring in the summer, but Nketiah has continued to do his bit to make sure Arsenal are playing in Europe's elite competition next term, and doubled the hosts' lead with a well-taken second from Martinelli's pass in the 10th minute.\nThat was the forward's ninth goal this season, although five of those have come in the Carabao Cup, where he was used most frequently before earning a first Premier League start of the season last month and establishing his place in Arteta's first XI.\nNow the soon-to-be-free-agent is spearheading a young and exciting Arsenal forward line alongside Bukayo Saka and Martinelli, who was on the end of a foolish tackle from Ayling that resulted in the defender being dismissed after 27 minutes.\nArsenal's flowing attack toyed with the visitors as Martin Odegaard's free-kick found its way onto the bar and Martinelli poked a half-volley over, only for the Gunners to be caught out from Leeds' first corner.\nIt made things slightly less comfortable than Arteta will have hoped for but his side got the vital win they needed before a trip to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where victory will confirm Arsenal's return to the Champions League for the first time since 2016-17.\nLeeds on the brink\nLeeds looked to have turned a corner under new boss Marsch, collecting three wins in a five-game unbeaten run before being humbled 4-0 by league leaders Manchester City last time out.\nThat might have been enough to drag them to safety were it not for recent revivals from Burnley and Everton, but Marsch's side now find themselves on the brink of a return to the Championship.\nThe American must have watched on in disbelief as Meslier took a poor touch in his six-yard box to allow former Leeds loanee Nketiah to open the scoring after five minutes.\nHe will have been even more dumbfounded by captain Ayling, on his 500th career appearance, diving in on Martinelli when the visitors were trailing 2-0.\nThe defender was initially shown a yellow card, but VAR recommended referee Chris Kavanagh look at the pitch-side monitor and he upgraded it to red.\nRaphinha almost followed the Leeds skipper for his reaction and the visitors threatened to unravel as home fans taunted them with chants of \"you're going down\".\nDespite their numerical disadvantage, Leeds rediscovered some defensive solidity and made their first opportunity at the other end count when Junior Firpo flicked on a corner for Llorente to score.\nRodrigo had a chance to snatch a draw in stoppage time but could not get enough on his header, leaving Leeds 18th, level on points with Burnley and one behind Everton but with a far worse goal difference, as they finish the day in the bottom three for the first time since October.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

This is not the moment to praise individuals.\"\nVictory would have virtually guaranteed Chelsea's presence in next season's Champions League, but Tuchel's side showed their vulnerability - 13 of the last 15 league goals they have conceded have come in the second half - and their winless run in the Premier League now stretches to three games.\n\"At some point we played like we were 2-0 down not 2-0 up,\" added the German. \"I don't think we were too deep, I think it was the opposite, and then we tried to respond to it and change the structure.\n\"So I don't know if that was the right decision from me, I need to watch it again. But in general it's a lack of execution, of discipline and execution of the match plan throughout the whole half.\"\nWolves show character in comeback\nWolves' promising first season under Bruno Lage was in danger of stumbling to an unsatisfactory finish, but the manner of this draw will have lifted the mood at Molineux.\nWith 11 minutes of normal time remaining, the visitors were staring at a fourth successive defeat without scoring a goal.\nBut Trincao's superb curling effort from outside the box gave Wolves hope and they then had a flurry of chances to level before Coady rose highest to head Chiquinho's cross beyond Edouard Mendy and spark huge celebrations in the away end.\nBoss Lage had to watch from home after returning a positive Covid test, but his side's substitutions proved crucial with both goalscorer Trincao and Chiquinho, who got both assists, brought on with Wolves 2-0 down.\nWith three games remaining, Wolves still have the chance to secure European football next term but must navigate a tricky run-in that includes both Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\"Bruno Lage was in touch and we had a chat at half time over Zoom,\" said goalkeeping coach Tony Roberts. \"He is very happy as you can imagine but also disappointed we didn't get the three points.\n\"We want to get as high as we can.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Norwich 0-4 West Ham: Visitors keep top six dream alive with rout\nWest Ham are \"desperate to get back into Europe\" according to manager David Moyes, who saw his side's hopes of qualifying for the Europa League strengthened by thrashing already-relegated Norwich.\nThe win - thanks to Said Benrahma's double, Michail Antonio's strike and a penalty from Manuel Lanzini - puts the Hammers just three points behind sixth-placed Manchester United in the final Europa League spot, with a game in hand.\nThey also have the added security of being in pole position for the Europa Conference League should they miss out on the Europa League, sitting five points clear of closest-rivals Wolves\nAnd Moyes said that his side have had their appetite whetted for further European football despite the disappointment of their midweek defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League semi-finals.\n\"We are desperate to get back into Europe. We've had an unbelievable experience,\" Moyes told BBC Sport. \"It isn't something West Ham have had regularly, and not for a long time. The supporters enjoyed it and we had a great trip. We are trying to get into the Europa League or Conference League.\"\nMoyes admitted he was concerned that his side may not be at their best after their exertions in midweek but praised his players' application.\n\"It was big that we turned in a good performance and result after one of the biggest disappointments we've all had in a long time,\" he added.\n\"Any manager would think there is a chance of a hangover because you never know the way football is. We set the tone in the first 20 minutes and got a goal in that period as well.\n\"The players did a really good, professional job. We could have played better and on another day we might have scored more. We've missed regular goals in the past few months.\"\nNorwich, meanwhile, seemed devoid of inspiration in front of an angry home crowd as costly errors proved their downfall.\nIt took just 12 minutes for the Hammers to solidify their strong start with the opener. Jarrod Bowen fed Benrahma on the left after a swift attacking move, and he fired a deflected shot under Tim Krul, who really should have done better.\nNorwich's defensive frailties were in evidence again as Antonio made it 2-0 on the half hour mark. Bowen's reverse pass appeared to have been dealt with by Grant Hanley, but Krul collided with his captain to allow the striker a tap in to an empty net.\nSpace was far too easily afforded to West Ham and they should have punished Norwich again immediately. Benrahma had all the time in the world to pick out a cross, and, with players queuing up to score, Bowen somehow fired wide from point-blank range.\nHowever, he picked himself up and registered another assist, picking out Benrahma once more. The Algerian rifled a shot past a helpless Krul on the stroke of half time.\nNorwich thought they had pulled one back through Sam Byram just after the restart. Lukasz Fabianski failed to catch a corner and the defender turned it home, only for it to become immediately apparent through VAR that the ball had hit his arm.\nVAR intervened at the other end 25 minutes from time when Jacob Sorensen handled in the area, allowing Lanzini to step up and convert from the spot.\nWest Ham bounce back strongly\nIt could have been easy for Moyes' side to fold after the disappointment of Thursday night, so their focus was impressive.\nIt may not have been the toughest of tests against opponents playing only for pride, but West Ham showed their intent as they started as they meant to go on, utilising the space and hurting the home side out wide.\nBenrahma was one of two changes for the game and he could have had a hat-trick to further delight the travelling fans, whose buoyancy showed there is still much achieve this season.\nNorwich going down with a whimper\nThe season cannot end soon enough for the Canaries. It is the third season in a row that promotion has been followed immediately by relegation, but there was a greater sense of animosity in the air.\nThe home crowd's displeasure was clear at half-time and although there was a mini resurgence in the second period it did not last long. History suggests Dean Smith's side will have a good go at promotion next season, and the fans will be desperate for that to be the case.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

This is not the moment to praise individuals.\"\nVictory would have virtually guaranteed Chelsea's presence in next season's Champions League, but Tuchel's side showed their vulnerability - 13 of the last 15 league goals they have conceded have come in the second half - and their winless run in the Premier League now stretches to three games.\n\"At some point we played like we were 2-0 down not 2-0 up,\" added the German. \"I don't think we were too deep, I think it was the opposite, and then we tried to respond to it and change the structure.\n\"So I don't know if that was the right decision from me, I need to watch it again. But in general it's a lack of execution, of discipline and execution of the match plan throughout the whole half.\"\nWolves show character in comeback\nWolves' promising first season under Bruno Lage was in danger of stumbling to an unsatisfactory finish, but the manner of this draw will have lifted the mood at Molineux.\nWith 11 minutes of normal time remaining, the visitors were staring at a fourth successive defeat without scoring a goal.\nBut Trincao's superb curling effort from outside the box gave Wolves hope and they then had a flurry of chances to level before Coady rose highest to head Chiquinho's cross beyond Edouard Mendy and spark huge celebrations in the away end.\nBoss Lage had to watch from home after returning a positive Covid test, but his side's substitutions proved crucial with both goalscorer Trincao and Chiquinho, who got both assists, brought on with Wolves 2-0 down.\nWith three games remaining, Wolves still have the chance to secure European football next term but must navigate a tricky run-in that includes both Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\"Bruno Lage was in touch and we had a chat at half time over Zoom,\" said goalkeeping coach Tony Roberts. \"He is very happy as you can imagine but also disappointed we didn't get the three points.\n\"We want to get as high as we can. We have three tough games.

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Liverpool 1-1 Tottenham: Antonio Conte is the great title race disruptor\nThe great Premier League title race disruptor was at it again as Tottenham manager Antonio Conte achieved what was starting to look impossible and stopped the Liverpool steamroller in its tracks.\nConte is an elite manager who is perfectly suited to elite games and a deserved 1-1 draw at Anfield was testimony to the Italian's tactical and organisational skill, putting a twist into the season's league climax.\nIt is not the first time he has thrown a spanner in the title works, having led Spurs to a 3-2 win at Manchester City in February. He has now overseen two draws against Liverpool, and the north London club are undefeated in their four league games against arguably Europe's two top sides.\nThere was a sense of anti-climax around Anfield at the final whistle. That the home fans were subdued was understandable given the game began draped in an air of celebration in the wake of Liverpool reaching the Champions League final, where they will meet Real Madrid in Paris.\nIt has for several weeks been a case of who would blink first between Liverpool and City and it was Jurgen Klopp's side who dropped points - but this was as much down to the excellence of Spurs as a rare night when they failed to touch their usual heights.\nIn the wider context, it was a result that was not ideal for either team, as City have the opportunity to strengthen their position and return to an enhanced position at the top of the table against Newcastle United at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, while Arsenal can assert their authority in the race for the top four at home to struggling Leeds United. The Gunners currently stand in fourth place, a point ahead of Spurs, who have played a game more.\nSpurs, however, will be happier with the draw because any point at Anfield is precious with Liverpool such a fearsome proposition. The manner in which Spurs acquitted themselves should give them huge confidence about where they could end up if they keep Conte.\nLiverpool were not at their best and looked tired late on, the expected surge in front of the Kop once Luis Diaz levelled Son Heung-min's opener with 16 minutes left failing to materialise.\nSpurs actually had the best chance in the closing seconds when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg failed to realise what time and space he had in front of the exposed Alisson Becker, doing neither one thing nor the other when faced with the choice of heading on target or finding the unmarked Harry Kane.\nKlopp was unable to indulge in his traditional celebratory fist pump in front of the home fans after the final whistle but he will know this title race is not over yet. The pressure now shifts to City to cash in on the window of opportunity Liverpool have opened for them.\nFor Spurs, the need to back Conte and keep him in north London was emphasised by how he organised his side to carry out their Anfield task with fierce discipline, defensive courage, streetwise game management and a genuine threat on the counter-attack.\nAnd, with a full week to prepare for what is arguably football's most formidable task at present, Conte showed once again he is a man with a plan and with the ability to get his players to carry it out to the letter.\nIt takes something special to unlock Liverpool's defence and a sweeping move between Kane, Ryan Sessegnon and scorer Son delivered it after 56 minutes.\nThere is still talk that Conte may not be in it at Spurs for the long haul and there is no question he will demand serious backing from chairman Daniel Levy to keep him happy.\nThe bottom line is Spurs will get no-one better than the Italian, a world-class manager who would be coveted by any of the major football powers seeking a coach or manager - apart from Manchester United, obviously, as they bizarrely decided this fiercely-driven winner was not for them.\nYes, Conte is unquestionably high maintenance - as his previous clubs would testify - but he is proven at the highest level and Spurs might realise he only wants what they and their supporters desire, namely success.\nAs for Liverpool, they are still in a golden spell, with appearances in the FA Cup final and Champions League final to come within three weeks and with three games left in the title race.\nCity might be in a stronger position but this result demonstrates there could still be twists to come and Guardiola's side have to demonstrate they have recovered from the trauma of letting a Champions League final place that was in their hands slip away at the Bernabeu.\nLiverpool will not be going away on the back of one draw - now it is over to Manchester City.\nCould an afternoon nap boost your memory?: Dr Michael Mosley looks at the benefits of a siesta\nDid fame contribute to their deaths?: Legends Never Die explores what happened to three Gen Z hip-hop stars",

Marsch\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nVisit our Leeds page\nGunners take charge of top-four race\nWith Spurs drawing at Liverpool on Saturday, Arsenal knew if they could successfully navigate this potential stumbling block they would head into one of the most crucial north London derbies in recent years on Thursday with a commanding lead over their rivals.\nThe hosts were handed the ideal start when Meslier took a loose touch from Ayling's pass and allowed Nketiah to pounce for the opener - a reward for both his persistent pressing and recent performances leading the Arsenal line.\nThe 22-year-old's forward's future is yet to be determined, with his contract expiring in the summer, but Nketiah has continued to do his bit to make sure Arsenal are playing in Europe's elite competition next term, and doubled the hosts' lead with a well-taken second from Martinelli's pass in the 10th minute.\nThat was the forward's ninth goal this season, although five of those have come in the Carabao Cup, where he was used most frequently before earning a first Premier League start of the season last month and establishing his place in Arteta's first XI.\nNow the soon-to-be-free-agent is spearheading a young and exciting Arsenal forward line alongside Bukayo Saka and Martinelli, who was on the end of a foolish tackle from Ayling that resulted in the defender being dismissed after 27 minutes.\nArsenal's flowing attack toyed with the visitors as Martin Odegaard's free-kick found its way onto the bar and Martinelli poked a half-volley over, only for the Gunners to be caught out from Leeds' first corner.\nIt made things slightly less comfortable than Arteta will have hoped for but his side got the vital win they needed before a trip to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where victory will confirm Arsenal's return to the Champions League for the first time since 2016-17.\nLeeds on the brink\nLeeds looked to have turned a corner under new boss Marsch, collecting three wins in a five-game unbeaten run before being humbled 4-0 by league leaders Manchester City last time out.\nThat might have been enough to drag them to safety were it not for recent revivals from Burnley and Everton, but Marsch's side now find themselves on the brink of a return to the Championship.\nThe American must have watched on in disbelief as Meslier took a poor touch in his six-yard box to allow former Leeds loanee Nketiah to open the scoring after five minutes.\nHe will have been even more dumbfounded by captain Ayling, on his 500th career appearance, diving in on Martinelli when the visitors were trailing 2-0.\nThe defender was initially shown a yellow card, but VAR recommended referee Chris Kavanagh look at the pitch-side monitor and he upgraded it to red.\nRaphinha almost followed the Leeds skipper for his reaction and the visitors threatened to unravel as home fans taunted them with chants of \"you're going down\".\nDespite their numerical disadvantage, Leeds rediscovered some defensive solidity and made their first opportunity at the other end count when Junior Firpo flicked on a corner for Llorente to score.\nRodrigo had a chance to snatch a draw in stoppage time but could not get enough on his header, leaving Leeds 18th, level on points with Burnley and one behind Everton but with a far worse goal difference, as they finish the day in the bottom three for the first time since October.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

If Arsenal win their next two games they will be in next season's Champions League.\nThe more difficult aspect is that, given Spurs' fixtures, the likelihood is that they may well have to win at Newcastle United on Monday to keep their ambitions on track.\nArsenal are so close and looked to be in pole position just a few weeks ago, so to miss out now would be a huge disappointment, especially as they have not had any European football to distract them from the job of finishing in the top four.\nArteta must ensure his players put this experience behind them but there is no doubt this defeat has put Arsenal under serious pressure befofe their visit to Tyneside, where manager Eddie Howe will want to round off Newcastle's season at St James' Park in style after moving them clear of relegation trouble with plenty to spare.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They are two points ahead of Leeds, who remain in the bottom three and have played a game more.\nWatford had little to play for other than avoiding another loss as manager Roy Hodgson's reign comes to a close but this was a grim encounter that will not linger in the memory.\nReaction to Watford v Everton, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Watford content\nVisit our Everton page\nEverton have supporters to thank\nFor Everton, the highlight of the night was another show of magnificent travelling support from fans who have taken ownership of the crisis facing the club in a remarkable mobilisation that has played a huge part in their recent recovery.\nAs at Leicester on Sunday, the away section provided a thunderous soundtrack throughout, even setting aside the desperately meagre fare on the pitch to back Everton from the first minute until the last.\nManager Frank Lampard was quick to show his appreciation at the end and he has formed a bond with Everton's fans that has not existed since Roberto Martinez's successful first season. It has certainly not been seen before under the reign of owner Farhad Moshiri.\nToffees fans, realising the serious danger of relegation, set aside their protests at years of bad decision-making at boardroom level inside Goodison Park to back the side and, if they do stay up, the club should be eternally grateful for their unswerving loyalty.\nA missed chance this may have been, but Everton's fate is in their own hands - and survival looks a lot more likely than it did before taking seven points from three games.\n\"I wouldn't say I'm frustrated. I think if you can't win, you don't lose, and we were more than secure in the game,\" said Lampard.\n\"If you ask me, I'd much rather be the team that's got it in your hands and a point or two more on the board and maybe a game more than someone as well, so I think that probably in that situation that's what you want, but the pressure is huge anyway.\n\"For all the talk about pressure, more or less, it's only actions at this point. It's how we act and how we perform in these games.\"\nWatford look to the future\nThe cheers that rang around Vicarage Road at the final whistle were an almost ironic celebration of Watford ending that awful sequence of home losses, but it was a show of satisfaction nonetheless.\nTo the credit of the Hornets supporters, they threw their backing behind Watford with passion and good humour throughout the whole game and deserve something to celebrate, even if it hardly qualifies as consolation.\nHodgson is on the way out after failing to save them from the drop and Edwards will be the latest incumbent of the Vicarage Road hot-seat after moving from Forest Green to help them build back from the Championship.\nIt will be, no doubt, another summer of churn at this club but one thing they can count on is their excellent fans, who have stood by Watford even in this awful season.\nHodgson said: \"I think it was a sterling effort from the players. The players have been doing the work with us and there was an enormous honesty about our performance.\n\"They played with an integrity and honesty that was really encouraging. Your confidence can never be high after being relegated.

We've had an unbelievable experience,\" Moyes told BBC Sport. \"It isn't something West Ham have had regularly, and not for a long time. The supporters enjoyed it and we had a great trip. We are trying to get into the Europa League or Conference League.\"\nMoyes admitted he was concerned that his side may not be at their best after their exertions in midweek but praised his players' application.\n\"It was big that we turned in a good performance and result after one of the biggest disappointments we've all had in a long time,\" he added.\n\"Any manager would think there is a chance of a hangover because you never know the way football is. We set the tone in the first 20 minutes and got a goal in that period as well.\n\"The players did a really good, professional job. We could have played better and on another day we might have scored more. We've missed regular goals in the past few months.\"\nNorwich, meanwhile, seemed devoid of inspiration in front of an angry home crowd as costly errors proved their downfall.\nIt took just 12 minutes for the Hammers to solidify their strong start with the opener. Jarrod Bowen fed Benrahma on the left after a swift attacking move, and he fired a deflected shot under Tim Krul, who really should have done better.\nNorwich's defensive frailties were in evidence again as Antonio made it 2-0 on the half hour mark. Bowen's reverse pass appeared to have been dealt with by Grant Hanley, but Krul collided with his captain to allow the striker a tap in to an empty net.\nSpace was far too easily afforded to West Ham and they should have punished Norwich again immediately. Benrahma had all the time in the world to pick out a cross, and, with players queuing up to score, Bowen somehow fired wide from point-blank range.\nHowever, he picked himself up and registered another assist, picking out Benrahma once more. The Algerian rifled a shot past a helpless Krul on the stroke of half time.\nNorwich thought they had pulled one back through Sam Byram just after the restart. Lukasz Fabianski failed to catch a corner and the defender turned it home, only for it to become immediately apparent through VAR that the ball had hit his arm.\nVAR intervened at the other end 25 minutes from time when Jacob Sorensen handled in the area, allowing Lanzini to step up and convert from the spot.\nWest Ham bounce back strongly\nIt could have been easy for Moyes' side to fold after the disappointment of Thursday night, so their focus was impressive.\nIt may not have been the toughest of tests against opponents playing only for pride, but West Ham showed their intent as they started as they meant to go on, utilising the space and hurting the home side out wide.\nBenrahma was one of two changes for the game and he could have had a hat-trick to further delight the travelling fans, whose buoyancy showed there is still much achieve this season.\nNorwich going down with a whimper\nThe season cannot end soon enough for the Canaries. It is the third season in a row that promotion has been followed immediately by relegation, but there was a greater sense of animosity in the air.\nThe home crowd's displeasure was clear at half-time and although there was a mini resurgence in the second period it did not last long. History suggests Dean Smith's side will have a good go at promotion next season, and the fans will be desperate for that to be the case.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

City are not over the line yet, and their next test is an awkward trip to West Ham on Sunday, but on this evidence they will take some stopping.\nFollow live text commentary of Wednesday's Premier League action\nVisit our Wolves page\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nLaporte injury is a cause for concern\nThis was a night to savour for Guardiola and City's travelling fans but the one note of concern was the sight of Aymeric Laporte and Fernandinho being forced off with an injury in the second half.\nCity may have bolstered their attack for next season with their agreement to sign Borussia Dortmund striker Haaland but it is defence where they are short right now.\nWith Ruben Dias, John Stones and Kyle Walker already out injured for the season and Nathan Ake not fully fit,Guardiola chose to put veteran midfielder Fernandinho in his back-line alongside Laporte at Molineux.\nWolves were set up to make the most of any lack of pace in City's rearguard and, initially, looked dangerous whenever they broke forward.\nWhen Dendoncker's equaliser came via that route and left the home fans in raptures, it seemed Wolves would ensure City were in for a difficult night. De Bruyne had other ideas, however.\nA good game for Lage to miss\nWolves boss Bruno Lage was absent from the dugout after testing positive with Covid, and communicated with his coaching staff by phone.\nOne can only imagine he attempted to get the message across on a number of occasions that they should try to stop City's number 17, but the task was beyond any of his players.\nDe Bruyne almost added a fifth goal for himself before the end, and the only surprise was that he fired against the post on that occasion rather than finding the corner of the net.\nHe had done little else wrong all night, and was rightly serenaded by City's jubilant supporters when he celebrated with them at the final whistle.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We give up an early goal and go down a man again - deja vu,\" Marsch told BBC Sport.\n\"We don't get a chance to stay in the game and see if we can test ourselves and come away with more. We lose another player.\n\"Two tackles in the last two games that were a little bit crossing the line and hurting the team. I'm not going to blame or finger point any of our players. They've given everything they can. We have to stay within boundaries in not jeopardising ourselves.\"\nLeeds also became the first team to ever receive 100 yellow or red cards in a Premier League season.\nMount scored the game's opening goal with a lovely first-time effort from outside the box from Reece James' cut-back at the end of a nice passing move.\nKovacic had to be replaced because of an ankle injury following the foul by James. \"It looks swollen and painful. It's the same ankle he had injured already. It doesn't look good,\" said Blues boss Thomas Tuchel.\nPulisic slotted Mount's pass into the bottom corner from 20 yards.\nLukaku - who earlier had a goal disallowed - scored the third goal that the Blues' dominance deserved as he took his time to hold off three defenders and smash home.\nLeeds offered very little and their hopes of staying up are out of their hands. They are behind 17th-placed Burnley on goal difference and two points off Everton, and have played a game more than both.\nChelsea only need to beat one of Leicester or Watford - or hope Tottenham do not win all three remaining games - to clinch a place in next season's Champions League. But for now their focus turns to Saturday's FA Cup final against Liverpool.\nFollow live text commentary of all Wednesday's games here\nGo straight to all the best Leeds United content\nVisit our Chelsea page\nIs the end nigh for Leeds?\nLeeds replacing their legendary boss Marcelo Bielsa with Marsch in February has brought no real upturn in fortunes.\nIll-discipline cost them again with James shown a fully-deserved red card for a bad foul on Kovacic - who was booed by home fans as he limped off to be replaced by Ruben Loftus-Cheek. That was their third red of the season (on top of a record 97 yellows) and their second in four days.\nLeeds now need to get something from games with Brighton and Brentford - without Ayling or James - and hope Burnley or Everton slip up above them.\nLeeds have conceded 37 goals in their home league games this season, their second worst ever record in a top-flight campaign.\nThey could perhaps deal with those struggles better if they were scoring more goals - but they only had five shots at Elland Road, none on target.\nJob almost done for Chelsea\nChelsea, who have been comfortable in third place for most of the season, looked to be cruising towards the Champions League places but a run of three games without a win might have seen a tiny bit of doubt creep in.\nThey could be guaranteed a top-four place by the time they go to Wembley on Saturday if Spurs do not beat Arsenal on Thursday.\nThomas Tuchel's side were deserved winners and could have scored more, with Lukaku having six shots alone.\nThe Belgian continued his revival with his third goal in two Premier League games. He had only netted four in his first 22.\nIn Mount - involved in the first two goals - Chelsea have a star. With 11 goals and 10 assists he is only the fifth (and youngest) Chelsea player to reach double figures in both in a Premier League season, after Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, Juan Mata and Eden Hazard.\n\"We were very focused,\" said Tuchel. \"Even against 11 players we were clearly the better team. I felt the team were very committed, focused and calm. I had a good feeling.\n\"I was happy with how we played and how the players reacted after Saturday's late equaliser [in the 2-2 draw with Wolves].

But none compares to this dominant victory over United.\nIndeed, the Seagulls were not flattered by the margin of victory and could even have scored more, with Welbeck going close in the first half and unlucky not to add a fifth late on with an excellent effort from 25 yards that curled just past the post.\nMeanwhile, United's few chances of note included a Bruno Fernandes effort that was parried by Robert Sanchez.\nEdinson Cavani, set to leave the club on a free transfer at the end of the season, thought he had scored a consolation when he steered in Harry Maguire's cross from close range - but that was rightly ruled out for offside.\nMore remarkably, this was ninth-placed Brighton's first home win of 2022 after only picking up four points from their previous eight games at the Amex.\nIt kept them on course to claim their first ever top-10 finish in English football's top flight in their 121-year history.\nFor United, the season cannot end quickly enough. They spent almost \u00a3120m on Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho and five-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, and hopes were high at the start of the season that they could push for the title after coming second last season.\nBut after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November, the club appointed Rangnick on an interim basis, although he was not given the chance to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window and the club have gone backwards.\nManchester United have been English champions a record 20 times, but the rebuilding task facing Ten Hag, who could win the Dutch Eredivisie on Sunday with current club Ajax, is growing by each match.\nOn this evidence, he faces the toughest task in football to bring United back to their glory years.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The Colombian's signing has proved to be a masterstroke.\nNow the scenery switches to Molineux on Wednesday, where leaders City face Wolves, who still have European aspirations of their own.\nPep Guardiola's side still have that advantage on goal difference but Liverpool's win at least ensures they stay right on Manchester City's shoulders as the season reaches its climax.\nGerrard with work to do\nAston Villa will finish the season in a comfortable mid-table position but so much of this term has been about manager Steven Gerrard discovering what he has at his disposal then laying the groundwork for next season.\nHe has talent in the shape of Emiliano Buendia but big decisions remain about whether he will strengthen in defence - where captain Tyrone Mings still looks suspect - and on the possibility of a permanent deal for his former Liverpool colleague Philippe Coutinho.\nThe Brazilian, on loan from Barcelona, only showed his ability in flashes here and it was clear the Villa fans felt more of a surge of hope when he was replaced by Buendia.\nGerrard certainly has something to work with but a lot needs to be done and he is a driven personality who will not want to cruise along in mid-table.\nVilla, and Ings in particular, had plenty of opportunities to take advantage of some uncharacteristic uncertainty in the visitors' defence, with keeper Alisson fortunate to get away with one or two moments of poor judgement - although he then made a crucial save from the striker when he broke clear with a chance to equalise.\nThe end of the season will be the end of Gerrard's fact-finding mission and the serious reconstruction will begin at Villa Park.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They are two points ahead of Leeds, who remain in the bottom three and have played a game more.\nWatford had little to play for other than avoiding another loss as manager Roy Hodgson's reign comes to a close but this was a grim encounter that will not linger in the memory.\nReaction to Watford v Everton, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Watford content\nVisit our Everton page\nEverton have supporters to thank\nFor Everton, the highlight of the night was another show of magnificent travelling support from fans who have taken ownership of the crisis facing the club in a remarkable mobilisation that has played a huge part in their recent recovery.\nAs at Leicester on Sunday, the away section provided a thunderous soundtrack throughout, even setting aside the desperately meagre fare on the pitch to back Everton from the first minute until the last.\nManager Frank Lampard was quick to show his appreciation at the end and he has formed a bond with Everton's fans that has not existed since Roberto Martinez's successful first season. It has certainly not been seen before under the reign of owner Farhad Moshiri.\nToffees fans, realising the serious danger of relegation, set aside their protests at years of bad decision-making at boardroom level inside Goodison Park to back the side and, if they do stay up, the club should be eternally grateful for their unswerving loyalty.\nA missed chance this may have been, but Everton's fate is in their own hands - and survival looks a lot more likely than it did before taking seven points from three games.\n\"I wouldn't say I'm frustrated. I think if you can't win, you don't lose, and we were more than secure in the game,\" said Lampard.\n\"If you ask me, I'd much rather be the team that's got it in your hands and a point or two more on the board and maybe a game more than someone as well, so I think that probably in that situation that's what you want, but the pressure is huge anyway.\n\"For all the talk about pressure, more or less, it's only actions at this point.

The players have been doing the work with us and there was an enormous honesty about our performance.\n\"They played with an integrity and honesty that was really encouraging.

The decision is either right or wrong.\n\"Is a shirt pull a foul? Yes. Is it in the box? Yes. It's a penalty.\"\nA Richarlison spot-kick in first-half stoppage time restored Everton's advantage after Seamus Coleman's own goal had levelled for the Bees, but Brentford dominated the second half and deservedly turned the game on its head through headers from Yoane Wissa and Rico Henry.\nThe Toffees contacted the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) after the Liverpool defeat to query why referee Stuart Attwell did not penalise a challenge on Anthony Gordon.\n\"It's hard,\" Lampard continued. \"I have to represent the club, represent the fans that come here, and those small margins can affect our position.\n\"I do believe that penalty for the shirt pull means maybe 2-0 and 11 men, and I think we all know how that game goes.\"\nThe Toffees' woes were compounded late on when substitute Salomon Rondon was sent off for a two-footed lunge on Henry, but Lampard's side will be safe if they beat Crystal Palace at home on Thursday evening.\nHenry and Toney say their families were racially abused at Everton\nWhat's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?\nVisit our Everton page\nGo straight to all the best Brentford coverage\nEverton miss chance to secure safety\nAn impressive haul of seven points from three games had lifted Everton clear of the bottom three before Sunday's crucial game, and Leeds' failure to overcome Brighton at Elland Road meant survival was within tantalising distance for Lampard and his players - who were greeted off the team bus by thousands of Toffees fans prior to kick-off.\nBoth sides had opportunities to open the scoring in a blistering start to the match, the first of which was spurned by Richarlison after Brentford goalkeeper David Raya had clawed Gordon's clever flick into the forward's path.\nIvan Toney and Richarlison traded further chances, before Calvert-Lewin - making his first start since 9 April - got the slightest of touches to Gordon's driven free-kick to break the deadlock and ramp up the noise inside an already frantic Goodison Park.\nThe mood changed dramatically, however, when Branthwaite was adjudged to have brought down Toney as last man.\nThe red card shifted the momentum inside Goodison Park as Christian Eriksen curled a free-kick narrowly wide of the far post, before Wissa's whipped delivery was diverted into his own net by Coleman.\nThere was still time for another twist before the interval as Mads Bech Sorensen was adjudged to have tugged back Richarlison inside the Brentford penalty area, allowing the Brazilian to slam home the resulting spot-kick for his 10th goal of the campaign in all competitions.\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank switched to a back three at half-time in a bid to press home his side's numerical advantage, and the bold move paid off as the visitors struck twice in the space of three second-half minutes.\nThere was little Jordan Pickford could do about Wissa's looping header or Henry's well-placed effort moments later, which handed Brentford a first league double in this fixture since 1936.\nThere seemed little chance of Everton clawing their way back into the game at this stage, but any hopes the Toffees had of salvaging an unlikely point were well and truly extinguished by Rondon, whose reckless challenge on Henry earned him a straight red card from referee Michael Oliver.\nThe victory lifts Brentford up to 11th - two points behind Leicester and Brighton in ninth and 10th respectively.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The fans are entitled to be frustrated and upset with us and to make their opinions heard.\"\nHodgson's side have also conceded 46 league goals at home this term, the most by any top-flight team since 1960-61.\nIt represented an embarrassing send-off for Hodgson at Vicarage Road and for Foster, who also appears set to leave the club this summer.\nVintage Vardy\nWhile the pre-match focus was on goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel's omission after 149 consecutive league appearances, by the end it was another of Leicester's 35-year-olds who had taken the headlines.\nFor the second game running Vardy scored twice, becoming the first Leicester player to do so in the Premier League and the second-oldest player ever after Youri Djorkaeff to accomplish that feat in the competition.\nHis first was all about anticipation, running clear of the last defender to reach Maddison's lofted ball before Foster and glancing his header into an unguarded net.\nHis second was another typical Vardy effort, running into the channel to collect Barnes' pass before sliding his shot past Foster.\nBy then Leicester's early woes of conceding a 16th top-flight goal from a corner were long forgotten.\n\"It was a fantastic win,\" said Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers.\n\"It's never easy at this stage of the season when people think you have nothing to play for. I'm proud of the players. They turned up and they were hungry right to the end. I thought the attacking part of our game was outstanding.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

With the chances we created, you expect to score more than one goal. We've conceded naively on a set play so we have ourselves to blame.\"\nThe Villa boss added: \"We need to be more ruthless and clinical.

Clarets keeper Nick Pope made two brilliant saves from Son Heung-min after the break to keep the game in the balance, and his side almost levelled when Ashley Barnes fired against the post.\nBy the end, the home fans were imploring Friend to blow the final whistle as Burnley pumped balls into their box in the closing seconds, and they got their wish as Spurs held on for an important victory.\nWhat's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?\nReaction from Spurs v Burnley and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nVisit our Tottenham page\nGo straight to all our Burnley content\nSpurs get the job done\nThis Spurs performance brought none of the euphoria that had greeted their win over Arsenal on Thursday but they dug in to ensure it brought the same result.\nThey got it despite four of their players suffering from a stomach bug - goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who played the 90 minutes, plus his deputy Pierluigi Gollini, winger Dejan Kulusevski and midfielder Harry Winks who were all on the bench.\nTottenham's bid to finish fourth is still not in their own hands but they have put the pressure on the Gunners now, with only seven days of the season to go.\nThe way Antonio Conte's side started the game, it appeared they would overwhelm the Clarets, who did not even manage a touch in the Spurs area until the 25th minute.\nBut Pope saved from Kane, who also saw a goal-bound header hooked clear by Nathan Collins and Burnley began to create chances of their own.\nThe visitors wasted a good opportunity to take the lead when Maxwel Cornet ran clear but fired weakly at Hugo Lloris, but they remained resolute at the back and Spurs' frustration continued to grow - until VAR handed Kane the chance to make the breakthrough.\nBurnley have work to do\nThe Burnley bench understandably reacted angrily when Tottenham were belatedly awarded the penalty that undid all of the Clarets' good work in the first half.\nMichael Jackson's side had arrived with a game plan to defend in numbers and pack their own box and, after surviving that frantic start, it seemed to be working.\nThey did a decent job at chasing the game too and caused Spurs some problems in the second half - notably from set-pieces - but for all their industry, Barnes' effort from distance was still the closest they came to an equaliser.\nAfter taking 10 points from his first four games in charge, caretaker boss Jackson has now lost two games on the bounce.\nHis side still have a game in hand over Leeds, their closest relegation rivals, as well as a vastly superior goal difference - but they go into the final week of the season with their fate still uncertain.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Liverpool confirmed their obvious superiority while the home side looked nervous, especially when playing out from the back, where they played themselves into trouble on several occasions.\nSouthampton lie in 15th place, nearing the end of the season in which moments of promise were eventually overshadowed by disappointment. This is exactly where they finished last season and they have to win at Leicester City on Sunday to equal last term's points tally.\nNow Hasenhuttl will hope to keep hold of star man James Ward-Prowse this summer and get some much-needed financial backing from the club's new owners, the company backed by Serb media mogul Dragan Solak.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Toti's well-timed challenge stopped Dowell as he closed in on a tap-in from the rebound.\nWolves dominated possession but were frustrated by Norwich's robust defence for much of the first half.\nTheir only chance of real note came after half an hour, when Raul Jimenez's cross was headed over by Hwang Hee-chan.\nEight minutes before the break, it was third time lucky for Pukki. He cut in from the right and created a sight of goal before wrong-footing Ruddy for his eleventh goal of the season.\nBooed off at half-time, Wolves came out fighting and levelled 10 minutes after the restart. Joao Moutinho's free-kick caused chaos in the area, eventually finding its way for Ait-Nouri to head home.\nThe mood changed instantly. Chiquinho, a half-time change for the hosts, was causing all sorts of problems and Norwich suddenly looked vulnerable at the back. Pedro Neto nearly put Wolves ahead, only to be thwarted by Angus Gunn.\nBruno Lage's side hunted the winner but were unable to make their dominance count, and he was left frustrated by his side once again conceding first in a match.\n\"We are frustrated with the result. It has been easy to score goals against us in the last months,\" Lage told BBC Sport.\n\"We tried to do our best. We changed the dynamic a bit, scored one and should score more. It is a draw, it is not good for us and me. I wanted a good performance and result for the fans who supported us this season.\n\"Sometimes the games are balanced and we are suffering first and conceding first, even when the opponent is doing nothing.\n\"Today, we are controlling the game, we tried to find our spaces to play. We are missing some players; it is easy to find spaces against our defence and it is hard for me to be in this moment.\"\nWhat's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?\nVisit our Wolves page\nHere is all our Norwich content\nWolves rally but can't find breakthrough\nIt was a much improved second-half display from Wolves as they looked to end their season on home soil with a flourish.\nThe introduction of Chiquinho made a real difference and they began to find more space in key areas than before, with Norwich looking much less resolute.\nBut ultimately, Lage's side perhaps won't be sad to see the back of Molineux for the time being as they failed to turn around a drab home record, having won just three of their previous nine in Wolverhampton.\nCanaries hold on but rue early misses\nThere was a reaction from Norwich here, after a difficult few weeks which confirmed their return to the Championship. The heart was evident again, but perhaps the quality wasn't.\nIt could have been very different had Pukki made good on those opportunities in the first half, and Dean Smith will no doubt be disappointed with the manner of the goal they conceded.\nSmith admitted his frustration with Pukki's finishing but was pleased with the way his side defended overall.\n\"We had three wonderful chances,\" he said. \"Teemu has been put through a number of times. I thought defensively we restricted them to not many chances at all.\n\"It was a really good, workmanlike performance but I'm disappointed we haven't got all three because we could have been more than a goal up at half-time.\n\"[The equaliser] was preventable because it wasn't a free-kick. Unfortunately we have decisions like that go against us week in, week out. We are disappointed by that.\n\"We wanted to stop the bleeding today; we've been conceding too many goals and too many big chances. I thought we did that today. Second half, we were careless on the ball and didn't keep it as well as we did first half. We thoroughly merited the point.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who scored his first goal since August against Brentford on Sunday during an injury-hit season, sparked pandemonium with a diving header from Demarai Gray's free-kick.\nThe excitement boiled over as fans descended on the pitch to celebrate, with blue mist shrouding the stadium as smoke flares were let off.\nThe crucial result avoided the kind of final-day nerves that Everton fans had to experience in 1998 and 1994, where the team also preserved their Premier League status.\nThis time, with a trip to Arsenal on Sunday, they can at least enjoy the fact that however tortuous this season has been, they will remain in the top flight, and will hope to build on the spirit shown in the closing stages of the campaign.\nPalace's Vieira involved in altercation with pitch invader\n'A special night in Everton history - but we can't be here again'\nVisit our Everton page\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\nThe party started at the final whistle, with thousands of fans flooding onto the pitch, letting off more smoke flares, saluting their team and manager Lampard.\nBut he and the club will hope they will never have to cope with a similar scare again given lavish spending on players and a move to a new stadium in 2024.\nSpirit from fans and players save Everton again\nLampard described this game as \"all or nothing\" given Everton's wretched away record, which has seen them win once on the road in the league since August.\nAnd despite a poor showing in the first period, where once again Everton looked inferior to their opponents, they somehow managed another second-half turnaround, which has been crucial in keeping them in the Premier League.\nThe scenes at the final whistle were in stark contrast to those before the break where a tempestuous game boiled over on the pitch and left a livid feeling in the stands.\nAfter the introduction of Dele Alli at the break and a move to a more attacking formation, Everton matched their second-half showings against Newcastle, Leicester and Chelsea, which earned two wins and a draw.\nLampard may well question why his side have to play poorly to find the inspiration, but boosted by a support which has had a massive role in their survival, they turned the game around against a Palace side which had beaten them twice already this season.\nPalace dominate first half\nSunday's defeat by Brentford threatened to derail Everton's momentum gathered by their superior home form, but the hand that supporters have played in keeping the Toffees up cannot be underestimated.\nLampard and fans tried to evoke the spirit of recent matches from the start, with the team coach greeted by a wall of blue smoke outside the stadium.\nThat almost boiled over early on as Anthony Gordon and Wifried Zaha squared up to each other, causing a melee, but once Palace settled they quickly picked off an Everton side who struggled to keep the ball.\nLampard again favoured a 3-5-2 formation, but when his side retreated into a back five, Patrick Vieira's visitors were able to enjoy plenty of possession and control the game.\nThere were moments in first half for Everton's fans to get excited about, like Richarlison's free-kick that hit the bar.\nBut for the most part the passionate home support turned to anger as Mateta scored his seventh goal of the season before helping to create Palace's second.\nThe fact it came from Ayew was contentious. He had hacked down Gordon shortly before but only received a yellow card and was then on hand to take advantage as both Vitaliy Mykolenko and Abdoulaye Doucoure somehow failed to connect with the ball on the line following Zaha's shot.\nThat silenced the crowd, who must have felt like relegation was staring them in the face.\nBut a half-time switch to a back four by Lampard, who replaced the ineffective Andre Gomes with Alli, breathed life into Everton.\nNine minutes after the break, Keane fired in after Mykolenko's free-kick was headed back to the centre-back by Mason Holgate.\nAnd with 15 minutes left, Everton managed to conjure up another goal. Alli had a hand in it, crossing the ball, but when the Palace defence failed to clear Richarlison's shot ended up in the bottom corner, setting off wild celebrations.\nThat seemed minor compared to Calvert-Lewin's winner. Everton fans could not contain their delight, running onto the pitch, with Zaha seeming to take issue with some supporters' attentions.\nThe pitch was eventually cleared, but there was little hope for the stewards as thousands celebrated with their heroes at the final whistle.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

While Jackson's side entertain 12th-placed Newcastle at the weekend, Leeds are at 11th-placed Brentford.\n\"The least we wanted was a point, we're a little disappointed not to get the three,\" he said after Burnley ended a two-match losing run.\n\"Everything I've seen tonight is what this group does. They've had to dig in, they've had to work.

When you analyse the goals we conceded, there isn't a lot good you could say. Crass individual errors and we find ourselves on the end of a very bad defeat.\n\"We've had the worst home record in all the leagues. You need your wins at home.

But given the situation they found themselves in at the break, with Liverpool potentially having the chance to catch them when they play on Tuesday, the final outcome was positive for the visitors.\nIt certainly was for West Ham, who have qualified for European football through their league position in successive seasons for the first time in their history.\nWhat's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?\nFollow reaction to West Ham v Man City and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nVisit our Manchester City page\nCity drag themselves out of trouble\nIt is a measure of the success Guardiola has had in this stadium that his first five visits all yielded victories - and a staggering total of 22 goals.\nNow City have drawn on three successive visits - losing on penalties in the Carabao Cup earlier this season.\nIn the week they signed Erling Haaland, they found it impossible to hold West Ham's number nine, Michail Antonio, and were unsettled by Bowen's direct running.\nWithout Grealish's volley from Rodri's knock-down flicking off Craig Dawson's leg and over Fabianski, they might have been in for a very fraught second half.\nAs it was, they dominated possession and put the Hammers defence under so much pressure, it felt inevitable an equaliser would come. That Coufal provided it was unfortunate as the Czech did not have to dive at Mahrez's free-kick, which Fabianksi seemed to have covered.\nMahrez blew the opportunity to avoid a nervy final day - but, 10 years after Sergio Aguero's famous injury-time title winner, City fans do at least know that anything can happen if events start to conspire against them again.\nEuropa Conference joy for West Ham\nThis has been an excellent season for West Ham - with European qualification being welcomed by manager David Moyes, even if it ends up being the Europa Conference League.\nBowen, a Premier League player of the year nominee, has been one of the stand-out stars.\nThe former Hull man showed an impressive turn of pace to run on to Pablo Fornals' hooked long pass, sprint round Ederson and finish from an acute angle.\nBowen showed composure also when he ran on to Antonio's through ball and found the net again.\nHowever, had he pulled a cross back rather than try to score from an impossibly narrow angle shortly after Grealish had breathed new life into the game, West Ham might have got a rare home win over City.\nAntonio also fluffed his lines when Fernandinho's woeful back-pass sent him through, chipping wide of Ederson and the City goal.\nHammers stalwart Noble says farewell\nMark Noble was 17 when he made his Hammers debut.\nBorn in Canning Town and growing up only a mile from Upton Park, Noble has been a fan all his life and other than short loan spells at Hull and Ipswich early in his career, has played for the club through the intervening 18 seasons.\nWest Ham were determined to make the most of Noble's final home game. His face adorned the side of the stadium, clearly visible on the walk up from the Westfield centre. A cake in his honour was left in the media room, with members of the press also given a letter from Noble thanking them for their support throughout his career.\nThe front page of the programme was dedicated to Noble, a distinctive number 16 shirt was laid on the pitch before the game, supporters applauded throughout the 16th minute.\nUnder the circumstances, it was hardly a surprise he was fighting back the tears as he came out to take the acclaim just before the teams emerged from the tunnel.\nMoyes trusted Noble enough to bring him on near the end as West Ham secured their point, before Noble received the acclaim of virtually a full stadium that waited to hear his final farewell long after the whistle had gone.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

But given the situation they found themselves in at the break, with Liverpool potentially having the chance to catch them when they play on Tuesday, the final outcome was positive for the visitors.\nIt certainly was for West Ham, who have qualified for European football through their league position in successive seasons for the first time in their history.\nWhat's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?\nFollow reaction to West Ham v Man City and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nVisit our Manchester City page\nCity drag themselves out of trouble\nIt is a measure of the success Guardiola has had in this stadium that his first five visits all yielded victories - and a staggering total of 22 goals.\nNow City have drawn on three successive visits - losing on penalties in the Carabao Cup earlier this season.\nIn the week they signed Erling Haaland, they found it impossible to hold West Ham's number nine, Michail Antonio, and were unsettled by Bowen's direct running.\nWithout Grealish's volley from Rodri's knock-down flicking off Craig Dawson's leg and over Fabianski, they might have been in for a very fraught second half.\nAs it was, they dominated possession and put the Hammers defence under so much pressure, it felt inevitable an equaliser would come. That Coufal provided it was unfortunate as the Czech did not have to dive at Mahrez's free-kick, which Fabianksi seemed to have covered.\nMahrez blew the opportunity to avoid a nervy final day - but, 10 years after Sergio Aguero's famous injury-time title winner, City fans do at least know that anything can happen if events start to conspire against them again.\nEuropa Conference joy for West Ham\nThis has been an excellent season for West Ham - with European qualification being welcomed by manager David Moyes, even if it ends up being the Europa Conference League.\nBowen, a Premier League player of the year nominee, has been one of the stand-out stars.\nThe former Hull man showed an impressive turn of pace to run on to Pablo Fornals' hooked long pass, sprint round Ederson and finish from an acute angle.\nBowen showed composure also when he ran on to Antonio's through ball and found the net again.\nHowever, had he pulled a cross back rather than try to score from an impossibly narrow angle shortly after Grealish had breathed new life into the game, West Ham might have got a rare home win over City.\nAntonio also fluffed his lines when Fernandinho's woeful back-pass sent him through, chipping wide of Ederson and the City goal.\nHammers stalwart Noble says farewell\nMark Noble was 17 when he made his Hammers debut.\nBorn in Canning Town and growing up only a mile from Upton Park, Noble has been a fan all his life and other than short loan spells at Hull and Ipswich early in his career, has played for the club through the intervening 18 seasons.\nWest Ham were determined to make the most of Noble's final home game. His face adorned the side of the stadium, clearly visible on the walk up from the Westfield centre. A cake in his honour was left in the media room, with members of the press also given a letter from Noble thanking them for their support throughout his career.\nThe front page of the programme was dedicated to Noble, a distinctive number 16 shirt was laid on the pitch before the game, supporters applauded throughout the 16th minute.\nUnder the circumstances, it was hardly a surprise he was fighting back the tears as he came out to take the acclaim just before the teams emerged from the tunnel.\nMoyes trusted Noble enough to bring him on near the end as West Ham secured their point, before Noble received the acclaim of virtually a full stadium that waited to hear his final farewell long after the whistle had gone.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Everton 3-2 Crystal Palace: Dominic Calvert-Lewin winner preserves Toffees' Premier League status\nEverton secured their Premier League status with an incredible fightback where they came from two goals down to beat Crystal Palace.\nThe hosts, who will continue their 68-year stay in the top flight, looked like they were heading for defeat after Palace scored twice in the first half through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew.\nBut conjuring up a fighter's spirit once more and spurred on by their vociferous support, Everton turned the game around in the second half, thanks to a more attacking approach.\nNine minutes after the break Michael Keane smashed in to give Frank Lampard's side hope, and when Richarlison found the bottom corner with a deflected shot with 15 minutes left, it sent Goodison Park into raptures as a precious point looked likely.\nYet the best was to come with five minutes left. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who scored his first goal since August against Brentford on Sunday during an injury-hit season, sparked pandemonium with a diving header from Demarai Gray's free-kick.\nThe excitement boiled over as fans descended on the pitch to celebrate, with blue mist shrouding the stadium as smoke flares were let off.\nThe crucial result avoided the kind of final-day nerves that Everton fans had to experience in 1998 and 1994, where the team also preserved their Premier League status.\nThis time, with a trip to Arsenal on Sunday, they can at least enjoy the fact that however tortuous this season has been, they will remain in the top flight, and will hope to build on the spirit shown in the closing stages of the campaign.\nPalace's Vieira involved in altercation with pitch invader\n'A special night in Everton history - but we can't be here again'\nVisit our Everton page\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\nThe party started at the final whistle, with thousands of fans flooding onto the pitch, letting off more smoke flares, saluting their team and manager Lampard.\nBut he and the club will hope they will never have to cope with a similar scare again given lavish spending on players and a move to a new stadium in 2024.\nSpirit from fans and players save Everton again\nLampard described this game as \"all or nothing\" given Everton's wretched away record, which has seen them win once on the road in the league since August.\nAnd despite a poor showing in the first period, where once again Everton looked inferior to their opponents, they somehow managed another second-half turnaround, which has been crucial in keeping them in the Premier League.\nThe scenes at the final whistle were in stark contrast to those before the break where a tempestuous game boiled over on the pitch and left a livid feeling in the stands.\nAfter the introduction of Dele Alli at the break and a move to a more attacking formation, Everton matched their second-half showings against Newcastle, Leicester and Chelsea, which earned two wins and a draw.\nLampard may well question why his side have to play poorly to find the inspiration, but boosted by a support which has had a massive role in their survival, they turned the game around against a Palace side which had beaten them twice already this season.\nPalace dominate first half\nSunday's defeat by Brentford threatened to derail Everton's momentum gathered by their superior home form, but the hand that supporters have played in keeping the Toffees up cannot be underestimated.\nLampard and fans tried to evoke the spirit of recent matches from the start, with the team coach greeted by a wall of blue smoke outside the stadium.\nThat almost boiled over early on as Anthony Gordon and Wifried Zaha squared up to each other, causing a melee, but once Palace settled they quickly picked off an Everton side who struggled to keep the ball.\nLampard again favoured a 3-5-2 formation, but when his side retreated into a back five, Patrick Vieira's visitors were able to enjoy plenty of possession and control the game.\nThere were moments in first half for Everton's fans to get excited about, like Richarlison's free-kick that hit the bar.\nBut for the most part the passionate home support turned to anger as Mateta scored his seventh goal of the season before helping to create Palace's second.\nThe fact it came from Ayew was contentious. He had hacked down Gordon shortly before but only received a yellow card and was then on hand to take advantage as both Vitaliy Mykolenko and Abdoulaye Doucoure somehow failed to connect with the ball on the line following Zaha's shot.\nThat silenced the crowd, who must have felt like relegation was staring them in the face.\nBut a half-time switch to a back four by Lampard, who replaced the ineffective Andre Gomes with Alli, breathed life into Everton.\nNine minutes after the break, Keane fired in after Mykolenko's free-kick was headed back to the centre-back by Mason Holgate.\nAnd with 15 minutes left, Everton managed to conjure up another goal. Alli had a hand in it, crossing the ball, but when the Palace defence failed to clear Richarlison's shot ended up in the bottom corner, setting off wild celebrations.\nThat seemed minor compared to Calvert-Lewin's winner. Everton fans could not contain their delight, running onto the pitch, with Zaha seeming to take issue with some supporters' attentions.\nThe pitch was eventually cleared, but there was little hope for the stewards as thousands celebrated with their heroes at the final whistle.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

But none compares to this dominant victory over United.\nIndeed, the Seagulls were not flattered by the margin of victory and could even have scored more, with Welbeck going close in the first half and unlucky not to add a fifth late on with an excellent effort from 25 yards that curled just past the post.\nMeanwhile, United's few chances of note included a Bruno Fernandes effort that was parried by Robert Sanchez.\nEdinson Cavani, set to leave the club on a free transfer at the end of the season, thought he had scored a consolation when he steered in Harry Maguire's cross from close range - but that was rightly ruled out for offside.\nMore remarkably, this was ninth-placed Brighton's first home win of 2022 after only picking up four points from their previous eight games at the Amex.\nIt kept them on course to claim their first ever top-10 finish in English football's top flight in their 121-year history.\nFor United, the season cannot end quickly enough. They spent almost \u00a3120m on Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho and five-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, and hopes were high at the start of the season that they could push for the title after coming second last season.\nBut after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November, the club appointed Rangnick on an interim basis, although he was not given the chance to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window and the club have gone backwards.\nManchester United have been English champions a record 20 times, but the rebuilding task facing Ten Hag, who could win the Dutch Eredivisie on Sunday with current club Ajax, is growing by each match.\nOn this evidence, he faces the toughest task in football to bring United back to their glory years.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The decision is either right or wrong.\n\"Is a shirt pull a foul? Yes. Is it in the box? Yes. It's a penalty.\"\nA Richarlison spot-kick in first-half stoppage time restored Everton's advantage after Seamus Coleman's own goal had levelled for the Bees, but Brentford dominated the second half and deservedly turned the game on its head through headers from Yoane Wissa and Rico Henry.\nThe Toffees contacted the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) after the Liverpool defeat to query why referee Stuart Attwell did not penalise a challenge on Anthony Gordon.\n\"It's hard,\" Lampard continued. \"I have to represent the club, represent the fans that come here, and those small margins can affect our position.\n\"I do believe that penalty for the shirt pull means maybe 2-0 and 11 men, and I think we all know how that game goes.\"\nThe Toffees' woes were compounded late on when substitute Salomon Rondon was sent off for a two-footed lunge on Henry, but Lampard's side will be safe if they beat Crystal Palace at home on Thursday evening.\nHenry and Toney say their families were racially abused at Everton\nWhat's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?\nVisit our Everton page\nGo straight to all the best Brentford coverage\nEverton miss chance to secure safety\nAn impressive haul of seven points from three games had lifted Everton clear of the bottom three before Sunday's crucial game, and Leeds' failure to overcome Brighton at Elland Road meant survival was within tantalising distance for Lampard and his players - who were greeted off the team bus by thousands of Toffees fans prior to kick-off.\nBoth sides had opportunities to open the scoring in a blistering start to the match, the first of which was spurned by Richarlison after Brentford goalkeeper David Raya had clawed Gordon's clever flick into the forward's path.\nIvan Toney and Richarlison traded further chances, before Calvert-Lewin - making his first start since 9 April - got the slightest of touches to Gordon's driven free-kick to break the deadlock and ramp up the noise inside an already frantic Goodison Park.\nThe mood changed dramatically, however, when Branthwaite was adjudged to have brought down Toney as last man.\nThe red card shifted the momentum inside Goodison Park as Christian Eriksen curled a free-kick narrowly wide of the far post, before Wissa's whipped delivery was diverted into his own net by Coleman.\nThere was still time for another twist before the interval as Mads Bech Sorensen was adjudged to have tugged back Richarlison inside the Brentford penalty area, allowing the Brazilian to slam home the resulting spot-kick for his 10th goal of the campaign in all competitions.\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank switched to a back three at half-time in a bid to press home his side's numerical advantage, and the bold move paid off as the visitors struck twice in the space of three second-half minutes.\nThere was little Jordan Pickford could do about Wissa's looping header or Henry's well-placed effort moments later, which handed Brentford a first league double in this fixture since 1936.\nThere seemed little chance of Everton clawing their way back into the game at this stage, but any hopes the Toffees had of salvaging an unlikely point were well and truly extinguished by Rondon, whose reckless challenge on Henry earned him a straight red card from referee Michael Oliver.\nThe victory lifts Brentford up to 11th - two points behind Leicester and Brighton in ninth and 10th respectively.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Wolves 1-1 Norwich: Canaries hold Wolves to drab draw\nWolves' hopes of European qualification were extinguished as already-relegated Norwich City held them to a frustrating draw at Molineux.\nRayan Ait-Nouri rescued a point after an improved second-half performance by the home side, but it is now just one win from their last seven games.\nBecause of West Ham's point against Manchester City in London, Wolves can no longer reach the Europa Conference League for next season.\nTeemu Pukki gave the Canaries an early lead, but they weren't able to hold on for a final away victory of the season.\nThere was an end-of-season feel to the game from the start, with both sides lacking form and purpose.\nPukki fired wide after being released by a perfectly-weighted pass from Kieran Dowell, before John Ruddy denied him with a fine save moments later. Toti's well-timed challenge stopped Dowell as he closed in on a tap-in from the rebound.\nWolves dominated possession but were frustrated by Norwich's robust defence for much of the first half.\nTheir only chance of real note came after half an hour, when Raul Jimenez's cross was headed over by Hwang Hee-chan.\nEight minutes before the break, it was third time lucky for Pukki. He cut in from the right and created a sight of goal before wrong-footing Ruddy for his eleventh goal of the season.\nBooed off at half-time, Wolves came out fighting and levelled 10 minutes after the restart. Joao Moutinho's free-kick caused chaos in the area, eventually finding its way for Ait-Nouri to head home.\nThe mood changed instantly. Chiquinho, a half-time change for the hosts, was causing all sorts of problems and Norwich suddenly looked vulnerable at the back. Pedro Neto nearly put Wolves ahead, only to be thwarted by Angus Gunn.\nBruno Lage's side hunted the winner but were unable to make their dominance count, and he was left frustrated by his side once again conceding first in a match.\n\"We are frustrated with the result. It has been easy to score goals against us in the last months,\" Lage told BBC Sport.\n\"We tried to do our best. We changed the dynamic a bit, scored one and should score more. It is a draw, it is not good for us and me. I wanted a good performance and result for the fans who supported us this season.\n\"Sometimes the games are balanced and we are suffering first and conceding first, even when the opponent is doing nothing.\n\"Today, we are controlling the game, we tried to find our spaces to play. We are missing some players; it is easy to find spaces against our defence and it is hard for me to be in this moment.\"\nWhat's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?\nVisit our Wolves page\nHere is all our Norwich content\nWolves rally but can't find breakthrough\nIt was a much improved second-half display from Wolves as they looked to end their season on home soil with a flourish.\nThe introduction of Chiquinho made a real difference and they began to find more space in key areas than before, with Norwich looking much less resolute.\nBut ultimately, Lage's side perhaps won't be sad to see the back of Molineux for the time being as they failed to turn around a drab home record, having won just three of their previous nine in Wolverhampton.\nCanaries hold on but rue early misses\nThere was a reaction from Norwich here, after a difficult few weeks which confirmed their return to the Championship. The heart was evident again, but perhaps the quality wasn't.\nIt could have been very different had Pukki made good on those opportunities in the first half, and Dean Smith will no doubt be disappointed with the manner of the goal they conceded.\nSmith admitted his frustration with Pukki's finishing but was pleased with the way his side defended overall.\n\"We had three wonderful chances,\" he said. \"Teemu has been put through a number of times. I thought defensively we restricted them to not many chances at all.\n\"It was a really good, workmanlike performance but I'm disappointed we haven't got all three because we could have been more than a goal up at half-time.\n\"[The equaliser] was preventable because it wasn't a free-kick. Unfortunately we have decisions like that go against us week in, week out. We are disappointed by that.\n\"We wanted to stop the bleeding today; we've been conceding too many goals and too many big chances. I thought we did that today. Second half, we were careless on the ball and didn't keep it as well as we did first half. We thoroughly merited the point.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Clarets keeper Nick Pope made two brilliant saves from Son Heung-min after the break to keep the game in the balance, and his side almost levelled when Ashley Barnes fired against the post.\nBy the end, the home fans were imploring Friend to blow the final whistle as Burnley pumped balls into their box in the closing seconds, and they got their wish as Spurs held on for an important victory.\nWhat's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?\nReaction from Spurs v Burnley and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nVisit our Tottenham page\nGo straight to all our Burnley content\nSpurs get the job done\nThis Spurs performance brought none of the euphoria that had greeted their win over Arsenal on Thursday but they dug in to ensure it brought the same result.\nThey got it despite four of their players suffering from a stomach bug - goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who played the 90 minutes, plus his deputy Pierluigi Gollini, winger Dejan Kulusevski and midfielder Harry Winks who were all on the bench.\nTottenham's bid to finish fourth is still not in their own hands but they have put the pressure on the Gunners now, with only seven days of the season to go.\nThe way Antonio Conte's side started the game, it appeared they would overwhelm the Clarets, who did not even manage a touch in the Spurs area until the 25th minute.\nBut Pope saved from Kane, who also saw a goal-bound header hooked clear by Nathan Collins and Burnley began to create chances of their own.\nThe visitors wasted a good opportunity to take the lead when Maxwel Cornet ran clear but fired weakly at Hugo Lloris, but they remained resolute at the back and Spurs' frustration continued to grow - until VAR handed Kane the chance to make the breakthrough.\nBurnley have work to do\nThe Burnley bench understandably reacted angrily when Tottenham were belatedly awarded the penalty that undid all of the Clarets' good work in the first half.\nMichael Jackson's side had arrived with a game plan to defend in numbers and pack their own box and, after surviving that frantic start, it seemed to be working.\nThey did a decent job at chasing the game too and caused Spurs some problems in the second half - notably from set-pieces - but for all their industry, Barnes' effort from distance was still the closest they came to an equaliser.\nAfter taking 10 points from his first four games in charge, caretaker boss Jackson has now lost two games on the bounce.\nHis side still have a game in hand over Leeds, their closest relegation rivals, as well as a vastly superior goal difference - but they go into the final week of the season with their fate still uncertain.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nArsenal off to perfect start\nAfter a disappointing end to last season, Arsenal's opening weekend win helps them gather more momentum to add to their Community Shield win over Manchester City at Wembley last weekend.\nThe Gunners led the Premier League for 248 days last season but their challenge fell apart in the closing stages as City overtook them to claim the title as part of a Treble, along with the Champions League and FA Cup.\nArsenal's big summer signings Declan Rice, Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber all started again for Mikel Arteta, having made their competitive debuts in the Community Shield, but it was Gabriel Martinelli who looked the liveliest in the opening stages.\nThe Brazilian winger darted in and out of the Forest defence to create the goalscoring opportunity for Nketiah, who netted his first goal since January when his shot took the slightest of deflections off Joe Worrall to send Turner the wrong way.\nEight minutes later, Saka's quality shone through when he received the ball on the edge of the penalty area, cut inside and fired home Arsenal's second.\nHowever, Arsenal's afternoon was marred when Timber, signed from Ajax for \u00a334m last month, limped off the pitch and was replaced by Takehiro Tomiyasu in the 50th minute with what appeared to be a calf injury.\nRice, a \u00a3100m signing from West Ham, was effective in the Arsenal midfield and came close on a couple of occasions to adding a third for the home side, but his best effort, a 20-yard strike, was pushed on to the post by Turner's fingertip save.\nForest charge too late for impressive comeback\nBefore kick-off Forest manager Steve Cooper said he was still in the process of putting his team together, and it certainly looked that way in north London.\nThe visitors started with their top scorer from last season, Awoniyi, on the bench with doubts over his recovery from an ankle injury, but apart from Johnson's opening opportunity, chances were lacking and Forest had yet to have an attempt on target when the Nigeria striker was substituted on in the 71st minute.\nBut Awoniyi proved to be the spark Forest were missing, opening their account for the season when he fired home fellow substitute Anthony Elanga's square pass across the face of Arsenal's goal.\nDespite the seven minutes of injury time added on, Cooper's side failed to break down Arsenal's possession to add a second with Morgan Gibbs-White coming closest, but shooting over while stretching.\nFollow your Premier League club and get news sent direct to you\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nEdouard scored just five league goals last season, with Saturday's goal just his third goal in 24 league games for Palace.\n\"Odsonne's been excellent in pre-season,\" said Hodgson. \"I don't think we saw the best of him last season. In the 10 games I had at the end of the season we always thought the quality was there.\n\"What he's done for us in pre-season and today, that's what he's got. That's in his locker and it's really good to see him bringing that out.\n\"I hope today's game, not just the goal but his all-round play, will improve his confidence because if we can get him playing at that level week after week, I think we can be a handful for a lot of teams.\"\nPalace trio relish greater attacking role\nAlthough Palace failed to create any clear-cut chances in the first half, Edouard pounced early in the second before Foderingham kept United in the game.\nHodgson made the Eagles more attacking after succeeding Patrick Vieira in March and since Zaha's departure has brought in Brazilian forward Matheus Franca.\nThe 19-year-old was injured for the season opener, along with France Under-21 winger Michael Olise, but the form of Edouard, Ayew and new England international Eberechi Eze suggested they will relish having greater responsibility in the absence of Zaha.\nUnited are also rebuilding having sold two key players - Iliman Ndiaye and Sander Berge - since being last season's Championship runners-up.\nAfter Ndiaye's departure, manager Paul Heckingbottom said his squad was \"a long way off\", but on the eve of the new campaign he said the focus was \"going forward and attacking this season\", adding that the Blades \"can surprise a lot of people\".\nA spate of injuries also meant he started two 20-year-old forwards - Osula and summer signing Benie Traore.\nOsula almost made a dream start to his full United debut as his curling shot deflected narrowly wide and the young Dane fired into the side-netting on the break in the second half.\nBut otherwise the hosts created little as Palace dominated for most of the contest.\nAyew had a goal disallowed for offside while Edouard and Cheick Doucoure tested Foderingham, before Edouard made the breakthrough.\n\"We knew we'd be up against it, but I'm proud of the players and proud of the effort,\" said Heckingbottom.\n\"Palace deserve the win but there's nothing that scares us in this league, we just know we've got to get better from here on in.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nNo Toney, no problems\nThomas Frank's side know they will have to make do without key forward Toney until mid-January after he was banned for eight months for breaking Football Association betting rules.\nThe England forward was the third top goalscorer in the Premier League last season, behind Manchester City's Erling Haaland and Kane, but they are not showing any signs of missing him.\nBrentford won four of the five games they played without Toney last season and, in Mbeumo and Wissa, they have two competent forwards at this level.\nMbuemo took his penalty with aplomb as he wrong-footed Guglielmo Vicario, while Wissa diverted the ball over the line, albeit not with the cleanest strike of his career.\nIf Mbuemo and Wissa are the finishers, Henry is a potent supplier as he showed his blistering pace to torment Royal on several occasions.\nAs well as cruising on to his own touch past Royal to cut the ball back for Wissa's goal, he also did brilliantly to beat his man and find Mbuemo at the far post, with the striker unable to divert the ball past Vicario from close range.\nRicharlison struggles in central role\nGoalscoring pedigree is the most important feature of any team, and Kane's departure will have Spurs fans worried.\nKane leaves the Premier League as Tottenham's all-time top scorer with 280 goals in 435 appearances.\nHe leaves behind big boots to fill but, in the short term at least, Brazil forward Richarlison looks set to try and answer Postecoglou's call for goals.\nUnfortunately for Spurs and their fans, Richarlison did very little to ease their concerns as he cut an isolated figure. In a quiet first half, as Spurs dominated with 66% of possession, the forward touched the ball only 16 times.\nRomero was the only Spurs outfield player to touch the ball fewer times (10) before being taken off in the 14th minute.\nMaddison, whose arrival from Leicester over the summer was a big coup for Spurs, tried to roll the ball through early on but Richarlison was muscled out of the way and unable to cause a threat.\nThe same combination linked up in the second half, but this time Richarlison snatched at the shot and fired straight at Brentford's \u00a311m summer signing Mark Flekken in goal.\nTime will tell if Richarlison is Spurs' permanent answer to Kane.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nFollow Man Utd v Wolves here\nSir Alex says United need Hojlund fit\nIn the build-up to the game US broadcaster NBC was given a pitchside interview with Sir Alex Ferguson.\nThe legendary United boss praised the work Ten Hag is doing and said the situation for his old club would improve markedly once \u00a372m forward Rasmus Hojlund has recovered from the back injury he arrived from Atalanta with.\nNot long afterwards, Hojlund took his seat alongside Tom Heaton and Jonny Evans at the back of the directors' box.\nSir Alex's words were given added credence when the game started as Marcus Rashford failed to make any impact as the main striker and Alejandro Garnacho and Antony were equally muted on the flanks.\nPerhaps it should not have been a surprise given in 11 meetings over the past four years only twice have these two sides managed to produce more than a single goal between them.\nUnited's other new outfield recruit Mason Mount also failed to make an impact and in a game where so much of their offensive play was average, Fernandes' inspired pass to create the goal stood out.\nThe Old Trafford crowd do have a new hero in Onana though. The Cameroon keeper produced a conservative performance with the ball at his feet and did not venture too far from his goal when the home side pressed forward.\nHowever, the saves he made were important and the reception the former Ajax and Inter Milan man received from the stands indicated the home fans are very much on his side.\nDefiant Wolves still cannot find the net\nThat O'Neil spent the immediate seconds after the final whistle still unable to comprehend that his side were denied a penalty and the Wolves fans bellowed their support for their new manager and his team said everything about how the visitors played.\nO'Neil made a point of saying before the game that \"clubs normally get six weeks\" to prepare for their opening game.

Send us your views here\nSeagulls not deterred by disruption\nBrighton's summer has been dominated by outgoings, with midfielder Alexis Mac Allister having left for Liverpool, goalkeeper Robert Sanchez departed to Chelsea, and Ecuador international Caicedo seemingly also on his way to either Anfield or Stamford Bridge.\nAlthough this may only be one win, and against newly-promoted opposition, the start made by De Zerbi's side suggested that they can cope with significant losses again, as they have done in recent seasons.\nBrighton have built their success since earning promotion in 2017 on superb recruitment, allowing them to seamlessly replace those they sell, and the contributions made by Pedro and Adingra indicated the club may have struck gold again.\nPedro made a wasteful start but threatened regularly in the second half before deservedly getting his goal when he scored a soft penalty that was awarded to him after Lockyer put his arm across the Brazilian in the box.\nWinger Adingra was signed in the summer of 2022 and after an impressive loan spell at Belgian club Union Saint-Gilloise, also part-owned by Brighton chairman Tony Bloom, caught the eye in pre-season and was lively after replacing March in the 74th minute here.\nDespite the outgoings, Brighton still have a dependable core, only added to by the arrival of the experienced and versatile James Milner who made a solid debut at right-back.\nMarch, who came through the academy and has now played 276 times for the Seagulls, was a threat throughout while Ferguson's goal gives him the perfect start as he attempts to build on a debut season that included finding the net six times.\nTougher tests will come but this was an impressive start.\nMistakes cost Luton\nLuton have taken a measured approach since securing their top flight status.\nSix new signings were handed debuts on the south coast - goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski, wing-backs Ryan Giles and Issa Kabore, midfielder Tahith Chong, centre-back Mads Andersen and striker Jacob Brown - but their summer spending has totalled just \u00a317m.\nThere were reasons to be positive for the Hatters. Their direct approach meant Brighton were threatened by crosses into the box and centre-forward Morris had forced a good save from Jason Steele before his spot-kick goal.\nBut, though it may be clich\u00e9 to say it, at Premier League level their mistakes will likely be punished.\nAmari'i Bell was caught under the ball when March headed in Kaoru Mitoma's cross and Mpanzu gifted Adingra his goal when trying to play out from his own box.\nMidfielder Mpanzu has been with Luton since their time outside the Football League, which came as recently as 2014, and in playing at Amex Stadium he became the first player to feature for the same club in each of England's top five leagues.\nThe Luton players were still warmly applauded by their vociferous travelling support at the final whistle.\n\"I don't want anyone to be happy about losing football matches - we're certainly not,\" manager Rob Edwards said.\n\"[But} I was pleased with stuff I saw today. I know we're going to get better, but we've got to get better quickly.\n\"I thought we were right in the game at 1-0 and at 2-1 but we shot ourselves in the foot.\"\nVisit our dedicated Brighton page\nGo straight to the best Luton content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

The connection from day one has been fantastic.\"\n'Caicedo perfect for Chelsea but no panic for Liverpool' - analysis\nHow did you rate Chelsea's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Liverpool's display? Send us your views here\nSalah's surprise exit\nWhen Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp made the surprise decision to replace Salah after 77 minutes the forward made little attempt to disguise his unhappiness.\nSalah had shown his usual magic in the first half, hitting the bar then producing a brushstroke of genius to set up Diaz's opener.\nAs a result, there were plenty of quizzical looks as he made his way to the technical area, shaking his head and throwing his wrist strapping to the turf as he did so.\nKlopp said: \"I can understand because if Mo scored it would have been a new record for goals scored in the opening game but I didn't think about that.\n\"We needed stability and we needed fresh legs. It was super intense for everybody. That's all I can say about it. His reaction was absolutely OK.\"\nSalah was part of a potent Liverpool attacking display but it was clear in this game why Klopp is keen to add a midfield shield of security in the shape of Caicedo or Southampton's Romeo Lavia.\nFor all Liverpool's threat going forward, and substitute Darwin Nunez almost won it with a deflected shot in the last few seconds, Liverpool looked vulnerable at the back.\nThe visitors will nevertheless be reasonably happy with a point, although they thought they had made it 2-0 when Salah scored in the first half before it was ruled out for offside by VAR.\nHowever the flaws Klopp is trying to address remain obvious, and at least one more midfield signing seems certain before the transfer window closes.\nLiverpool were angry they did not receive a penalty for a handball against Jackson but a point was probably what they deserved.\n\"We scored a super first goal, scored a sensational second goal that was unfortunately offside,\" said Klopp.\n\"If you ask me if I was completely happy with the game, then no, but I saw enough that we are a step further in the right direction.\n\"We had our moments. It was a super intense game, a wild game in moments. We should have controlled it more but couldn't.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Hull played him at centre-forward so it's not me trying to be a genius.\"\nHow did you rate Bournemouth's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of West Ham's display? Send us your views here\nPleasing aspects for both managers\nThis was a meeting of old and new.\nWest Ham's only summer signing, Edson Alvarez from Ajax, is sidelined. James Ward-Prowse and Harry Maguire are expected to complete \u00a330m moves from Southampton and Manchester United respectively, but those deals have not gone through yet.\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, whose job seemed under threat last season until leading them to their first trophy in a generation, remains in charge.\nMichail Antonio, 33, led the line up front - a year after it looked like he was going to be phased out in favour of Gianluca Scamacca, who returned to Italy to join Atalanta after one season in London.\nWest Ham were without former captain Declan Rice, who joined Arsenal for \u00a3100m this summer. Paqueta started even though City are trying to sign him.\nSoucek had their first chance, ghosting in behind the defence and on to Said Benrahma's ball before his shot hit the far post.\nSoucek headed over twice from Bowen corners, while Benrahma flashed a shot over from long range.\nThe goal eventually came when Soucek found Bowen, who curled a fine shot home.\nPaqueta almost won the game for West Ham but his effort from 16 yards hit the post.\nBournemouth, on the other hand, have their third manager in a year in charge, with ex-Rayo Vallecano boss Iraola working in England for the first time. He replaced the sacked Gary O'Neil in the summer.\nIraola was known in Spain for direct attacking football, with full-backs heavily involved, and he gave debuts to summer signings Max Aarons and Milos Kerkez in the two full-back slots.\nThey showed good signs in this game, with David Brooks forcing two fine saves with strong efforts from long range and Rothwell hitting the bar from outside the box.\nSo it was probably fair enough when Semenyo's shot hit Soucek and landed to Solanke. He went past the keeper before levelling the scores.\nBournemouth reportedly rejected an offer\n, external\nfrom West Ham for Solanke a week ago.\nThey brought on Dutch winger Justin Kluivert in the second half and the summer signing from Roma joined a select group of players.\nHe is the fourth player to feature in each of Europe's top five leagues - the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A - after Florin Raducioiu, Christian Poulsen and Steven Jovetic.\nIraola told BBC Sport: \"The game was quite level. We didn't play well especially the beginning of each half; they were better than us.\n\"We improved during both halves and finished better than them. We had more of the ball but didn't have so many clear chances. A draw is quite fair.\n\"Obviously [we are] a work in progress. We were slow moving the ball in the first half. Our defenders have to move it much faster higher up the pitch.\n\"Joe took more responsibility in the build-up. We were finding our forwards better through the wings. We're still working on it.\n\"More players will come but we have to wait. These three weeks are strange - we don't know what will happen.\"\nMoyes said: \"It was a wee bit huff and puff at times. The first game of season, you're never sure. One point isn't bad but for long periods it looked like we'd win.\n\"We looked well organised. We played only at certain times. Jarrod scored a good goal.\"\nOn Paqueta's future, Moyes said: \"There's a price on everyone's head. We don't want Lucas to go, it's as simple as that.\n\"But sometimes it's difficult to say to these boys 'you can't join Manchester City or Real Madrid', the biggest clubs in the world.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Spurs' display? Send us your views here\nNo Toney, no problems\nThomas Frank's side know they will have to make do without key forward Toney until mid-January after he was banned for eight months for breaking Football Association betting rules.\nThe England forward was the third top goalscorer in the Premier League last season, behind Manchester City's Erling Haaland and Kane, but they are not showing any signs of missing him.\nBrentford won four of the five games they played without Toney last season and, in Mbeumo and Wissa, they have two competent forwards at this level.\nMbuemo took his penalty with aplomb as he wrong-footed Guglielmo Vicario, while Wissa diverted the ball over the line, albeit not with the cleanest strike of his career.\nIf Mbuemo and Wissa are the finishers, Henry is a potent supplier as he showed his blistering pace to torment Royal on several occasions.\nAs well as cruising on to his own touch past Royal to cut the ball back for Wissa's goal, he also did brilliantly to beat his man and find Mbuemo at the far post, with the striker unable to divert the ball past Vicario from close range.\nRicharlison struggles in central role\nGoalscoring pedigree is the most important feature of any team, and Kane's departure will have Spurs fans worried.\nKane leaves the Premier League as Tottenham's all-time top scorer with 280 goals in 435 appearances.\nHe leaves behind big boots to fill but, in the short term at least, Brazil forward Richarlison looks set to try and answer Postecoglou's call for goals.\nUnfortunately for Spurs and their fans, Richarlison did very little to ease their concerns as he cut an isolated figure. In a quiet first half, as Spurs dominated with 66% of possession, the forward touched the ball only 16 times.\nRomero was the only Spurs outfield player to touch the ball fewer times (10) before being taken off in the 14th minute.\nMaddison, whose arrival from Leicester over the summer was a big coup for Spurs, tried to roll the ball through early on but Richarlison was muscled out of the way and unable to cause a threat.\nThe same combination linked up in the second half, but this time Richarlison snatched at the shot and fired straight at Brentford's \u00a311m summer signing Mark Flekken in goal.\nTime will tell if Richarlison is Spurs' permanent answer to Kane.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

The Cameroon keeper produced a conservative performance with the ball at his feet and did not venture too far from his goal when the home side pressed forward.\nHowever, the saves he made were important and the reception the former Ajax and Inter Milan man received from the stands indicated the home fans are very much on his side.\nDefiant Wolves still cannot find the net\nThat O'Neil spent the immediate seconds after the final whistle still unable to comprehend that his side were denied a penalty and the Wolves fans bellowed their support for their new manager and his team said everything about how the visitors played.\nO'Neil made a point of saying before the game that \"clubs normally get six weeks\" to prepare for their opening game.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester City's display?

He spent the summer recovering from the serious hamstring injury that forced him out of the Champions League final win over Inter Milan after only 36 minutes and looked crestfallen as he walked off here.\nCity will hope the injury to such a key player, who had already created the opening goal for Haaland, is not serious - as the rest of their opening Premier League night played out satisfactorily.\nBurnley can take heart despite defeat\nBurnley were presented with the toughest possible start to life back in the Premier League as manager Vincent Kompany tried to plot the downfall of the Treble winners and the club where he became an iconic figure as the inspirational captain during their glory years.\nThe result was locked in after City went ahead early but Burnley showed real spirit and character, even creating anxious moments for Guardiola's side as Lyle Foster and Zeki Amdouni threatened.\nIn the end, they were undone by some loose defending but more specifically by the predatory instincts and natural goalscoring prowess of Haaland - and they will not be the last to suffer that fate this season.\nBurnley stuck to Kompany's passing methods, which made them such impressive winners of the Championship last season, while Trafford, the goalkeeping hero of England's European Under-21 Championship triumph in July, made an impressive debut against his former club.\nKompany's players got an early taste of what will be required this season but this was the most exacting examination of all and, even though they lost, there will still be plenty to encourage them.\nSome booing was heard when the players took the knee before kick-off and Burnley removed a fan from Turf Moor after City defender Rico Lewis was struck with an object.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Hull played him at centre-forward so it's not me trying to be a genius.\"\nHow did you rate Bournemouth's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of West Ham's display? Send us your views here\nPleasing aspects for both managers\nThis was a meeting of old and new.\nWest Ham's only summer signing, Edson Alvarez from Ajax, is sidelined. James Ward-Prowse and Harry Maguire are expected to complete \u00a330m moves from Southampton and Manchester United respectively, but those deals have not gone through yet.\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, whose job seemed under threat last season until leading them to their first trophy in a generation, remains in charge.\nMichail Antonio, 33, led the line up front - a year after it looked like he was going to be phased out in favour of Gianluca Scamacca, who returned to Italy to join Atalanta after one season in London.\nWest Ham were without former captain Declan Rice, who joined Arsenal for \u00a3100m this summer. Paqueta started even though City are trying to sign him.\nSoucek had their first chance, ghosting in behind the defence and on to Said Benrahma's ball before his shot hit the far post.\nSoucek headed over twice from Bowen corners, while Benrahma flashed a shot over from long range.\nThe goal eventually came when Soucek found Bowen, who curled a fine shot home.\nPaqueta almost won the game for West Ham but his effort from 16 yards hit the post.\nBournemouth, on the other hand, have their third manager in a year in charge, with ex-Rayo Vallecano boss Iraola working in England for the first time. He replaced the sacked Gary O'Neil in the summer.\nIraola was known in Spain for direct attacking football, with full-backs heavily involved, and he gave debuts to summer signings Max Aarons and Milos Kerkez in the two full-back slots.\nThey showed good signs in this game, with David Brooks forcing two fine saves with strong efforts from long range and Rothwell hitting the bar from outside the box.\nSo it was probably fair enough when Semenyo's shot hit Soucek and landed to Solanke. He went past the keeper before levelling the scores.\nBournemouth reportedly rejected an offer\n, external\nfrom West Ham for Solanke a week ago.\nThey brought on Dutch winger Justin Kluivert in the second half and the summer signing from Roma joined a select group of players.\nHe is the fourth player to feature in each of Europe's top five leagues - the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A - after Florin Raducioiu, Christian Poulsen and Steven Jovetic.\nIraola told BBC Sport: \"The game was quite level. We didn't play well especially the beginning of each half; they were better than us.\n\"We improved during both halves and finished better than them. We had more of the ball but didn't have so many clear chances. A draw is quite fair.\n\"Obviously [we are] a work in progress. We were slow moving the ball in the first half. Our defenders have to move it much faster higher up the pitch.\n\"Joe took more responsibility in the build-up. We were finding our forwards better through the wings. We're still working on it.\n\"More players will come but we have to wait. These three weeks are strange - we don't know what will happen.\"\nMoyes said: \"It was a wee bit huff and puff at times. The first game of season, you're never sure. One point isn't bad but for long periods it looked like we'd win.\n\"We looked well organised. We played only at certain times. Jarrod scored a good goal.\"\nOn Paqueta's future, Moyes said: \"There's a price on everyone's head. We don't want Lucas to go, it's as simple as that.\n\"But sometimes it's difficult to say to these boys 'you can't join Manchester City or Real Madrid', the biggest clubs in the world.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Send us your views here\nSalah's surprise exit\nWhen Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp made the surprise decision to replace Salah after 77 minutes the forward made little attempt to disguise his unhappiness.\nSalah had shown his usual magic in the first half, hitting the bar then producing a brushstroke of genius to set up Diaz's opener.\nAs a result, there were plenty of quizzical looks as he made his way to the technical area, shaking his head and throwing his wrist strapping to the turf as he did so.\nKlopp said: \"I can understand because if Mo scored it would have been a new record for goals scored in the opening game but I didn't think about that.\n\"We needed stability and we needed fresh legs. It was super intense for everybody. That's all I can say about it. His reaction was absolutely OK.\"\nSalah was part of a potent Liverpool attacking display but it was clear in this game why Klopp is keen to add a midfield shield of security in the shape of Caicedo or Southampton's Romeo Lavia.\nFor all Liverpool's threat going forward, and substitute Darwin Nunez almost won it with a deflected shot in the last few seconds, Liverpool looked vulnerable at the back.\nThe visitors will nevertheless be reasonably happy with a point, although they thought they had made it 2-0 when Salah scored in the first half before it was ruled out for offside by VAR.\nHowever the flaws Klopp is trying to address remain obvious, and at least one more midfield signing seems certain before the transfer window closes.\nLiverpool were angry they did not receive a penalty for a handball against Jackson but a point was probably what they deserved.\n\"We scored a super first goal, scored a sensational second goal that was unfortunately offside,\" said Klopp.\n\"If you ask me if I was completely happy with the game, then no, but I saw enough that we are a step further in the right direction.\n\"We had our moments. It was a super intense game, a wild game in moments. We should have controlled it more but couldn't.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

In the 10 games I had at the end of the season we always thought the quality was there.\n\"What he's done for us in pre-season and today, that's what he's got. That's in his locker and it's really good to see him bringing that out.\n\"I hope today's game, not just the goal but his all-round play, will improve his confidence because if we can get him playing at that level week after week, I think we can be a handful for a lot of teams.\"\nPalace trio relish greater attacking role\nAlthough Palace failed to create any clear-cut chances in the first half, Edouard pounced early in the second before Foderingham kept United in the game.\nHodgson made the Eagles more attacking after succeeding Patrick Vieira in March and since Zaha's departure has brought in Brazilian forward Matheus Franca.\nThe 19-year-old was injured for the season opener, along with France Under-21 winger Michael Olise, but the form of Edouard, Ayew and new England international Eberechi Eze suggested they will relish having greater responsibility in the absence of Zaha.\nUnited are also rebuilding having sold two key players - Iliman Ndiaye and Sander Berge - since being last season's Championship runners-up.\nAfter Ndiaye's departure, manager Paul Heckingbottom said his squad was \"a long way off\", but on the eve of the new campaign he said the focus was \"going forward and attacking this season\", adding that the Blades \"can surprise a lot of people\".\nA spate of injuries also meant he started two 20-year-old forwards - Osula and summer signing Benie Traore.\nOsula almost made a dream start to his full United debut as his curling shot deflected narrowly wide and the young Dane fired into the side-netting on the break in the second half.\nBut otherwise the hosts created little as Palace dominated for most of the contest.\nAyew had a goal disallowed for offside while Edouard and Cheick Doucoure tested Foderingham, before Edouard made the breakthrough.\n\"We knew we'd be up against it, but I'm proud of the players and proud of the effort,\" said Heckingbottom.\n\"Palace deserve the win but there's nothing that scares us in this league, we just know we've got to get better from here on in.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Send us your views here\nArsenal off to perfect start\nAfter a disappointing end to last season, Arsenal's opening weekend win helps them gather more momentum to add to their Community Shield win over Manchester City at Wembley last weekend.\nThe Gunners led the Premier League for 248 days last season but their challenge fell apart in the closing stages as City overtook them to claim the title as part of a Treble, along with the Champions League and FA Cup.\nArsenal's big summer signings Declan Rice, Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber all started again for Mikel Arteta, having made their competitive debuts in the Community Shield, but it was Gabriel Martinelli who looked the liveliest in the opening stages.\nThe Brazilian winger darted in and out of the Forest defence to create the goalscoring opportunity for Nketiah, who netted his first goal since January when his shot took the slightest of deflections off Joe Worrall to send Turner the wrong way.\nEight minutes later, Saka's quality shone through when he received the ball on the edge of the penalty area, cut inside and fired home Arsenal's second.\nHowever, Arsenal's afternoon was marred when Timber, signed from Ajax for \u00a334m last month, limped off the pitch and was replaced by Takehiro Tomiyasu in the 50th minute with what appeared to be a calf injury.\nRice, a \u00a3100m signing from West Ham, was effective in the Arsenal midfield and came close on a couple of occasions to adding a third for the home side, but his best effort, a 20-yard strike, was pushed on to the post by Turner's fingertip save.\nForest charge too late for impressive comeback\nBefore kick-off Forest manager Steve Cooper said he was still in the process of putting his team together, and it certainly looked that way in north London.\nThe visitors started with their top scorer from last season, Awoniyi, on the bench with doubts over his recovery from an ankle injury, but apart from Johnson's opening opportunity, chances were lacking and Forest had yet to have an attempt on target when the Nigeria striker was substituted on in the 71st minute.\nBut Awoniyi proved to be the spark Forest were missing, opening their account for the season when he fired home fellow substitute Anthony Elanga's square pass across the face of Arsenal's goal.\nDespite the seven minutes of injury time added on, Cooper's side failed to break down Arsenal's possession to add a second with Morgan Gibbs-White coming closest, but shooting over while stretching.\nFollow your Premier League club and get news sent direct to you\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nA poor start for new Chelsea manager Pochettino\nChelsea have spent more than \u00a3900m since American businessman Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital bought the club in May 2022 yet have just one point from their first two competitive games under new manager Pochettino.\nTwo of the club's biggest outlays during that lavish period of spending had an afternoon to forget at London Stadium.\nFernandez, whose \u00a3107m move from Benfica in February is the British transfer record that Caicedo could potentially break, wasted the perfect chance to score his first Chelsea goal.\nEngland winger Raheem Sterling was a constant threat for Chelsea and he was brought down by Tomas Soucek in the penalty area but Fernandez's spot-kick was saved by Areola diving to his right.\nCaicedo chose to join Chelsea over Liverpool on Monday, but it was an uncertain start for him in Chelsea colours - including needing Blues goalkeeper Robert Sanchez to make a good save after the debutant had given the ball away to Pablo Fornals.\nMoments later Caicedo then conceded a penalty and, unlike Fernandez, Paqueta converted it as West Ham maintained the unbeaten start to the season that gives them four points from their opening two matches.\nBrazil playmaker Paqueta has been linked with a transfer but his potential move to Manchester City has been put on hold after it was revealed he is being investigated by the Football Association for potential betting rule breaches.\nImpressive Ward-Prowse enjoys 'special day'\nWest Ham were playing at home for the first time since beating Fiorentina 2-1 in June to win the Europa Conference League - the Hammers' first piece of silverware since 1980.\nThe trophy was on display at London Stadium before the match, but the man who lifted the trophy, England midfielder Declan Rice, is no longer at the club having joined Arsenal in a \u00a3100m deal in July.\nHis replacement James Ward-Prowse, whose \u00a330m move from Southampton was confirmed on Monday, impressed his new supporters as he registered two assists - the corner for Aguerd's header then the pass through for Antonio to score the Hammers' second.\n\"It was a dream debut for me on a personal note, just a direct free-kick was missing,\" Ward-Prowse told Sky Sports.\n\"Everyone knows the impact Declan Rice had for this club, I have to show what James Ward-Prowse can bring to the club and that's my mentality.\n\"It is a special day and the first of hopefully many more to come.\"",

Their direct approach meant Brighton were threatened by crosses into the box and centre-forward Morris had forced a good save from Jason Steele before his spot-kick goal.\nBut, though it may be clich\u00e9 to say it, at Premier League level their mistakes will likely be punished.\nAmari'i Bell was caught under the ball when March headed in Kaoru Mitoma's cross and Mpanzu gifted Adingra his goal when trying to play out from his own box.\nMidfielder Mpanzu has been with Luton since their time outside the Football League, which came as recently as 2014, and in playing at Amex Stadium he became the first player to feature for the same club in each of England's top five leagues.\nThe Luton players were still warmly applauded by their vociferous travelling support at the final whistle.\n\"I don't want anyone to be happy about losing football matches - we're certainly not,\" manager Rob Edwards said.\n\"[But} I was pleased with stuff I saw today. I know we're going to get better, but we've got to get better quickly.\n\"I thought we were right in the game at 1-0 and at 2-1 but we shot ourselves in the foot.\"\nVisit our dedicated Brighton page\nGo straight to the best Luton content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nHome comforts for Forest as Awoniyi proves his worth\nThe home form of Nottingham Forest was a huge factor in Steve Cooper's side remaining in the league last season.\nIt may be key again this time around. A dominant first half showing in front of a raucous crowd should have produced more than one goal with Brennan Johnson looking particularly lively on the counter-attack.\nAwoniyi's headed goal meant he became only the second Forest player to score in six consecutive league games, following Stan Collymore, who did so in 1995.\nBut it was the player replacing him who gave Forest the win.\nWood came on in the 83rd minute and scored six minutes later to keep up Forest's fine form at the City Ground. Taking in the end of last season, this was their fourth successive home league win - the first time they have managed that in the top flight since 1996.\n\"We played the real football in the game, the real tactical ideas. In the end, we've scored two really good goals,\" manager Cooper said.\n\"The boys showed good quality with the crossing and headers.\n\"You don't get many chances in this league. But we could have created some more. But we scored two. It's important to get the first win of the season.\"\nSheffield United unlucky not to draw\nGoing a goal down after just two minutes certainly wasn't ideal for United but Paul Heckingbottom's side managed to stay in the game - and responded well after half-time.\nUnited were on the attack as soon as the second half began, with Anel Ahmedhodzic having a shot deflected out for a corner.\nAnother corner followed and was not properly cleared, allowing Hamer to unleash a superb strike from the edge of the area to draw United level.\nBenie Traore had a golden opportunity when through on goal but was denied by the glove of Forest keeper Matt Turner.\nThe American positioned himself well to narrow the angle and stop United going in front in what proved to be a vital moment. Traore went off injured with less than 10 minutes remaining but was a bright spark throughout for the Blades.\nDespite conceding late on, United's second-half performance was much improved and gives them something to build on when they host defending champions Manchester City next weekend.\n\"From 20 minutes in, we were very good and played really well. I was delighted with the second-half performance,\" manager Heckingbottom said.\n\"We more than matched them after 20 minutes. That was the performance we wanted to see.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester City's display? Send us your views here\nMan City have just too much\nManchester City showed inevitable signs of rust even though they started their campaign with a win - as was proved by the animated behaviour of perfectionist manager Pep Guardiola.\nIf goal machine Haaland was expecting a congratulatory arm around the shoulder from his manager as he walked off at half-time, he received a rude awakening when he received an intense lecture from Guardiola, who demanded a cameraman move out of range as he spoke to the striker.\nHe clearly wanted even more from Haaland, who showed his lethal economy by scoring twice from only six touches in the first half.\nIt sounds ludicrous to suggest Haaland was often on the periphery of the action but such is his brilliance in front of goal that he still makes the decisive contribution and built the platform for what turned into a routine victory for the champions.\nKovacic slipped smoothly into the action as replacement for De Bruyne but the Belgian's recurring injury problems will be a real source of concern for Guardiola and City. He spent the summer recovering from the serious hamstring injury that forced him out of the Champions League final win over Inter Milan after only 36 minutes and looked crestfallen as he walked off here.\nCity will hope the injury to such a key player, who had already created the opening goal for Haaland, is not serious - as the rest of their opening Premier League night played out satisfactorily.\nBurnley can take heart despite defeat\nBurnley were presented with the toughest possible start to life back in the Premier League as manager Vincent Kompany tried to plot the downfall of the Treble winners and the club where he became an iconic figure as the inspirational captain during their glory years.\nThe result was locked in after City went ahead early but Burnley showed real spirit and character, even creating anxious moments for Guardiola's side as Lyle Foster and Zeki Amdouni threatened.\nIn the end, they were undone by some loose defending but more specifically by the predatory instincts and natural goalscoring prowess of Haaland - and they will not be the last to suffer that fate this season.\nBurnley stuck to Kompany's passing methods, which made them such impressive winners of the Championship last season, while Trafford, the goalkeeping hero of England's European Under-21 Championship triumph in July, made an impressive debut against his former club.\nKompany's players got an early taste of what will be required this season but this was the most exacting examination of all and, even though they lost, there will still be plenty to encourage them.\nSome booing was heard when the players took the knee before kick-off and Burnley removed a fan from Turf Moor after City defender Rico Lewis was struck with an object.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here\nBailey and Diaby impress for Villa\nIn this fixture last season, former England team-mates Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard were in the dugout for their respective sides.\nBoth teams changed their managers during the campaign, but it is clear which team has been helped most by their decision.\nSpaniard Emery has done a remarkable job since being appointed in October, dragging Villa away from the relegation zone to a European finish last term.\nWhile Emery's side were taken apart by the Magpies in their opener, they did the same to Everton at their Villa Park fortress - collecting an eighth consecutive win on their own turf.\nBailey weaved his magic from the left wing, giving Ashley Young a torrid time on his return to his former club, while club record signing Diaby looks to have fitted in seamlessly and was equally impressive in the final third.\nOnce McGinn put the hosts ahead, there was only going to be one winner.\nLuiz and Bailey extended Villa's advantage before Colombian Duran netted his first for the club minutes after coming on as a substitute to add gloss to an emphatic victory.\nCalvert-Lewin's injury woes continue\nEverton escaped relegation by the skin of their teeth on the final day of last season and the early signs suggest this could be another season of struggle for the Toffees.\nThey have lost both their opening games without scoring to sink to the bottom of the table.\nBeaten by Fulham in their first game having missed numerous chances, Everton were demolished by Villa who took full advantage of defensive lapses on a scorching day in the Midlands.\nStricken striker Calvert-Lewin was fit to start but lasted only 36 minutes as he came off with a facial injury sustained earlier in the game during a collision with goalkeeper Martinez.\nThe Englishman has completed 90 minutes just four times in the league since the start of last season and with Neal Maupay out of form and summer signing Youssef Chermiti not yet fit, Everton desperately need to find goals from somewhere.\nDanjuma looked lively after coming on for Calvert-Lewin, but missed a golden chance on the stroke of half-time when his low shot was kept out by Martinez, the best opportunity the visitors managed to fashion.\nUp next for Everton is a huge match next Saturday against fellow winless side Wolves, who have also lost both of their games so far."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Sheff Utd's display? Send us your views here\nHome comforts for Forest as Awoniyi proves his worth\nThe home form of Nottingham Forest was a huge factor in Steve Cooper's side remaining in the league last season.\nIt may be key again this time around. A dominant first half showing in front of a raucous crowd should have produced more than one goal with Brennan Johnson looking particularly lively on the counter-attack.\nAwoniyi's headed goal meant he became only the second Forest player to score in six consecutive league games, following Stan Collymore, who did so in 1995.\nBut it was the player replacing him who gave Forest the win.\nWood came on in the 83rd minute and scored six minutes later to keep up Forest's fine form at the City Ground. Taking in the end of last season, this was their fourth successive home league win - the first time they have managed that in the top flight since 1996.\n\"We played the real football in the game, the real tactical ideas. In the end, we've scored two really good goals,\" manager Cooper said.\n\"The boys showed good quality with the crossing and headers.\n\"You don't get many chances in this league. But we could have created some more. But we scored two. It's important to get the first win of the season.\"\nSheffield United unlucky not to draw\nGoing a goal down after just two minutes certainly wasn't ideal for United but Paul Heckingbottom's side managed to stay in the game - and responded well after half-time.\nUnited were on the attack as soon as the second half began, with Anel Ahmedhodzic having a shot deflected out for a corner.\nAnother corner followed and was not properly cleared, allowing Hamer to unleash a superb strike from the edge of the area to draw United level.\nBenie Traore had a golden opportunity when through on goal but was denied by the glove of Forest keeper Matt Turner.\nThe American positioned himself well to narrow the angle and stop United going in front in what proved to be a vital moment. Traore went off injured with less than 10 minutes remaining but was a bright spark throughout for the Blades.\nDespite conceding late on, United's second-half performance was much improved and gives them something to build on when they host defending champions Manchester City next weekend.\n\"From 20 minutes in, we were very good and played really well. I was delighted with the second-half performance,\" manager Heckingbottom said.\n\"We more than matched them after 20 minutes. That was the performance we wanted to see. The new players could see it.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Pochettino has spoken to the forward throughout this pre-season and the beginning of the campaign as he looks to get the best out of him - which seems to be having the desired effect.\nSterling's opening goal showed exactly why he is a key part of Gareth Southgate's England squad when fully fit. He has not been in the past two Three Lions squads because of fitness issues, but it seems likely he will be included following his start to this season when the latest squad is named next week.\nHis second goal against Luton showed his calmness when in dangerous positions, and the pass for Jackson's goal highlighted his quality.\nIf Chelsea are to get back to the top end of the table Sterling will be key to their hopes, as he is by far the most experienced and proven attacker they possess.\n\"If I'm 100% at something, I know what I can do and that's what I'm doing this year - just 100% focus on scoring goals and helping my team,\" said Sterling.\n\"I want to get back to being obsessed with football. Just football 24/7 and nothing else and focus on top performances and goals and assists.\"\nChelsea manager Pochettino also spoke to Sky Sports and said of Sterling's performance: \"He played with freedom on the pitch. We know what he is capable of.\n\"We are pleased for him.

I can't speak highly enough of the fans and the people that have helped me settle,\" the England midfielder added.\nAs Brighton pushed after the restart West Ham exploited the space their players left behind, and Bowen brilliantly controlled Benrahma's cross-field ball in a counter-attack before finding the bottom corner.\nFive minutes later the three points were wrapped up thanks to Antonio's fine finish after creating space for himself. The Jamaica international almost added a fourth in the closing stages but prodded a shot over when through on goal.\nWard-Prowse also had a chance to add a fourth late on, but his shot from a tight-angle was saved before the rebound off a Brighton defender hit the cross bar.\n\"Today was a well-deserved three points,\" Moyes told BBC Match of the Day. \"All the forward players had a really good contribution.\"\nVisit our dedicated Brighton page\nGo straight to the best West Ham content\nWatch: The Football News Show on Brighton's hopes\nBrighton lack ruthless touch\nBrighton finished the match with 79% of possession but, despite scoring four goals in each of their last two matches, initially struggled to trouble West Ham keeper Alphonse Areola.\n\"It can happen in football. I am really frustrated for the result but not for the performance,\" said Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi to BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We made some crucial and important mistakes for the first and third goals. We could be more clinical but when you concede the first goal, the space becomes smaller and it is more difficult.\"\nBrighton's best chance at finding a way back into the game came just after the restart when Areola dived to his left to keep out an Evan Ferguson header with Brighton one goal down.\nThe Seagulls rallied after going three down and scored in the 81st minute as Gross' driven shot from the edge of the box found the bottom corner.\nThat sparked a flurry of chances for De Zerbi's men, with Joel Veltman's volley forcing a fine save from Areola and the hosts having a penalty shout turned down after the ball was deemed to have accidentally struck West Ham's Vladimir Coufal's arm in the box.\nIn injury time Ferguson blasted a fierce shot which was only just tipped on to the bar by Areola, but by that stage defeat was inevitable and Brighton fell to their first loss to West Ham in 13 Premier League matches."

Those three points for us are very important.\"\nVilla looked dangerous every time they came forward and their strong start saw Cash's double come in the opening 20 minutes, having last scored for Villa in May 2022.\nBut it was Diaby - a club-record buy from Bayer Leverkusen - who was the standout player again. A constant threat in the final third, the French winger scored one goal and set up another.\nDiaby could have had a further assist when he laid the ball on for Watkins inside the six-yard box, but the England striker fired his effort straight at James Trafford.\nOn-loan midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo came off the bench and should have scored on his debut, but saw his shot deflect wide when running through on goal and Watkins unmarked in support. The glaring miss, though, did not prove costly on this occasion.\n'Learning comes at a price' - Kompany\nBurnley followed up their opening-day defeat by champions Manchester City with another home loss - already more than they suffered in the entirety of their Championship-winning run last season.\nThey have also lost back-to-back games at the start of a campaign for the third consecutive season and will need to improve in both defence and attack if they are to avoid an immediate return to the second tier.\nConceding early goals is proving to be a problem for Kompany's side and, although they did pull a goal back through South African frontman Foster, they were mostly disjointed in the final third.\nSummer signing Zeki Amdouni fired an effort over and debutant defender Hannes Delcroix's header forced Villa stand-in keeper Robin Olsen into a decent stop, but the home side were outplayed for large periods.\nKompany said: \"Learning comes at a price in the Premier League. You can see the quality of the Aston Villa team when they took their chances, credit to them.\n\"We didn't start the game badly at all, but didn't manage to get a real grip on the game. Villa were always a threat on the counter, we created moments and chances and but momentum in the second half and the goal helped us for that.\n\"We conceded a goal at the height of the momentum, a very good side who are very well coached. We are there in parts but we will have to learn from it when you get punished.\n\"You play against a very good side and everything happens a bit faster.

Pochettino has spoken to the forward throughout this pre-season and the beginning of the campaign as he looks to get the best out of him - which seems to be having the desired effect.\nSterling's opening goal showed exactly why he is a key part of Gareth Southgate's England squad when fully fit. He has not been in the past two Three Lions squads because of fitness issues, but it seems likely he will be included following his start to this season when the latest squad is named next week.\nHis second goal against Luton showed his calmness when in dangerous positions, and the pass for Jackson's goal highlighted his quality.\nIf Chelsea are to get back to the top end of the table Sterling will be key to their hopes, as he is by far the most experienced and proven attacker they possess.\n\"If I'm 100% at something, I know what I can do and that's what I'm doing this year - just 100% focus on scoring goals and helping my team,\" said Sterling.\n\"I want to get back to being obsessed with football. Just football 24/7 and nothing else and focus on top performances and goals and assists.\"\nChelsea manager Pochettino also spoke to Sky Sports and said of Sterling's performance: \"He played with freedom on the pitch. We know what he is capable of.\n\"We are pleased for him. He needs to keep going and contribute more goals and assists to help the team to win.\"\nLuton show they will cause problems this season\nMuch was made of the players' pricetags before this match, with new Chelsea signing Caicedo costing more than the whole Luton squad.\nHowever, at times you could not tell the difference in budget with the threat Luton carried.\nIssa Kabore was dangerous down the right, and Luton's coaching team encouraged the full-back to run at Chilwell whenever he got the chance.\nTahith Chong flashed a shot high and wide after he nicked the ball from Caicedo, while Ryan Giles tested Sanchez in the Chelsea goal in the second half but they could not find a clear chance to score.\nThe Hatters showed again that they are an organised team that will cause sides in the Premier League problems, but Chelsea's superior quality saw them win comfortably.",

Send us your views here\nArsenal's defensive frailties on show again\nA resilient performance against Crystal Palace on Monday saw the Gunners end with 10 men but all three points; however, they swiftly fell behind against Fulham.\nPereira's finish meant Arsenal became the first team in Premier League history to concede a first-minute goal three times inside a calendar year.\nQuickfire strikes from Saka and Nketiah midway through the second half saw Arsenal surge into the lead. After winning the penalty for the equaliser, Vieira found space on the left to drive in a low cross for substitute Nketiah to finish.\nYet even with Arsenal having a man advantage for the closing minutes, they could not see out the game. Palhinha was left unmarked and punished sloppy defending to snatch a point for Marco Silva's team.\nIn games against Nottingham Forest and now Fulham, Arsenal have conceded in the last 15 minutes of the second half, with the defending that cost them towards the end of last season's title challenge still an issue.\nTakehiro Tomiyasu's red card at Palace meant Jakub Kiwior came into Mikel Arteta's home side, with Thomas Partey playing as a makeshift full-back, and it was clear to see the defence was unbalanced by the changes.\nAfter getting into their winning position, Arsenal switched off and were punished.\nResilient Fulham earn important point\nSilva's side were on their way to losing consecutive London derbies before Palhinha's late equaliser, having gone down to Brentford last time out.\nIt remains to be seen what the long-term impact is of losing last season's top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic to Al-Hilal, but Fulham at least began and ended this game in style.\nScoring twice at Emirates Stadium and taking a point sounds positive, and it could have been even better. Summer recruit Raul Jimenez sent an acrobatic volley just over the goal as he narrowly missed a chance to open his account for Fulham.\nThe away side had done well to restrict Arsenal to half-chances but then conceded twice in quick succession, and the game looked to be slipping away from them.\nThe Cottagers had been incensed by Arsenal's second goal, claiming Bassey was fouled near his own byeline by Saka. Silva was booked for his protestations.\nFormer Ajax defender Bassey was then shown a second yellow card with seven minutes remaining on his first start for the club.\nDespite going down to 10 men for the second game in a row, having had Tim Ream dismissed last week, Fulham persevered and left Gunners boss Arteta with plenty of food for thought."

I can't speak highly enough of the fans and the people that have helped me settle,\" the England midfielder added.\nAs Brighton pushed after the restart West Ham exploited the space their players left behind, and Bowen brilliantly controlled Benrahma's cross-field ball in a counter-attack before finding the bottom corner.\nFive minutes later the three points were wrapped up thanks to Antonio's fine finish after creating space for himself. The Jamaica international almost added a fourth in the closing stages but prodded a shot over when through on goal.\nWard-Prowse also had a chance to add a fourth late on, but his shot from a tight-angle was saved before the rebound off a Brighton defender hit the cross bar.\n\"Today was a well-deserved three points,\" Moyes told BBC Match of the Day. \"All the forward players had a really good contribution.\"\nVisit our dedicated Brighton page\nGo straight to the best West Ham content\nWatch: The Football News Show on Brighton's hopes\nBrighton lack ruthless touch\nBrighton finished the match with 79% of possession but, despite scoring four goals in each of their last two matches, initially struggled to trouble West Ham keeper Alphonse Areola.\n\"It can happen in football. I am really frustrated for the result but not for the performance,\" said Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi to BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We made some crucial and important mistakes for the first and third goals. We could be more clinical but when you concede the first goal, the space becomes smaller and it is more difficult.\"\nBrighton's best chance at finding a way back into the game came just after the restart when Areola dived to his left to keep out an Evan Ferguson header with Brighton one goal down.\nThe Seagulls rallied after going three down and scored in the 81st minute as Gross' driven shot from the edge of the box found the bottom corner.\nThat sparked a flurry of chances for De Zerbi's men, with Joel Veltman's volley forcing a fine save from Areola and the hosts having a penalty shout turned down after the ball was deemed to have accidentally struck West Ham's Vladimir Coufal's arm in the box.\nIn injury time Ferguson blasted a fierce shot which was only just tipped on to the bar by Areola, but by that stage defeat was inevitable and Brighton fell to their first loss to West Ham in 13 Premier League matches.",

Those three points for us are very important.\"\nVilla looked dangerous every time they came forward and their strong start saw Cash's double come in the opening 20 minutes, having last scored for Villa in May 2022.\nBut it was Diaby - a club-record buy from Bayer Leverkusen - who was the standout player again. A constant threat in the final third, the French winger scored one goal and set up another.\nDiaby could have had a further assist when he laid the ball on for Watkins inside the six-yard box, but the England striker fired his effort straight at James Trafford.\nOn-loan midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo came off the bench and should have scored on his debut, but saw his shot deflect wide when running through on goal and Watkins unmarked in support.

You can see the quality of the Aston Villa team when they took their chances, credit to them.\n\"We didn't start the game badly at all, but didn't manage to get a real grip on the game. Villa were always a threat on the counter, we created moments and chances and but momentum in the second half and the goal helped us for that.\n\"We conceded a goal at the height of the momentum, a very good side who are very well coached. We are there in parts but we will have to learn from it when you get punished.\n\"You play against a very good side and everything happens a bit faster. It is a tough league, the jump from Championship to Premier League is the highest in world football, the negative is the result.\n\"I have not seen anything that, with a bit of time and experience, we won't be able to fix.\""

The goal came from lovely movement deep on the left from Schade and the link-up in midfield was excellent.\nBut without Ivan Toney up front, they lacked the necessary focal point and they couldn't build on such a good foundation.\nYoane Wissa missed a good chance before half-time and wasn't able to capitalise on winning the ball high a couple of times, while Bryan Mbeumo couldn't get into the game.\nWith Toney changing agents this week amid speculation linking him with a move, perhaps this was a warning shot to Frank that more firepower could be required before the transfer window shuts next week.\nPalace battle after flat start\nRoy Hodgson's men are also in dire need of a striker after another rather toothless display overall, but the way they grew into the game as it went on shows their Premier League nous.\nIt was a frustrating afternoon for Eze who continues to be Palace's shining light since Wilfried Zaha departed in the summer. Michael Olise and Matheus Franca remain out injured.\nInterest from Manchester City in Eze will do little to quell fears around their attack and. on a personal note, there were some nice moments from him as Palace improved. But Hodgson has already spoken about not wanting to rely on him to inspire them.\nIt was telling that Flekken wasn't tested at all until Edouard's free-kick which preceded his excellent double save.\nPalace continue to look bright on the counter-attack and more than competitive in midfield but they could be in for a long season if they don't begin to create and take more chances.\nReaction to Brentford v Crystal Palace, plus the rest of Saturday's action\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance?

Send us your views here\nArsenal's defensive frailties on show again\nA resilient performance against Crystal Palace on Monday saw the Gunners end with 10 men but all three points; however, they swiftly fell behind against Fulham.\nPereira's finish meant Arsenal became the first team in Premier League history to concede a first-minute goal three times inside a calendar year.\nQuickfire strikes from Saka and Nketiah midway through the second half saw Arsenal surge into the lead. After winning the penalty for the equaliser, Vieira found space on the left to drive in a low cross for substitute Nketiah to finish.\nYet even with Arsenal having a man advantage for the closing minutes, they could not see out the game. Palhinha was left unmarked and punished sloppy defending to snatch a point for Marco Silva's team.\nIn games against Nottingham Forest and now Fulham, Arsenal have conceded in the last 15 minutes of the second half, with the defending that cost them towards the end of last season's title challenge still an issue.\nTakehiro Tomiyasu's red card at Palace meant Jakub Kiwior came into Mikel Arteta's home side, with Thomas Partey playing as a makeshift full-back, and it was clear to see the defence was unbalanced by the changes.\nAfter getting into their winning position, Arsenal switched off and were punished.\nResilient Fulham earn important point\nSilva's side were on their way to losing consecutive London derbies before Palhinha's late equaliser, having gone down to Brentford last time out.\nIt remains to be seen what the long-term impact is of losing last season's top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic to Al-Hilal, but Fulham at least began and ended this game in style.\nScoring twice at Emirates Stadium and taking a point sounds positive, and it could have been even better. Summer recruit Raul Jimenez sent an acrobatic volley just over the goal as he narrowly missed a chance to open his account for Fulham.\nThe away side had done well to restrict Arsenal to half-chances but then conceded twice in quick succession, and the game looked to be slipping away from them.\nThe Cottagers had been incensed by Arsenal's second goal, claiming Bassey was fouled near his own byeline by Saka. Silva was booked for his protestations.\nFormer Ajax defender Bassey was then shown a second yellow card with seven minutes remaining on his first start for the club.\nDespite going down to 10 men for the second game in a row, having had Tim Ream dismissed last week, Fulham persevered and left Gunners boss Arteta with plenty of food for thought.",

He was brilliant in the attacking [play] and made the difference. I am very happy with his performance.\"\nThe victory was particularly notable given it was the first time United had fallen two behind in a game so quickly in the Premier League era.\nThough clear questions can be raised about how they fell behind so meekly, criticism could be levelled at Forest for failing to take their chances whilst they were still in front, and doubt perhaps cast on the decision to award the home side their spot-kick, Ten Hag preferred to focus his post-match thoughts around his side's character.\n\"There is big spirit and energy,\" he said.\n\"We've seen this team can bounce back. If you have such a [poor] start, you need to get over it. It's not easy, but compliments to the team.\n\"We have the personality. In certain moments we can definitely improve, but in general this team has the character to bounce back all the time.\"\nFootball Daily podcast: West Ham go top & Man Utd come from two down\nThousands protests against Man Utd owners\nAround 5,000 United fans stayed inside Old Trafford long after the final whistle to voice their protests against the club's owners.\nThe 1958 Group had called for supporters to voice their opposition to the Glazer family amid continued uncertainty over the timing and decision of the 'strategic review' that was launched in November.\nSheikh Jassim and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS Group have both lodged bids to take control of United but neither camp has been told whether they have been successful.\nThis has led to fears the Glazers may opt to remain in control.\n\"They are entitled to have an opinion but you see also the fans and the team have a very strong bond,\" said Ten Hag.\n\"In my time here, that has got stronger and stronger and today we made it stronger because a magnificent comeback will help.\n\"We get big support from them away from home and at Old Trafford.\"\nOur coverage of Manchester United is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything United - go straight to all the best content"

I thought we had some real good control of it.\n\"Obviously we suffered some big chances from our own doing, technical breakdowns with the ball, turnover, and they punished us.\n\"It was a big improvement today and now we need to push the lads hard to get every little drop out of them in the final third because that's where you make a big difference.\"",

On Thursday, he got a similar award from Uefa.\nMan City's assistant manager Juanma Lillo was effusive in his praise of the striker saying it is \"no surprise\" that he reaches high goal-scoring figures.\n\"He's great at providing for other players, he gave one assist today, he has this importance to other players, it's not just about scoring goals,\" said Lillo.\n\"I'm more impressed by other figures as well, not just if he ends up scoring. I always looked at his intelligence as well as his goal-scoring.\"\nHere, he was back doing what he does best - putting the ball into the net, as he took his tally to six for the campaign.\nHaaland had set up the opener for Julian Alvarez - and with the score at 2-1 going into the second half, the favour was returned, as the Argentine sent him charging into the box with a fine first-time pass for City's third.\nThe Norwegian then kept his nerve to score City's fourth from the penalty spot after Issa Diop had fouled Alvarez.\nHaaland had already been named man of the match when he applied the superb first-time finish to Sergio Gomez's cut-back to claim yet another match ball.\nFulham would argue the pivotal moment in the game came just before the break, after Tim Ream had equalised within a minute of Alvarez's opener on the half hour.\nVideo assistant referee Tony Harrington ruled an offside Manuel Akanji was not interfering with play as Nathan Ake's 10-yard header bounced past him, even though the Swiss made a play for the ball.\nFulham boss Marco Silva evidently thought otherwise and was booked as he led the protests.\nFollow Man City v Fulham and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance?

He led our press today - and then he has the quality to take his chances. I'm really pleased for him.\"\nThe win means Postecoglou joins Harry Redknapp, Tim Sherwood and Antonio Conte in picking up ten points in their opening four matches in charge of Tottenham, who registered their biggest away victory since a 6-1 triumph at Manchester United in October 2020.\nBurnley poor at the back\nSpeaking before the game, Postecoglou was highly complimentary of opposite number Vincent Kompany and the philosophy he has brought to Turf Moor since his appointment last summer.\nThe Clarets' opener encapsulated them at their attacking best. After regaining possession deep inside their own half, the home side swept the ball from right to left and Connor Roberts released the lively Luca Koleosho, who outfoxed Porro before picking out Foster.\nKoleosho's pace and trickery could prove a useful weapon as Burnley look to avoid a swift return to the Championship this season, but to stand any chance of avoiding the drop they will need to improve drastically at the other end.\nThe Clarets conceded early in both their previous Premier League games this season and their lead here lasted just 12 minutes as Son's effort gave Spurs a foothold.\nKompany brought on Hannes Delcroix and goalscorer Brownhill at half-time but they were far too open after the restart, allowing Tottenham to cut through them at will and emerge with a comfortable victory that seemed unlikely after Foster's early opener.\nBurnley have lost their opening three top-flight games for a fourth time after the 1920-21, 1927-28, and 2020-21 seasons. The good news for Clarets fans is that none of those campaigns ended in relegation.",

It ended his side's run of 316 minutes without a Premier League goal.\nUnited have been tipped as one of the favourites for relegation but signalled once again they won't be pushovers by showing plenty of heart, as they did in defeat by champions Manchester City last Sunday.\nThe \u00a318m man Archer was central to the play in the final third, caressing in a fine finish for his first goal since moving from Aston Villa, and it was his superb curler that hit the woodwork and went in off Pickford.\nBut they failed to hang on as Danjuma's well-taken finish at the far post drew the visitors level, though they could have won it late in injury time when McBurnie's was somehow denied by Pickford.\nNew signing Beto led the line with effectiveness for Everton, pressing the opposition defence and holding the ball up, but could not add a goal that his performance deserved.\nThe two sides return to action on 16 September after the international break, with United travelling to Tottenham and Everton hosting Arsenal."

And here they are on three wins from four games - above those teams.\nFerguson, as prodigious a talent as he is, might not have been given a regular run of games at another club after moving from Bohemians in 2021.\nThey are in their first European campaign this season, in the Europa League, but if they can balance both who knows what competition they could be in next season?\nSolly March, Kaoru Mitoma and Lewis Dunk all had chances to score before Ferguson's triple made him the first non-English player to hit 10 Premier League goals before their 19th birthday.\nIt is still early days and they have had a tough start in terms of fixtures, but Newcastle - who discovered their Champions League group this week - have lost three of their opening four games.\nThey had to make their first change to the starting line-up this season, with Sven Botman injured and Matt Targett replacing him, and had two chances to score in the opening three minutes with Alexander Isak twice shooting wide.\nSadly they were probably their best chances until the death when Wilson ran onto Sean Longstaff's long ball to score a consolation.\nCheck out our Brighton index here\nClick here for all things Newcastle",

It ended his side's run of 316 minutes without a Premier League goal.\nUnited have been tipped as one of the favourites for relegation but signalled once again they won't be pushovers by showing plenty of heart, as they did in defeat by champions Manchester City last Sunday.\nThe \u00a318m man Archer was central to the play in the final third, caressing in a fine finish for his first goal since moving from Aston Villa, and it was his superb curler that hit the woodwork and went in off Pickford.\nBut they failed to hang on as Danjuma's well-taken finish at the far post drew the visitors level, though they could have won it late in injury time when McBurnie's was somehow denied by Pickford.\nNew signing Beto led the line with effectiveness for Everton, pressing the opposition defence and holding the ball up, but could not add a goal that his performance deserved.\nThe two sides return to action on 16 September after the international break, with United travelling to Tottenham and Everton hosting Arsenal.",

Send us your views here\nSon the star as Spurs continue to impress\nTottenham were punished for their slow start at Turf Moor, but Son sparked the visitors into life with his first of the game before putting the finishing touches to yet another eye-catching showing from Ange Postecoglou's team.\nAfter their skipper's equaliser had steadied their nerves, Spurs took full advantage of the spaces afforded to them by Burnley and could have won by a more handsome margin.\nMaddison delivered another influential display in midfield, going close to getting on the scoresheet in the first half before curling home magnificently in the early stages of the second.\nBut the afternoon belonged to Son, who scored his first hat-trick since a 6-2 victory over Leicester in September last year - and his fourth in the Premier League - to lift Tottenham up to second in the embryonic table.\n\"Sonny was outstanding,\" Postecoglou said afterwards. \"He's been an outstanding leader, with the way he presents himself every day in training. He led our press today - and then he has the quality to take his chances. I'm really pleased for him.\"\nThe win means Postecoglou joins Harry Redknapp, Tim Sherwood and Antonio Conte in picking up ten points in their opening four matches in charge of Tottenham, who registered their biggest away victory since a 6-1 triumph at Manchester United in October 2020.\nBurnley poor at the back\nSpeaking before the game, Postecoglou was highly complimentary of opposite number Vincent Kompany and the philosophy he has brought to Turf Moor since his appointment last summer.\nThe Clarets' opener encapsulated them at their attacking best. After regaining possession deep inside their own half, the home side swept the ball from right to left and Connor Roberts released the lively Luca Koleosho, who outfoxed Porro before picking out Foster.\nKoleosho's pace and trickery could prove a useful weapon as Burnley look to avoid a swift return to the Championship this season, but to stand any chance of avoiding the drop they will need to improve drastically at the other end.\nThe Clarets conceded early in both their previous Premier League games this season and their lead here lasted just 12 minutes as Son's effort gave Spurs a foothold.\nKompany brought on Hannes Delcroix and goalscorer Brownhill at half-time but they were far too open after the restart, allowing Tottenham to cut through them at will and emerge with a comfortable victory that seemed unlikely after Foster's early opener.\nBurnley have lost their opening three top-flight games for a fourth time after the 1920-21, 1927-28, and 2020-21 seasons. The good news for Clarets fans is that none of those campaigns ended in relegation."

The team showed good spirit to survive.\"\nCity maintain their two-point lead over Tottenham and Liverpool at the top of the table, while West Ham drop to sixth thanks to their first defeat of the campaign.\nWhat did you make of West Ham's display? Let us know here\nHow did you rate Man City's performance? Send us your views here\nCity patience pays off\nThere was little wrong with City's first-half display, but, despite registering 17 shots before the break, they could not find a way past Areola and West Ham's deep-lying rearguard.\nThey went close to taking a deserved lead after only six minutes, but Areola produced fine saves to deny Rodri and Ruben Dias either side of Tomas Soucek's goal-line block from Haaland.\nThe Norwegian - of all people - squandered two glorious opportunities before half-time, somehow steering Doku's low cross wide of the far post before having another shot cleared off the line by the retreating Nayef Aguerd.\nGuardiola, back in the City dugout following surgery, will have asked for more of the same from his players at half-time and they were level moments after the restart as the lively Doku cut in from the left before producing an expert finish.\nReflecting on the 21-year-old Belgian's performance, Guardiola said: \"I would say that the first game (against Fulham) he was shy, but today he was not. He was a proper winger, having the ball and having the ability to go one v one.\n\"Not just that - he has the quality to read when to make the pass for the next player. I was very happy. It was a very good performance from Jeremy.\"\nAlvarez rattled a post with a magnificent free-kick not longer after Doku's leveller, but City were not to be denied as the Argentine scooped a clever ball over the West Ham backline for Silva to poke home.\nHaaland delivered the icing on the cake late on, extending his league tally to seven goals in five games this season with a smart finish from Silva's pass.\nValiant Hammers fall short\nWest Ham overcame Brighton last month despite having only 22% possession, and for a long time it looked as though they might secure another famous win against the Premier League champions despite having their backs to the wall for the vast majority of the first half.\nThe hosts could have taken the lead before the opener, Aguerd nearly getting on the end of Soucek's near-post flick-on following a clever corner routine involving Ward-Prowse and Jarrod Bowen.\nWest Ham's move for the opening goal was perfectly executed, Vladimir Coufal lofting a delightful cross in for Ward-Prowse to head home from close range.\nBut their hard work was undone seconds after the interval, much to the frustration of David Moyes, his coaching staff and the home supporters.\n\"It was bad timing for their first goal right after half-time, but I was more disappointed with their second goal - it was really poor,\" Moyes told BBC Sport.\n\"We've had small margins in the other games that we've won. Today their keeper made a couple of saves and those margins could have gone our way [but] didn't.\n\"We were probably as good on the ball today as we have been for a long time but didn't get the opportunities we would have liked. We were still a threat, but not enough.\"\nEderson pulled off a sensational one-handed save to deny Kurt Zouma with the score at 1-1, but Silva's goal seemed to deflate West Ham before Haaland's late effort ended their hopes of getting anything from the contest.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Burnley's display? Send us your views here\nA point apiece a fair result\nThese two sides met at the City Ground for the second time in three weeks and it seemed like a repeat result was on the cards.\nBurnley's club record signing Amdouni converted a 90th-minute winner to send his side through to the EFL Cup third round at the expense of Forest last month.\nAnd he netted again on Monday night with a drilled effort from the edge of the box after being set up by Italy youth international Koleosho, who outpaced home skipper Joe Worrall close to the byeline.\nKoleosho impressed, giving Argentine World Cup winner Gonzalo Montiel the runaround throughout the game before being replaced by Belgium international Mike Tresor.\nThis was a solid showing from Kompany's men in their first away game of the campaign after conceding three or more goals in all their matches so far.\nA club-record five consecutive Premier League defeats was avoided but their return to the top-flight has been a struggle after cantering to the Championship title last season.\nForest, though, hit back in the second period through Hudson-Odoi's brilliant finish with the side highlighting their prowess in front of goal by scoring in their 12th straight top-flight game.\nThe equaliser came from Taiwo Awoniyi's knockdown and the Nigeria striker is becoming an integral part of a Forest side that keeps changing personnel, now contributing a goal or assist in his last nine league games.\nThe two sides face Manchester clubs on Saturday - Forest travelling to Treble winners and league leaders Manchester City (kick-off 15:00 BST), while Burnley host United on the same day (20:00)."

He used his physicality to turn on the halfway line before bursting down the flank and delivering an early ball into the path of Edouard, who capitalised on a slip from goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to coolly slot home for his fourth in the league this season.\nDespite being without England international defender Marc Guehi and midfielder Jefferson Lerma because of injury, Palace appeared to be on track for a rare win at Villa Park, standing firm in the face of relentless pressure.\nHowever, substitute Duran rifled home the equaliser in spectacular fashion to turn the game on its head and drag momentum back in Villa's direction.\nA desperate lunge from Richards saw Watkins fouled in the area and spot-kick specialist Luiz made no mistake from 12 yards to edge his side in front.\nBailey - another substitute - gave Villa some breathing space in the 101st minute when he was found in space by Moussa Diaby.\n\"We played a lot [of other matches] like today and were winning in the first 20 or so minutes,\" Villa manager Unai Emery told BBC Match Of The Day.\n\"We said at half-time to keep going and controlling the game like we were doing. They have a very good team and good players and they did that transition and scored the goal. Then it was a difficult moment.\n\"We were playing more with our hearts than with our minds in the last 20 minutes and sometimes you need that. At the end we deserved to win. We scored three goals so I'm very happy because after their goal it was a difficult moment and we really reacted very well.\"\nVilla now turn their attention to the Europa Conference League with a trip to Polish club Legia to come on Thursday.\nPalace relying heavily on Edouard\nHodgson returned for his second spell in charge of Palace in March and was key in steering the club clear of relegation, but they couldn't rely on his pitchside instruction at Villa Park.\nPalace confirmed shortly before kick-off that the 76-year-old \"had taken ill\" and that assistant McCarthy would take the reins alongside Ray Lewington.\nIt seemed as though Edouard was going to raise Hodgson's spirits by delivering all three points but the Frenchman lacked support from others in attack when Palace had further chances to strengthen their lead.\nEberechi Eze was denied on two occasions by Villa goalkeeper Martinez, while Mateta struggled to have much impact after laying on the assist for the opener.\n\"I'm disappointed for the players - the gameplan worked for a large spell of the game, but I'm disappointed that we didn't get anything from the game,\" McCarthy said.\n\"The team shape and the effort were great. We knew it was going to be a tough side, but the boys who stepped in were great.\n\"The result just leaves a really bitter taste in our mouths.\"\nEdouard appears to be filling the void left by Wilfried Zaha, who departed for Galatasaray this summer, and has scored four of Palace's six goals in the league this campaign.\nThe former Celtic striker has also surpassed his tally of three goals in the Premier League in 2022-23.\nFollow Aston Villa v Crystal Palace and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance?

We controlled the game better.\n\"We have a good squad, no doubt about it. We had a super strong bench today. But even with quality you can play badly, that's what we did in the first half.\"\nResilient Reds bounce back again\nLiverpool offered little as an attacking threat in the opening 45 minutes as their midfield got consistently overrun, going into the break behind.\nKlopp brought on Luis Diaz for the subdued Alexis Mac Allister at half time, before bringing on Elliott and Darwin Nunez 11 minutes after the restart.\nThe substitutes made an impact as Liverpool transformed, with Diaz heading just wide from Robertson's volleyed cross a mere 90 seconds after coming on.\nThe Colombian was then involved in the equaliser as some neat interplay on the edge of the box saw the ball eventually reach Salah, whose drilled cross-shot was tapped home by Gakpo.\nNunez then came close to putting Liverpool ahead but his shot was well blocked by a combination of goalkeeper Jose Sa and defender Max Kilman.\nWolves were looking increasingly out on their feet and it was the visitors who looked the most likely to score.\nThey duly did with five minutes left when Robertson, captain in the absence of the suspended Virgil van Dijk, ran on to Salah's searching pass and side-footed home from six yards.\nElliott wrapped up the win late on but was denied the goal when it was adjudged his shot took enough of a deflection off Bueno to go down as an own goal by the Wolves defender.\nNeto stars but Wolves run out of gas\nWolves manager Gary O'Neil will have reasons to be optimistic despite a fourth defeat from five games this season, leaving the Black Country side near the foot of the Premier League.\n\"For us to compete with Liverpool we have to compete above our level.

The Seagulls are now on a run of four successive Premier League wins over their hosts, and this victory brought more boos at the final whistle, though not on anywhere near the same scale as when Hojlund was withdrawn.\nTen Hag's side have now conceded 10 goals in their last four games, and have also conceded more than one in four successive league matches for the first time since 1979.\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brighton's display? Send us your views here\nUnited hit unexpected trouble\nThings were not supposed to be like this for United.\nSix points from their opening five games represents their worst start since the 2014-15 campaign under Louis van Gaal.\nIn addition to the three damaging defeats they suffered, they are also without Sancho, who is training away from the first team after he said on social media he felt he was being made a scapegoat by Ten Hag in a clear challenge to the manager's authority.\nFellow winger Antony is also absent, having been given time off to address allegations made by his former partner.\nWith new signings Mason Mount and Sofyan Amrabat watching from the stands, Ten Hag is clearly struggling with significant membersof his squad missing.\nStill, United had plenty of experience on show, but with the exception of Marcus Rashford they were largely toothless in attack.\nThe England forward had one first-half effort deflected onto the angle between post and crossbar, and also supplied the low cross which Hojlund, sliding in, probably should have converted.\nAt that point, with the game still goalless and United enjoying an encouraging start, a goal could have been pivotal.\nAs it was, the home side's momentum gradually petered out and there was no repeat of the heroics which saw them come from two goals down to win against Nottingham Forest last month.\nBrighton on the march\nWhile Ten Hag's side is still being viewed as a rebuild in progress, it is worth remembering the Dutchman has been in charge of his team longer than Roberto De Zerbi has been at Brighton.\nIn that regard, the comparisons between the two sides are stark.\nSix of United's starting line-up were bought during Ten Hag's tenure, while only one De Zerbi's signing - former Borussia Dortmund midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud - started for Brighton.\nEvidently, De Zerbi has made a massive impact with his attention to detail and tactical acumen, which owner Tony Bloom admitted this week have caught him by surprise.\nBut through Bloom, chief executive Paul Barber, skipper Lewis Dunk and beyond, there is a continuity and vision about Brighton which those in power at Old Trafford would do well to take note of.\nSimon Adingra is another previously 'unknown' player making a huge impact for the Seagulls this season, as so many have done in recent years.\nBought from Danish club Nordsjaelland last year, the Ivorian was loaned out to Bloom's Belgian club Union Saint-Gilloise, before returning for the current campaign a more accomplished player.\nThe 21-year-old created the opener by exploiting space on the home side's left flank and delivering a cross which Adam Lallana stepped over to allow Welbeck the room to finish.\nKaoru Mitoma also travelled down the Brighton to Union SG loan route before returning to the south coast. The Japanese forward's impact is now well established and it was his pass that allowed Tariq Lamptey to set up Gross for Brighton's second, a goal made somewhat easier to convert for the German by Lisandro Martinez's fruitless dive to win possession inside his own area.\nWith star signing Ansu Fati making his first appearance for the club in the final moments and a European debut against AEK Athens to come on Thursday, these really are unprecedented times for Brighton."

We controlled the game better.\n\"We have a good squad, no doubt about it. We had a super strong bench today. But even with quality you can play badly, that's what we did in the first half.\"\nResilient Reds bounce back again\nLiverpool offered little as an attacking threat in the opening 45 minutes as their midfield got consistently overrun, going into the break behind.\nKlopp brought on Luis Diaz for the subdued Alexis Mac Allister at half time, before bringing on Elliott and Darwin Nunez 11 minutes after the restart.\nThe substitutes made an impact as Liverpool transformed, with Diaz heading just wide from Robertson's volleyed cross a mere 90 seconds after coming on.\nThe Colombian was then involved in the equaliser as some neat interplay on the edge of the box saw the ball eventually reach Salah, whose drilled cross-shot was tapped home by Gakpo.\nNunez then came close to putting Liverpool ahead but his shot was well blocked by a combination of goalkeeper Jose Sa and defender Max Kilman.\nWolves were looking increasingly out on their feet and it was the visitors who looked the most likely to score.\nThey duly did with five minutes left when Robertson, captain in the absence of the suspended Virgil van Dijk, ran on to Salah's searching pass and side-footed home from six yards.\nElliott wrapped up the win late on but was denied the goal when it was adjudged his shot took enough of a deflection off Bueno to go down as an own goal by the Wolves defender.\nNeto stars but Wolves run out of gas\nWolves manager Gary O'Neil will have reasons to be optimistic despite a fourth defeat from five games this season, leaving the Black Country side near the foot of the Premier League.\n\"For us to compete with Liverpool we have to compete above our level. We did that for 45 minutes and then maybe threw the odd punch in the second half,\" O'Neil told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"It looks like a comfortable win for Liverpool but it wasn't comfortable for most of the afternoon.\"\nThe home side were excellent in the first half, with midfielders Joao Gomes and Mario Lemina snapping at the heels of the Liverpool players and feeding debutant Jeanricner Bellegarde and Neto to launch rapid counter-attacks.\nNeto in particular was excellent and set up the opener when he weaved past three Liverpool players and surged into the area, before crossing low for goalscorer Hwang.\nAnother piece of dazzling wing play saw him nutmeg Joe Gomez and chip in an inviting cross for Matheus Cunha, who mistimed his jump with the goal at his mercy.\nCunha was made to regret that miss as Wolves faded badly in the second half in the face of a resurgent Liverpool, failing to have a shot on target.\nNext weekend's trip to fellow early strugglers Luton already looks like a pivotal encounter.\nReaction to Wolves v Liverpool and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nWhat did you make of Wolves' display?

Send us your views here\nCity patience pays off\nThere was little wrong with City's first-half display, but, despite registering 17 shots before the break, they could not find a way past Areola and West Ham's deep-lying rearguard.\nThey went close to taking a deserved lead after only six minutes, but Areola produced fine saves to deny Rodri and Ruben Dias either side of Tomas Soucek's goal-line block from Haaland.\nThe Norwegian - of all people - squandered two glorious opportunities before half-time, somehow steering Doku's low cross wide of the far post before having another shot cleared off the line by the retreating Nayef Aguerd.\nGuardiola, back in the City dugout following surgery, will have asked for more of the same from his players at half-time and they were level moments after the restart as the lively Doku cut in from the left before producing an expert finish.\nReflecting on the 21-year-old Belgian's performance, Guardiola said: \"I would say that the first game (against Fulham) he was shy, but today he was not. He was a proper winger, having the ball and having the ability to go one v one.\n\"Not just that - he has the quality to read when to make the pass for the next player. I was very happy. It was a very good performance from Jeremy.\"\nAlvarez rattled a post with a magnificent free-kick not longer after Doku's leveller, but City were not to be denied as the Argentine scooped a clever ball over the West Ham backline for Silva to poke home.\nHaaland delivered the icing on the cake late on, extending his league tally to seven goals in five games this season with a smart finish from Silva's pass.\nValiant Hammers fall short\nWest Ham overcame Brighton last month despite having only 22% possession, and for a long time it looked as though they might secure another famous win against the Premier League champions despite having their backs to the wall for the vast majority of the first half.\nThe hosts could have taken the lead before the opener, Aguerd nearly getting on the end of Soucek's near-post flick-on following a clever corner routine involving Ward-Prowse and Jarrod Bowen.\nWest Ham's move for the opening goal was perfectly executed, Vladimir Coufal lofting a delightful cross in for Ward-Prowse to head home from close range.\nBut their hard work was undone seconds after the interval, much to the frustration of David Moyes, his coaching staff and the home supporters.\n\"It was bad timing for their first goal right after half-time, but I was more disappointed with their second goal - it was really poor,\" Moyes told BBC Sport.\n\"We've had small margins in the other games that we've won. Today their keeper made a couple of saves and those margins could have gone our way [but] didn't.\n\"We were probably as good on the ball today as we have been for a long time but didn't get the opportunities we would have liked. We were still a threat, but not enough.\"\nEderson pulled off a sensational one-handed save to deny Kurt Zouma with the score at 1-1, but Silva's goal seemed to deflate West Ham before Haaland's late effort ended their hopes of getting anything from the contest."

He's a fantastic footballer,\" Postecoglou told BBC Sport.\n\"He's got so much to give and that can help ease the burden he's feeling in other parts of his life. I'm really pleased for him.\"\nUntil Richarlison's intervention, Spurs' unbeaten Premier League start under Postecoglou looked to be coming to an end thanks to a Gustavo Hamer strike that crept in off a post.\nSheffield United had seemingly engineered a classic smash-and-grab away victory after soaking up pressure for long periods, with goalkeeper Wes Foderingham making a number of fine saves.\nBut Richarlison glanced home fellow substitute Ivan Perisic's corner before Kulusevski left the gallant visitors, who had Oli McBurnie sent off at the end, broken-hearted.\nHaving trailed until the 98th minute, Tottenham's turnaround was the latest winning comeback in Premier League history.\n\"There's some real resilience and spirit within that group already, which is great to see because they are a relatively new group,\" said Postecoglou.\n\"You get tested on days like this.

Send us your views here\nSpurs find another way to win\nSpurs have been hailed for their fine start to life under Postecoglou - and to life without Harry Kane - with their vibrant performances helping the Australian win the Premier League manager of the month award at his first attempt.\nBut, of their four wins so far, this victory arguably might please him the most given the way Spurs had to battle and persevere to eke it out.\nMost of their opponents this season had been happy to go toe-to-toe with Postecoglou's famed 'Ange ball' philosophy, but that was always unlikely with Sheffield United.\nPaul Heckingbottom's side came with a clear gameplan to stifle Spurs, and it succeeded for much of the afternoon, although they still needed Foderingham to be at his best.\nHe made an excellent near-post stop to foil Yves Bissouma in the first half and also thwarted Pape Matar Sarr, Son Heung-min, the lively Manor Solomon, James Maddison and Kulusevski.\nThe visitors created the odd chance on the counter, James McAtee eliciting a smart save from Guglielmo Vicario in the first half, and Hamer pounced when Spurs fell asleep from a long throw.\nBrennan Johnson thought he had equalised with virtually his first touch in a Spurs shirt, but the offside flag denied the deadline-day signing, leaving the stage clear for his fellow replacement to steal the show.\nRicharlison has endured a difficult time since leaving Everton for north London last summer, often employed as a substitute and scoring only once in the league before his header here.\nBut he - and Postecoglou - will hope the honesty he displayed off the pitch this week and the impact he made on it against United can be the turning point of his Spurs career.\nA fourth successive victory means Spurs have their best start to a season for 57 years and keeps them second in the table before Postecoglou's first taste of a north London derby against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium next weekend.\nThe winless United, meanwhile, remain on one point from five games despite redoubtable efforts against both Spurs and Manchester City - with all four of their losses coming by a single goal.\nThey will be without McBurnie for at least one match after he was handed a second booking not long after Tottenham's winning goal.\n\"It's sickening for everyone involved in the dressing room - to come so close to three points, then thinking you're going to have settle for one, and come away with nothing,\" said Heckingbottom.\n\"But that doesn't alter the performance. Right now we have to be positive about how we played. You can see how they celebrated when they won the game, we did that to them.\""

He used his physicality to turn on the halfway line before bursting down the flank and delivering an early ball into the path of Edouard, who capitalised on a slip from goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to coolly slot home for his fourth in the league this season.\nDespite being without England international defender Marc Guehi and midfielder Jefferson Lerma because of injury, Palace appeared to be on track for a rare win at Villa Park, standing firm in the face of relentless pressure.\nHowever, substitute Duran rifled home the equaliser in spectacular fashion to turn the game on its head and drag momentum back in Villa's direction.\nA desperate lunge from Richards saw Watkins fouled in the area and spot-kick specialist Luiz made no mistake from 12 yards to edge his side in front.\nBailey - another substitute - gave Villa some breathing space in the 101st minute when he was found in space by Moussa Diaby.\n\"We played a lot [of other matches] like today and were winning in the first 20 or so minutes,\" Villa manager Unai Emery told BBC Match Of The Day.\n\"We said at half-time to keep going and controlling the game like we were doing. They have a very good team and good players and they did that transition and scored the goal. Then it was a difficult moment.\n\"We were playing more with our hearts than with our minds in the last 20 minutes and sometimes you need that. At the end we deserved to win. We scored three goals so I'm very happy because after their goal it was a difficult moment and we really reacted very well.\"\nVilla now turn their attention to the Europa Conference League with a trip to Polish club Legia to come on Thursday.\nPalace relying heavily on Edouard\nHodgson returned for his second spell in charge of Palace in March and was key in steering the club clear of relegation, but they couldn't rely on his pitchside instruction at Villa Park.\nPalace confirmed shortly before kick-off that the 76-year-old \"had taken ill\" and that assistant McCarthy would take the reins alongside Ray Lewington.\nIt seemed as though Edouard was going to raise Hodgson's spirits by delivering all three points but the Frenchman lacked support from others in attack when Palace had further chances to strengthen their lead.\nEberechi Eze was denied on two occasions by Villa goalkeeper Martinez, while Mateta struggled to have much impact after laying on the assist for the opener.\n\"I'm disappointed for the players - the gameplan worked for a large spell of the game, but I'm disappointed that we didn't get anything from the game,\" McCarthy said.\n\"The team shape and the effort were great. We knew it was going to be a tough side, but the boys who stepped in were great.\n\"The result just leaves a really bitter taste in our mouths.\"\nEdouard appears to be filling the void left by Wilfried Zaha, who departed for Galatasaray this summer, and has scored four of Palace's six goals in the league this campaign.\nThe former Celtic striker has also surpassed his tally of three goals in the Premier League in 2022-23.\nFollow Aston Villa v Crystal Palace and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance?

The Seagulls are now on a run of four successive Premier League wins over their hosts, and this victory brought more boos at the final whistle, though not on anywhere near the same scale as when Hojlund was withdrawn.\nTen Hag's side have now conceded 10 goals in their last four games, and have also conceded more than one in four successive league matches for the first time since 1979.\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brighton's display? Send us your views here\nUnited hit unexpected trouble\nThings were not supposed to be like this for United.\nSix points from their opening five games represents their worst start since the 2014-15 campaign under Louis van Gaal.\nIn addition to the three damaging defeats they suffered, they are also without Sancho, who is training away from the first team after he said on social media he felt he was being made a scapegoat by Ten Hag in a clear challenge to the manager's authority.\nFellow winger Antony is also absent, having been given time off to address allegations made by his former partner.\nWith new signings Mason Mount and Sofyan Amrabat watching from the stands, Ten Hag is clearly struggling with significant membersof his squad missing.\nStill, United had plenty of experience on show, but with the exception of Marcus Rashford they were largely toothless in attack.\nThe England forward had one first-half effort deflected onto the angle between post and crossbar, and also supplied the low cross which Hojlund, sliding in, probably should have converted.\nAt that point, with the game still goalless and United enjoying an encouraging start, a goal could have been pivotal.\nAs it was, the home side's momentum gradually petered out and there was no repeat of the heroics which saw them come from two goals down to win against Nottingham Forest last month.\nBrighton on the march\nWhile Ten Hag's side is still being viewed as a rebuild in progress, it is worth remembering the Dutchman has been in charge of his team longer than Roberto De Zerbi has been at Brighton.\nIn that regard, the comparisons between the two sides are stark.\nSix of United's starting line-up were bought during Ten Hag's tenure, while only one De Zerbi's signing - former Borussia Dortmund midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud - started for Brighton.\nEvidently, De Zerbi has made a massive impact with his attention to detail and tactical acumen, which owner Tony Bloom admitted this week have caught him by surprise.\nBut through Bloom, chief executive Paul Barber, skipper Lewis Dunk and beyond, there is a continuity and vision about Brighton which those in power at Old Trafford would do well to take note of.\nSimon Adingra is another previously 'unknown' player making a huge impact for the Seagulls this season, as so many have done in recent years.\nBought from Danish club Nordsjaelland last year, the Ivorian was loaned out to Bloom's Belgian club Union Saint-Gilloise, before returning for the current campaign a more accomplished player.\nThe 21-year-old created the opener by exploiting space on the home side's left flank and delivering a cross which Adam Lallana stepped over to allow Welbeck the room to finish.\nKaoru Mitoma also travelled down the Brighton to Union SG loan route before returning to the south coast. The Japanese forward's impact is now well established and it was his pass that allowed Tariq Lamptey to set up Gross for Brighton's second, a goal made somewhat easier to convert for the German by Lisandro Martinez's fruitless dive to win possession inside his own area.\nWith star signing Ansu Fati making his first appearance for the club in the final moments and a European debut against AEK Athens to come on Thursday, these really are unprecedented times for Brighton.",

He's a fantastic footballer,\" Postecoglou told BBC Sport.\n\"He's got so much to give and that can help ease the burden he's feeling in other parts of his life. I'm really pleased for him.\"\nUntil Richarlison's intervention, Spurs' unbeaten Premier League start under Postecoglou looked to be coming to an end thanks to a Gustavo Hamer strike that crept in off a post.\nSheffield United had seemingly engineered a classic smash-and-grab away victory after soaking up pressure for long periods, with goalkeeper Wes Foderingham making a number of fine saves.\nBut Richarlison glanced home fellow substitute Ivan Perisic's corner before Kulusevski left the gallant visitors, who had Oli McBurnie sent off at the end, broken-hearted.\nHaving trailed until the 98th minute, Tottenham's turnaround was the latest winning comeback in Premier League history.\n\"There's some real resilience and spirit within that group already, which is great to see because they are a relatively new group,\" said Postecoglou.\n\"You get tested on days like this. It helps fuel belief for us to grow. Our supporters have had an unforgettable day and all those things help in what we are trying to do.\"\nHow did you rate Spurs' performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Sheff Utd's display? Send us your views here\nSpurs find another way to win\nSpurs have been hailed for their fine start to life under Postecoglou - and to life without Harry Kane - with their vibrant performances helping the Australian win the Premier League manager of the month award at his first attempt.\nBut, of their four wins so far, this victory arguably might please him the most given the way Spurs had to battle and persevere to eke it out.\nMost of their opponents this season had been happy to go toe-to-toe with Postecoglou's famed 'Ange ball' philosophy, but that was always unlikely with Sheffield United.\nPaul Heckingbottom's side came with a clear gameplan to stifle Spurs, and it succeeded for much of the afternoon, although they still needed Foderingham to be at his best.\nHe made an excellent near-post stop to foil Yves Bissouma in the first half and also thwarted Pape Matar Sarr, Son Heung-min, the lively Manor Solomon, James Maddison and Kulusevski.\nThe visitors created the odd chance on the counter, James McAtee eliciting a smart save from Guglielmo Vicario in the first half, and Hamer pounced when Spurs fell asleep from a long throw.\nBrennan Johnson thought he had equalised with virtually his first touch in a Spurs shirt, but the offside flag denied the deadline-day signing, leaving the stage clear for his fellow replacement to steal the show.\nRicharlison has endured a difficult time since leaving Everton for north London last summer, often employed as a substitute and scoring only once in the league before his header here.\nBut he - and Postecoglou - will hope the honesty he displayed off the pitch this week and the impact he made on it against United can be the turning point of his Spurs career.\nA fourth successive victory means Spurs have their best start to a season for 57 years and keeps them second in the table before Postecoglou's first taste of a north London derby against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium next weekend.\nThe winless United, meanwhile, remain on one point from five games despite redoubtable efforts against both Spurs and Manchester City - with all four of their losses coming by a single goal.\nThey will be without McBurnie for at least one match after he was handed a second booking not long after Tottenham's winning goal.\n\"It's sickening for everyone involved in the dressing room - to come so close to three points, then thinking you're going to have settle for one, and come away with nothing,\" said Heckingbottom.\n\"But that doesn't alter the performance. Right now we have to be positive about how we played. You can see how they celebrated when they won the game, we did that to them.\"",

Have your say here\nWhat do you make of Brentford's performance?

But because it's not clear and obvious, it's too tight.\n\"Now we will have a situation where Howard Webb will come out and apologise about the situation and say 'we're sorry'. Going forward these should not be penalties.\"\nHowe heads to San Siro in better spirits\nThe chewing gum might have been gnawed more intently, but otherwise there was little in the sanguine Howe's touchline demeanour in the technical area to indicate he was feeling the pressure.\nVictory over a Brentford team unbeaten in seven league games before this encounter helped lift the Magpies to 11th place as they notched their second win of the season.\nIn keeping with his persona, there was no outpouring of emotion from Howe at the final whistle, his mind doubtless already on Tuesday's Champions League opener at San Siro against AC Milan - who were thrashed 5-1 in Saturday's Milan derby.\nIn attempting to ignite their season Howe made five changes to his starting line-up, but Brentford's enterprise was the more polished in the early stages.\nHickey went close while Yoane Wissa was unable to apply the decisive touch to Mathias Jensen's fizzing delivery shortly after. What the Bees lacked was a cutting edge in attack as the ongoing absence of Ivan Toney - suspended until January for betting offences - was acutely felt again.\nNewcastle finished the first half the stronger and Bruno Guimaraes saw his diving header at the back post saved by the feet of Flekken.\nPredatory Wilson underlines his qualities\nThe home side rediscovered some of the intensity which had helped propel them into the top four last season in the second half - and Wilson was again the difference.\nThe 31-year-old signed a new contract this week which will potentially extend his stay on Tyneside until the summer of 2025.\nHis predatory instincts in front of goal were once again underlined as he enabled Howe's side to win a match slim on clear-cut chances.\nAlexander Isak had been given the task of spearheading Newcastle's attack in their opening four matches, but after a poor run of results Howe turned to experienced goalscorer Wilson.\nThe England striker was unfortunate to have been deemed to have fouled Flekken when he turned the ball home from close range shortly after the break.\nHowever, when Flekken brought down Gordon the Newcastle number nine stepped up and emphatically buried the spot-kick.\n\"He is a leader in the group, a vocal presence, a positive guy and a goalscorer,\" Howe said.\n\"Put them together and he's very important, so I'm very happy he's staying with us.\"\nWilson has scored his past 11 penalties, a run stretching back to May 2021, and now has 14 goals in his past 17 appearances having only started seven of them.\nHe should be a shoo-in to be in the starting line-up at San Siro next week.\nHowe added: \"It was a bitty game for us. We had to get set-pieces right, crosses right and defensively I was very pleased.\""

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Chelsea 0-1 Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins winner piles more misery on 10-man Blues\nChelsea's stuttering start to the Premier League season took another turn for the worse as Aston Villa piled more misery on the 10-man Blues with victory at Stamford Bridge.\nOllie Watkins fired home an unerring winner between the legs of Robert Sanchez from an incredibly tight angle as Villa capitalised on Malo Gusto's dismissal for dangerous play.\nMauricio Pochettino's hosts fashioned plenty of chances before Gusto's red card for a poorly-timed tackle that caught Lucas Digne on the ankle but, as so often this season, failed to take any of them.\nNicolas Jackson and Raheem Sterling were both denied one-on-one by excellent Emiliano Martinez saves while Enzo Fernandez sliced another glorious opportunity wide.\nChelsea had been equally indebted to their own goalkeeper as Sanchez made a pair of flying fingertip saves to thwart beautifully-struck volleys by Digne and Nicolo Zaniolo.\nThere were chances at both ends even after Gusto was sent off but Villa, who climb to sixth, took one of theirs via Watkins, while Chelsea failed to score for a third successive game to stay 14th.\nThe Blues have just five points from their opening six games and their woes pre-date Pochettino's appointment, with only two wins and 11 goals in their past 14 home league matches.\nBut the Argentine remains convinced better times lurk just around the corner if his side can overcome their shyness in front of goal.\n\"The team never gives up and of course we are going to fight to change as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\"I am seeing the team trying. We created many chances. We cannot criticise or say anything about the capacity to fight, they are fighting and they have the will.\"\nRelive Chelsea v Villa and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Chelsea's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Aston Villa's display? Send us your views here\nMore headaches for Pochettino\nChelsea's only wins in their seven games under Pochettino have come against Luton and AFC Wimbledon and the injury-hit Blues will be cursing their luck after a second successive home defeat.\nThey will feel Villa's winner was a tad fortunate as Levi Colwill did brilliantly to block Watkins' initial effort but the ball ricocheted kindly for the striker to squeeze home a fine finish at the second attempt.\nAn Axel Disasi header narrowly ruled out for offside at the end of the first half will add to the Blues' belief that little is going their way - but they are hardly helping themselves either.\nGusto's red-card challenge was not malicious but it was ill-judged and was always going to be upgraded from yellow when the video assistant referee intervened, while the Blues' finishing was once again simply not up to scratch.\nAdmittedly, Martinez did excellently to win his one-on-one duels with Jackson, Sterling and, later, substitute Ben Chilwell, but Chelsea should have converted at least one of those chances.\n\"We are confident in the way we perform - the only thing we are missing is scoring and if we keep working hard we will change,\" Pochettino said.\n\"I am not frustrated, just disappointed. I think we were the better team until the red card.\"\nTo add to the head coach's headaches, however, with about a dozen players out injured, Jackson will now join the suspended Gusto on the sidelines for Chelsea's next game after collecting a fifth booking in just six matches.\nWatkins back on the goal trail\nWhile Chelsea are enduring their worst start to a campaign in eight years - since Jose Mourinho's dire final season at Stamford Bridge - Villa continue to look a club on the up under Unai Emery.\nTrue, they sat off for much of the first half and needed some magic from Martinez to keep Chelsea at bay, but Villa also created chances of their own and really took the initiative after Gusto's sending off.\nThe win will be a welcome one after a surprise Europa League defeat at Legia Warsaw in midweek - and the manner in which it came will be a relief to Watkins, who had scored just once in his past 12 league outings.\nThe England striker had, however, netted 11 times in the dozen games before that and Villa will be hopeful his excellent finish here can spark another similar goal glut.\nIt has been keeping goals out at the other end that has been their main problem, especially on the road, having shipped five at Newcastle and three at both Liverpool and Warsaw, so a clean sheet - merited through Martinez's brilliance and some fine last-ditch defending - will be well received by Emery too before Brighton's visit to Villa Park on Saturday.\n\"The clean sheet was very important because we conceded a lot of goals away.

Send us your views here\nWith Newcastle seemingly able to carve through the Blades at will, it was the irrepressible Gordon who added the fifth.\nThe former Everton winger cut in from the left and effortlessly curled the ball into the far corner past Wes Foderingham in the Sheffield United goal.\nMiguel Almiron slotted in number six and Bruno Guimaraes made it seven with 17 minutes still remaining against an increasingly despondent home side.\nThat was plenty of time for substitute Alexander Isak to pounce on another defensive error, turn his man and calmly finish to make it 8-0, the same score by which Newcastle beat Sheffield Wednesday in 1999.\nThe result is also Sheffield United's record league defeat.\nSheffield United honour Cusack before match\nGordon shines in sparkling Newcastle display\nUnlikely as it seems given the scoreline, Newcastle started relatively slowly and it was the home side that looked the more threatening in the opening exchanges.\nThat all changed the moment the first goal went in and Gordon was key to it, twisting smartly on the byeline before finding Longstaff to finish.\nGordon was only on the pitch because of an injury to Harvey Barnes but the winger's introduction helped change the game.\nWhile the match became something of a procession in the second half, it was the pace and trickery of Gordon down the left that helped Newcastle get into such a position.\n\"They can't handle Gordon. He is causing them all sorts of problems,\" former Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison told BBC Radio 5 Live at half-time.\n\"They can't deal with him.\"\nGordon got his goal as Sheffield United capitulated after the break and Newcastle continued relentlessly on.\nAfter an underwhelming start to their league campaign - losing three of their first five games - this was a statement win that will keep spirits high at St James' Park and add to the belief that they can make their mark domestically, as well as in Europe, this season.\nNo positives for Blades after record loss\n\"I can't stand here and say anything positive,\" Sheffield United captain John Egan said after the match.\nThis was the Blades' largest defeat in their league history in their 4,988th game.\nThat speaks for itself but the worrying truth for them is that it could have been worse.\nHaving been unable to make the most of a couple of early chances - Luke Thomas saw one shot blocked and sliced another wide when in space at the far post - they crumbled after going behind.\nThree goals in 14 first-half minutes left Sheffield United looking dazed and the concern is that the half-time break only seemed to make things worse.\nNewcastle players were able to find space all over the pitch and the home side were outclassed. That may not be a surprise against a Champions League side but the fact they were completely outfought as well is more of a worry.\nDespite four defeats in their first five games, this is the first time Heckingbottom's side have lost by more than a goal and they have to hope this proves to be an aberration.",

He could only claw away a cross allowing an attack to continue, ending with James Maddison crossing for Son Heung-min to equalise with a deft finish.\nArsenal restored their lead after 54 minutes when Romero was penalised for handball following the intervention of the Video Assistant Referee, Saka scoring from the spot.\nSpurs, illustrating their new positive approach under manager Ange Postecoglou in his first north London derby, were back on terms almost instantly when Jorginho, as a half-time substitute for the injured Declan Rice, lost possession to Maddison, who played in Son for another cool finish.\n'Spurs making big strides under Postecoglou'\nRelive Arsenal's draw with Tottenham and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Arsenal's performance?

Send us your views here\nArsenal left frustrated\nThe headline news before kick-off was Mikel Arteta's decision to stay with Raya in goal, a move that surely ends the debate about who is Arsenal's number one keeper, the Spaniard getting the nod ahead of England's Ramsdale.\nIt was a mixed afternoon for Raya, who made two important interventions but was also culpable for Spurs' first equaliser when he should have held a cross, allowing Spurs to maintain pressure and score.\nFor Arsenal, there will be real frustration in being held to a point and one of the key moments came when they were leading 1-0 and Gabriel Jesus caught James Maddison in possession, only to shoot wildly over the top with just Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario to beat.\nArsenal were never at their most fluent, not helped by losing Rice to injury at half-time, and paid the price when his replacement Jorginho was robbed by Maddison for Spurs' second goal.\nThe Gunners staged a late show to beat Manchester United but there was no repeat here, even in 10 minutes of added time, and Arteta's side had to settle for a point against their great rivals.\nAsked afterwards about Rice's withdrawal, Arteta claimed it was due to a back injury. He said: \"Yeah he had some discomfort in his back. He was telling us during the first half that he was uncomfortable. When we assessed him at half time he could not continue so we had to change him.\"The Spaniard added: \"Hopefully not [long-term]. It's strange that a player like him has to come off. So we'll see.\"\nTottenham show signs of progress\nTottenham's positive and entertaining start to the season under new manager Postecoglou has sparked real optimism but this was the biggest test of the post-Harry Kane era so far.\nThe upbeat mood will certainly be maintained after the manner in which Spurs not only approached this game, determined not to simply sit back, but also the way in which they responded after going behind twice to come back and earn a point.\nSpurs had to suffer under pressure, which was inevitable, but they never buckled and were always prepared to take the opportunity to attack when the opportunity arose.\nWith the great talisman Kane now at Bayern Munich, Spurs had to look to other areas of creation, other partnerships that could somehow compensate for the absence of the guaranteed goal supply from the England captain.\nAnd they appear to have found it with Maddison and Son, who were at the heart of both Spurs goals - with Maddison the creator and Son the scorer.\nThe pair seemed tuned into the same wavelength and Spurs were the grateful beneficiaries.\nSpurs were equally impressive when Arsenal tried to mount one of their late trademark rallies, resilient at the back but also ready to spring forward even in those added 10 minutes.\nThere was no doubt which set of supporters were happier as Postecoglou clenched his fists and applauded the Spurs fans banked in a corner of Emirates Stadium after the final whistle."

Our performances have been but the outcomes haven't - it was good today to get the outcome.\"\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, Dyche said: \"The bigger picture is to start the process of moving forward. I said to the players, we're the only ones who can change the story of Everton.\n\"The fans play their part, but it's on the pitch you can change stories and that's our job. We've got to change the story, get it more positive and build from what we're doing.\"\nAbdoulaye Doucoure's superbly taken half-volley had given the lively visitors the lead inside the opening six minutes.\nHowever, after Dwight McNeil shot narrowly wide and Doucoure hit the crossbar with another excellent attempt, a below-par Brentford delivered a sucker-punch.\nJust 90 seconds after Doucoure's chance, Mathias Jensen found the bottom corner following a slick passing move to equalise against the run of play.\nEverton continued to pose the greater threat and impressive \u00a330m summer signing Beto went close to a first Premier League goal before half-time, lifting a shot over Mark Flekken which rolled wide of the far post.\nBut it was captain James Tarkowski who took advantage of poor Brentford defending to head home McNeil's corner after 67 minutes, before Calvert-Lewin raced on to James Garner's pass to fire past Flekken and seal a much-needed three points.\nAnalysis: What might Everton fans expect from 777 takeover?\nFollow live text coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nDoucoure and Beto impress in positive Everton performance\nAmid the ongoing noise around Everton, four defeats from five league games ahead of Saturday's trip to London suggested a third successive relegation dogfight could be in store for the club. However, Dyche this week called for his players to \"play with a smile\".\nAnd while uncertainty continues off the pitch, amid a proposed takeover of the club by American investment group 777 Partners, Dyche and his players know they must focus on making progress on it.\nAt last, the Toffees have hinted at their ability to achieve that.\nA lack of goals had been a pressing concern in the early stages of the campaign - Everton had scored in only one previous league game, with two goals in a draw at Sheffield United.\nAlthough they scored three here, perhaps Dyche's only complaint can be that they failed to add more.\nThe industrious Doucoure led by example, dictating Everton's rhythm and producing the early moment of quality to inspire an encouraging performance that Dyche will desperately hope can kickstart his side's campaign.\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here\nDoucoure was inches away from chasing a hat-trick after 26 minutes - before Jensen dealt a harsh reminder of the Premier League's punishing nature by converting Brentford's first chance of note.\nBut Everton continued to play positively, and with no shortage of belief, to earn a first league win since beating Bournemouth to secure their Premier League safety on the final day of last season.\nIn a match full of positives for the away side there was yet another promising display by Beto, whose hard work and ability to win duels created space for those around him to exploit.\nCalvert-Lewin, on his 250th club career appearance, added the finishing touch after great work by Garner to dispossess Nathan Collins. It provided the perfect end to a hugely satisfying evening for Dyche.\n\"They are hard yards when you're not winning games,\" Dyche told BBC Sport. \"We are still a work in progress. It is a stepping stone. These are all building blocks.\"\nOn Calvert-Lewin, Dyche added: \"He is a very good player and he has had a very frustrating period. It's been a very hard period for him, but he has stuck at it and he will get fitter and sharper.\"\nRare off day for disappointing Brentford\nThis was an uncharacteristic Brentford performance and manager Thomas Frank will hope his side offer an immediate response after slumping to successive defeats following an unbeaten first four games.\nThe Bees were dealt a setback in the warm-up when Kevin Schade suffered an injury and had to be replaced by Keane Lewis-Potter.\nLewis-Potter wasted no time announcing himself - the 22-year-old's threatening run leading to Ashley Young being shown a yellow card after 38 seconds - while he also missed a chance under pressure from Tarkowski.\nBut those flashes, along with Jensen's equaliser and the passing sequence preceding it, proved rare moments of promise.\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance? Have your say here\nBrentford, in the ongoing absence of banned talisman Ivan Toney, struggled to assert themselves throughout a frustrating evening and could have few complaints about the result.\nThey now sit just two points ahead of Everton, perched in 13th place following back-to-back defeats.\n\"First and foremost Everton deserved to win. We performed badly. This was very unlike us and these fantastic players that we played like that today,\" Frank said.\n\"This group of players have been good at bouncing back. It's very important we do so again.\"",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Newcastle's display? Send us your views here\nWith Newcastle seemingly able to carve through the Blades at will, it was the irrepressible Gordon who added the fifth.\nThe former Everton winger cut in from the left and effortlessly curled the ball into the far corner past Wes Foderingham in the Sheffield United goal.\nMiguel Almiron slotted in number six and Bruno Guimaraes made it seven with 17 minutes still remaining against an increasingly despondent home side.\nThat was plenty of time for substitute Alexander Isak to pounce on another defensive error, turn his man and calmly finish to make it 8-0, the same score by which Newcastle beat Sheffield Wednesday in 1999.\nThe result is also Sheffield United's record league defeat.\nSheffield United honour Cusack before match\nGordon shines in sparkling Newcastle display\nUnlikely as it seems given the scoreline, Newcastle started relatively slowly and it was the home side that looked the more threatening in the opening exchanges.\nThat all changed the moment the first goal went in and Gordon was key to it, twisting smartly on the byeline before finding Longstaff to finish.\nGordon was only on the pitch because of an injury to Harvey Barnes but the winger's introduction helped change the game.\nWhile the match became something of a procession in the second half, it was the pace and trickery of Gordon down the left that helped Newcastle get into such a position.\n\"They can't handle Gordon. He is causing them all sorts of problems,\" former Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison told BBC Radio 5 Live at half-time.\n\"They can't deal with him.\"\nGordon got his goal as Sheffield United capitulated after the break and Newcastle continued relentlessly on.\nAfter an underwhelming start to their league campaign - losing three of their first five games - this was a statement win that will keep spirits high at St James' Park and add to the belief that they can make their mark domestically, as well as in Europe, this season.\nNo positives for Blades after record loss\n\"I can't stand here and say anything positive,\" Sheffield United captain John Egan said after the match.\nThis was the Blades' largest defeat in their league history in their 4,988th game.\nThat speaks for itself but the worrying truth for them is that it could have been worse.\nHaving been unable to make the most of a couple of early chances - Luke Thomas saw one shot blocked and sliced another wide when in space at the far post - they crumbled after going behind.\nThree goals in 14 first-half minutes left Sheffield United looking dazed and the concern is that the half-time break only seemed to make things worse.\nNewcastle players were able to find space all over the pitch and the home side were outclassed. That may not be a surprise against a Champions League side but the fact they were completely outfought as well is more of a worry.\nDespite four defeats in their first five games, this is the first time Heckingbottom's side have lost by more than a goal and they have to hope this proves to be an aberration."

He could only claw away a cross allowing an attack to continue, ending with James Maddison crossing for Son Heung-min to equalise with a deft finish.\nArsenal restored their lead after 54 minutes when Romero was penalised for handball following the intervention of the Video Assistant Referee, Saka scoring from the spot.\nSpurs, illustrating their new positive approach under manager Ange Postecoglou in his first north London derby, were back on terms almost instantly when Jorginho, as a half-time substitute for the injured Declan Rice, lost possession to Maddison, who played in Son for another cool finish.\n'Spurs making big strides under Postecoglou'\nRelive Arsenal's draw with Tottenham and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Arsenal's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Spurs' display? Send us your views here\nArsenal left frustrated\nThe headline news before kick-off was Mikel Arteta's decision to stay with Raya in goal, a move that surely ends the debate about who is Arsenal's number one keeper, the Spaniard getting the nod ahead of England's Ramsdale.\nIt was a mixed afternoon for Raya, who made two important interventions but was also culpable for Spurs' first equaliser when he should have held a cross, allowing Spurs to maintain pressure and score.\nFor Arsenal, there will be real frustration in being held to a point and one of the key moments came when they were leading 1-0 and Gabriel Jesus caught James Maddison in possession, only to shoot wildly over the top with just Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario to beat.\nArsenal were never at their most fluent, not helped by losing Rice to injury at half-time, and paid the price when his replacement Jorginho was robbed by Maddison for Spurs' second goal.\nThe Gunners staged a late show to beat Manchester United but there was no repeat here, even in 10 minutes of added time, and Arteta's side had to settle for a point against their great rivals.\nAsked afterwards about Rice's withdrawal, Arteta claimed it was due to a back injury. He said: \"Yeah he had some discomfort in his back. He was telling us during the first half that he was uncomfortable. When we assessed him at half time he could not continue so we had to change him.\"The Spaniard added: \"Hopefully not [long-term]. It's strange that a player like him has to come off. So we'll see.\"\nTottenham show signs of progress\nTottenham's positive and entertaining start to the season under new manager Postecoglou has sparked real optimism but this was the biggest test of the post-Harry Kane era so far.\nThe upbeat mood will certainly be maintained after the manner in which Spurs not only approached this game, determined not to simply sit back, but also the way in which they responded after going behind twice to come back and earn a point.\nSpurs had to suffer under pressure, which was inevitable, but they never buckled and were always prepared to take the opportunity to attack when the opportunity arose.\nWith the great talisman Kane now at Bayern Munich, Spurs had to look to other areas of creation, other partnerships that could somehow compensate for the absence of the guaranteed goal supply from the England captain.\nAnd they appear to have found it with Maddison and Son, who were at the heart of both Spurs goals - with Maddison the creator and Son the scorer.\nThe pair seemed tuned into the same wavelength and Spurs were the grateful beneficiaries.\nSpurs were equally impressive when Arsenal tried to mount one of their late trademark rallies, resilient at the back but also ready to spring forward even in those added 10 minutes.\nThere was no doubt which set of supporters were happier as Postecoglou clenched his fists and applauded the Spurs fans banked in a corner of Emirates Stadium after the final whistle.",

Our performances have been but the outcomes haven't - it was good today to get the outcome.\"\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, Dyche said: \"The bigger picture is to start the process of moving forward. I said to the players, we're the only ones who can change the story of Everton.\n\"The fans play their part, but it's on the pitch you can change stories and that's our job. We've got to change the story, get it more positive and build from what we're doing.\"\nAbdoulaye Doucoure's superbly taken half-volley had given the lively visitors the lead inside the opening six minutes.\nHowever, after Dwight McNeil shot narrowly wide and Doucoure hit the crossbar with another excellent attempt, a below-par Brentford delivered a sucker-punch.\nJust 90 seconds after Doucoure's chance, Mathias Jensen found the bottom corner following a slick passing move to equalise against the run of play.\nEverton continued to pose the greater threat and impressive \u00a330m summer signing Beto went close to a first Premier League goal before half-time, lifting a shot over Mark Flekken which rolled wide of the far post.\nBut it was captain James Tarkowski who took advantage of poor Brentford defending to head home McNeil's corner after 67 minutes, before Calvert-Lewin raced on to James Garner's pass to fire past Flekken and seal a much-needed three points.\nAnalysis: What might Everton fans expect from 777 takeover?\nFollow live text coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nDoucoure and Beto impress in positive Everton performance\nAmid the ongoing noise around Everton, four defeats from five league games ahead of Saturday's trip to London suggested a third successive relegation dogfight could be in store for the club. However, Dyche this week called for his players to \"play with a smile\".\nAnd while uncertainty continues off the pitch, amid a proposed takeover of the club by American investment group 777 Partners, Dyche and his players know they must focus on making progress on it.\nAt last, the Toffees have hinted at their ability to achieve that.\nA lack of goals had been a pressing concern in the early stages of the campaign - Everton had scored in only one previous league game, with two goals in a draw at Sheffield United.\nAlthough they scored three here, perhaps Dyche's only complaint can be that they failed to add more.\nThe industrious Doucoure led by example, dictating Everton's rhythm and producing the early moment of quality to inspire an encouraging performance that Dyche will desperately hope can kickstart his side's campaign.\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here\nDoucoure was inches away from chasing a hat-trick after 26 minutes - before Jensen dealt a harsh reminder of the Premier League's punishing nature by converting Brentford's first chance of note.\nBut Everton continued to play positively, and with no shortage of belief, to earn a first league win since beating Bournemouth to secure their Premier League safety on the final day of last season.\nIn a match full of positives for the away side there was yet another promising display by Beto, whose hard work and ability to win duels created space for those around him to exploit.\nCalvert-Lewin, on his 250th club career appearance, added the finishing touch after great work by Garner to dispossess Nathan Collins. It provided the perfect end to a hugely satisfying evening for Dyche.\n\"They are hard yards when you're not winning games,\" Dyche told BBC Sport. \"We are still a work in progress. It is a stepping stone. These are all building blocks.\"\nOn Calvert-Lewin, Dyche added: \"He is a very good player and he has had a very frustrating period. It's been a very hard period for him, but he has stuck at it and he will get fitter and sharper.\"\nRare off day for disappointing Brentford\nThis was an uncharacteristic Brentford performance and manager Thomas Frank will hope his side offer an immediate response after slumping to successive defeats following an unbeaten first four games.\nThe Bees were dealt a setback in the warm-up when Kevin Schade suffered an injury and had to be replaced by Keane Lewis-Potter.\nLewis-Potter wasted no time announcing himself - the 22-year-old's threatening run leading to Ashley Young being shown a yellow card after 38 seconds - while he also missed a chance under pressure from Tarkowski.\nBut those flashes, along with Jensen's equaliser and the passing sequence preceding it, proved rare moments of promise.\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance? Have your say here\nBrentford, in the ongoing absence of banned talisman Ivan Toney, struggled to assert themselves throughout a frustrating evening and could have few complaints about the result.\nThey now sit just two points ahead of Everton, perched in 13th place following back-to-back defeats.\n\"First and foremost Everton deserved to win. We performed badly. This was very unlike us and these fantastic players that we played like that today,\" Frank said.\n\"This group of players have been good at bouncing back. It's very important we do so again.\""

That is where we let ourselves down, with the final pass [and] the final ball.\n\"The good work that got us there didn't get any reward.\"\nFulham lack clinical edge\nAs for Fulham, the question remains who is going to fill the goalscoring boots of the departed Aleksandar Mitrovic.\nManager Marco Silva kept faith with former Wolves striker Jimenez in south London but the 32-year-old, who scored three goals for Mexico during the last international break, has now gone 29 Premier League appearances without finding the net.\nHe was denied by an impressive Johnstone save in the first half, but the striker should have picked out the unmarked Pereira at the end of a second-half Fulham counter-attack.\nWillian spurned a late opportunity to win the game when he latched on to a low cross from the right, only to shoot straight at Johnstone.\n\"Overall, I think we deserved the three points,\" Silva told BBC Match of the Day. \"We created enough, we showed quality, pushed them back and controlled the game.\n\"It was a great effort from the boys [with] good spirit and organisation. If someone has to win the game, it should be Fulham because we were the best team on the pitch.\"\nThe Cottagers have kept more clean sheets than any other team in the top flight this season, but, with home games against Chelsea and Sheffield United coming up in early October, Silva will be desperate for his side to rediscover their cutting edge at the other end.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 0-1 Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins winner piles more misery on 10-man Blues\nChelsea's stuttering start to the Premier League season took another turn for the worse as Aston Villa piled more misery on the 10-man Blues with victory at Stamford Bridge.\nOllie Watkins fired home an unerring winner between the legs of Robert Sanchez from an incredibly tight angle as Villa capitalised on Malo Gusto's dismissal for dangerous play.\nMauricio Pochettino's hosts fashioned plenty of chances before Gusto's red card for a poorly-timed tackle that caught Lucas Digne on the ankle but, as so often this season, failed to take any of them.\nNicolas Jackson and Raheem Sterling were both denied one-on-one by excellent Emiliano Martinez saves while Enzo Fernandez sliced another glorious opportunity wide.\nChelsea had been equally indebted to their own goalkeeper as Sanchez made a pair of flying fingertip saves to thwart beautifully-struck volleys by Digne and Nicolo Zaniolo.\nThere were chances at both ends even after Gusto was sent off but Villa, who climb to sixth, took one of theirs via Watkins, while Chelsea failed to score for a third successive game to stay 14th.\nThe Blues have just five points from their opening six games and their woes pre-date Pochettino's appointment, with only two wins and 11 goals in their past 14 home league matches.\nBut the Argentine remains convinced better times lurk just around the corner if his side can overcome their shyness in front of goal.\n\"The team never gives up and of course we are going to fight to change as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\"I am seeing the team trying. We created many chances. We cannot criticise or say anything about the capacity to fight, they are fighting and they have the will.\"\nRelive Chelsea v Villa and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Chelsea's performance?

Send us your views here\nMore headaches for Pochettino\nChelsea's only wins in their seven games under Pochettino have come against Luton and AFC Wimbledon and the injury-hit Blues will be cursing their luck after a second successive home defeat.\nThey will feel Villa's winner was a tad fortunate as Levi Colwill did brilliantly to block Watkins' initial effort but the ball ricocheted kindly for the striker to squeeze home a fine finish at the second attempt.\nAn Axel Disasi header narrowly ruled out for offside at the end of the first half will add to the Blues' belief that little is going their way - but they are hardly helping themselves either.\nGusto's red-card challenge was not malicious but it was ill-judged and was always going to be upgraded from yellow when the video assistant referee intervened, while the Blues' finishing was once again simply not up to scratch.\nAdmittedly, Martinez did excellently to win his one-on-one duels with Jackson, Sterling and, later, substitute Ben Chilwell, but Chelsea should have converted at least one of those chances.\n\"We are confident in the way we perform - the only thing we are missing is scoring and if we keep working hard we will change,\" Pochettino said.\n\"I am not frustrated, just disappointed. I think we were the better team until the red card.\"\nTo add to the head coach's headaches, however, with about a dozen players out injured, Jackson will now join the suspended Gusto on the sidelines for Chelsea's next game after collecting a fifth booking in just six matches.\nWatkins back on the goal trail\nWhile Chelsea are enduring their worst start to a campaign in eight years - since Jose Mourinho's dire final season at Stamford Bridge - Villa continue to look a club on the up under Unai Emery.\nTrue, they sat off for much of the first half and needed some magic from Martinez to keep Chelsea at bay, but Villa also created chances of their own and really took the initiative after Gusto's sending off.\nThe win will be a welcome one after a surprise Europa League defeat at Legia Warsaw in midweek - and the manner in which it came will be a relief to Watkins, who had scored just once in his past 12 league outings.\nThe England striker had, however, netted 11 times in the dozen games before that and Villa will be hopeful his excellent finish here can spark another similar goal glut.\nIt has been keeping goals out at the other end that has been their main problem, especially on the road, having shipped five at Newcastle and three at both Liverpool and Warsaw, so a clean sheet - merited through Martinez's brilliance and some fine last-ditch defending - will be well received by Emery too before Brighton's visit to Villa Park on Saturday.\n\"The clean sheet was very important because we conceded a lot of goals away. It was important to win through a clean sheet,\" the Villa boss said.\n\"We needed to find a way where we were stronger than we were against Newcastle and Liverpool. Today was tough but we competed very well.\""

I don't want this to come across in any kind of arrogant way but I expected us to [win] today, I really did. I told the boys before the game, 'I know this is going to be a good day'.\n\"We really believed we could come here and win the game. We had a really good plan.\"\nThe hosts were the better side early on, and winger Dwight McNeil fired a volley narrowly wide before each of James Garner, Idrissa Gueye and Amadou Onana failed to hit the target from promising positions.\nLuton held out before taking a shock lead in fortuitous circumstances when Carlton Morris' header rattled the crossbar and, as Ashley Young looked to clear, the ball cannoned off captain Tom Lockyer and into the net.\nThe Hatters were in dreamland when they doubled their lead as Morris kept his composure to side-foot in a volley from Alfie Doughty's free-kick having been left unmarked at the back post.\nIn an action-packed first half, Garner headed against the crossbar and the Toffees did manage to pull a goal back through Dominic Calvert-Lewin from close range, which was awarded after a long check for offside by VAR.\nThe Englishman struck a volley wide in the second period and substitute Beto twice headed over, while at the other end Morris had an effort ruled out for offside as the visitors held on for a famous win.\n777 Partners watch Dyche's Everton fail to 'change the story'\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nHow did you rate Everton's performance?

But what an accolade.\n\"It's special but it's a team game and a first Premier League win brings a buzz in the changing rooms.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Liverpool's display? Send us your views here\nSpurs' patience rewarded by slice of fortune\nSpurs knew they were under pressure to to find a winner against a side who have joined them as one of the early Premier League pacesetters.\nIt is to their credit that there was no sense of panic in their approach even as the seconds ticked away and Liverpool's red wall of defensive defiance kept them at bay, helped by keeper Alisson proving such a relentless barrier.\nSpurs showed their new-found belief throughout the game and, despite some groans when Dejan Kulusevski played the ball back to Porro at the end of six minutes of stoppage time, their patience was rewarded with a large slice of good fortune as Matip's attempted clearance deflection carried such power that even Alisson was rendered powerless.\nIt was a climax which sparked wild scenes around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where the atmosphere has been transformed since Postecoglou's arrival.\nMaddison was once again pulling the strings, playing a key part in Son's opener, while the intensity and determination is bringing roars of approval from Spurs fans who have suffered under the stodgy styles of previous bosses Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte.\nThis may only be a pretty fortunate late victory against nine men, but a three points swing over this increasingly formidable Liverpool team will send confidence soaring even higher at Spurs.\nLiverpool left heartbroken and fuming\nMatip's misery was the final straw for Liverpool after a game in which manager Klopp and his players were convinced officialdom and the fates conspired against them cruelly.\nKlopp complained bitterly about Jones and Jota being sent off, while the decision to rule out Diaz's first-half goal for offside was clearly an enormous error.\nTheir sense of injustice will have felt even more acute given the manner in which they organised themselves in a 5-3-0 formation, with a world-class last line of defence in keeper Alisson, to keep Spurs at arm's length once they were down to nine men.\nLiverpool have shown they can get results with reduced numbers this season, having beaten Bournemouth and Newcastle United despite being down to ten men, but this time it just proved a step too far.\nKlopp, however, will be rightly proud of the way Liverpool gathered themselves to get within seconds of a valuable point.\nThe Reds' attacking prowess is well known but this was a show of quality and character at the other end of the field, only for all their hard work to come to nothing after Matip's unwitting late intervention."

When they did they found goalkeeper Sam Johnstone in superb form.\nJohnstone made two crucial saves in the second half to preserve Palace's lead, first pushing over Bruno Fernandes' dipping effort before keeping out Hojlund's bullet header.\nThe Palace goal continued to live a charmed life but Manchester United could not find a way through as the visitors secured a win that moved them above their opponents to ninth, with the hosts dropping to 10th.\nIt is now four defeats in seven Premier League games for Ten Hag's side, who have endured their worst start to a league season after seven games in 34 years.\nManchester United 'not good enough' in worst Premier League start\nRelive Manchester United v Crystal Palace and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Crystal Palace's display? Let us know here\nA frustrating afternoon for United\nAfter starting September with three successive defeats Manchester United were looking to end the month on a high, and victory over Palace would have been their third in a row to get their season off and running.\nHaving breezed to victory against Roy Hodgson's men on Tuesday, the home fans would have been forgiven for expecting more of the same against the Eagles.\nInitially it looked like that would be the case as they made a dominant start, but Mitchell's goalline clearance proved something of a turning point.\nAfter that, Palace started to look more of a threat on the counter, while Manchester United found themselves increasingly frustrated as they struggled to break their opponents down.\nThere were boos at full time from the home fans, who expressed their frustration at the officials after a couple of penalty calls were waved away.\nUnited had plenty of chances to snatch a draw, but a mix of poor finishing and excellent Palace defending meant it would not be their day.\nThe perfect away performance\nFor Crystal Palace, this was a gameplan for an away game executed to perfection.\nThey were defensively solid and looked a threat on the counter-attack, with Andersen's fine strike just reward for a strong display in the opening 45 minutes.\nPalace had not scored in the first half this season before the trip to Old Trafford, but it was well worth the wait with Andersen displaying brilliant technique for the strike from Eberechi Eze's free-kick down the right.\nFrom then on it was all about resisting the numerous Manchester United attacks, which they did so superbly with Andersen and Marc Guehi superb in the centre of defence, backed up by Johnstone.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brentford's display? Send us your views here\nForest battle hard to earn a point\nThirteen minutes were added at the end of the match, with both sides having chances to snatch a dramatic winner in a thrilling finish.\nBryan Mbeumo headed over for Brentford and Chris Wood nodded wide for Forest, before the visitors had a shot cleared off the line. At the other end Willy Boly glanced a header wide and Maupay had another shot blocked for the Bees.\nBut Forest boss Steve Cooper, whose side moved up one place to 11th, will be delighted with the commitment from his side, who had to play with a player fewer for more than 40 minutes.\nThe desire from the hosts was shown near the end when Morgan Gibbs-White produced a goal-saving sliding challenge on Mbeumo, with the Forest midfielder, the coaching staff and fans celebrating as if they had snatched a winning goal.\nThe entertaining finale was very much in contrast to the first half, where neither side had a shot on target until the third minute of added time.\nThat was when Vitaly Janelt's deflected strike was parried by home keeper Matt Turner, before Ibrahim Sangare made a superb block to deny Norgaard as he looked to convert the rebound.\nTurner nearly gifted Brentford a goal at the start of the second half with a heavy touch from a backpass.\nWissa managed to slide in on the goalkeeper and steer the ball goalwards only for Boly, excellent throughout, to get back in time to clear off the line.\nVAR plays a role\nThe fourth official was meant to be Darren England, but he was stood down for the role after being involved as the video assistant referee in the \"significant human error\" when Liverpool were denied a goal - later shown to be onside - in their 2-1 loss at Tottenham on Saturday.\nIt was another controversial afternoon for VAR with Michael Oliver's first intervention coming after only 11 minutes when Taiwo Awoniyi thought he had scored his fourth league goal of the season from close range after Brentford failed to clear a corner from the right.\nBut, unlike at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, the correct decision was made, with Awoniyi clearly offside and ahead of Wissa when the lines were added on to the video evidence.\nIt proved to be a busy afternoon for the VAR officials, with the red card and Norgaard's goal needing to be checked.\nDespite both of those decisions going their way and Brentford not judged offside for the goal, the visitors rued a missed opportunity."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Sheff Utd's display? Send us your views here\nMoyes milestone marked in style\nHammers boss Moyes passed 25 years in management back in January, having made his debut in the dugout with Preston in 1998.\nAnd while he has been an occasionally divisive figure among supporters at some clubs - not least his current one - that longevity must be applauded, particularly in the modern era.\nIn a game where boardroom patience levels and managerial reigns are shorter than ever, the Hammers are only Moyes' sixth club in that quarter-century span, which could be regarded as a telling statistic in itself.\nMoyes this week was forced to defend the Hammers' style of play, given they had the second-lowest possession figures in the top flight - but their opening goal here would have been the envy of any team.\nA patient build-up gave way to a lovely passage of one-touch football that ended with Bowen coolly steering a first-time finish into the bottom corner from Vladimir Coufal's pull-back.\nOnce Soucek evaded the attentions of two defenders to tuck Antonio's slide-rule pass beyond Foderingham, the game was over, extending Moyes' perfect home career record against the Blades to eight wins.\nPerhaps with Thursday's Europa League trip to Freiburg in mind, the Hammers eased off in the second half but rarely looked in danger of conceding as they recorded a first league clean sheet of the season.\nThe form of Bowen, in particular, will please Moyes, with the forward showing the sort of form that earned him an England call-up last year - only Erling Haaland and Son Heung-min have more goals in the top flight than the 26-year-old this term.\nBlades better but scars remain\nOnly a fortnight has passed since the Blades' previous trip to the capital, when they conceded two goals deep into time added on to lose at Tottenham - and that late heartbreak seems, in hindsight, to have severely damaged their confidence.\nWhile this display was an improvement on their Newcastle nightmare, it would have been hard not to be - and they never really seemed to possess the belief they showed against Spurs just a couple of weeks prior.\nThere were some bright moments at London Stadium, particularly after the break, and substitute Anis Ben Slimane looked lively with a couple of late efforts but they were left to rue a nervy first period when they looked vulnerable every time the Hammers attacked.\nThe scars from the Magpies mauling will fade in time - and this was a step towards that - but they remain without a clean sheet since promotion and face a hugely important trip to Fulham in a week's time given Manchester United and Arsenal are their subsequent two opponents."

I don't want this to come across in any kind of arrogant way but I expected us to [win] today, I really did. I told the boys before the game, 'I know this is going to be a good day'.\n\"We really believed we could come here and win the game. We had a really good plan.\"\nThe hosts were the better side early on, and winger Dwight McNeil fired a volley narrowly wide before each of James Garner, Idrissa Gueye and Amadou Onana failed to hit the target from promising positions.\nLuton held out before taking a shock lead in fortuitous circumstances when Carlton Morris' header rattled the crossbar and, as Ashley Young looked to clear, the ball cannoned off captain Tom Lockyer and into the net.\nThe Hatters were in dreamland when they doubled their lead as Morris kept his composure to side-foot in a volley from Alfie Doughty's free-kick having been left unmarked at the back post.\nIn an action-packed first half, Garner headed against the crossbar and the Toffees did manage to pull a goal back through Dominic Calvert-Lewin from close range, which was awarded after a long check for offside by VAR.\nThe Englishman struck a volley wide in the second period and substitute Beto twice headed over, while at the other end Morris had an effort ruled out for offside as the visitors held on for a famous win.\n777 Partners watch Dyche's Everton fail to 'change the story'\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nHow did you rate Everton's performance?

But what an accolade.\n\"It's special but it's a team game and a first Premier League win brings a buzz in the changing rooms.

When they did they found goalkeeper Sam Johnstone in superb form.\nJohnstone made two crucial saves in the second half to preserve Palace's lead, first pushing over Bruno Fernandes' dipping effort before keeping out Hojlund's bullet header.\nThe Palace goal continued to live a charmed life but Manchester United could not find a way through as the visitors secured a win that moved them above their opponents to ninth, with the hosts dropping to 10th.\nIt is now four defeats in seven Premier League games for Ten Hag's side, who have endured their worst start to a league season after seven games in 34 years.\nManchester United 'not good enough' in worst Premier League start\nRelive Manchester United v Crystal Palace and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance?

At the other end Willy Boly glanced a header wide and Maupay had another shot blocked for the Bees.\nBut Forest boss Steve Cooper, whose side moved up one place to 11th, will be delighted with the commitment from his side, who had to play with a player fewer for more than 40 minutes.\nThe desire from the hosts was shown near the end when Morgan Gibbs-White produced a goal-saving sliding challenge on Mbeumo, with the Forest midfielder, the coaching staff and fans celebrating as if they had snatched a winning goal.\nThe entertaining finale was very much in contrast to the first half, where neither side had a shot on target until the third minute of added time.\nThat was when Vitaly Janelt's deflected strike was parried by home keeper Matt Turner, before Ibrahim Sangare made a superb block to deny Norgaard as he looked to convert the rebound.\nTurner nearly gifted Brentford a goal at the start of the second half with a heavy touch from a backpass.\nWissa managed to slide in on the goalkeeper and steer the ball goalwards only for Boly, excellent throughout, to get back in time to clear off the line.\nVAR plays a role\nThe fourth official was meant to be Darren England, but he was stood down for the role after being involved as the video assistant referee in the \"significant human error\" when Liverpool were denied a goal - later shown to be onside - in their 2-1 loss at Tottenham on Saturday.\nIt was another controversial afternoon for VAR with Michael Oliver's first intervention coming after only 11 minutes when Taiwo Awoniyi thought he had scored his fourth league goal of the season from close range after Brentford failed to clear a corner from the right.\nBut, unlike at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, the correct decision was made, with Awoniyi clearly offside and ahead of Wissa when the lines were added on to the video evidence.\nIt proved to be a busy afternoon for the VAR officials, with the red card and Norgaard's goal needing to be checked.\nDespite both of those decisions going their way and Brentford not judged offside for the goal, the visitors rued a missed opportunity."

But Wolves played with calmness and had a plan, exploiting the space behind the left side of City's defence, which first Neto and then Semedo did with such success.\nNeto's burst carried him to the byline, with Dias so desperate to stop the Portugal star's cross that he stuck out a leg and sent the ball looping into the net.\nFor the second, Matheus Cunha had the presence of mind to return the ball to Hwang, whose initial effort had been blocked.\nIn their last game on this ground, Wolves led for 48 minutes before eventually crumbling to defeat against Liverpool.\nThey were in no mood to let their big-name visitors off the hook a second time.\nGo straight to our Wolves page",

Nicolo Zaniolo was in an offside position when the ball left Watkins' boot for 2-0, but the video assistant referee ruled the winger was not obstructing Steele's line of vision and the goal was given.\nThe home side's third was also allowed to stand after Solly March had been caught by the falling Douglas Luiz in the build-up, but the half-time scoreline did not flatter Emery's team in the slightest.\nDe Zerbi's half-time introduction of Fati, Joao Pedro and Tariq Lamptey paid immediate dividends as the Barcelona loanee bundled home his first goal for the club, but the effort failed to spark a second half revival as Villa went on to rub further salt into the visitors' wounds.\nThis was the first time Brighton conceded six goals in a single top-flight game - and the first time in any league match since a 6-0 defeat by West Ham in the Championship in April 2012."

Send us your views here\nWatkins at heart of scintillating display\nBoth these teams were knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek, Villa losing at 2-1 home to Everton and Brighton going down 1-0 at Chelsea.\nThat was Villa's first home defeat since February, but Emery's team delivered the perfect response as they repeatedly tore into the Seagulls, ruthlessly exposing the visitors' vulnerability on the counter-attack.\nWatkins, who had scored just once in his past 12 league outings prior to last weekend's winner at Chelsea, was a constant threat and could have had a hat-trick in the first half - but sent a fierce effort agonisingly wide of the far post with the score still 1-0.\nThere was an element of fortune about the forward's third of the match, which struck Webster and looped high into the Brighton net, but it was no more than the former Brentford man deserved after a scintillating performance in front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate.\nThe 27-year-old has now scored in each of his past four Premier League appearances against Brighton - only Sergio Aguero, Jamie Vardy and Phil Foden had previously found the net in four successive top-flight appearances against the Seagulls.\nRamsey added a fifth with a curling, right-footed shot from the corner of the penalty area, before Douglas Luiz pounced on a rebound from Watkins' saved effort to complete the rout deep into added time.\nThis was Villa's 10th home league win in a row - their best run since registering 13 home league victories in succession 40 years ago.\nNightmare afternoon for Seagulls\nBrighton boss Roberto de Zerbi was linked with the Real Madrid manager's job in midweek but this was a sobering afternoon for his side, who could have taken an early lead through Estupinan but were second best from the moment Watkins broke the deadlock after 14 minutes.\nThe full-back poked into the arms of Emiliano Martinez after running on to Billy Gilmour's lofted through ball, but the chance proved to be the high point of a wretched afternoon for the visitors.\nBrighton may feel aggrieved by Villa's second and third goals. Nicolo Zaniolo was in an offside position when the ball left Watkins' boot for 2-0, but the video assistant referee ruled the winger was not obstructing Steele's line of vision and the goal was given.\nThe home side's third was also allowed to stand after Solly March had been caught by the falling Douglas Luiz in the build-up, but the half-time scoreline did not flatter Emery's team in the slightest.\nDe Zerbi's half-time introduction of Fati, Joao Pedro and Tariq Lamptey paid immediate dividends as the Barcelona loanee bundled home his first goal for the club, but the effort failed to spark a second half revival as Villa went on to rub further salt into the visitors' wounds.\nThis was the first time Brighton conceded six goals in a single top-flight game - and the first time in any league match since a 6-0 defeat by West Ham in the Championship in April 2012.",

Send us your views here\nSpurs' patience rewarded by slice of fortune\nSpurs knew they were under pressure to to find a winner against a side who have joined them as one of the early Premier League pacesetters.\nIt is to their credit that there was no sense of panic in their approach even as the seconds ticked away and Liverpool's red wall of defensive defiance kept them at bay, helped by keeper Alisson proving such a relentless barrier.\nSpurs showed their new-found belief throughout the game and, despite some groans when Dejan Kulusevski played the ball back to Porro at the end of six minutes of stoppage time, their patience was rewarded with a large slice of good fortune as Matip's attempted clearance deflection carried such power that even Alisson was rendered powerless.\nIt was a climax which sparked wild scenes around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where the atmosphere has been transformed since Postecoglou's arrival.\nMaddison was once again pulling the strings, playing a key part in Son's opener, while the intensity and determination is bringing roars of approval from Spurs fans who have suffered under the stodgy styles of previous bosses Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte.\nThis may only be a pretty fortunate late victory against nine men, but a three points swing over this increasingly formidable Liverpool team will send confidence soaring even higher at Spurs.\nLiverpool left heartbroken and fuming\nMatip's misery was the final straw for Liverpool after a game in which manager Klopp and his players were convinced officialdom and the fates conspired against them cruelly.\nKlopp complained bitterly about Jones and Jota being sent off, while the decision to rule out Diaz's first-half goal for offside was clearly an enormous error.\nTheir sense of injustice will have felt even more acute given the manner in which they organised themselves in a 5-3-0 formation, with a world-class last line of defence in keeper Alisson, to keep Spurs at arm's length once they were down to nine men.\nLiverpool have shown they can get results with reduced numbers this season, having beaten Bournemouth and Newcastle United despite being down to ten men, but this time it just proved a step too far.\nKlopp, however, will be rightly proud of the way Liverpool gathered themselves to get within seconds of a valuable point.\nThe Reds' attacking prowess is well known but this was a show of quality and character at the other end of the field, only for all their hard work to come to nothing after Matip's unwitting late intervention."

When the final whistle sounded, the chant had changed to \"Nunes, Nunes, what's the score\".\nAll the best Manchester City news and views in one place\nA bit of history for O'Neil\nIn achieving this victory, Wolves boss Gary O'Neil was joining an exclusive club.\nIn 44 previous Premier League meetings against sides managed by Englishmen, has Guardiola previously lost only once - against Graham Potter's Brighton in 2021.\nO'Neil can take pride in the fact this success was not achieved solely through backs-to-the-wall defending.\nThere was a bit of that - and goalkeeper Jose Sa was well placed to deal with efforts from Haaland and Alvarez, knowing the equaliser went right into the top corner. But Wolves played with calmness and had a plan, exploiting the space behind the left side of City's defence, which first Neto and then Semedo did with such success.\nNeto's burst carried him to the byline, with Dias so desperate to stop the Portugal star's cross that he stuck out a leg and sent the ball looping into the net.\nFor the second, Matheus Cunha had the presence of mind to return the ball to Hwang, whose initial effort had been blocked.\nIn their last game on this ground, Wolves led for 48 minutes before eventually crumbling to defeat against Liverpool.\nThey were in no mood to let their big-name visitors off the hook a second time.\nGo straight to our Wolves page"

We could have nicked it at the end.\n\"It is a clean sheet away from home and we would have done anything for results and performances like that last season.\n\"There are some good signs in the team and there have been for a few weeks now.\""

The on-loan Leeds winger brilliantly lofted a first-time finish into an unguarded net.\nThe Toffees could have had a third on the stroke of half-time, but Dominic Calvert-Lewin's towering header at the back post rattled the crossbar.\nBut the home side remained buoyant against a dire Cherries team and sealed victory on the hour mark when Abdoulaye Doucoure smashed in, just as he did on the final day of last season to ensure survival.\nWins will make 'more people smile' - Dyche hails Everton triumph\n'No magic wand' to fix Everton, say 777 Partners\nHow did you rate Everton's performance?

Celebrations were short-lived, however, as Villa hit back inside two minutes with defender Pau Torres' first goal for the club.\nA lack of goalmouth action was the overriding feature of a disjointed first half that featured more yellow cards than shots on target as referee Rob Jones had his hands full in trying to keep a lid on a feisty West Midlands derby.\nVilla's Matty Cash registered the only effort on goal when he met John McGinn's cross in the opening 10 minutes, but it was straight at goalkeeper Jose Sa.\nThe second-half goals helped the game come to life and Wolves had a golden chance to snatch victory in the final 10 minutes when Sasa Kalajdzic squared for Neto, but the Portuguese lacked composure as he blazed over from eight yards out.\nWolves had to hang on during 12 minutes of stoppage time, playing most of the additional minutes with only 10 men after Mario Lemina was shown a second yellow card for pulling back Nicolo Zaniolo. In the final action of the game they were almost undone, Villa striker Ollie Watkins' header only denied by the woodwork.\nThe draw moved Wolves up to 14th and four points clear of the relegation zone heading into the international break, while Villa stayed fifth.\nWolves lacking potency in final third\nHwang is fast becoming Wolves' key man having scored his fifth goal of the campaign - already surpassing his tally of three in the league last season and matching the five he scored in 2021-22.\nHe has now scored six of his side's past 10 goals in the Premier League and is the club's first player to net in five consecutive top-flight games since John Richards did so in six successive matches in 1973.\nThe South Korea international was receiving treatment just moments before he put his side ahead, having been caught in the face by the swinging arm of Diego Carlos. He recovered quickly to make an intelligent run across the front of Ezri Konsa and meet a cut-back from Neto after some fine solo work on the flank from the winger.\nOf Wolves' attacking play and his own form, Hwang said: \"He [Neto] is amazing, we understand each other very well. Not just with Neto, but with Cunha and every team player. Our team vibe is very positive. We keep going and try to manage our game. We are going a good way.\n\"I [have] scored five at the moment but the most important thing is for the team to win. Last week was a big win [against Manchester City] - we are hungry and can do better.\n\"So far we have done very well. This game was very tough but we got a very important point.\"\nNeto was also lively and enjoyed plenty of success against Villa wing-back Lucas Digne, claiming his fifth assist of the season and moving level with Tottenham's James Maddison at the top of that list.\nHowever, Wolves' other attackers - Matheus Cunha, Kaladjdzic and Fabio Silva - all failed to muster a shot on target.\nIndeed, they had three efforts directly on goal over the course of the game and have struggled in that department all season with just newly promoted trio Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton finding the target on fewer occasions.\nVilla extend unbeaten run\nVilla have won just once at Molineux since 2012, and that victory in 2020 was when the game was played behind closed doors during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nDespite having a quick turnaround after beating Zrinjski Mostar 1-0 in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, Villa were the brighter of the sides in the opening stages.\nUnai Emery set his side out in a 3-4-2-1, as he has done in three of their five games on the road in the Premier League this season, deploying Cash and Digne as wing-backs and giving them licence to get into the final third.\nAnd Cash almost capitalised on that freedom when he ghosted in at the far post to volley McGinn's cross but Sa stood firm.\nAs the half developed, the match lost all rhythm as ill discipline and poorly-timed challenges prevented any meaningful action.\nVilla found it difficult to find a supply line for in-form striker Watkins in that first period but he got a sight at goal just a minute after the restart when he stretched to poke the ball at goal, forcing Sa into action.\nThe England international, who signed a new five-year contract this week, did have a hand in the goal with his cross finding Torres lurking at the far post.\nThe Spaniard's first goal for his new club after a summer move from Villarreal ensured a positive run now extending to four unbeaten in the Premier League stretches into the international break.\nReaction to Wolves v Aston Villa live, plus all of Sunday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Wolves' performance?

Send us your views here\nArsenal show their mettle\nArsenal seemed gripped with nerves early on against a City team who have maintained such a stranglehold on them in the Premier League in recent years.\nRaya was hesitant, especially with the ball at his feet, and even the Arsenal fans who have been so supportive of Mikel Arteta's side were showing signs of impatience.\nThe introduction of Martinelli for Leandro Trossard after the break made a huge difference as the Brazilian ran at the City defence and finally posed problems - even though visiting keeper Ederson was initially largely untroubled.\nArsenal were organised and resilient in defence, keeping Erling Haaland at bay, and all their hard work was rewarded with the winner, albeit with it coming through that crucial deflection off Ake.\nCity and Pep Guardiola have cast a shadow over Arsenal in recent years, not least when they hauled them in at the critical point of last season's title race, but this victory will surely give the Gunners huge self-belief.\nSaka not available for England, says Arteta\nCity come up short\nCity previously had to go back to December 2018 to recall the taste of successive Premier League defeats, when they lost at home to Crystal Palace and away to Leicester City.\nThey dropped only three further points all season after that double jolt. Now they must recover again after losing in the league at Wolves and here at Arsenal, where they were way short of their best.\nCity, as usual, had plenty of possession, but they lacked their normal thrust and sharpness, with striker Haaland reduced to the role of a virtual spectator.\nThere was indiscipline, too, from Kovacic, who was fortunate to only be shown a yellow card for a poor challenge on Odegaard yet still followed it up almost immediately with another on Rice.\nThe indiscipline spilled over at the final whistle too as a clutch of City players including Haaland and Kyle Walker were involved in a heated exchange with a number of Arsenal's backroom staff.\nGuardiola's side will be bitterly disappointed with these past two league results - but history shows City have the quality and character to return to their best swiftly.",

Send us your views here\nSignificant win or papering over the cracks?\nIt is impossible to underestimate what McTominay's double will do for morale around United during the international break.\nLike Maguire, the midfielder could have left Old Trafford in the summer, so it is ironic the pair combined to salvage what had been set to be a desperate situation for Ten Hag.\nAverting that 1977 statistic and, more pertinently, three home defeats in a week against opposition most observers would expect them to dismiss relatively comfortably, provides breathing space from a suffocating situation.\nBut once the sugar rush of the euphoria has subsided, Ten Hag will know he has a lot of work to do to even make United into the coherent outfit he turned them into last season.\n'Football can be brutal' - Frank on Man Utd defeat\nThere is no-one who epitomises United's malaise more than Marcus Rashford.\nAlthough it was after the World Cup he really went on the surge that took him to 30 goals last season, he had scored five by this point last term. Now he is stuck on the single effort he scored against Arsenal on 3 September.\nRashford's body language is poor. At one point he tried to control a high punt out of the Brentford area, only for the ball to bounce under his foot and out for a throw, which he took himself and then ambled towards the area.\nWhen he did chase back to play a pass to Onana as Brentford countered from a United corner, Rashford was ponderous as he then made his way forward again, even though the hosts transitioned the ball into attack fairly quickly.\nHe did draw a low save out of Brentford's Premier League debutant keeper Thomas Strakosha as the opening period was drawing to a close but he also sent a speculative effort drifting well wide 10 minutes into the second half.\nIt was all so far removed from the Rashford he is when at his dangerous best, using his pace to unsettle even the best defences, and it was no surprise when he was taken off with barely an hour gone as Ten Hag chased the game.\nAs it turned out, United had to wait for another 24 minutes for the substitution that made the difference.\nBrentford's pain\nEven as the Brentford fans celebrated Jensen giving them the lead, they would have been wary.\nGoing into the game, they had dropped more points from winning positions than any other top-flight team.\nYet, until the mad ending, they actually looked more like adding to their lead than conceding an equaliser.\nNeal Maupay and Christian Norgaard both had efforts touched over by United keeper Andre Onana, who had hardly covered himself in glory with the Brentford goal.\nIt was actually a catalogue of defensive errors that started with Casemiro gifting possession to Brentford deep inside his own half when he was under no pressure.\nThe Brazilian then missed a rescuing tackle before Victor Lindelof's attempted clearance went straight to a visiting player inside the United box. Jensen applied the low finish, which Onana failed to keep out.\nFor so long, it looked like being enough to secure Brentford their first Old Trafford win since 1937. McTominay had other ideas.",

We could have nicked it at the end.\n\"It is a clean sheet away from home and we would have done anything for results and performances like that last season.\n\"There are some good signs in the team and there have been for a few weeks now.\"",

Send us your views here\nArsenal show their mettle\nArsenal seemed gripped with nerves early on against a City team who have maintained such a stranglehold on them in the Premier League in recent years.\nRaya was hesitant, especially with the ball at his feet, and even the Arsenal fans who have been so supportive of Mikel Arteta's side were showing signs of impatience.\nThe introduction of Martinelli for Leandro Trossard after the break made a huge difference as the Brazilian ran at the City defence and finally posed problems - even though visiting keeper Ederson was initially largely untroubled.\nArsenal were organised and resilient in defence, keeping Erling Haaland at bay, and all their hard work was rewarded with the winner, albeit with it coming through that crucial deflection off Ake.\nCity and Pep Guardiola have cast a shadow over Arsenal in recent years, not least when they hauled them in at the critical point of last season's title race, but this victory will surely give the Gunners huge self-belief.\nSaka not available for England, says Arteta\nCity come up short\nCity previously had to go back to December 2018 to recall the taste of successive Premier League defeats, when they lost at home to Crystal Palace and away to Leicester City.\nThey dropped only three further points all season after that double jolt. Now they must recover again after losing in the league at Wolves and here at Arsenal, where they were way short of their best.\nCity, as usual, had plenty of possession, but they lacked their normal thrust and sharpness, with striker Haaland reduced to the role of a virtual spectator.\nThere was indiscipline, too, from Kovacic, who was fortunate to only be shown a yellow card for a poor challenge on Odegaard yet still followed it up almost immediately with another on Rice.\nThe indiscipline spilled over at the final whistle too as a clutch of City players including Haaland and Kyle Walker were involved in a heated exchange with a number of Arsenal's backroom staff.\nGuardiola's side will be bitterly disappointed with these past two league results - but history shows City have the quality and character to return to their best swiftly."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brentford's display? Send us your views here\nSignificant win or papering over the cracks?\nIt is impossible to underestimate what McTominay's double will do for morale around United during the international break.\nLike Maguire, the midfielder could have left Old Trafford in the summer, so it is ironic the pair combined to salvage what had been set to be a desperate situation for Ten Hag.\nAverting that 1977 statistic and, more pertinently, three home defeats in a week against opposition most observers would expect them to dismiss relatively comfortably, provides breathing space from a suffocating situation.\nBut once the sugar rush of the euphoria has subsided, Ten Hag will know he has a lot of work to do to even make United into the coherent outfit he turned them into last season.\n'Football can be brutal' - Frank on Man Utd defeat\nThere is no-one who epitomises United's malaise more than Marcus Rashford.\nAlthough it was after the World Cup he really went on the surge that took him to 30 goals last season, he had scored five by this point last term. Now he is stuck on the single effort he scored against Arsenal on 3 September.\nRashford's body language is poor. At one point he tried to control a high punt out of the Brentford area, only for the ball to bounce under his foot and out for a throw, which he took himself and then ambled towards the area.\nWhen he did chase back to play a pass to Onana as Brentford countered from a United corner, Rashford was ponderous as he then made his way forward again, even though the hosts transitioned the ball into attack fairly quickly.\nHe did draw a low save out of Brentford's Premier League debutant keeper Thomas Strakosha as the opening period was drawing to a close but he also sent a speculative effort drifting well wide 10 minutes into the second half.\nIt was all so far removed from the Rashford he is when at his dangerous best, using his pace to unsettle even the best defences, and it was no surprise when he was taken off with barely an hour gone as Ten Hag chased the game.\nAs it turned out, United had to wait for another 24 minutes for the substitution that made the difference.\nBrentford's pain\nEven as the Brentford fans celebrated Jensen giving them the lead, they would have been wary.\nGoing into the game, they had dropped more points from winning positions than any other top-flight team.\nYet, until the mad ending, they actually looked more like adding to their lead than conceding an equaliser.\nNeal Maupay and Christian Norgaard both had efforts touched over by United keeper Andre Onana, who had hardly covered himself in glory with the Brentford goal.\nIt was actually a catalogue of defensive errors that started with Casemiro gifting possession to Brentford deep inside his own half when he was under no pressure.\nThe Brazilian then missed a rescuing tackle before Victor Lindelof's attempted clearance went straight to a visiting player inside the United box. Jensen applied the low finish, which Onana failed to keep out.\nFor so long, it looked like being enough to secure Brentford their first Old Trafford win since 1937. McTominay had other ideas."

Celebrations were short-lived, however, as Villa hit back inside two minutes with defender Pau Torres' first goal for the club.\nA lack of goalmouth action was the overriding feature of a disjointed first half that featured more yellow cards than shots on target as referee Rob Jones had his hands full in trying to keep a lid on a feisty West Midlands derby.\nVilla's Matty Cash registered the only effort on goal when he met John McGinn's cross in the opening 10 minutes, but it was straight at goalkeeper Jose Sa.\nThe second-half goals helped the game come to life and Wolves had a golden chance to snatch victory in the final 10 minutes when Sasa Kalajdzic squared for Neto, but the Portuguese lacked composure as he blazed over from eight yards out.\nWolves had to hang on during 12 minutes of stoppage time, playing most of the additional minutes with only 10 men after Mario Lemina was shown a second yellow card for pulling back Nicolo Zaniolo. In the final action of the game they were almost undone, Villa striker Ollie Watkins' header only denied by the woodwork.\nThe draw moved Wolves up to 14th and four points clear of the relegation zone heading into the international break, while Villa stayed fifth.\nWolves lacking potency in final third\nHwang is fast becoming Wolves' key man having scored his fifth goal of the campaign - already surpassing his tally of three in the league last season and matching the five he scored in 2021-22.\nHe has now scored six of his side's past 10 goals in the Premier League and is the club's first player to net in five consecutive top-flight games since John Richards did so in six successive matches in 1973.\nThe South Korea international was receiving treatment just moments before he put his side ahead, having been caught in the face by the swinging arm of Diego Carlos. He recovered quickly to make an intelligent run across the front of Ezri Konsa and meet a cut-back from Neto after some fine solo work on the flank from the winger.\nOf Wolves' attacking play and his own form, Hwang said: \"He [Neto] is amazing, we understand each other very well. Not just with Neto, but with Cunha and every team player. Our team vibe is very positive. We keep going and try to manage our game. We are going a good way.\n\"I [have] scored five at the moment but the most important thing is for the team to win. Last week was a big win [against Manchester City] - we are hungry and can do better.\n\"So far we have done very well. This game was very tough but we got a very important point.\"\nNeto was also lively and enjoyed plenty of success against Villa wing-back Lucas Digne, claiming his fifth assist of the season and moving level with Tottenham's James Maddison at the top of that list.\nHowever, Wolves' other attackers - Matheus Cunha, Kaladjdzic and Fabio Silva - all failed to muster a shot on target.\nIndeed, they had three efforts directly on goal over the course of the game and have struggled in that department all season with just newly promoted trio Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton finding the target on fewer occasions.\nVilla extend unbeaten run\nVilla have won just once at Molineux since 2012, and that victory in 2020 was when the game was played behind closed doors during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nDespite having a quick turnaround after beating Zrinjski Mostar 1-0 in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, Villa were the brighter of the sides in the opening stages.\nUnai Emery set his side out in a 3-4-2-1, as he has done in three of their five games on the road in the Premier League this season, deploying Cash and Digne as wing-backs and giving them licence to get into the final third.\nAnd Cash almost capitalised on that freedom when he ghosted in at the far post to volley McGinn's cross but Sa stood firm.\nAs the half developed, the match lost all rhythm as ill discipline and poorly-timed challenges prevented any meaningful action.\nVilla found it difficult to find a supply line for in-form striker Watkins in that first period but he got a sight at goal just a minute after the restart when he stretched to poke the ball at goal, forcing Sa into action.\nThe England international, who signed a new five-year contract this week, did have a hand in the goal with his cross finding Torres lurking at the far post.\nThe Spaniard's first goal for his new club after a summer move from Villarreal ensured a positive run now extending to four unbeaten in the Premier League stretches into the international break.\nReaction to Wolves v Aston Villa live, plus all of Sunday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Wolves' performance?

Send us your views here\nBowen signs new contract with Hammers\nRelive West Ham's draw with Newcastle and follow the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nHammers snatch late leveller\nWest Ham fans went through a whole range of emotions across the 90 minutes.\nAt half-time, it looked as if their team would equal their best league start since the 1999-2000 season, putting themselves on track for 16 points after eight games with a win over a leggy Newcastle.\nMoyes' side were boosted by the return of forward Michail Antonio, who was back from a hip injury, and they took the lead from their first attack.\nEmerson knocked the ball around Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope, who had raced from his line, and a low cross allowed unmarked midfielder Soucek to tap into an empty net.\nWhen Newcastle responded at the start of an exciting second period, West Ham then appeared to be slipping to a third Premier League defeat in four matches.\nThat was until Kudus struck brilliantly from the edge of the penalty area.\nAnd in the last few seconds the home team nearly snatched victory when Jarrod Bowen's shot was saved by Pope, the ball just evading the onrushing Said Benrahma as he looked to knock in the rebound.\nAsked whether Kudus, 23, would start more for the Hammers, Moyes added: \"He will be in the team for years to come so we are not in a huge hurry.\n\"The team is getting good results, but he can play a big role in the future.\"\nAfter the match Moyes also confirmed England forward Jarrod Bowen had signed a new contract with the club.\nAll the latest West Ham news in one place\nClick here for Newcastle news, analysis and fan reaction\nTiredness a factor for Toon\nNewcastle manager Eddie Howe said his side's performance was \"probably a hangover from midweek\".\nFour days ago Newcastle were superb, beating French champions Paris St-Germain in the Champions League.\nBut in London they looked lethargic and only gave glimpses of their best in short, sharp moments.\nAfter going close to an equaliser through two Dan Burn headers, Isak levelled in the 57th minute, blasting the ball into the net after a free-kick was diverted into his path.\nFour minutes and 28 seconds later the Swedish forward added another, tapping in Kieran Trippier's pass across goal.\nIsak almost made it a first Premier League hat-trick but struck the post from a tight angle having dribbled the ball beyond West Ham keeper Alphonse Areola.\nThat was Newcastle's best chance for a third, but, with the visitors unable to kill off the game, tiredness came into play.\nWest Ham's five changes from their midweek XI compared to Newcastle's one became evident, with the Hammers far more energetic in the closing stages as they not only levelled but nearly found a very late winner.\n\"[It was] a really good response in the second half but we're frustrated not to get over the line,\" Howe told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"I think we did really well in the second half, showed great character to come back. We took control of the game, caused problems, created chances.\"\nThe international break means Eddie Howe's side next play on Saturday, 21 October, at home to Crystal Palace in the Premier League.\nWest Ham are away to Aston Villa a day later."

I said: 'Maybe, who knows.' But it is perfect because now I have scored my first goal.\n\"I think we showed a great mentality as a team.\"\nLuton had captain Tom Lockyer's low header chalked off when Elijah Adebayo was deemed to have fouled Cristian Romero as he headed Mads Andersen's free-kick across goal.\nA more positive approach in the second half led to them creating plenty of opportunities but Tottenham held on to leave Rob Edwards' side without a win at home this season.\nAnge Postecoglou's Spurs are now unbeaten in eight Premier League games and sit two points ahead of Manchester City, who face Arsenal on Sunday.\nSpurs continue unbeaten run\nRemarkably, the home side made it through the opening 20 minutes without conceding after Spurs had peppered the Luton goal.\nRicharlison twice had opportunities in the opening five minutes, but poked his first effort from Maddison's whipped cross over the bar before having a low drive saved by the boot of Thomas Kaminski in the Luton goal.\nPedro Porro then struck a shot wide and a poor Tom Lockyer clearance was snatched at by Son.\nBissouma had already ensured he would miss Spurs' next game by picking up a fifth booking of the season for dragging down Chiedozie Ogbene.\nBut the midfielder, who has had an impressive start to the campaign, then picked up a second yellow for diving on the edge of the Luton area.\nWhat did you make of Spurs' display?

But, having managed to get to half-time level, they emerged from the break with renewed belief.\nPaul Heckingbottom's side failed to attempt a shot in the first half as Fulham pushed for a deserved opener - and they were grateful to see Pereira blaze over at close range with the best chance before half-time.\nOli McBurnie had headed directly at Bernd Leno after being left unmarked at a corner, before Robinson's misfortune reignited hopes of a first victory.\nAuston Trusty was adamant Carlos Vinicius should have received further punishment for grabbing his neck, but Fulham were deserved winners in the end.\nAnd while this latest defeat added further pressure on Heckingbottom and his players going into the international break, it is the injury to Basham that will be of immediate concern."

The key word for us was 'tempo'; we started quick and that got us up and running. It put us in good stead for the rest of the game.\"\nRoy Hodgson's visitors were never in the game and couldn't match Newcastle's intensity, but will hope it is a minor blip in what has been a fine start to the season.\nNewcastle went in front when Trippier found Murphy with a sumptuous first-time pass and the winger lifted the ball over Sam Johnstone, who was caught in no-man's land.\nInitially called offside, VAR judged that Trippier's run in the build-up was impeccably timed, sending the St James' Park crowd wild.\nNewcastle's hold on the first half was released only sporadically by attacks from the visitors, and the hosts were out of sight by the break despite having squandered a number of chances.\nTrippier and Murphy were causing havoc down the right, and their link-up led to a pinpoint cross for Gordon to finish at the back post in the final minute of normal time.\nLongstaff then added the third, pouncing on a Marc Guehi slip to slot past the helpless Johnstone.\nPalace started the second half with a few signs of life; a more organised counter-press helping them break through the Newcastle lines.\nOdsonne Edouard was denied by a Jamaal Lascelles block, but Newcastle broke from the resulting corner, with Ward stepping in to cut out Murphy's Gordon-bound cross.\nThat ruthlessness on the break was evident again when just seconds after Palace had tested Nick Pope, Wilson finished off yet another swift move involving Murphy and Trippier.\nMagpies make it five straight home wins\nThe defeat at Brighton at the beginning of September feels like a long time ago.\nThat was Newcastle's last of three successive losses; they have since returned to their best, going eight games unbeaten in all competitions, scoring 22 goals and conceding just three.\nThey could have scored more on Saturday, particularly when Gordon hit the bar in a similar position from which he eventually profited.\nBruno Guimaraes was typically effervescent, while calls for Sean Longstaff to receive England recognition may echo beyond Tyneside after another goal, and Wilson proved a point to Gareth Southgate too.\nPalace porous in defence\nComing into this game, Palace had only conceded 18 goals in total since Hodgson's return to the club in March, but they were opened up far too easily from the start.\nWhile everything stemmed from Newcastle's right, the returning Jefferson Lerma and Cheick Doucoure looked off the pace in the middle, too.\nHodgson will rightly be concerned by such a damaging defeat, but it is still rare enough to count as an off day. With Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze still out injured though, their lack of any real threat going forward is arguably more pressing.\nRelive Newcastle v Crystal Palace here\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Send us your views here\nRaya struggles to convince\nArsenal will be delighted to have secured a point at Chelsea after struggling for their usual fluency. The Gunners deserve full credit for sticking in there to maintain their unbeaten Premier League run with a result that looked unlikely for most of the game.\nManager Mikel Arteta was berating his players regularly for their carelessness, but there can be no questions about their character as they snatched a point with that late rally.\nIt was not a display without question marks, though, and the biggest will be over David Raya's poor performance in goal.\nArteta took a big decision when he replaced long-time first choice and England keeper Aaron Ramsdale with his summer signing from Brentford for the visit to Everton in September.\nFor all Arteta's talk of competition for places, it is clear he was installing the 28-year-old Spain international as his main keeper and much was riding on his choice.\nIt is a move that has not yet worked as Arteta hoped, with Raya looking uncertain in recent games, at fault for a goal in the Champions League defeat away to Lens and getting away with moments of hesitation in the win against Manchester City.\nHere, he cut a nervous figure throughout and was embarrassed when he was caught badly out of position as Mykhailo Mudryk's delivery from the left flew over his head for Chelsea's second.\nRaya almost made matters worse when he passed the ball straight to Cole Palmer in front of goal shortly afterwards, but Chelsea let him off the hook.\nArteta appears to have backed Raya but certainly needs the keeper to start performing better - and quickly - to deliver any sort of convincing case that he is a genuine upgrade on Ramsdale.\nFrustration for improving Chelsea\nChelsea looked like winners of this game for so long that to let it slip so late and so carelessly will almost feel like a defeat for Mauricio Pochettino and his players.\nFor long periods, Chelsea impressed and looked like a side finally heading in the right direction after a horrendous period on and off the pitch.\nThe goals from Palmer and Mudryk looked to have them on course for a third successive league win as Chelsea produced their best performance since Pochettino was appointed in the summer.\nMudryk looked like a player with increasing confidence, while Moises Caicedo was doing that understated but so effective job as a holding midfield man which persuaded Chelsea to pay Brighton \u00a3115m to secure his services.\nIronically, given Raya's struggles in the Arsenal goal, it was the poor clearance from his opposite number Sanchez that gifted Rice the goal that changed the whole emphasis and tone of the game.\nThose in blue at Stamford Bridge were suddenly nervous, Arsenal were invigorated, and the equaliser soon came from Trossard.\nThere was so much to admire in this Chelsea performance, and when the disappointment subsides Pochettino may be able to appreciate this, but there is no doubt the dramatic conclusion here at Stamford Bridge provided a bitter pill for the home side to swallow.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

We defended well then at the end we made a second mistake.\"\nIt leaves winless Bournemouth in the relegation zone, while Wolves picked up their third victory in nine Premier League matches on manager Gary O'Neil's return to his former club.\n\"Honestly, I feel no different to when we beat Manchester City or Everton,\" said O'Neil.\n\"I have huge respect for everyone at Bournemouth who gave me the opportunity to manage a Premier League team. A funny experience being back, but I enjoyed our performance.\"\nFrustrating afternoon for hosts as Cook sent off\nThere was plenty of excitement for a first look at Bournemouth's summer signing Alex Scott in the league - the highly-rated 20-year-old who joined from Bristol City had to bide his time in recovery from injury.\nHe slotted in seamlessly as Bournemouth started on the front foot when David Brooks finished off a well-worked move by drilling it straight into the arms of goalkeeper Jose Sa.\nHowever, there were early signs of Wolves' attacking threat with Pedro Neto and Hwang - who has scored five of their 11 goals in the Premier League this season - both causing problems.\nNeto's effort struck the crossbar early on and was a warning for Bournemouth, while Cunha was asking questions of the hosts' defence.\nThose two combined for Wolves' equaliser within minutes of the restart after the Cherries had struck first when Solanke, netting his fourth league goal of the season, flicked on a low cross from Billing, allowed to push on with Scott providing cover.\nThe match was finely poised at the start of the second half, but Wolves continued to threaten going forwards and after Cook's sending off, it was only a matter of time before they grabbed a winner.\n\"Lewis and Neto know they made the mistakes,\" added Iraola. \"We are not keeping the focus to compete and win games.\"I've not seen it repeated [the red card], but he was the first one to apologise. He left us in a difficult situation, but we were close to taking at least one point.

Have your say here.\nWhat did you make of Burnley's display? Send us your views here.\nReaction to Brentford v Burnley and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nBrentford claim much-needed win in style\nBrentford were minutes away from a famous victory at Manchester United in their last game before the international break, Scott McTominay's late double condemning the Bees to a 2-1 defeat which manager Frank described as \"brutal\".\nThat was the sixth time this season that Frank's side had dropped points from a winning position but this time, after Wissa had opened the scoring against Burnley, the hosts managed not only to preserve their lead but added to it - courtesy of two superb efforts.\nThey could, and perhaps should, have been further ahead by half-time but Maupay, Frank Onyeka and Mbeumo all failed to make the most of opportunities.\nMaupay will have felt particularly aggrieved after his early header was disallowed for offside against Ajer - who did not appear to be interfering with play when Mbeumo's free-kick left his boot.\nThe Everton loanee also dragged a low shot wide of the far post, had an effort cleared off the line by the retreating Dara O'Shea and had a fierce strike magnificently tipped over the crossbar by Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford.\nThere was little the 21-year-old could do about Brentford's second and third goals, however, as the Bees earned their first league win since beating London rivals Fulham more than two months ago.\nStruggling Clarets leaking goals\nBurnley registered their first victory of the campaign at Luton in their last away game but the defensive frailties that have plagued the Clarets for much of the season resurfaced at the Gtech Community Stadium.\nThe visitors were frustrated not to have been awarded a first-half penalty when Mike Tresor went to ground under Onyeka's challenge, but Brentford - who registered 15 attempts in the first half - would have been out of sight by the interval had it not been for Trafford.\nThe former Manchester City goalkeeper brilliantly kept out Christian Norgaard's drive after it had taken a wicked deflection off Wissa, before denying Maupay with another superb save.\nBurnley were their own worst enemy at times, with O'Shea having to slide Maupay's shot off the line after Ameen Al-Dakhil had carelessly given away possession deep inside the Clarets half.\nVincent Kompany's team made a brighter start to the second period and should have made it 2-1 through Koleosho, but their hopes of getting anything from the game were all but ended when Roberts was given his marching orders with 12 minutes remaining.\nThe result means Burnley have lost seven of their opening nine matches in a top-flight campaign for the first time since 1888-89.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Arsenal's display? Send us your views here\nRaya struggles to convince\nArsenal will be delighted to have secured a point at Chelsea after struggling for their usual fluency. The Gunners deserve full credit for sticking in there to maintain their unbeaten Premier League run with a result that looked unlikely for most of the game.\nManager Mikel Arteta was berating his players regularly for their carelessness, but there can be no questions about their character as they snatched a point with that late rally.\nIt was not a display without question marks, though, and the biggest will be over David Raya's poor performance in goal.\nArteta took a big decision when he replaced long-time first choice and England keeper Aaron Ramsdale with his summer signing from Brentford for the visit to Everton in September.\nFor all Arteta's talk of competition for places, it is clear he was installing the 28-year-old Spain international as his main keeper and much was riding on his choice.\nIt is a move that has not yet worked as Arteta hoped, with Raya looking uncertain in recent games, at fault for a goal in the Champions League defeat away to Lens and getting away with moments of hesitation in the win against Manchester City.\nHere, he cut a nervous figure throughout and was embarrassed when he was caught badly out of position as Mykhailo Mudryk's delivery from the left flew over his head for Chelsea's second.\nRaya almost made matters worse when he passed the ball straight to Cole Palmer in front of goal shortly afterwards, but Chelsea let him off the hook.\nArteta appears to have backed Raya but certainly needs the keeper to start performing better - and quickly - to deliver any sort of convincing case that he is a genuine upgrade on Ramsdale.\nFrustration for improving Chelsea\nChelsea looked like winners of this game for so long that to let it slip so late and so carelessly will almost feel like a defeat for Mauricio Pochettino and his players.\nFor long periods, Chelsea impressed and looked like a side finally heading in the right direction after a horrendous period on and off the pitch.\nThe goals from Palmer and Mudryk looked to have them on course for a third successive league win as Chelsea produced their best performance since Pochettino was appointed in the summer.\nMudryk looked like a player with increasing confidence, while Moises Caicedo was doing that understated but so effective job as a holding midfield man which persuaded Chelsea to pay Brighton \u00a3115m to secure his services.\nIronically, given Raya's struggles in the Arsenal goal, it was the poor clearance from his opposite number Sanchez that gifted Rice the goal that changed the whole emphasis and tone of the game.\nThose in blue at Stamford Bridge were suddenly nervous, Arsenal were invigorated, and the equaliser soon came from Trossard.\nThere was so much to admire in this Chelsea performance, and when the disappointment subsides Pochettino may be able to appreciate this, but there is no doubt the dramatic conclusion here at Stamford Bridge provided a bitter pill for the home side to swallow.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

We will miss him.\"\nCharlton's ill health in recent years means Ten Hag never got to meet the man who has a statue in his honour outside Old Trafford and after whom the main stand is named.\nThe Dutchman would not have to walk around Old Trafford's rooms too much to understand the legacy Charlton leaves; the visiting fans chanted his name before kick-off and after the final whistle.\n\"Of course we are very sad and our thoughts are with his family and especially his wife Lady Norma, his children and his grandchildren,\" said Ten Hag.\n\"It is a legend, a giant passing away. His achievements are so immense and huge. It is global, not only England; you see the facts he achieved is incredible.\n\"All the games; his titles, his trophies, the contribution he had with his goals. I never had the honour to meet him but I heard, despite all his trophies and games, he was so humble.\n\"A big personality and an example for all of us as a footballer and also in society and global wide.\n\"It was an extra motivation, absolutely.\"\nReaction as Manchester United win at struggling Sheffield United\nMan Utd struggles continue despite win\nCharlton is one of the most significant figures in the storied history of Manchester United that the current crop of players are finding it difficult to live up to.\nEven in victory, at times they looked disjointed.\nTheir struggles were encapsulated in stoppage time when Antony Martial was presented with a three-on-one situation as he bore down on the home goal.\nMartial elected to go left to fellow substitute Alejandro Garnacho rather than right to Bruno Fernandes. Garnacho put the chance wide, but it transpired he had run offside anyway.\nSofyan Amrabat operated as a de-facto quarter-back, playing deeper than Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof, who were given the responsibility of starting attacks but rarely did so with any speed or purpose.\nFernandes flicked a first-half free-kick off the crossbar and Amrabat's long-range effort thudded against the other one after the break.\nHowever, other than an excellent save from Wes Foderingham to deny Rasmus Hojlund and Marcus Rashford sending an low effort wide of the far post, the visitors were not convincing, until Dalot stepped in to win it.\nBlades lack cutting edge\nSheffield United suffered a club record eight-goal hammering by Newcastle on their last outing on home soil.\nThere are two sides to Paul Heckingbottom's team though. There is also the one that was level with Manchester City with five minutes left and that led at Tottenham heading into injury time.\nThis performance was very much from the latter variety.\nCameron Archer forced Andre Onana into two decent first-half saves, the second of which also required some assistance from Amrabat.\nThe Blades' midfield passing game was sharp and exploited the gaps that appeared as their opponents struggled with the positional aspect of their game.\nAt one point, Onana went down apparently injured, triggering the visitors entire outfield contingent to head over to their manager on the touchline for what was something akin to a tactical time-out.\nA dipping, swerving long-range second-half effort from substitute Rhian Brewster also tested Onana.\nThe thunderous manner of McBurnie's equaliser suggested that despite their plight, there is still belief in the Sheffield United camp.\nBut the fact it was the Scotland forward's first goal of the season also shows the class to make a tangible impact at this level is simply not there.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

We defended well then at the end we made a second mistake.\"\nIt leaves winless Bournemouth in the relegation zone, while Wolves picked up their third victory in nine Premier League matches on manager Gary O'Neil's return to his former club.\n\"Honestly, I feel no different to when we beat Manchester City or Everton,\" said O'Neil.\n\"I have huge respect for everyone at Bournemouth who gave me the opportunity to manage a Premier League team. A funny experience being back, but I enjoyed our performance.\"\nFrustrating afternoon for hosts as Cook sent off\nThere was plenty of excitement for a first look at Bournemouth's summer signing Alex Scott in the league - the highly-rated 20-year-old who joined from Bristol City had to bide his time in recovery from injury.\nHe slotted in seamlessly as Bournemouth started on the front foot when David Brooks finished off a well-worked move by drilling it straight into the arms of goalkeeper Jose Sa.\nHowever, there were early signs of Wolves' attacking threat with Pedro Neto and Hwang - who has scored five of their 11 goals in the Premier League this season - both causing problems.\nNeto's effort struck the crossbar early on and was a warning for Bournemouth, while Cunha was asking questions of the hosts' defence.\nThose two combined for Wolves' equaliser within minutes of the restart after the Cherries had struck first when Solanke, netting his fourth league goal of the season, flicked on a low cross from Billing, allowed to push on with Scott providing cover.\nThe match was finely poised at the start of the second half, but Wolves continued to threaten going forwards and after Cook's sending off, it was only a matter of time before they grabbed a winner.\n\"Lewis and Neto know they made the mistakes,\" added Iraola. \"We are not keeping the focus to compete and win games.\"I've not seen it repeated [the red card], but he was the first one to apologise. He left us in a difficult situation, but we were close to taking at least one point. We conceded in the worst way.\"\nScott was one of those sacrificed as his Premier League debut ended after 57 minutes.\nCook's red card ends Bournemouth's run of 66 games without having a player sent off, while Wolves ended a run of 11 Premier League matches where they had failed to win after conceding the opening goal.\n\"I was disappointed with a couple of our yellow cards,\" said Wolves boss O'Neil.\n\"Cunha was booked for dissent, we're still picking up too many yellow cards.

The key word for us was 'tempo'; we started quick and that got us up and running. It put us in good stead for the rest of the game.\"\nRoy Hodgson's visitors were never in the game and couldn't match Newcastle's intensity, but will hope it is a minor blip in what has been a fine start to the season.\nNewcastle went in front when Trippier found Murphy with a sumptuous first-time pass and the winger lifted the ball over Sam Johnstone, who was caught in no-man's land.\nInitially called offside, VAR judged that Trippier's run in the build-up was impeccably timed, sending the St James' Park crowd wild.\nNewcastle's hold on the first half was released only sporadically by attacks from the visitors, and the hosts were out of sight by the break despite having squandered a number of chances.\nTrippier and Murphy were causing havoc down the right, and their link-up led to a pinpoint cross for Gordon to finish at the back post in the final minute of normal time.\nLongstaff then added the third, pouncing on a Marc Guehi slip to slot past the helpless Johnstone.\nPalace started the second half with a few signs of life; a more organised counter-press helping them break through the Newcastle lines.\nOdsonne Edouard was denied by a Jamaal Lascelles block, but Newcastle broke from the resulting corner, with Ward stepping in to cut out Murphy's Gordon-bound cross.\nThat ruthlessness on the break was evident again when just seconds after Palace had tested Nick Pope, Wilson finished off yet another swift move involving Murphy and Trippier.\nMagpies make it five straight home wins\nThe defeat at Brighton at the beginning of September feels like a long time ago.\nThat was Newcastle's last of three successive losses; they have since returned to their best, going eight games unbeaten in all competitions, scoring 22 goals and conceding just three.\nThey could have scored more on Saturday, particularly when Gordon hit the bar in a similar position from which he eventually profited.\nBruno Guimaraes was typically effervescent, while calls for Sean Longstaff to receive England recognition may echo beyond Tyneside after another goal, and Wilson proved a point to Gareth Southgate too.\nPalace porous in defence\nComing into this game, Palace had only conceded 18 goals in total since Hodgson's return to the club in March, but they were opened up far too easily from the start.\nWhile everything stemmed from Newcastle's right, the returning Jefferson Lerma and Cheick Doucoure looked off the pace in the middle, too.\nHodgson will rightly be concerned by such a damaging defeat, but it is still rare enough to count as an off day. With Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze still out injured though, their lack of any real threat going forward is arguably more pressing.\nRelive Newcastle v Crystal Palace here\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

But he steered them to European qualification last season and now they are back within a point of the Champions League places.\n'We need to take our dreams' - special season for 'flying' Villa?\nDouglas Luiz relishing Emery approach\nSeveral players have been revitalised by Emery's arrival at Villa Park, including Douglas Luiz. Previously seen as a holding midfielder, he scored three league goals during Gerrard's tenure, which lasted just under a year.\nBut the adventurous, attacking formation that Emery has deployed - with three at the back and Matty Cash and Lucas Digne as wing-backs - allows Douglas Luiz the freedom to move into a more advanced role.\nThe 25-year-old had already forced West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola to turn a shot wide before scoring for a sixth league game running at Villa Park.\nNicolo Zaniolo, assisting an Italian investigation into alleged illegal betting activity, remains available to Villa and the on-loan Italy winger cut the ball back for Watkins, who in turn laid it off for Douglas Luiz to beat Areola with a 20-yard strike into the bottom corner.\nThe partnership that Watkins and summer signing Moussa Diaby have already struck up has also proved pivotal for Villa this season.\nBefore the game they had created 14 chances for one another in the Premier League this season - four more than any other duo - and Diaby made two more for Watkins in the first half.\nWatkins dragged the first effort wide from right in front of goal before unleashing a low strike from outside the box that Areola had to palm into the side-netting.\nDouglas Luiz doubled Villa's lead, slotting a penalty down the middle after Ezri Konsa had been fouled, before Watkins, who scored his third goal for England during the international break, made no mistake after latching on to John McGinn's long ball, firing inside the near post.\nFor Villa's fourth, Youri Tielemans fed the ball into fellow substitute Bailey, who showed neat footwork inside the box before curling inside the far post.\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance? Have your say here\nPaqueta poor for compatriot's double\nWest Ham's development under David Moyes has also been highly impressive, if a little more gradual.\nAfter winning the Europa Conference League last season, the Hammers have continued to look sharp and Bowen tested Emiliano Martinez in the first half of this tussle while Lucas Paqueta lost his bearings in a good position and sent an acrobatic overhead kick away from goal.\nBut the Brazilian, who almost joined Manchester City in the summer, switched off as he let compatriot Douglas Luiz get a free run towards goal to score the opener.\nJust after half-time, a loose pass backwards from Paqueta allowed Konsa to nip in front of Edson Alvarez, who brought down the Villa defender for the penalty.\nBowen gave the Hammers hope as a speculative effort resulted in his 100th career goal for a league club - his first also came at Villa Park in August 2017, earning Hull a 1-1 draw in the Championship.\nCash turned a Nayef Aguerd effort behind as the visitors briefly threatened an equaliser, but they were unable to avoid a third league defeat - their first two were against Manchester City and Liverpool.\nWhat did you make of West Ham's display?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here\nSalah secures the points\nThe two sides have had contrasting campaigns so far, with Liverpool looking to challenge for the title while Everton are languishing close to the relegation zone once more.\nThe 243rd Merseyside derby was a close affair but it was the Reds who came out on top once more, courtesy of star man Salah's thumping penalty and close-range finish in injury time.\nThe home supporters needed a lift and someone to stand up and provide the impetus for the result, and it was Salah who again provided it - although Liverpool may have had luck on their side.\nThe penalty was given after referee Craig Pawson came to the pitchside monitor and adjudged that Keane had handled the ball, while the official did not send Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate off following a foul on Everton forward Beto while already on a booking.\nReds boss Klopp reacted by immediately substituting Konate and bringing on Joel Matip as he successfully looked to hold on to a clean sheet.\nLiverpool have a stranglehold on results in this fixture and have now lost just one in 28 meetings against the Blues, that solitary defeat coming at Anfield in February 2021.\nBut Liverpool's home form is formidable and it was always going be a big ask for a struggling Everton side to travel the short distance home with anything, as Klopp's side have lost just one of their last 45 matches on their own turf.\nThe German boss also surpassed former Liverpool and Everton boss Rafael Benitez as the manager with most derby wins in the Premier League with nine.\nAfter Salah's opener, substitute Harvey Elliott forced Pickford into a fine save, tipping a vicious effort on to the crossbar, before Salah sealed victory in the 97th minute.\nWill Everton feel hard done by?\nIt could have been a very different result had Calvert-Lewin's early chance gone in, and it turned out to be their only shot on target in the game.\nBut the gameplan had to change after Young's red card, with the former England international failing to keep his cool in the pressurised situation of a derby.\nAlready on a booking, the full-back lunged in on Diaz for a second mistimed challenge and was dismissed on 38 minutes, much to the anger of Dyche.\nThe Everton manager will also point to Reds defender Konate doing similar in the second period when the match was goalless.\nEverton were unable to spring a surprise after coming into the game in buoyant mood on the back of a 3-0 win over Bournemouth, and they return the short distance home across Stanley Park empty handed.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nSalah secures the points\nThe two sides have had contrasting campaigns so far, with Liverpool looking to challenge for the title while Everton are languishing close to the relegation zone once more.\nThe 243rd Merseyside derby was a close affair but it was the Reds who came out on top once more, courtesy of star man Salah's thumping penalty and close-range finish in injury time.\nThe home supporters needed a lift and someone to stand up and provide the impetus for the result, and it was Salah who again provided it - although Liverpool may have had luck on their side.\nThe penalty was given after referee Craig Pawson came to the pitchside monitor and adjudged that Keane had handled the ball, while the official did not send Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate off following a foul on Everton forward Beto while already on a booking.\nReds boss Klopp reacted by immediately substituting Konate and bringing on Joel Matip as he successfully looked to hold on to a clean sheet.\nLiverpool have a stranglehold on results in this fixture and have now lost just one in 28 meetings against the Blues, that solitary defeat coming at Anfield in February 2021.\nBut Liverpool's home form is formidable and it was always going be a big ask for a struggling Everton side to travel the short distance home with anything, as Klopp's side have lost just one of their last 45 matches on their own turf.\nThe German boss also surpassed former Liverpool and Everton boss Rafael Benitez as the manager with most derby wins in the Premier League with nine.\nAfter Salah's opener, substitute Harvey Elliott forced Pickford into a fine save, tipping a vicious effort on to the crossbar, before Salah sealed victory in the 97th minute.\nWill Everton feel hard done by?\nIt could have been a very different result had Calvert-Lewin's early chance gone in, and it turned out to be their only shot on target in the game.\nBut the gameplan had to change after Young's red card, with the former England international failing to keep his cool in the pressurised situation of a derby.\nAlready on a booking, the full-back lunged in on Diaz for a second mistimed challenge and was dismissed on 38 minutes, much to the anger of Dyche.\nThe Everton manager will also point to Reds defender Konate doing similar in the second period when the match was goalless.\nEverton were unable to spring a surprise after coming into the game in buoyant mood on the back of a 3-0 win over Bournemouth, and they return the short distance home across Stanley Park empty handed.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

But he steered them to European qualification last season and now they are back within a point of the Champions League places.\n'We need to take our dreams' - special season for 'flying' Villa?\nDouglas Luiz relishing Emery approach\nSeveral players have been revitalised by Emery's arrival at Villa Park, including Douglas Luiz. Previously seen as a holding midfielder, he scored three league goals during Gerrard's tenure, which lasted just under a year.\nBut the adventurous, attacking formation that Emery has deployed - with three at the back and Matty Cash and Lucas Digne as wing-backs - allows Douglas Luiz the freedom to move into a more advanced role.\nThe 25-year-old had already forced West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola to turn a shot wide before scoring for a sixth league game running at Villa Park.\nNicolo Zaniolo, assisting an Italian investigation into alleged illegal betting activity, remains available to Villa and the on-loan Italy winger cut the ball back for Watkins, who in turn laid it off for Douglas Luiz to beat Areola with a 20-yard strike into the bottom corner.\nThe partnership that Watkins and summer signing Moussa Diaby have already struck up has also proved pivotal for Villa this season.\nBefore the game they had created 14 chances for one another in the Premier League this season - four more than any other duo - and Diaby made two more for Watkins in the first half.\nWatkins dragged the first effort wide from right in front of goal before unleashing a low strike from outside the box that Areola had to palm into the side-netting.\nDouglas Luiz doubled Villa's lead, slotting a penalty down the middle after Ezri Konsa had been fouled, before Watkins, who scored his third goal for England during the international break, made no mistake after latching on to John McGinn's long ball, firing inside the near post.\nFor Villa's fourth, Youri Tielemans fed the ball into fellow substitute Bailey, who showed neat footwork inside the box before curling inside the far post.\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance? Have your say here\nPaqueta poor for compatriot's double\nWest Ham's development under David Moyes has also been highly impressive, if a little more gradual.\nAfter winning the Europa Conference League last season, the Hammers have continued to look sharp and Bowen tested Emiliano Martinez in the first half of this tussle while Lucas Paqueta lost his bearings in a good position and sent an acrobatic overhead kick away from goal.\nBut the Brazilian, who almost joined Manchester City in the summer, switched off as he let compatriot Douglas Luiz get a free run towards goal to score the opener.\nJust after half-time, a loose pass backwards from Paqueta allowed Konsa to nip in front of Edson Alvarez, who brought down the Villa defender for the penalty.\nBowen gave the Hammers hope as a speculative effort resulted in his 100th career goal for a league club - his first also came at Villa Park in August 2017, earning Hull a 1-1 draw in the Championship.\nCash turned a Nayef Aguerd effort behind as the visitors briefly threatened an equaliser, but they were unable to avoid a third league defeat - their first two were against Manchester City and Liverpool.\nWhat did you make of West Ham's display?

We will miss him.\"\nCharlton's ill health in recent years means Ten Hag never got to meet the man who has a statue in his honour outside Old Trafford and after whom the main stand is named.\nThe Dutchman would not have to walk around Old Trafford's rooms too much to understand the legacy Charlton leaves; the visiting fans chanted his name before kick-off and after the final whistle.\n\"Of course we are very sad and our thoughts are with his family and especially his wife Lady Norma, his children and his grandchildren,\" said Ten Hag.\n\"It is a legend, a giant passing away. His achievements are so immense and huge. It is global, not only England; you see the facts he achieved is incredible.\n\"All the games; his titles, his trophies, the contribution he had with his goals. I never had the honour to meet him but I heard, despite all his trophies and games, he was so humble.\n\"A big personality and an example for all of us as a footballer and also in society and global wide.\n\"It was an extra motivation, absolutely.\"\nReaction as Manchester United win at struggling Sheffield United\nMan Utd struggles continue despite win\nCharlton is one of the most significant figures in the storied history of Manchester United that the current crop of players are finding it difficult to live up to.\nEven in victory, at times they looked disjointed.\nTheir struggles were encapsulated in stoppage time when Antony Martial was presented with a three-on-one situation as he bore down on the home goal.\nMartial elected to go left to fellow substitute Alejandro Garnacho rather than right to Bruno Fernandes. Garnacho put the chance wide, but it transpired he had run offside anyway.\nSofyan Amrabat operated as a de-facto quarter-back, playing deeper than Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof, who were given the responsibility of starting attacks but rarely did so with any speed or purpose.\nFernandes flicked a first-half free-kick off the crossbar and Amrabat's long-range effort thudded against the other one after the break.\nHowever, other than an excellent save from Wes Foderingham to deny Rasmus Hojlund and Marcus Rashford sending an low effort wide of the far post, the visitors were not convincing, until Dalot stepped in to win it.\nBlades lack cutting edge\nSheffield United suffered a club record eight-goal hammering by Newcastle on their last outing on home soil.\nThere are two sides to Paul Heckingbottom's team though. There is also the one that was level with Manchester City with five minutes left and that led at Tottenham heading into injury time.\nThis performance was very much from the latter variety.\nCameron Archer forced Andre Onana into two decent first-half saves, the second of which also required some assistance from Amrabat.\nThe Blades' midfield passing game was sharp and exploited the gaps that appeared as their opponents struggled with the positional aspect of their game.\nAt one point, Onana went down apparently injured, triggering the visitors entire outfield contingent to head over to their manager on the touchline for what was something akin to a tactical time-out.\nA dipping, swerving long-range second-half effort from substitute Rhian Brewster also tested Onana.\nThe thunderous manner of McBurnie's equaliser suggested that despite their plight, there is still belief in the Sheffield United camp.\nBut the fact it was the Scotland forward's first goal of the season also shows the class to make a tangible impact at this level is simply not there.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

We were much more on the front foot. We pressed them higher and our reaction was really good.\n\"We have to give credit to the players.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester City's display? Send us your views here\nMan City hit their stride\nManchester City have looked short of their best on occasions this season, even when spending so much time at the top of the Premier League, but the reigning champions gave an ominous display here to outclass their arch-rivals.\nHaaland's hunger for goals is insatiable, with United keeper Onana doing well to deny him twice, while the manner in which they exposed the home side's flaws was brutal.\nIn contrast to United's shapeless efforts, City were measured, controlled and passed the ball around with the confidence of a team that knew they were up against opponents nowhere near their level.\nFoden's goal gave the scoreline a far more realistic appearance as City exerted a stranglehold throughout. Further goals would not have flattered them, with the left-flank work of Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva particularly fruitful.\nThe return from John Stones after injury only adds to their quality - as was proved with a performance that outlined the task facing anyone wanting to wrest the title away from them.\nMan Utd outclassed\nThe sight of thousands of empty seats all around Old Trafford in the closing stages of this derby told the tale of a truly miserable and chastening day for Manchester United.\nIn the moments after the tribute to Charlton, the stadium was a cauldron of sounds as United fans urged their side forward - but the difference in class was swiftly clear.\nUnited had their chances, particularly when Ederson saved from McTominay and when the struggling Marcus Rashford sent a great chance wide, but Ten Hag's side were short on ideas, creation and urgency, and were outmanoeuvred by this outstanding City team.\nHojlund may have conceded a penalty but the youngster's endeavour was admirable and Old Trafford made its feelings known with loud jeers when he was substituted late on.\nUnited looked to have made steps forward last season, when they beat City in the Premier League at Old Trafford, but this was a worrying sight for Ten Hag, whose team looked like they were heading backwards."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Burnley's display? Send us your views here\nCherries win in front of owner Foley\nResponding to speculation about his future before this match, Iraola said he \"understands\" the rumours surrounding his Bournemouth tenure but remains focused on getting the Cherries out of their current predicament.\nThis win, in front of watching owner Bill Foley, will go a long way to easing some of the scrutiny on the former Rayo Vallecano boss, whose team created the better opportunities after falling behind to Taylor's early effort.\nThe Burnley full-back's 11th-minute opener appeared to spark the hosts into life, and they should have restored parity prior to Semenyo's goal when Tavernier somehow scuffed a low effort into the ground and over the crossbar from point-blank range.\nMepham sent a free header straight at Trafford not long after the leveller, while Billing blazed over the crossbar as Bournemouth ended the first half in the ascendancy.\nCherries fans sung Iraola's name as the home side pressed for a second-half winner, and they were finally rewarded for their efforts when Billing found the net from about 40 yards out with 15 minutes remaining.\nBournemouth had to endure a nervous wait while Rodriguez's goal was checked by VAR before being ruled out, but a late Burnley equaliser would have been harsh on Iraola and his players.\nClarets denied after long VAR review\nVincent Kompany said Burnley were \"nowhere near Premier League standards\" in last Saturday's defeat at Brentford, and the Clarets can have few complaints about the outcome on the south coast after being second best for long spells.\nKompany's team missed the aerial presence of Lyle Foster, who was ruled out after falling ill on the morning of the game.\nTaylor had not scored since finding the net for Leeds in a Championship fixture against MK Dons in 2015, but Burnley failed to build on the full-back's early strike and were indebted to Trafford for keeping them on level terms in the first half.\nRodriguez had not seen much of the ball after replacing Zeki Amdouni at half-time, but the former Southampton and West Brom striker thought he had earned the visitors a precious point when he found the bottom corner with a low left-footed strike.\nThe forward appeared to be just ahead of Bournemouth defender Lloyd Kelly when the ball was played to him, but it took VAR more than five minutes to rule the goal out.\nBurnley have now lost three top-flight games this season after scoring the opening goal - more than any other side.",

I think the spell between the first and second goal we were dominant and played some really good football and then still think the lads handled [the end of the match] well.\n\"We haven't faced that situation this year and there was a really clear-headedness about the team.

Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Spurs' performance? Have your say here\nMaddison is Spurs' key man again\nPostecoglou's impact on the Spurs squad cannot be underestimated - he is not only enjoying the best start to a season by a new manager in Premier League history, but has also guided his team to their second best start to a top-flight campaign.\nSpurs' best ever start came in the 1960-61 season, when they went on to win the league title. While it is early days, fans will be starting to dream of a title challenge this term too.\nKey to Tottenham's impressive form this term has been the irrepressible Maddison, who has appeared right at home in this Spurs team ever since his summer transfer from Leicester City, and it came as no surprise that he was at the heart of both goals at Selhurst Park.\nSpurs were much improved after the break following a tight first half in which Palace striker Odsonne Edouard went closest with a low strike that was pushed away by Guglielmo Vicario.\nPalace had defended solidly and maintained their shape well for 52 minutes, but they buckled when Maddison found space inside the penalty area drove the ball powerfully across the face of goal to deflect in off Ward.\nAfter that Tottenham, and Maddison in particular, found space more frequently and he played a significant part in the second, carrying the ball forward and gliding into the box before feeding Johnson, whose cutback was converted by Son.\nMaddison and Son's ability to maintain their stellar form will be key in determining just seriously Tottenham can challenge at the top of the table as the season progresses, but right now both players are looking unstoppable.\nHistory suggests Spurs title challenge is on\nThough Postecoglou and his Spurs squad will likely insist they are not getting carried away about a potential title challenge, the statistics look very positive:\nTottenham are the 13th side in Premier League history to take 26 points or more from their first 10 games of a season. Of the previous 12 sides, 11 of them finished in the top three, and half of them went on to win the title.\nThe only side to have such an impressive start and not finish in the top three was Newcastle back in 1994-95, when they finished sixth.\nHowever, that was in a 42-game season. Every side to take 26 points or more after 10 games of a 38-game season has finished in the top three.\nTottenham's current five-point lead is their biggest lead over second place in the top-flight since the final day of the 1960-61 campaign (eight points), when they last won the title.\nAnd one stat that will please Spurs fans even more - Arsenal's 'Invincibles' team of 2003/04 earned 24 points in their first 10 games, two fewer than this Tottenham side.\n\"It's been a fantastic start to the season that none of us expected,\" former Manchester United defender Gary Neville said on Sky Sports. \"With Harry Kane leaving, it was inconceivable.\n\"Those Tottenham fans have had a lot of pain with the way the team has played and results [in recent years], but they are playing great football.\n\"They should enjoy it, but there's a long way to go.\"\u2060\nPositives for Palace despite loss\nCrystal Palace have enjoyed a decent start to the season under Roy Hodgson, but have come out of two difficult games against Newcastle and now Tottenham with zero points, conceding six goals and scoring only once.\nBut, while the 4-0 loss to Eddie Howe's side was a poor performance from start to finish, there were signs of encouragement in this display against a team continuing a stunning run of form.\nThey frustrated their opponents in the first half and created the better chances, but ultimately Ward's moment of misfortune proved decisive.\nIt may have ended in defeat but this battling display was more like what Hodgson surely wanted to see after following the meek capitulation at Newcastle last time out."

It was a great turn and finish - it is very difficult to defend.\"\nHis movement and link-up play also caused trouble for the home defence, with his flick-on for team-mate Abdoulaye Doucoure shortly after the goal almost ending up in a second for the visitors.\nHammers keeper Alphonse Areola denied Doucoure with a sharp save, meaning Everton had to defend doggedly in the final stages to prevent West Ham grabbing a barely-deserved equaliser.\nPickford's save, along with the organisation led by centre-backs James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite, clinched only a fourth win on the road in 40 league matches for Everton.\nCalvert-Lewin received plenty of the plaudits as the squad celebrated with a jubilant away end to mark an emotional week on a high.\nHammers rue missed opportunities\nSwathes of empty seats in the home stands towards the end of the game indicated what the West Ham fans thought about their side's performance.\nWhile the Hammers had almost 65% possession, they created few clear-cut opportunities as they struggled to break down a resolute Everton side.\nIn-form winger Jarrod Bowen, whose six goals this season earned him an England recall last month, slashed wide their best chance in the first half and he also headed Aaron Cresswell's free-kick over the bar after the break.\nWest Ham continued to push and probe in a desperate search for an equaliser, but did not show enough quality - other than Benrahma's effort - to seriously stretch Everton.\n\"There was very, very little in the game,\" Moyes said.\n\"The one chance which came, they scored it. We missed two or three opportunities to score and you don't get loads. We didn't finish them off.\n\"We've scored in every other game this season but today we couldn't get through.

We are disappointed and frustrated by the result.\n\"For the performance, there was only one team on the pitch and this team was Brighton - we deserved to win.\n\"In the first half we played very well. After we conceded we played very well again and very good football.\"\nThe Seagulls are now without a win in four league games, drawing two and losing two - their longest run without victory since five winless matches when De Zerbi first took charge in October 2022.\nAfter the high of beating Ajax 2-0 in the Europa League on Thursday, the Italian made six changes to the starting line-up for Fulham's visit - but fatigue and rotation could be starting to take their toll.\nPositive point for Fulham\nFulham's chances were fleeting throughout the game and they did not register a shot on target until the second half as they struggled to match Brighton's tempo.\nJust five teams, including each of the three newly promoted sides, have scored fewer than the Cottagers' nine this campaign and they appear to be lacking a focal point to their attack.\nThe summer exit of last season's top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has joined Saudi side Al-Hilal, is being sorely felt.Palhinha earns point for Fulham at Brighton\nRaul Jimenez, signed from Wolves as a replacement for the Serbia international, was brought back into the starting 11 for the trip to Brighton but is yet to open his account for the club.\nThe Mexico striker has not scored in his past 32 Premier League appearances, a run that stretches back to his time at Molineux.\nBut Palhinha stepped up when it counted, spinning on the edge of the box and firing Fulham on to level terms to mark his 50th appearance for the club in style.\nIt is the second time the Portugal midfielder has scored in 2023-24, having also salvaged a point with a late strike in a 2-2 draw at Arsenal.\nFulham looked ready to kick on after the equaliser, with substitute Rodrigo Muniz testing goalkeeper Jason Steele with a clever flick of the heel as he met a low cross.\nBut they soon fell back into their shell, sitting back and soaking up pressure as they were seemingly satisfied with a share of the points.\nIt is now five games without a win for the Cottagers on the road, having only recorded one victory on their travels all season, although manager Marco Silva regarded a point at Brighton as a positive.\nHe told Match of the Day: \"I think we had too much respect for them in the first half, we did not decide well when to press, it was not a collective pressure.\n\"Second half was completely different. We were much more on the front foot. We pressed them higher and our reaction was really good.\n\"We have to give credit to the players. The reaction, the way we equalised, the big chance we had after we equalised.\n\"We showed good organisation to keep the result. At the end I think it was a fair result after our reaction in the second half.\"\nHow did you rate Brighton's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Fulham's display?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester City's display? Send us your views here\nMan City hit their stride\nManchester City have looked short of their best on occasions this season, even when spending so much time at the top of the Premier League, but the reigning champions gave an ominous display here to outclass their arch-rivals.\nHaaland's hunger for goals is insatiable, with United keeper Onana doing well to deny him twice, while the manner in which they exposed the home side's flaws was brutal.\nIn contrast to United's shapeless efforts, City were measured, controlled and passed the ball around with the confidence of a team that knew they were up against opponents nowhere near their level.\nFoden's goal gave the scoreline a far more realistic appearance as City exerted a stranglehold throughout. Further goals would not have flattered them, with the left-flank work of Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva particularly fruitful.\nThe return from John Stones after injury only adds to their quality - as was proved with a performance that outlined the task facing anyone wanting to wrest the title away from them.\nMan Utd outclassed\nThe sight of thousands of empty seats all around Old Trafford in the closing stages of this derby told the tale of a truly miserable and chastening day for Manchester United.\nIn the moments after the tribute to Charlton, the stadium was a cauldron of sounds as United fans urged their side forward - but the difference in class was swiftly clear.\nUnited had their chances, particularly when Ederson saved from McTominay and when the struggling Marcus Rashford sent a great chance wide, but Ten Hag's side were short on ideas, creation and urgency, and were outmanoeuvred by this outstanding City team.\nHojlund may have conceded a penalty but the youngster's endeavour was admirable and Old Trafford made its feelings known with loud jeers when he was substituted late on.\nUnited looked to have made steps forward last season, when they beat City in the Premier League at Old Trafford, but this was a worrying sight for Ten Hag, whose team looked like they were heading backwards.",

It was a great turn and finish - it is very difficult to defend.\"\nHis movement and link-up play also caused trouble for the home defence, with his flick-on for team-mate Abdoulaye Doucoure shortly after the goal almost ending up in a second for the visitors.\nHammers keeper Alphonse Areola denied Doucoure with a sharp save, meaning Everton had to defend doggedly in the final stages to prevent West Ham grabbing a barely-deserved equaliser.\nPickford's save, along with the organisation led by centre-backs James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite, clinched only a fourth win on the road in 40 league matches for Everton.\nCalvert-Lewin received plenty of the plaudits as the squad celebrated with a jubilant away end to mark an emotional week on a high.\nHammers rue missed opportunities\nSwathes of empty seats in the home stands towards the end of the game indicated what the West Ham fans thought about their side's performance.\nWhile the Hammers had almost 65% possession, they created few clear-cut opportunities as they struggled to break down a resolute Everton side.\nIn-form winger Jarrod Bowen, whose six goals this season earned him an England recall last month, slashed wide their best chance in the first half and he also headed Aaron Cresswell's free-kick over the bar after the break.\nWest Ham continued to push and probe in a desperate search for an equaliser, but did not show enough quality - other than Benrahma's effort - to seriously stretch Everton.\n\"There was very, very little in the game,\" Moyes said.\n\"The one chance which came, they scored it. We missed two or three opportunities to score and you don't get loads. We didn't finish them off.\n\"We've scored in every other game this season but today we couldn't get through. That's what you always get with Sean Dyche's teams, they defend well and make it difficult for you to get through.\"\nHow did you rate West Ham's performance?

Obviously hamstring injuries have very different levels of severity, so we're hoping it's on the smaller side.\n\"He's been a big part of what we've managed to do so far but, for however long he's out, the group is ready to make sure we keep producing performances and we keep picking up points.\"\nO'Neil will take some solace in the fact his side still managed to continue to apply pressure after Neto's departure as Hwang, Cunha, substitute Sasa Kalajdzic and Rayan Ait-Nouri all toiled in pursuit of a winner.\nAll the best Wolverhampton Wanderers news and views in one place\nPromising signs for depleted Newcastle\nNewcastle's start to the season has been strong, but concerns over a potential slip-up would have been merited with a depleted squad.\nSweden striker Isak was forced off after 15 minutes in Wednesday's Champions League defeat to Borussia Dortmund with a groin issue, Jacob Murphy has a shoulder injury, and Elliot Anderson has a back problem.\nAdded to such woes was the loss of key summer signing Sandro Tonali, who began a 10-month suspension on Saturday for breaching betting rules.\nBut their battling display at Molineux will have pleased boss Eddie Howe.\nWilson showed his quality, while Sean Longstaff also caused issues for the hosts with his midfield runs.

Send us your views here\nThe Gunners are unbeaten in 19 home games against United in all competitions since 1971.\nOnce they got in front, it seemed there would only be one outcome.\nUnited keeper Wes Foderingham saved fierce efforts from Gabriel Martinelli and Ben White as Arsenal asserted their dominance.\nNketiah steps up with Jesus absent\nNketiah came into the starting line-up in place of Gabriel Jesus, who injured a hamstring in the midweek Champions League win against Sevilla, and took his opportunity with both hands.\nHe was alert to Rice's pass, taking a brilliant touch to wrongfoot Auston Trusty and fire home.\nFoderingham flapped at a corner from Bukayo Saka and Nketiah pounced to slam in a half-volley from close range.\nThe confidence on display from Nketiah seemed to increase with each finish, culminating in a superb third.\nA lay-off from Emile Smith Rowe, making his first start of the season, gave Nketiah time and space to blast into the top corner. With less than an hour played, the match ball had been secured.\n\"It's amazing. It's not been easy - last month I lost my auntie so I want to dedicate these three goals to her. Her family was here watching so it is a really special moment,\" Nketiah told BBC Match of the Day.\nNketiah let Vieira take the penalty, sacrificing the chance to become only the third Arsenal player to score four goals in a Premier League match after Andrey Arshavin and Thierry Henry.\n\"My first instinct was to grab the ball and go, but Fabio won it and it was a good moment. It's all about being a team player. It was his time to get a chance and he tucked it away,\" added Nketiah.\nSaka was captain in Martin Odegaard's absence and, when he was substituted, he passed the armband to Nketiah, who captained Arsenal for the first time.\nJesus could only applaud in the stands as he watched Nketiah put in an accomplished display.\nBlades come up short again\nSheffield United have lost nine of their 10 league matches this season with a goal difference of minus 22 - the worst start by any side to a Premier League season.\nUnited did well to keep Arsenal at bay for the opening half an hour, but the defence wilted and left gaps open as Mikel Arteta's side grew in confidence.\nThe Blades had just two shots in the match, neither of which were on target.\nGustavo Hamer tried a spectacular effort from the halfway line but it sailed out for a goal kick as United's lack of attacking threat was laid bare.\nAfter Nketiah's hat-trick, it appeared as if Arsenal were happy with their lot, but two late lapses in concentration proved costly for United.\nNorwood gave away a poor penalty and then Tomiyasu was allowed to ghost past the United defence to complete the thrashing."

I think the spell between the first and second goal we were dominant and played some really good football and then still think the lads handled [the end of the match] well.\n\"We haven't faced that situation this year and there was a really clear-headedness about the team. There was no rushing and panic which is a good sign.\"\nReaction and analysis as Tottenham win at Crystal Palace\nWhat did you make of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Spurs' performance? Have your say here\nMaddison is Spurs' key man again\nPostecoglou's impact on the Spurs squad cannot be underestimated - he is not only enjoying the best start to a season by a new manager in Premier League history, but has also guided his team to their second best start to a top-flight campaign.\nSpurs' best ever start came in the 1960-61 season, when they went on to win the league title. While it is early days, fans will be starting to dream of a title challenge this term too.\nKey to Tottenham's impressive form this term has been the irrepressible Maddison, who has appeared right at home in this Spurs team ever since his summer transfer from Leicester City, and it came as no surprise that he was at the heart of both goals at Selhurst Park.\nSpurs were much improved after the break following a tight first half in which Palace striker Odsonne Edouard went closest with a low strike that was pushed away by Guglielmo Vicario.\nPalace had defended solidly and maintained their shape well for 52 minutes, but they buckled when Maddison found space inside the penalty area drove the ball powerfully across the face of goal to deflect in off Ward.\nAfter that Tottenham, and Maddison in particular, found space more frequently and he played a significant part in the second, carrying the ball forward and gliding into the box before feeding Johnson, whose cutback was converted by Son.\nMaddison and Son's ability to maintain their stellar form will be key in determining just seriously Tottenham can challenge at the top of the table as the season progresses, but right now both players are looking unstoppable.\nHistory suggests Spurs title challenge is on\nThough Postecoglou and his Spurs squad will likely insist they are not getting carried away about a potential title challenge, the statistics look very positive:\nTottenham are the 13th side in Premier League history to take 26 points or more from their first 10 games of a season. Of the previous 12 sides, 11 of them finished in the top three, and half of them went on to win the title.\nThe only side to have such an impressive start and not finish in the top three was Newcastle back in 1994-95, when they finished sixth.\nHowever, that was in a 42-game season. Every side to take 26 points or more after 10 games of a 38-game season has finished in the top three.\nTottenham's current five-point lead is their biggest lead over second place in the top-flight since the final day of the 1960-61 campaign (eight points), when they last won the title.\nAnd one stat that will please Spurs fans even more - Arsenal's 'Invincibles' team of 2003/04 earned 24 points in their first 10 games, two fewer than this Tottenham side.\n\"It's been a fantastic start to the season that none of us expected,\" former Manchester United defender Gary Neville said on Sky Sports. \"With Harry Kane leaving, it was inconceivable.\n\"Those Tottenham fans have had a lot of pain with the way the team has played and results [in recent years], but they are playing great football.\n\"They should enjoy it, but there's a long way to go.\"\u2060\nPositives for Palace despite loss\nCrystal Palace have enjoyed a decent start to the season under Roy Hodgson, but have come out of two difficult games against Newcastle and now Tottenham with zero points, conceding six goals and scoring only once.\nBut, while the 4-0 loss to Eddie Howe's side was a poor performance from start to finish, there were signs of encouragement in this display against a team continuing a stunning run of form.\nThey frustrated their opponents in the first half and created the better chances, but ultimately Ward's moment of misfortune proved decisive.\nIt may have ended in defeat but this battling display was more like what Hodgson surely wanted to see after following the meek capitulation at Newcastle last time out.",

Send us your views here\nBrilliant Bees sting Chelsea\nBrentford have won on all three of their visits to Stamford Bridge as a Premier League club, and, although Chelsea were largely the better side, Brentford still created their fair share of chances.\nMathias Jensen was given room down the right just after half-time, cutting the ball back to Vitaly Janelt, who guided his shot straight at Sanchez.\nBrentford's goal was also created down the right when Mbeumo fired in a brilliant, pacy delivery and Pinnock sprinted to meet it with a powerful header.\nOn the break Yegor Yarmolyuk was clean through when he was kept out by Sanchez, before Mbeumo stabbed a shot narrowly wide.\nThomas Frank's side added a second when Mbeumo tapped the ball into an empty net with only Sanchez nearby.\nAfter a slow start to the season Brentford have now won two games in succession while extending their unbeaten run in London derbies to 13 matches.\nBlues wasteful at the Bridge\nChelsea have yet to find their groove under Mauricio Pochettino.\nAgainst Brentford - a side often praised for their organisation and defensive rigidity - they initially cut through at will, with Madueke curling an effort against the post in the first 10 minutes.\nCole Palmer looked impressive and crossed for an unmarked Marc Cucurella midway through the first half, but his first-time shot was straight at Flekken.\nAfter the restart Chelsea's wastefulness became more apparent and they did not have a shot on target in the second half.\nSince February Chelsea have won only two home league matches - against relegated Leeds last season and newly promoted Luton this term - and have failed to score in four of their 10 games this season.\nChelsea host on Blackburn in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday and Brentford entertain West Ham in the Premier League next Saturday."

Send us your views here\nBattling Blades secure first win\nSheffield United were enduring the worst ever start to a Premier League season until Norwood secured a vital home win.\nThe bleak run of results appeared set to continue when they had no shots on target in the first half and looked toothless in attack.\nPaul Heckingbottom's side have nine players out injured, including striker Oli McBurnie.\nRhian Brewster started his second consecutive league match up front but was once again unable to make an impact before coming off with a complaint just before the break.\nHowever, the home side looked much better in the second half, with Archer, James McAtee and Gustavo Hamer all firing shots over the bar.\nWhen the ball broke to Archer in the 72nd minute, his accomplished finish set United on course for victory. That was their first shot on target in 200 minutes of league football, since a Brewster effort in the 52nd minute against Manchester United.\nBellegarde's late equaliser threatened to deny the home side a win, but then came the late spot-kick.\nCaptain Norwood stepped up and scored what goes down as the third latest winner in a Premier League game, timed at 99 minutes and 16 seconds.\nThe hosts' refusal to accept a draw highlighted the resilience shown by the side who are already fighting against relegation.\nThey travel to Brighton next weekend with renewed confidence after a much-needed positive result.\nEventful cameo for Wolves' Silva\nPedro Neto was carried off with a hamstring injury in the 2-2 draw with Newcastle last weekend and Wolves missed his direct running and ability to create key chances.\nFabio Silva came on as a substitute in the 81st minute and had a big impact on proceedings.\nHe was booked after a minute and then left inconsolable after the final whistle having given away the penalty.\nHwang provided a few moments of inspiration, including the assist for Bellegarde's equaliser in the only real moment of quality for the away side.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-4 Chelsea: Nicolas Jackson scores hat-trick for Blues against nine-man Spurs\nMauricio Pochettino made a winning return to Tottenham with Chelsea as his former club were reduced to nine men on a night of chaos and controversy.\nThe Argentine's comeback was reduced to a minor sub-plot by an epic game which brought five goals, a further five which were disallowed, two red cards, and a slew of VAR decisions in one of the Premier League's most frenetic ever encounters.\nSpurs started brilliantly and deservedly went ahead when Dejan Kulusevski's sixth minute shot deflected in off Chelsea defender Levi Colwill, before Son Heung-min had an effort narrowly ruled out for offside as the home side looked to capitalise on their early dominance.\nIn a fevered atmosphere Chelsea had two goals of their own disallowed, one each from Raheem Sterling and Moises Caicedo ruled out for handball and offside respectively.\nThe latter situation still led to a Chelsea goal as a penalty was awarded for a crude challenge by Romero on compatriot Enzo Fernandez, and the Spurs defender was deservedly sent off in the aftermath.\nChelsea's summer signing Cole Palmer scored the resulting spot-kick to level the match before Spurs were also handicapped by what looked like a serious hamstring injury for key defender Micky van de Ven and an ankle problem for James Maddison as both players were substituted before the interval.\nSpurs were battling an even greater disadvantage when Destiny Udogie was sent off ten minutes after the break for an inexplicably reckless tackle on Sterling which brought a second yellow card from referee Michael Oliver.\nAnge Postecoglou, who also received a yellow card on the Spurs bench amid the mayhem, gambled on keeping a high line even with nine men but Chelsea finally broke their resistance with 15 minutes left, Raheem Sterling breaking clear to set up Nicolas Jackson for a simple finish.\nThe game was far from finished, though, and Spurs came close to securing a stunning draw as Eric Dier had a superb finish ruled out for a narrow offside and Rodrigo Bentancur headed just wide after beating Chelsea's defensive line at a late free-kick.\nJackson then scored twice more in stoppage time to secure a late hat-trick and render the scoreline far more comfortable than the evening had been for the visitors, who faced stern resistance from Spurs, who finally went down to their first Premier League defeat under Postecoglou.\n'One of the most mind-boggling Premier League games ever'\nUnpacking nine VAR checks in chaotic half of football\nTottenham v Chelsea as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nLack of discipline costs Spurs on night which promised so much\nSpurs fans were in buoyant mood before the game as they pondered the possibility of returning to the top of the Premier League, only to see their hopes extinguished in a spectacular, incident-packed game.\nIt all started so well with Kulusevski's goal but Spurs paid a heavy price for the reckless indiscipline of Romero, who was fortunate not to see red earlier than he did for kicking out at Colwill, but there was no escape when he followed through needlessly on Fernandez.\nUdogie was also lucky not to be sent off before his eventual dismissal for a wild challenge on Sterling, and the Italy international left the over-worked Oliver with no option when he dived in on the same player early in the second half.\nPostecoglou gambled on continuing with the high line and goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario hero acting as an emergency sweeper on several occasions, but just as Chelsea started to look frustrated, Spurs were broken and Jackson cashed in with his hat-trick.\nAside from the short-term pain of this defeat, Spurs now face long-term consequences from the chaos, not just with suspensions for Romero and Udogie but those injuries to Van de Ven and Maddison.\nSpurs supporters gave their players a rousing reception for their efforts at the final whistle but this was a painful night which could be very costly in the long run.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet Tottenham news, analysis, fan views and more sent straight to you\nGo to our dedicated Spurs page for all the best content\nChelsea and Jackson take big opportunity\nChelsea took their time to break down nine-man Spurs but eventually unlocked the defence, with Senegalese striker Nicolas Jackson the beneficiary.\nPochettino's men were already edging their way into the game even before Romero demonstrated his irresponsibility, but once he and Udogie were off Chelsea knew anything other than victory would have been unthinkable.\nThe home side made it to within 15 minutes of pulling off a remarkable draw before Sterling and Jackson finally cracked the code and this could be a landmark night for the 22-year-old striker, who has looked very much a work in progress since his summer move to Stamford Bridge.\nHe finish off three chances comfortably and marched off with the match ball, beaming in front of Chelsea's elated fans.\nPochettino will know this was not a victory earned in normal circumstances, but he will also aim to use it as a springboard after a middling start to the campaign.\nSign up for Chelsea news notifications\nGo straight to all the best Blues content\nOur

He was unable to convert several other opportunities and glaringly blazed over after Mohamed Salah nodded the ball to him in the six-yard box.\nThe result leaves Klopp's side third in the table, three points behind leaders Manchester City, while Luton have climbed out of the bottom three to 17th due to their superior goal difference over Bournemouth.\nSign up for Luton Town news notifications\nGet Liverpool news, analysis, podcasts and more sent straight to you\nLuton put Liverpool off their stride\nLiverpool arrived in Bedfordshire searching for their fifth consecutive win in all competitions, but only Diaz's late intervention spared them an embarrassing defeat against their unfancied opponents.\nWhile Liverpool's summer outlay on players was around \u00a3150m, Luton spent in the region of \u00a320m reinforcing their squad after completing a lengthy journey back to the English top flight.\nRelegated from the First Division the season before the Premier League was founded in 1992, they went on to spend five years as a non-league club.\nHowever, there was little to choose between the sides at times, with Luton's greater endeavour nullifying their opponents' obvious quality on the ball.\nThe Reds enjoyed plenty of possession and had 24 shots, but only six were on target and they appeared short of inspiration and efficiency in the final third until Elliott was introduced.\nHad Diogo Jota stroked in an early chance it may have altered the complexion of the match, but he saw his hurried effort saved at the near post by Thomas Kaminski.\nOnly three of Nunez's nine efforts were on target, while Cody Gakpo flicked wide from another Elliott delivery from the right.\nKlopp will also be concerned by the way Luton carved out openings, with Trent Alexander-Arnold struggling to contain Republic of Ireland winger Chiedozie Ogbene.\nOgbene surged past the England full-back during the first half to tee up Kabore and ghosted away from him and Ibrahima Konate in the second period to cut the ball back to Carlton Morris, who was denied by the onrushing Alisson.\nThe Brazilian keeper was unable to prevent Chong from finishing a move that started with a Liverpool corner, but Diaz was on hand to salvage a point for the Reds despite the ordeal he and his family are going through.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nEverton heading in right direction\nDyche will be left irritated his side could not cling on to all three points, but this was another promising performance from an Everton team who were so hapless at the start of the season.\nThe manager was adamant in those early weeks that Everton were heading in the right direction, despite losing four of their first five games - drawing the other at Sheffield United - and scoring only two goals.\nEverton have indeed turned the corner, suffering defeat in only two of their past eight games and also progressing to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday night.\nThe Toffees' trip to Brighton last season saw them claim arguably the most surprising result of the campaign as they came away with a thumping 5-1 victory, and this game back on home soil looked to be going in their favour too.\nMykolenko's early goal, reacting quickest after his first shot was kept out by Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen, put them on course for back-to-back league wins for the first time in 13 months.\nThey had only 20% possession but offered more of a goal threat and could have had more but Abdoulaye Doucoure, fresh off committing his future to the club until 2025, saw his thumping volley pushed away by Verbruggen.\nJames Garner curled a free-kick over and the imposing Dominic Calvert-Lewin dragged wide, while Dwight McNeil fired a low drive narrowly off target in the second half.\nThe hosts managed to shackle Brighton's attacking threat with the colossal Jarrad Branthwaite subduing teenage striker Evan Ferguson, who failed to make an impact before being substituted in the second half.\n\"It is definitely a point gained,\" said Dyche. \"They are a good outfit, we were very unfortunate with a massive deflection after them not having many chances at all.\n\"The tactical side of the game was fantastic from the players, we know they play with possession so you have to be patient.\"\nDyche praised his players' work ethic and said their mental development has been \"absolutely fantastic\" and has left him \"delighted with that side of the game\".\nThe former Burnley manager also felt his side should have had a penalty when Calvert-Lewin appeared to be bundled over by Jan Paul van Hecke and said: \"I spoke to the referee briefly and mentioned that the centre-half was the wrong side of Dom and that is when you get your arms around someone.\n\"The ball drops, it [the challenge] starts outside and he drags him inside the box, but it is a really important call and it went against us. I don't know how it went against us because I thought it was obvious.\"\nWith time running out, the fleetfooted Mitoma turned right and left before his cross into the box struck Young's knee and sailed over Pickford almost in slow motion before nestling in the back of the net.\nAfter a thrilling first season under De Zerbi in which they qualified for the Europa League, the Seagulls have hit a sticky patch this term, now winning just one of their last eight games in all competitions.\nThey may have felt aggrieved in the first half when Dunk looked to have equalised with a superb strike, but the celebrations were cut short after VAR adjudged him to be marginally offside.\nBrighton have had injuries to key players such as Pervis Estupinan, Danny Welbeck and Solly March to deal with, but their off-colour form will be of concern to the Italian manager.\nHe added: \"I am happy with the point, proud of the performance, but we are not in the best moment.\""

I asked him why he was here, why Manchester City had decided to invest in him. For his skills. What are his skills? Dribbling, be aggressive. Had he done it all his life? Do it [here].\n\"It is difficult to find a player today with the ability to dribble in small spaces. He's one of the fastest players in 5m. It's incredible how he can change the rhythm in 5m.\"\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here\nRelive Manchester City v Bournemouth and all of Saturday's Premier League action\nGuardiola plays down Haaland injury concern\nIn beating Bournemouth, City extended their record of winning every home game they have played in all competitions in 2023 to 22. They are now on a run of 14 successive victories against Bournemouth. Their 13 straight league wins against the Cherries is a Premier League record.\nAnd, as Guardiola pointed out, they achieved their biggest win of the season without any significant contribution from Haaland, who evidently felt pain in his ankle just before the break and flexed his leg a couple of times as he spoke to Julian Alvarez on his way to the dressing room.\nAt Borussia Dortmund, Haaland had injury issues which led to three absences of around a month. Since he came to the Premier League, the most he has sat out is a couple of matches.\nHowever, Guardiola didn't seem too concerned about the Norwegian, who has scored 65 times in 69 games for City.\n\"It was a twist with the ankle,\" he said.\n\"I didn't speak with the doctors. We will see in the next days... but hopefully,\" added Guardiola in relation to the Young Boys game.\nScott's Bournemouth injury fear\nBournemouth suffered another significant blow in addition to damage to their goal difference on a day when even limited pre-match expectations proved beyond them.\nYoung midfielder Alex Scott only made his debut a fortnight ago after arriving from Bristol City in the summer with an injury.\nThe 20-year-old, nicknamed the Guernsey Grealish after an impressive performance for his old club in this same stadium last season, appeared to be running off a dead leg when he was confronted by Rodri in the City box.\nThe block tackle that resulted left Scott on the floor and in obvious pain. There was no chance of him continuing and as the \u00a325m man was helped to the dressing room, Iraola had a consoling word.\n\"It is the other knee, something inside it,\" said Iraola.\n\"He says it doesn't feel it is bad but until he has been seen by the doctors we cannot say.\"",

He was unable to convert several other opportunities and glaringly blazed over after Mohamed Salah nodded the ball to him in the six-yard box.\nThe result leaves Klopp's side third in the table, three points behind leaders Manchester City, while Luton have climbed out of the bottom three to 17th due to their superior goal difference over Bournemouth.\nSign up for Luton Town news notifications\nGet Liverpool news, analysis, podcasts and more sent straight to you\nLuton put Liverpool off their stride\nLiverpool arrived in Bedfordshire searching for their fifth consecutive win in all competitions, but only Diaz's late intervention spared them an embarrassing defeat against their unfancied opponents.\nWhile Liverpool's summer outlay on players was around \u00a3150m, Luton spent in the region of \u00a320m reinforcing their squad after completing a lengthy journey back to the English top flight.\nRelegated from the First Division the season before the Premier League was founded in 1992, they went on to spend five years as a non-league club.\nHowever, there was little to choose between the sides at times, with Luton's greater endeavour nullifying their opponents' obvious quality on the ball.\nThe Reds enjoyed plenty of possession and had 24 shots, but only six were on target and they appeared short of inspiration and efficiency in the final third until Elliott was introduced.\nHad Diogo Jota stroked in an early chance it may have altered the complexion of the match, but he saw his hurried effort saved at the near post by Thomas Kaminski.\nOnly three of Nunez's nine efforts were on target, while Cody Gakpo flicked wide from another Elliott delivery from the right.\nKlopp will also be concerned by the way Luton carved out openings, with Trent Alexander-Arnold struggling to contain Republic of Ireland winger Chiedozie Ogbene.\nOgbene surged past the England full-back during the first half to tee up Kabore and ghosted away from him and Ibrahima Konate in the second period to cut the ball back to Carlton Morris, who was denied by the onrushing Alisson.\nThe Brazilian keeper was unable to prevent Chong from finishing a move that started with a Liverpool corner, but Diaz was on hand to salvage a point for the Reds despite the ordeal he and his family are going through.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

It's pleasing for us to score two goals in the way we thought we could create chances.\n\"A real gratitude to the players in terms of committing to the plan and we scored early in both halves.

The former Arsenal boss transformed their season from what appeared to be a relegation battle before guiding them into seventh in the table and European qualification for the first time in 13 years.\nThis defeat was his 14th in 45 matches in all competitions and only the fifth time Villa had been beaten in 17 games in 2023-24.\nDespite having far more of the ball, with 74% possession, Villa could not find a way through an organised backline, with Moussa Niakhate and Murillo defending excellently throughout for the home side.\nEngland striker Watkins should have got his sixth Premier League goal of the campaign but failed to get a good connection on a header.\nLeon Bailey fired wastefully over, Moussa Diaby has a shot saved and both Youri Tielemans and Lucas Digne missed the target on a frustrating day for Villa.\n\"We started the match very poor but we reacted well, we had chances and opportunities to score,\" said Emery.\n\"The players fought until the last minute. Of course it is hard to lose, but we have to accept it.\n\"We made two mistakes early in each half and it is difficult to come back. We have to be stronger defensively away if we want to get to be one of the top seven teams in the Premier League.\n\"I learn when we are winning, I learn when we draw and I learn when we are losing.\n\"It is one year since I arrived here. We have progressed, done a lot of work and I am proud of the players, but I want more. To increase the level is the next challenge I have.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

We are not playing like a month or two months ago but there are many reasons for it.\n\"It is not a very brilliant moment for us, but we are fighting. We played a good game, we didn't shoot enough to win the game and the result is a fair one.\n\"We have to create more chances to score but have to accept this moment. We are not winning as many games.\"\nFollow live coverage of Saturday's Premier League\nHow did you rate Everton's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brighton's display? Send us your views here\nEverton heading in right direction\nDyche will be left irritated his side could not cling on to all three points, but this was another promising performance from an Everton team who were so hapless at the start of the season.\nThe manager was adamant in those early weeks that Everton were heading in the right direction, despite losing four of their first five games - drawing the other at Sheffield United - and scoring only two goals.\nEverton have indeed turned the corner, suffering defeat in only two of their past eight games and also progressing to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday night.\nThe Toffees' trip to Brighton last season saw them claim arguably the most surprising result of the campaign as they came away with a thumping 5-1 victory, and this game back on home soil looked to be going in their favour too.\nMykolenko's early goal, reacting quickest after his first shot was kept out by Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen, put them on course for back-to-back league wins for the first time in 13 months.\nThey had only 20% possession but offered more of a goal threat and could have had more but Abdoulaye Doucoure, fresh off committing his future to the club until 2025, saw his thumping volley pushed away by Verbruggen.\nJames Garner curled a free-kick over and the imposing Dominic Calvert-Lewin dragged wide, while Dwight McNeil fired a low drive narrowly off target in the second half.\nThe hosts managed to shackle Brighton's attacking threat with the colossal Jarrad Branthwaite subduing teenage striker Evan Ferguson, who failed to make an impact before being substituted in the second half.\n\"It is definitely a point gained,\" said Dyche. \"They are a good outfit, we were very unfortunate with a massive deflection after them not having many chances at all.\n\"The tactical side of the game was fantastic from the players, we know they play with possession so you have to be patient.\"\nDyche praised his players' work ethic and said their mental development has been \"absolutely fantastic\" and has left him \"delighted with that side of the game\".\nThe former Burnley manager also felt his side should have had a penalty when Calvert-Lewin appeared to be bundled over by Jan Paul van Hecke and said: \"I spoke to the referee briefly and mentioned that the centre-half was the wrong side of Dom and that is when you get your arms around someone.\n\"The ball drops, it [the challenge] starts outside and he drags him inside the box, but it is a really important call and it went against us. I don't know how it went against us because I thought it was obvious.\"\nWith time running out, the fleetfooted Mitoma turned right and left before his cross into the box struck Young's knee and sailed over Pickford almost in slow motion before nestling in the back of the net.\nAfter a thrilling first season under De Zerbi in which they qualified for the Europa League, the Seagulls have hit a sticky patch this term, now winning just one of their last eight games in all competitions.\nThey may have felt aggrieved in the first half when Dunk looked to have equalised with a superb strike, but the celebrations were cut short after VAR adjudged him to be marginally offside.\nBrighton have had injuries to key players such as Pervis Estupinan, Danny Welbeck and Solly March to deal with, but their off-colour form will be of concern to the Italian manager.\nHe added: \"I am happy with the point, proud of the performance, but we are not in the best moment.\"",

It's pleasing for us to score two goals in the way we thought we could create chances.\n\"A real gratitude to the players in terms of committing to the plan and we scored early in both halves.

The former Arsenal boss transformed their season from what appeared to be a relegation battle before guiding them into seventh in the table and European qualification for the first time in 13 years.\nThis defeat was his 14th in 45 matches in all competitions and only the fifth time Villa had been beaten in 17 games in 2023-24.\nDespite having far more of the ball, with 74% possession, Villa could not find a way through an organised backline, with Moussa Niakhate and Murillo defending excellently throughout for the home side.\nEngland striker Watkins should have got his sixth Premier League goal of the campaign but failed to get a good connection on a header.\nLeon Bailey fired wastefully over, Moussa Diaby has a shot saved and both Youri Tielemans and Lucas Digne missed the target on a frustrating day for Villa.\n\"We started the match very poor but we reacted well, we had chances and opportunities to score,\" said Emery.\n\"The players fought until the last minute. Of course it is hard to lose, but we have to accept it.\n\"We made two mistakes early in each half and it is difficult to come back. We have to be stronger defensively away if we want to get to be one of the top seven teams in the Premier League.\n\"I learn when we are winning, I learn when we draw and I learn when we are losing.\n\"It is one year since I arrived here.

with Chelsea as his former club were reduced to nine men on a night of chaos and controversy.\nThe Argentine's comeback was reduced to a minor sub-plot by an epic game which brought five goals, a further five which were disallowed, two red cards, and a slew of VAR decisions in one of the Premier League's most frenetic ever encounters.\nSpurs started brilliantly and deservedly went ahead when Dejan Kulusevski's sixth minute shot deflected in off Chelsea defender Levi Colwill, before Son Heung-min had an effort narrowly ruled out for offside as the home side looked to capitalise on their early dominance.\nIn a fevered atmosphere Chelsea had two goals of their own disallowed, one each from Raheem Sterling and Moises Caicedo ruled out for handball and offside respectively.\nThe latter situation still led to a Chelsea goal as a penalty was awarded for a crude challenge by Romero on compatriot Enzo Fernandez, and the Spurs defender was deservedly sent off in the aftermath.\nChelsea's summer signing Cole Palmer scored the resulting spot-kick to level the match before Spurs were also handicapped by what looked like a serious hamstring injury for key defender Micky van de Ven and an ankle problem for James Maddison as both players were substituted before the interval.\nSpurs were battling an even greater disadvantage when Destiny Udogie was sent off ten minutes after the break for an inexplicably reckless tackle on Sterling which brought a second yellow card from referee Michael Oliver.\nAnge Postecoglou, who also received a yellow card on the Spurs bench amid the mayhem, gambled on keeping a high line even with nine men but Chelsea finally broke their resistance with 15 minutes left, Raheem Sterling breaking clear to set up Nicolas Jackson for a simple finish.\nThe game was far from finished, though, and Spurs came close to securing a stunning draw as Eric Dier had a superb finish ruled out for a narrow offside and Rodrigo Bentancur headed just wide after beating Chelsea's defensive line at a late free-kick.\nJackson then scored twice more in stoppage time to secure a late hat-trick and render the scoreline far more comfortable than the evening had been for the visitors, who faced stern resistance from Spurs, who finally went down to their first Premier League defeat under Postecoglou.\n'One of the most mind-boggling Premier League games ever'\nUnpacking nine VAR checks in chaotic half of football\nTottenham v Chelsea as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nLack of discipline costs Spurs on night which promised so much\nSpurs fans were in buoyant mood before the game as they pondered the possibility of returning to the top of the Premier League, only to see their hopes extinguished in a spectacular, incident-packed game.\nIt all started so well with Kulusevski's goal but Spurs paid a heavy price for the reckless indiscipline of Romero, who was fortunate not to see red earlier than he did for kicking out at Colwill, but there was no escape when he followed through needlessly on Fernandez.\nUdogie was also lucky not to be sent off before his eventual dismissal for a wild challenge on Sterling, and the Italy international left the over-worked Oliver with no option when he dived in on the same player early in the second half.\nPostecoglou gambled on continuing with the high line and goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario hero acting as an emergency sweeper on several occasions, but just as Chelsea started to look frustrated, Spurs were broken and Jackson cashed in with his hat-trick.\nAside from the short-term pain of this defeat, Spurs now face long-term consequences from the chaos, not just with suspensions for Romero and Udogie but those injuries to Van de Ven and Maddison.\nSpurs supporters gave their players a rousing reception for their efforts at the final whistle but this was a painful night which could be very costly in the long run.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet Tottenham

nine-man Spurs but eventually unlocked the defence, with Senegalese striker Nicolas Jackson the beneficiary.\nPochettino's men were already edging their way into the game even before Romero demonstrated his irresponsibility, but once he and Udogie were off Chelsea knew anything other than victory would have been unthinkable.\nThe home side made it to within 15 minutes of pulling off a remarkable draw before Sterling and Jackson finally cracked the code and this could be a landmark night for the 22-year-old striker, who has looked very much a work in progress since his summer move to Stamford Bridge.\nHe finish off three chances comfortably and marched off with the match ball, beaming in front of Chelsea's elated fans.\nPochettino will know this was not a victory earned in normal circumstances, but he will also aim to use it as a springboard after a middling start to the campaign.\nSign up for Chelsea news notifications\nGo straight to all the best Blues content\nOur

I asked him why he was here, why Manchester City had decided to invest in him. For his skills. What are his skills? Dribbling, be aggressive. Had he done it all his life? Do it [here].\n\"It is difficult to find a player today with the ability to dribble in small spaces. He's one of the fastest players in 5m. It's incredible how he can change the rhythm in 5m.\"\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display?

They are now on a run of 14 successive victories against Bournemouth. Their 13 straight league wins against the Cherries is a Premier League record.\nAnd, as Guardiola pointed out, they achieved their biggest win of the season without any significant contribution from Haaland, who evidently felt pain in his ankle just before the break and flexed his leg a couple of times as he spoke to Julian Alvarez on his way to the dressing room.\nAt Borussia Dortmund, Haaland had injury issues which led to three absences of around a month. Since he came to the Premier League, the most he has sat out is a couple of matches.\nHowever, Guardiola didn't seem too concerned about the Norwegian, who has scored 65 times in 69 games for City.\n\"It was a twist with the ankle,\" he said.\n\"I didn't speak with the doctors. We will see in the next days... but hopefully,\" added Guardiola in relation to the Young Boys game.\nScott's Bournemouth injury fear\nBournemouth suffered another significant blow in addition to damage to their goal difference on a day when even limited pre-match expectations proved beyond them.\nYoung midfielder Alex Scott only made his debut a fortnight ago after arriving from Bristol City in the summer with an injury.\nThe 20-year-old, nicknamed the Guernsey Grealish after an impressive performance for his old club in this same stadium last season, appeared to be running off a dead leg when he was confronted by Rodri in the City box.\nThe block tackle that resulted left Scott on the floor and in obvious pain. There was no chance of him continuing and as the \u00a325m man was helped to the dressing room, Iraola had a consoling word.\n\"It is the other knee, something inside it,\" said Iraola.\n\"He says it doesn't feel it is bad but until he has been seen by the doctors we cannot say.\""

The timing of the equaliser was perfect.\"\nHow did you rate Arsenal's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Burnley's display? Send us your views here\nReaction to Arsenal v Burnley and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nTrossard sets Arsenal on their way\nArsenal have had more than their fair share of injury troubles in recent weeks, but they were given a welcome boost before kick-off as Saka and Takehiro Tomiyasu, who both suffered knocks in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Sevilla, were passed fit to start.\nSaka was heavily involved in the early stages and went closest to giving the home side the lead inside the opening 20 minutes, his rising effort from the edge of the area tipped onto the crossbar by Clarets goalkeeper James Trafford.\nKai Havertz - who endured another frustrating afternoon - should have done better from a Saka corner and Trossard had another powerful drive tipped over by Trafford, but the Belgian made no mistake after Saka rose highest to steer a Zinchenko delivery into his path.\nThe Gunners are just the third Premier League side to score 1,000 goals at a venue since the 2006-07 season, after City (1,138 at Etihad Stadium) and Chelsea (1,028 at Stamford Bridge).\nThe home side felt Brownhill's second-half equaliser should have been disallowed for a foul on Tomiyasu by Luca Koleosho in the build-up - but they did not have to wait long to restore their advantage as Saliba was left unmarked to nod home his first of the campaign.\nThere were few complains from Arteta or his players when Vieira was dismissed for a reckless challenge on Brownhill, but Zinchenko's scissor kick nine minutes earlier had all but ended Burnley's hopes of salvaging a point.\nClarets show fight but defensive worries remain\nVincent Kompany's Burnley have now lost six consecutive games since claiming their first win of the season at Luton in early October, but they were very much in the game before Trossard's opener.\nSitting deep and defending in numbers, the Clarets succeeded in stifling Arsenal's attack for the majority of the first half and could even have opened the scoring themselves.\nZeki Amdouni had a rasping long-range drive parried away by David Raya, while Johann Berg Gudmundsson was denied by the Arsenal goalkeeper after striding clear of the Gunners' backline.\nBrownhill's goal early in the second half was no more than they deserved, but Kompany will be bitterly disappointed with the manner of Arsenal's second as Saliba was left unmarked to head home from virtually underneath the crossbar.\n\"When the second half gets decided on two set pieces, it leaves a bitter feeling,\" Kompany said. \"In general play we did as well as we could in terms of being solid, aggressive and taking our moments.\n\"I would only ever have concern with a team who drop their standards. But this team have such high standards. There's something unique in this club, but it doesn't translate into results.\"\nOne of few positives from a Burnley perspective was a first appearance of the season for forward Michael Obafemi, who came on with five minutes remaining after recovering from a long-term hamstring injury.",

We had a 1-0 win here on Thursday night against Olympiakos and now a victory today.\"\nUnhappy milestone for Cooper as away blues strike again\nSteve Cooper became the second manager to take charge of 50 Premier League games as Forest manager and will be disappointed not to have got at least a draw to mark the milestone.\nThe away side tried to use their aerial ability with Gibbs-White swinging crosses into the box but the West Ham defence held firm.\nCooper's side created some good chances, with Areola making a sensational save to deny Awoniyi, clawing a powerful header away from goal.\nAwoniyi was unlucky not to score a second after some excellent one-touch passes with Elanga straight from Vlachodimos' goal-kick, but Areola once again came to the rescue.\nElanga was Forest's main attacking outlet and his clinical finishing inside the box gave the away side the lead.\nHowever, just 123 seconds later, West Ham had equalised as Forest switched off from a set-piece and relinquished their lead.\nAlong with Rotherham United, Forest have the joint-fewest away league victories of any side in England's top four tiers since the start of last season, playing 26 matches and losing 18 of them.\n\"I'm disappointed, really disappointed. Not even to draw the game but not to win it because it's a game we could have easily won but we haven't won it,\" said Forest boss Cooper.\n\"We've lost the game on our own actions and when you think about that, you can't look past the goals which is an obvious thing to say.\n\"It's a real pity because after gifting them [West Ham] a goal we then do well to come back into the game, 1-1, we should go 2-1 up at the start of the second half.\""

Then with 10 players we could have defended better, with more order.\n\"I think our quality of play was very good but if you play like we did for the first 70 minutes you have to close the game and score two or three or four goals, not only one.\"",

Send us your views here\nWard-Prowse quality wins it for Hammers\nThe Hammers had been on a three-match losing streak in the Premier League before this dramatic victory.\nAfter going ahead early on, they were controlling the contest before being pegged back by Awoniyi's equaliser just before the break.\nForest then took the lead and it seemed the Hammers were in for another frustrating afternoon.\nHowever, David Moyes' side showed resilience to come from behind, winning a game in which they conceded more than once for the first time since January 2022.\nShortly before he scored the winner, Soucek dived to get his head to a Ward-Prowse free-kick but Forest goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos tipped it over the bar.\nTwo pin-point corners from the England midfielder turned the contest around for the home side.\nBoth Bowen and Soucek were in the right place to head home as the dead-ball expert's excellent deliveries found their men, with Ward-Prowse up to five assists in the league this season.\n\"I think if I was James I would be disappointed that he hadn't had 15 or 16 assists by now because of the quality of the balls,\" said West Ham boss Moyes.\n\"I was thrilled with the opening couple of minutes and I was certainly thrilled when I heard the final whistle as well.\n\"In between it, there was a lot of good things, some not so good, but in the Premier League you have to take your wins when you get them.\n\"Today was a good win. We had a 1-0 win here on Thursday night against Olympiakos and now a victory today.\"\nUnhappy milestone for Cooper as away blues strike again\nSteve Cooper became the second manager to take charge of 50 Premier League games as Forest manager and will be disappointed not to have got at least a draw to mark the milestone.\nThe away side tried to use their aerial ability with Gibbs-White swinging crosses into the box but the West Ham defence held firm.\nCooper's side created some good chances, with Areola making a sensational save to deny Awoniyi, clawing a powerful header away from goal.\nAwoniyi was unlucky not to score a second after some excellent one-touch passes with Elanga straight from Vlachodimos' goal-kick, but Areola once again came to the rescue.\nElanga was Forest's main attacking outlet and his clinical finishing inside the box gave the away side the lead.\nHowever, just 123 seconds later, West Ham had equalised as Forest switched off from a set-piece and relinquished their lead.\nAlong with Rotherham United, Forest have the joint-fewest away league victories of any side in England's top four tiers since the start of last season, playing 26 matches and losing 18 of them.\n\"I'm disappointed, really disappointed. Not even to draw the game but not to win it because it's a game we could have easily won but we haven't won it,\" said Forest boss Cooper.\n\"We've lost the game on our own actions and when you think about that, you can't look past the goals which is an obvious thing to say.\n\"It's a real pity because after gifting them [West Ham] a goal we then do well to come back into the game, 1-1, we should go 2-1 up at the start of the second half.\"",

Then with 10 players we could have defended better, with more order.\n\"I think our quality of play was very good but if you play like we did for the first 70 minutes you have to close the game and score two or three or four goals, not only one.\""

Send us your views here\nRe-live Manchester United v Luton Town and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nBig Sam's unfortunate reaction\nOn his return to the directors' box for the first time since the death of his wife, Lady Cathy, Sir Alex Ferguson was accompanied by his friend and former managerial rival Sam Allardyce.\nMidway through the first half, the TV cameras panned to the pair, just as Allardyce committed to a lengthy yawn.\nIt was an unfortunate reaction that didn't reflect play.\nThe home side had done most things right as they dominated proceedings without finding the goal they so desperately needed.\nRashford, one goal all season, blazed a half-volley over from an angle. Hojlund, no Premier League goals yet, got his knee to a deflected Rashford cross but couldn't get any strength behind it to take it past Thomas Kaminski, who kept the initial effort out with his chest and then scooped the ball away before a home player could prod the rebound in.\nLater in the half, Hojlund found Garnacho in lots of space on the edge of the Luton box but the Argentine's decision to control rather than shoot first time was fatal as it gave Kaminski chance to close him down and the opportunity was gone.\nUnited continued in the same positive manner during the second half.\nBut aside from Lindelof's goal, driven home after Rashford's off-target shot from the calm Mason Mount pass that set him up, they struggled in front of goal.\nRashford hit another effort straight at Kaminski, who also repelled Scott McTominay's near-post header.\nIt left United vulnerable, but Luton lacked the touch of class to make them pay.\nAnother Old Trafford defeat for Luton\nAllardyce would presumably have approved of the direct manner of Luton's only significant opening of the first half as Carlton Morris rose impressively to meet Issa Kabore's right-wing cross, forcing Andre Onana into a full length save to his left.\nHe would have been less forgiving of the Hatters in the second half, when Ross Barkley wasted a free-kick in an excellent position and former United defender Teden Mengi sent their only shot on target straight at Onana.\nThat is 19 straight away defeats at United for Luton now, going back to the 19th century, but these are not the games on which their Premier League future will be decided.\nThere is still an element of 'pinch me, look where we are' about the club whose last visit to this stadium was in 1991.\nAnd for 30-year-old midfielder Jordan Clark, whose CV includes a loan spell at nearby non-league club Hyde, a top-flight debut as a second-half substitute must feel very satisfying.",

The England midfielder picked himself up and slotted the penalty confidently past Jordan Pickford.\nEverton retook the lead in the 49th minute. Mykolenko hit a volley from the edge of the area that struck Sam Johnstone's post and Abdoulaye Doucoure was on hand to tap into an empty net from close range.\nPalace thought they had done enough to draw the match when Odsonne Edouard took advantage of a mix-up between James Tarkowski and Pickford, but that was before substitute Gueye scored late on to take all three points.\nThe result means Everton are unbeaten in four games in all competitions and eight points clear of the relegation zone.\nThe match between these two sides was played at a breathtaking pace and was not short of incidents.\nEverton caused Palace a lot of problems with their crosses into the box and Dominic Calvert-Lewin was denied a goal in the first half by an excellent intervention from Joel Ward when the scores were level.\nThat was before Palace thought they should have had a second penalty when Branthwaite challenged Eze, but, after a lengthy video assistant referee check, Eze was booked for simulation.\nEverton started the second half like they did the first period and scored early again through Doucoure before Edouard's leveller.\nGueye then snatched all three points with the winning goal in the 86th minute. The midfielder was played through on goal by Doucoure and slotted the ball through Tyrick Mitchell's legs and into the corner of the net to win the game.\nThe victory is only Everton's second in eight visits to Selhurst Park and continues their run of good form.\nFollow the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Palace's performance?

But this team have such high standards. There's something unique in this club, but it doesn't translate into results.\"\nOne of few positives from a Burnley perspective was a first appearance of the season for forward Michael Obafemi, who came on with five minutes remaining after recovering from a long-term hamstring injury."

A long ball was played forward and not properly cleared and Jack Harrison chipped an inviting cross into the box and Vitaliy Mykolenko headed in from close range.\nPalace were level four minutes later when Eberechi Eze went on a surging run into the Everton penalty area before being brought down by Jarrad Branthwaite. The England midfielder picked himself up and slotted the penalty confidently past Jordan Pickford.\nEverton retook the lead in the 49th minute. Mykolenko hit a volley from the edge of the area that struck Sam Johnstone's post and Abdoulaye Doucoure was on hand to tap into an empty net from close range.\nPalace thought they had done enough to draw the match when Odsonne Edouard took advantage of a mix-up between James Tarkowski and Pickford, but that was before substitute Gueye scored late on to take all three points.\nThe result means Everton are unbeaten in four games in all competitions and eight points clear of the relegation zone.\nThe match between these two sides was played at a breathtaking pace and was not short of incidents.\nEverton caused Palace a lot of problems with their crosses into the box and Dominic Calvert-Lewin was denied a goal in the first half by an excellent intervention from Joel Ward when the scores were level.\nThat was before Palace thought they should have had a second penalty when Branthwaite challenged Eze, but, after a lengthy video assistant referee check, Eze was booked for simulation.\nEverton started the second half like they did the first period and scored early again through Doucoure before Edouard's leveller.\nGueye then snatched all three points with the winning goal in the 86th minute. The midfielder was played through on goal by Doucoure and slotted the ball through Tyrick Mitchell's legs and into the corner of the net to win the game.\nThe victory is only Everton's second in eight visits to Selhurst Park and continues their run of good form.\nFollow the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Palace's performance?

Send us your views here\nRe-live Manchester United v Luton Town and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nBig Sam's unfortunate reaction\nOn his return to the directors' box for the first time since the death of his wife, Lady Cathy, Sir Alex Ferguson was accompanied by his friend and former managerial rival Sam Allardyce.\nMidway through the first half, the TV cameras panned to the pair, just as Allardyce committed to a lengthy yawn.\nIt was an unfortunate reaction that didn't reflect play.\nThe home side had done most things right as they dominated proceedings without finding the goal they so desperately needed.\nRashford, one goal all season, blazed a half-volley over from an angle. Hojlund, no Premier League goals yet, got his knee to a deflected Rashford cross but couldn't get any strength behind it to take it past Thomas Kaminski, who kept the initial effort out with his chest and then scooped the ball away before a home player could prod the rebound in.\nLater in the half, Hojlund found Garnacho in lots of space on the edge of the Luton box but the Argentine's decision to control rather than shoot first time was fatal as it gave Kaminski chance to close him down and the opportunity was gone.\nUnited continued in the same positive manner during the second half.\nBut aside from Lindelof's goal, driven home after Rashford's off-target shot from the calm Mason Mount pass that set him up, they struggled in front of goal.\nRashford hit another effort straight at Kaminski, who also repelled Scott McTominay's near-post header.\nIt left United vulnerable, but Luton lacked the touch of class to make them pay.\nAnother Old Trafford defeat for Luton\nAllardyce would presumably have approved of the direct manner of Luton's only significant opening of the first half as Carlton Morris rose impressively to meet Issa Kabore's right-wing cross, forcing Andre Onana into a full length save to his left.\nHe would have been less forgiving of the Hatters in the second half, when Ross Barkley wasted a free-kick in an excellent position and former United defender Teden Mengi sent their only shot on target straight at Onana.\nThat is 19 straight away defeats at United for Luton now, going back to the 19th century, but these are not the games on which their Premier League future will be decided.\nThere is still an element of 'pinch me, look where we are' about the club whose last visit to this stadium was in 1991.\nAnd for 30-year-old midfielder Jordan Clark, whose CV includes a loan spell at nearby non-league club Hyde, a top-flight debut as a second-half substitute must feel very satisfying."

The VAR had a quicker look at the decision, although the call appeared to be clear-cut.\nSalisbury had initially waved play on in stoppage time when Fulham's Wilson hit the deck, but was sent to his pitchside monitor by the VAR and awarded a third penalty which Willian dispatched.\nThere was time for a late penalty shout in the dying seconds of the match, when the ball struck the arm of a Fulham defender - albeit accidently - and play was rightly waved on.\nThe result ended Fulham's four-match winless run in the Premier League as they recorded their first league victory since beating Sheffield United 3-1 on 7 October.\nDecisions continue to go against Wolves\nThis is not the first time this season Wolves fans will feel their side have been on the wrong end of VAR.\nAgainst Manchester United in their opener they were denied a late penalty despite United goalkeeper Andre Onana clattering into Sasa Kalajdzic.\nReferees' chief Howard Webb, who is head of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), contacted Wolves officials after the match to apologise.\nWolves conceded a stoppage-time penalty in their 2-1 loss to Sheffield United at the start of November, when Fabio Silva fouled George Baldock in the box.\nManager Gary O'Neil described the decision a \"big error\" on BBC's Match of the Day.\nAnd just before the international break Wolves were on the wrong end of another key decision when Hwang was penalised for fouling Fabian Schar in a 2-2 draw with Newcastle, a call that Webb again clarified was incorrect.\nWolves will feel aggrieved with their loss at Craven Cottage having also hit the bar when trailing in the first half through Hwang.\nThey travel to Arsenal for their next match on Saturday in the Premier League, when they will be without Lemina and Gomes who have accumulated too many yellow cards."

They have now lost seven straight home games - failing to pick up a single point despite scoring first in three of those matches.\nThis particular loss will hurt badly.\nKompany's side edged a drab first half as West Ham lacked a cutting edge without injured attacking duo Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio. And the Clarets deservedly took the lead four minutes after the break.\nKudus clipped dangerman Luca Koleosho as he surged into the box and Rodriguez kept his nerve from the spot to drive home his first top-flight goal since April 2022.\nBut with Alphonse Areola repelling Zeki Amdouni's powerful drive and O'Shea heading over from the ensuing corner, the hosts left the door open for West Ham - and David Moyes' side took full advantage.\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nPainful loss for Burnley\nIn his programme notes, Kompany said there was still belief at the club that results would turn. Games like this will test that theory in every sense, with the cameras panning to Pace long after the final whistle.\nThe difficulty of dealing with this latest loss is that Burnley got themselves into a position from which they should have won, even though their early efforts suggested they did not truly believe they could.\nWhen Koleosho was set up by Amdouni, the teenager had enough space to aim for the corner. Instead, he fired straight at Areola and the West Ham keeper made a comfortable save.\nIt was the highlight of a poor first half, underlined by the repeated in-stadium video replays at half-time of a Burnley penalty claim as Koleosho went down after running into Vladimir Coufal.\nRookie top-flight referee Sam Barrott did not give the decision in real time and video assistant referee Craig Pawson decided the minimal movement Coufal made towards Koleosho should not have triggered the youngster to fall in the way he did.\nThankfully for Burnley, Barrott reached a different conclusion when Kudus nipped at Koleosho's heels at the start of the second half, and Rodriguez made no mistake with his spot-kick.\nWith Lyle Foster missing as he deals with personal issues, so much depends on Rodriguez, who is very much Burnley's hometown hero.\nWhen he thundered into Kudus late in the game, with Burnley still ahead, the home fans responded with a rendition of \"he's one of our own\".\nRodriguez will feel the hurt of this defeat just as acutely as the Clarets fans, who could scarcely believe what had happened in the closing stages.\nMubama makes his mark off the bench\nWest Ham's fans have been calling for Mubama to be afforded more first-team opportunities for some time.\nOne of the heroes of last season's FA Youth Cup triumph, the attacker is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far resisted the Hammers' efforts to persuade him to sign an extension.\nMoyes, ever the realist, opted to start Danny Ings up front at Turf Moor with Bowen and Antonio both absent through injury.\nFormer Burnley striker Ings has not scored in the top flight since a double against Nottingham Forest in February and, like most of his team-mates, the frontman made minimal impact.\nMoyes responded by offering Mubama almost 30 minutes to make an impression - the third-longest spell the teenager has had on the field since his first-team debut last season.\nThe 19-year-old made his mark when it really mattered - attacking Kudus' near-post cross and celebrating as if he had got the vital touch to turn the ball in for an equaliser.\nIt was actually ruled an O'Shea own goal to deny Mubama a first league strike, but the setback unsettled Burnley and Soucek dealt the final shattering blow five minutes later.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Before he took it though, Lewis Dunk was shown a yellow card for dissent and then 12 seconds later a straight red for foul and abusive language.\nThe final whistle was greeted by wild celebrations from Roberto de Zerbi and his staff, and the Brighton boss said it was a result of the difficulties his side had faced in recent matches.\n\"It [the result] was a big emotion - we are suffering too much,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"We have too many injuries, we lost four points against Sheffield United and Fulham at home. To win is difficult - my celebration is because we are suffering too much at the moment.\n\"We want to celebrate with our fans. If you have the right attitude, you win the game.\"\nSteve Cooper's Forest made a quick start and took the lead inside three minutes when Elanga met Gibbs-White's excellent cross with an emphatic header at the back post.\nThe visitors created chances of their own with Fati firing at goal before Billy Gilmour blazed over and then, after an impressive passage of play, hit a tame effort that failed to test keeper Odysseas Vlachodimos.\nAnd Brighton deservedly equalised when Ferguson curled a shot into the bottom corner.\nThe half ended with Brighton taking the lead, when Pedro leaped well to meet Pascal Gross' cross, but their injury troubles deepened with Tariq Lamptey going off.\nBoth Lamptey and Fati had been the liveliest players but their early departures did not diminish Albion's attacking threat.\nIndeed, the visitors extended their lead after the break when Pedro, who had been fouled by Chris Wood, scored his fifth penalty for the Seagulls.\nForest were given late hope when Gibbs-White scored from the spot after a VAR check confirmed that Callum Hudson-Odoi had been fouled by Jack Hinshelwood in the penalty box.\nCooper says he wants to help referees, but was left frustrated by Anthony Taylor's decision to give Brighton's penalty and the fact VAR needed to intervene to award a spot-kick for Forest.\n\"I just think if he gives [Brighton's] penalty, he's got to give so many,\" he said. \"The fact he's seen that in open play and not seen ours, needing VAR, sums up where refereeing is at. He is number one, apparently.\n\"I'm trying to be in the supportive camp, but then we see that. We've not played well enough, but having got momentum, to see a decision like that is not easy.\"\nForest sensed a dramatic equaliser but Brighton held on with their keeper Bert Verbruggen making a stunning save to deny Ryan Yates deep into 10 added minutes as the home side struggled to make their man advantage count.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Send us your views here.\nInjury-hit Magpies return to form\nNewcastle fell below their recent high standards at Bournemouth before the international break, but the 2-0 defeat at Vitality Stadium must be viewed in the context of the Magpies' personnel woes and a gruelling run of fixtures that included games against Arsenal, Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund.\nThough Eddie Howe's list of injury absentees remains a worry, his team looked more like their usual selves against Chelsea as they pressed their opponents high up the pitch and deservedly forced an early breakthrough.\nThey shot themselves in the foot in the build-up to the Blues' equaliser, however, Lascelles cheaply surrendering possession to Nicolas Jackson before Trippier was penalised for a faint nudge on Sterling, who beat Pope with his free-kick.\nJoelinton headed wide from an unmarked position and Kieran Trippier rattled the crossbar with a free-kick of his own, but Lascelles made amends for his first-half error by steering Gordon's inswinging delivery into the bottom corner.\nThe momentum was suddenly back with the home side and when Silva miscued a backpass to Sanchez, Joelinton was first to the loose ball and drilled beyond the Chelsea goalkeeper for his first Premier League goal of the season.\nJames' late dismissal and Gordon's calm finish were the icing on the cake for the Magpies, who travel to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday.\nBlues cause themselves problems\nChelsea are undoubtedly heading in the right direction under Mauricio Pochettino, who was not in the dugout at St James' Park after being shown his third yellow card of the season in the 4-4 draw with Manchester City two weeks ago.\nBut given Newcastle's injuries, this will go down as a missed opportunity to increase the pressure on the teams occupying the Premier League's European places.\nThe visitors had their fair share of opportunities in the first half, Conor Gallagher curling wide from the corner of the penalty area before Enzo Fernandez was denied by a one-handed Nick Pope save.\nGallagher should have done better when Pope's mis-hit clearance landed at his feet, but his shot lacked the power to beat the Magpies goalkeeper.\nIn the second half, Lascelles was left completely unmarked for Newcastle's second before Silva - who became Chelsea's oldest outfield player at 39 years and 64 days - laid a third on a plate for Joelinton.\nJames' red card was also avoidable with the Blues skipper's poor touch gifting possession to Gordon, who was then tugged back by the 23-year-old.\nThe final score may have been harsh on the visitors, but Newcastle were worthy winners.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

They were one point in front of us so to get the three points is important. It was tough and we did very good work.\""

Have your say here\nLiverpool satisfied with a point\nAlexander-Arnold turned the taunts back on City's fans after he drilled Liverpool's crucial equaliser past Ederson.\nIt had not been the easiest afternoon for Alexander-Arnold in the face of the direct running and trickery of Doku, but his ability on the ball has never been questioned and he showed it again to earn Liverpool a point.\nAnd the sight of Liverpool taking their time as the game went into the closing stages then eight minutes of stoppage time suggested Jurgen Klopp's side were happy with that share of the spoils.\nLiverpool, as they have done on previous occasions this season, showed that they are a constant menace who must be put away when you get chances.\nThey were nowhere near their best, but a team with this array of attacking talent, augmented by Alexander-Arnold, always have a puncher's chance and they proved it again as they left with a valuable point.\nWhat did you make of Liverpool's display?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Wolves' display? Send us your views here\nVAR in the spotlight once again\nIt was a tale of three penalties at Craven Cottage.\nThe first spot-kick referee Salisbury awarded was when Semedo caught Cairney in the area, although the VAR took a lengthy look at the call.\nIt upheld the on-field decision, even if Semedo did touch the ball as he made contact with Cairney.\nAbout 15 minutes later Wolves won a penalty of their own when a long ball over the top had Hwang sprinting in on goal, but he was caught by Ream inside the area. The VAR had a quicker look at the decision, although the call appeared to be clear-cut.\nSalisbury had initially waved play on in stoppage time when Fulham's Wilson hit the deck, but was sent to his pitchside monitor by the VAR and awarded a third penalty which Willian dispatched.\nThere was time for a late penalty shout in the dying seconds of the match, when the ball struck the arm of a Fulham defender - albeit accidently - and play was rightly waved on.\nThe result ended Fulham's four-match winless run in the Premier League as they recorded their first league victory since beating Sheffield United 3-1 on 7 October.\nDecisions continue to go against Wolves\nThis is not the first time this season Wolves fans will feel their side have been on the wrong end of VAR.\nAgainst Manchester United in their opener they were denied a late penalty despite United goalkeeper Andre Onana clattering into Sasa Kalajdzic.\nReferees' chief Howard Webb, who is head of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), contacted Wolves officials after the match to apologise.\nWolves conceded a stoppage-time penalty in their 2-1 loss to Sheffield United at the start of November, when Fabio Silva fouled George Baldock in the box.\nManager Gary O'Neil described the decision a \"big error\" on BBC's Match of the Day.\nAnd just before the international break Wolves were on the wrong end of another key decision when Hwang was penalised for fouling Fabian Schar in a 2-2 draw with Newcastle, a call that Webb again clarified was incorrect.\nWolves will feel aggrieved with their loss at Craven Cottage having also hit the bar when trailing in the first half through Hwang.\nThey travel to Arsenal for their next match on Saturday in the Premier League, when they will be without Lemina and Gomes who have accumulated too many yellow cards."

They have now lost seven straight home games - failing to pick up a single point despite scoring first in three of those matches.\nThis particular loss will hurt badly.\nKompany's side edged a drab first half as West Ham lacked a cutting edge without injured attacking duo Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio. And the Clarets deservedly took the lead four minutes after the break.\nKudus clipped dangerman Luca Koleosho as he surged into the box and Rodriguez kept his nerve from the spot to drive home his first top-flight goal since April 2022.\nBut with Alphonse Areola repelling Zeki Amdouni's powerful drive and O'Shea heading over from the ensuing corner, the hosts left the door open for West Ham - and David Moyes' side took full advantage.\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nPainful loss for Burnley\nIn his programme notes, Kompany said there was still belief at the club that results would turn. Games like this will test that theory in every sense, with the cameras panning to Pace long after the final whistle.\nThe difficulty of dealing with this latest loss is that Burnley got themselves into a position from which they should have won, even though their early efforts suggested they did not truly believe they could.\nWhen Koleosho was set up by Amdouni, the teenager had enough space to aim for the corner. Instead, he fired straight at Areola and the West Ham keeper made a comfortable save.\nIt was the highlight of a poor first half, underlined by the repeated in-stadium video replays at half-time of a Burnley penalty claim as Koleosho went down after running into Vladimir Coufal.\nRookie top-flight referee Sam Barrott did not give the decision in real time and video assistant referee Craig Pawson decided the minimal movement Coufal made towards Koleosho should not have triggered the youngster to fall in the way he did.\nThankfully for Burnley, Barrott reached a different conclusion when Kudus nipped at Koleosho's heels at the start of the second half, and Rodriguez made no mistake with his spot-kick.\nWith Lyle Foster missing as he deals with personal issues, so much depends on Rodriguez, who is very much Burnley's hometown hero.\nWhen he thundered into Kudus late in the game, with Burnley still ahead, the home fans responded with a rendition of \"he's one of our own\".\nRodriguez will feel the hurt of this defeat just as acutely as the Clarets fans, who could scarcely believe what had happened in the closing stages.\nMubama makes his mark off the bench\nWest Ham's fans have been calling for Mubama to be afforded more first-team opportunities for some time.\nOne of the heroes of last season's FA Youth Cup triumph, the attacker is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far resisted the Hammers' efforts to persuade him to sign an extension.\nMoyes, ever the realist, opted to start Danny Ings up front at Turf Moor with Bowen and Antonio both absent through injury.\nFormer Burnley striker Ings has not scored in the top flight since a double against Nottingham Forest in February and, like most of his team-mates, the frontman made minimal impact.\nMoyes responded by offering Mubama almost 30 minutes to make an impression - the third-longest spell the teenager has had on the field since his first-team debut last season.\nThe 19-year-old made his mark when it really mattered - attacking Kudus' near-post cross and celebrating as if he had got the vital touch to turn the ball in for an equaliser.\nIt was actually ruled an O'Shea own goal to deny Mubama a first league strike, but the setback unsettled Burnley and Soucek dealt the final shattering blow five minutes later.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here.\nWhat did you make of Chelsea's display? Send us your views here.\nInjury-hit Magpies return to form\nNewcastle fell below their recent high standards at Bournemouth before the international break, but the 2-0 defeat at Vitality Stadium must be viewed in the context of the Magpies' personnel woes and a gruelling run of fixtures that included games against Arsenal, Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund.\nThough Eddie Howe's list of injury absentees remains a worry, his team looked more like their usual selves against Chelsea as they pressed their opponents high up the pitch and deservedly forced an early breakthrough.\nThey shot themselves in the foot in the build-up to the Blues' equaliser, however, Lascelles cheaply surrendering possession to Nicolas Jackson before Trippier was penalised for a faint nudge on Sterling, who beat Pope with his free-kick.\nJoelinton headed wide from an unmarked position and Kieran Trippier rattled the crossbar with a free-kick of his own, but Lascelles made amends for his first-half error by steering Gordon's inswinging delivery into the bottom corner.\nThe momentum was suddenly back with the home side and when Silva miscued a backpass to Sanchez, Joelinton was first to the loose ball and drilled beyond the Chelsea goalkeeper for his first Premier League goal of the season.\nJames' late dismissal and Gordon's calm finish were the icing on the cake for the Magpies, who travel to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday.\nBlues cause themselves problems\nChelsea are undoubtedly heading in the right direction under Mauricio Pochettino, who was not in the dugout at St James' Park after being shown his third yellow card of the season in the 4-4 draw with Manchester City two weeks ago.\nBut given Newcastle's injuries, this will go down as a missed opportunity to increase the pressure on the teams occupying the Premier League's European places.\nThe visitors had their fair share of opportunities in the first half, Conor Gallagher curling wide from the corner of the penalty area before Enzo Fernandez was denied by a one-handed Nick Pope save.\nGallagher should have done better when Pope's mis-hit clearance landed at his feet, but his shot lacked the power to beat the Magpies goalkeeper.\nIn the second half, Lascelles was left completely unmarked for Newcastle's second before Silva - who became Chelsea's oldest outfield player at 39 years and 64 days - laid a third on a plate for Joelinton.\nJames' red card was also avoidable with the Blues skipper's poor touch gifting possession to Gordon, who was then tugged back by the 23-year-old.\nThe final score may have been harsh on the visitors, but Newcastle were worthy winners.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Before he took it though, Lewis Dunk was shown a yellow card for dissent and then 12 seconds later a straight red for foul and abusive language.\nThe final whistle was greeted by wild celebrations from Roberto de Zerbi and his staff, and the Brighton boss said it was a result of the difficulties his side had faced in recent matches.\n\"It [the result] was a big emotion - we are suffering too much,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"We have too many injuries, we lost four points against Sheffield United and Fulham at home. To win is difficult - my celebration is because we are suffering too much at the moment.\n\"We want to celebrate with our fans. If you have the right attitude, you win the game.\"\nSteve Cooper's Forest made a quick start and took the lead inside three minutes when Elanga met Gibbs-White's excellent cross with an emphatic header at the back post.\nThe visitors created chances of their own with Fati firing at goal before Billy Gilmour blazed over and then, after an impressive passage of play, hit a tame effort that failed to test keeper Odysseas Vlachodimos.\nAnd Brighton deservedly equalised when Ferguson curled a shot into the bottom corner.\nThe half ended with Brighton taking the lead, when Pedro leaped well to meet Pascal Gross' cross, but their injury troubles deepened with Tariq Lamptey going off.\nBoth Lamptey and Fati had been the liveliest players but their early departures did not diminish Albion's attacking threat.\nIndeed, the visitors extended their lead after the break when Pedro, who had been fouled by Chris Wood, scored his fifth penalty for the Seagulls.\nForest were given late hope when Gibbs-White scored from the spot after a VAR check confirmed that Callum Hudson-Odoi had been fouled by Jack Hinshelwood in the penalty box.\nCooper says he wants to help referees, but was left frustrated by Anthony Taylor's decision to give Brighton's penalty and the fact VAR needed to intervene to award a spot-kick for Forest.\n\"I just think if he gives [Brighton's] penalty, he's got to give so many,\" he said. \"The fact he's seen that in open play and not seen ours, needing VAR, sums up where refereeing is at. He is number one, apparently.\n\"I'm trying to be in the supportive camp, but then we see that. We've not played well enough, but having got momentum, to see a decision like that is not easy.\"\nForest sensed a dramatic equaliser but Brighton held on with their keeper Bert Verbruggen making a stunning save to deny Ryan Yates deep into 10 added minutes as the home side struggled to make their man advantage count.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say here\nLiverpool satisfied with a point\nAlexander-Arnold turned the taunts back on City's fans after he drilled Liverpool's crucial equaliser past Ederson.\nIt had not been the easiest afternoon for Alexander-Arnold in the face of the direct running and trickery of Doku, but his ability on the ball has never been questioned and he showed it again to earn Liverpool a point.\nAnd the sight of Liverpool taking their time as the game went into the closing stages then eight minutes of stoppage time suggested Jurgen Klopp's side were happy with that share of the spoils.\nLiverpool, as they have done on previous occasions this season, showed that they are a constant menace who must be put away when you get chances.\nThey were nowhere near their best, but a team with this array of attacking talent, augmented by Alexander-Arnold, always have a puncher's chance and they proved it again as they left with a valuable point.\nWhat did you make of Liverpool's display?

Send us your views here\nVilla make long-awaited return to top four\nVilla played their part in an entertaining opening, with Matty Cash and Torres both off target with efforts before Watkins had a goal disallowed for a tight offside moments after Lo Celso's opener.\nBut the visitors equalised on the stroke of half-time as Torres met Douglas Luiz's superb free-kick delivery on the run to power a header inside the near post.\nEmery made two changes at half-time, with Leon Bailey and Youri Tielemans coming on, and they each had a swift impact.\nBailey's curling strike squirmed under Guglielmo Vicario's dive, with the Tottenham keeper relieved to see the ball bounce back off the post.\nBut Villa were not to be denied and Watkins exchanged passes with Tielemans before sliding the ball past Vicario.\nThe in-form England striker almost added to his tally by glancing two headers narrowly wide.\nHowever two goals proved enough to send Villa into the top four, at least 13 games into a season, for the first time since December 2009.\n\"They created chances, we did as well, and we tried to be consistent with our gameplan,\" said Emery.\n\"We spoke about the opportunity to win. They were one point in front of us so to get the three points is important. It was tough and we did very good work.\""

We had some big, big chances to put the game to bed.\"\nThe second half, as it was against Lens on Wednesday, was more low-key. Rice dragged a low shot off target and Trossard shot straight at Wolves' substitute goalkeeper Dan Bentley from a good position, before Cunha halved the deficit late on.\nIt was a nervier finish than Arteta would have wanted, but the 41-year-old cut a very happy figure at full time as his side stretched their winning run in all competitions to five matches.\nToo little, too late from Wolves\nWolves were on the wrong end of another contentious VAR call in Monday's defeat by Fulham, but O'Neil's frustration will be directed at his own defence at Emirates Stadium after they conceded twice inside the opening quarter of an hour.\nDawson was beaten far too easily by Saka for the opener, while Zinchenko and Odegaard were both given too much space in the build-up to the Norwegian's low finish.\n\"The first goal was disappointing,\" O'Neil said. \"There were so many bodies around Saka. For him to wriggle through and for us to look hesitant in the penalty area is disappointing.\n\"The second goal was a great goal. We should have prevented it, but it happens.\"\nMax Kilman almost gifted Arsenal a third late in the first half, but Bentley got down to his left to deny Gabriel Jesus.\nCunha and Hwang Hee-chan both tested Raya as Wolves gradually started to carry more of an attacking threat after half-time, and Cunha's fabulous, curling strike gave them hope of claiming an unlikely point.\nBut it was too little, too late from the visitors, who are winless in their last 13 Premier League visits to London.",

In all, the away side received seven yellow cards and a red.\nMcBurnie's sending off robbed his side of a potential fightback in the second half and with so much on the line, it has to go down as one of the most absurd red cards received considering the situation.\nThe Blades - who next face a daunting home match against Liverpool on Wednesday - have a huge task on their hands for survival, winning only one of their 14 games so far and conceding a league-high 39 goals."

We had a plan for the Arsenal game a week ago and it was a different plan for Luton today.\n\"Until their goal, we were very dominant. With the amount of injuries we have - basically we have our four full-backs out - it was great.\n\"When you are dominating a game, if you keep the tempo and intensity, that is difficult to defend against and we did that very well.\"\nLack of firepower a huge problem for Luton\nLuton's tally of 57 goals was the lowest of any club to finish in the top six of the Championship last season, while only one club scored fewer in the top 10.\nIt appears manager Rob Edwards has not been able to solve those scoring issues since leading the club to a surprise promotion to the Premier League.\nOnly Sheffield United (11) have netted fewer goals than Luton (13) after 14 fixtures in the top-flight this term.\nThe Hatters looked uninterested in trying to attack during the first half, slowing the game down at every opportunity, and Anthony Taylor rightly dished out a yellow card to goalkeeper Kaminski after several complaints over his antics.\nIf Brentford had not managed to get two early quickfire goals in the second half, Luton may have continued to sit deep with every intention of holding out for a draw.\nMorris, their top scorer this term with three, had no service throughout and the absence of attack-minded wing-back Alfie Doughty, who missed out with a hip injury, was a major blow.\nLuton manager Edwards told BBC Sport: \"The better side won today. We struggled to find rhythm with the ball and we weren't able to keep it as well as we wanted to. We've been doing that better recently.\n\"We lost our captain at half-time and that change was big for us. We were a little bit makeshift at the back and Brentford getting those goals made it tough.\n\"We kept going, the lads always do; we found a way to get back into the game at 2-1, but in truth we didn't deserve anything today. Brentford were good and deserved the win. We needed to be better with the ball.\"\nThe glimpse of what Luton could be capable of came when substitute Brown raced through to score, but similar moments were few and far between.\nBy the looks of the fixture list, this campaign will get no easier for the Hatters any time soon. They host leaders Arsenal on Tuesday before welcoming Manchester City to Kenilworth Road on Sunday.\nEdwards said: \"That's the league and this is what we wanted.\"\nBrentford v Luton as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance?

The Argentine blasted the ball into the top corner from range to score his first goal for the Reds.\nLiverpool looked far likelier winners early in the second half. Forward Darwin Nunez was twice sent clear but hit the crossbar with one effort, and sliced another off target.\nFulham, though, delivered what seemed to be crushing blow on the break and the Reds looked set for their first home league defeat since losing to Leeds in October 2022.\nBut, rallied by the Anfield crowd, Endo curled in a fine shot from the edge of the box, before Alexander-Arnold controlled a lofted clearance with his knee and smashed an effort into the bottom corner.\nLiverpool's defending did look suspect in moments and questions will be asked of goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, filling in for the injured Alisson, who should have done better to keep out Fulham's second, unable to hack the ball away with his boot.\nBut for now, the Reds will enjoy a thrilling win.\nLiverpool did suffer an injury blow with centre-back Joel Matip having to go off with what appeared to be a knee injury after 69 minutes.\n\"We lost Joel and we have obviously no scan yet but after all you hear and can see, that will not be a short one,\" said Klopp.\n\"Unlucky, but we have to get through this.\"\nFulham so close to superb shock\nFulham do not traditionally do well at Liverpool. The Cottagers had won just two of their past 36 visits coming into Sunday's fixture and had never before scored more than once in the Premier League at Anfield.\nYet they were three minutes plus stoppage time away from a stunning victory.\nFormer Liverpool winger Wilson had equalised for the visitors with his side's first attack, slotting in Antonee Robinson's cross.\nFulham's second leveller was only granted after a lengthy video assistant referee review. Raul Jimenez nodded a corner on to Tete, who flicked into the net. The strike was initially flagged for offside, but that call was eventually overturned.\nThe delay caused by the video assistant referee decision, and an earlier head injury for Fulham keeper Leno, meant there were 12 minutes of first-half injury time.\nAnd Fulham played their best football during that additional time, seemingly adding a third when Tim Ream, who ultimately timed his run too early and was ruled offside, tapped in a rebound after Kelleher did well to keep out a Joao Palhinha header.\nHaving soaked up plenty of Liverpool pressure in the second half, Fulham made a late break forward and Willian combined with fellow substitute De Cordova-Reid, heading in his dinked cross.\nBut Marco Silva's side were unable to hold on, and their wait continued for a first Premier League away win since beating Everton on the opening day.",

I think we're looking like an improved outfit.\"\nForest threw everything at Everton's goal as the game headed towards the final whistle and the visitors were indebted to Jordan Pickford's late heroics.\nThe England goalkeeper raced off his line to make a tackle to deny Anthony Elanga and produced a fine diving save to keep an effort from Murillo.\nEverton's margin of victory might have been greater had Beto not fluffed a golden chance and McNeil seen a goal-bound effort cleared off the line.\nForest, who had earlier seen Morgan Gibbs-White strike the side netting and Murillo hit the base of the post, were left to rue missed chances of their own.\nGritty win for Dyche's battlers\nEverton's first game after they were handed a 10-point deduction by the Premier League for financial rule breaches ended in anti-climax last weekend.\nThe Goodison Park crowd were galvanised by the sense of injustice but on the pitch they surrendered to a tame 3-0 defeat to Manchester United..\nAgainst Forest, the visiting fans continued to vocalise their views of the biggest sporting sanction - which the club will appeal - meted out in Premier League history.\nThis time they had something to celebrate at the final whistle though, as Dyche's side produced a determined performance bristling with the kind of unity which will serve them well as they look to climb out of the drop zone.\nA familiar concern of last season's relegation battle - just who will score the goals to keep them up? - had initially looked to damage those hopes.\nBeto, handed an opportunity in place of the injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin, blazed over with the goal at his mercy midway through the first half.\nDyche turned on his heels and exhaled his frustrations with the Portuguese forward's finishing in the direction of the bench.\nThe Everton manager's breath cut through the night air again moments before half-time when McNeil saw his effort blocked on the line by Murillo.\nBy full-time though, Dyche was cheerfully slapping the backs of Everton's players after victory was secured thanks to McNeil's fine strike at the back post on 67 minutes.\n\"The points deduction? It's definitely galvanised us and we are more together and that shows on the pitch,\" McNeil said.\n\"We know we have the fans behind us. It was a massive result after what's happened.\"\nForest unable to deliver Cooper's message\nCuriously, before kick-off, Cooper emerged from the tunnel before both teams and applauded all four sides of the City Ground then made his way to his seat in the dug out.\nThe 43-year-old Welshman, who is respected and liked by supporters for his achievements with Forest, received a generous reception.\nBut whatever message Cooper had intended to send - to Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis, or otherwise - was not matched by the result and he was left picking the bones out of their seventh defeat in 14 matches.\nHis side have now lost consecutive Premier League games at the City Ground for the first time since a run of three defeats in August and September last year.\nEqually worryingly, they are now winless in the last 10 top-flight matches without Taiwo Awoniyi, having lost six of those. It looks like the Nigeria striker will not be back until early 2024 because of a groin injury.\nThe 26-year-old aggravated the problem playing for Nigeria during the international break and has had an operation for the issue.\nCooper will want to address the unwanted statistics and find some cutting edge elsewhere - and quickly - if he is keep both his job and Forest out of trouble.\n\"We've not shown the real guile and quality to create chances,\" Cooper added.\n\"We've lost three games on the bounce. I think what's frustrating is that we've lost games knowing that we can do better.\n\"We've not lost games because the opponents have been much better than us, which was often the case last year. It's not the case this year.\"\nHow did you rate Forest's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here"

They were organised at the back and, for all Brighton's possession, Chelsea defended stoutly and chances were at a premium.\n\"We deserved the win, but it was a complicated second half with one player less,\" Pochettino told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Brighton are a very good team and are playing well. Sometimes they force you to play deep but the attitude of the players was really good.\n\"The team is tired, we are all tired but overall happy. After Newcastle, we needed to show a different face. That's why I'm happy.\"\nJoao Pedro's late goal led to some late drama but Chelsea stood firm enough. The quality in their squad is clear but here they showed the kind of grit that will stand them in good stead going forward.\nBrighton fall short at end of memorable week\nComing back from two goals down to take a point, possibly three, at Stamford Bridge would have capped an already historic week for Roberto de Zerbi's side.\nReaching the Europa League knockout phase with a win at AEK Athens on Thursday was an uplifting but tiring achievement.\nDespite their best efforts in this game, it was not to be for the Seagulls.\n\"I think we played much better than Chelsea,\" Brighton manager De Zerbi told BBC Match of the Day.\nWhile Brighton responded admirably to going 2-0 down and enjoyed nearly 80% of possession in the second half, the frustration will be that they lacked the sharpness in the final third to really make it count.\nFatigue may have played a part, but with a busy December ahead and more European football to come in the new year, that is something Brighton will need to get used to.\n\"I'm really happy for the future of the club, but I want to win now and I want to reach the target now because we have to do better,\" De Zerbi added. \"We have to play in a stronger way.\"\nWith so many injuries and suspensions to contend with, even in defeat there were points of encouragement for the Seagulls, and they will focus now on capitalising on home assignments against Brentford and Burnley in the coming days.\nHow did you rate Chelsea's performance?

We had a plan for the Arsenal game a week ago and it was a different plan for Luton today.\n\"Until their goal, we were very dominant. With the amount of injuries we have - basically we have our four full-backs out - it was great.\n\"When you are dominating a game, if you keep the tempo and intensity, that is difficult to defend against and we did that very well.\"\nLack of firepower a huge problem for Luton\nLuton's tally of 57 goals was the lowest of any club to finish in the top six of the Championship last season, while only one club scored fewer in the top 10.\nIt appears manager Rob Edwards has not been able to solve those scoring issues since leading the club to a surprise promotion to the Premier League.\nOnly Sheffield United (11) have netted fewer goals than Luton (13) after 14 fixtures in the top-flight this term.\nThe Hatters looked uninterested in trying to attack during the first half, slowing the game down at every opportunity, and Anthony Taylor rightly dished out a yellow card to goalkeeper Kaminski after several complaints over his antics.\nIf Brentford had not managed to get two early quickfire goals in the second half, Luton may have continued to sit deep with every intention of holding out for a draw.\nMorris, their top scorer this term with three, had no service throughout and the absence of attack-minded wing-back Alfie Doughty, who missed out with a hip injury, was a major blow.\nLuton manager Edwards told BBC Sport: \"The better side won today. We struggled to find rhythm with the ball and we weren't able to keep it as well as we wanted to. We've been doing that better recently.\n\"We lost our captain at half-time and that change was big for us. We were a little bit makeshift at the back and Brentford getting those goals made it tough.\n\"We kept going, the lads always do; we found a way to get back into the game at 2-1, but in truth we didn't deserve anything today. Brentford were good and deserved the win. We needed to be better with the ball.\"\nThe glimpse of what Luton could be capable of came when substitute Brown raced through to score, but similar moments were few and far between.\nBy the looks of the fixture list, this campaign will get no easier for the Hatters any time soon. They host leaders Arsenal on Tuesday before welcoming Manchester City to Kenilworth Road on Sunday.\nEdwards said: \"That's the league and this is what we wanted.\"\nBrentford v Luton as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance?

We got in front but gave away a horrendous goal.\n\"Sometimes in these games, you just have to see it out, but I have to say we made two or three chances at the end which on another day we might have scored.\n\"It wasn't our best point, it wasn't our best performance but we will take something from the game.\"\nPalace lack cutting edge\nPalace, who had lost four of their previous five league games, did not manage a shot on target in the first half, despite a decent start - Edouard hooking a volley wide in the 12th minute as he was unable to shift his body position.\nWithin a minute of that miss, they were behind, and battling to find a way back. Michael Olise, recently returned from a hamstring injury, was Palace's main threat but struggled to create much of note. A threaded pass through to Edouard was cut out as the Frenchman tried to move his side further up the pitch.\nJordan Ayew, in for the injured Eberechi Eze, skewed an effort well wide, and Tyrick Mitchell put in a poor cross from a promising position, while an Andersen free-kick hit the West Ham wall and deflected out for a corner.\nRoy Hodgson's side have not scored in the first half in 11 of their 14 matches, with only newly promoted Luton Town (13) and Sheffield United (12) failing to score more often.\nEdouard did find an equaliser early in the second half, but Palace's lack of cutting edge was laid bare as their last shot of the match was taken by Olise in the 55th minute.\nA midweek match against Bournemouth is followed by fixtures against high-flying Liverpool and Manchester City, which will require Palace to be much sharper.\nHodgson told BBC Sport: \"I thought for large parts of the game, especially the bulk of the first half in particular,we actually played well. We established a lot of control and the game was even during that period.\n\"I think their [West Ham's] first attempt in our penalty area put them 1-0 up but where we really had to show resilience was at the end - because the 1-1 is basically there for you, you've earned it but unfortunately on the back of two bad results, the anxiety tends to creep in.\n\"Hats off to the players. I hope they're satisfied with their performance and I hope they get some confidence from it because I certainly got some confidence from the team's performance today.\"",

This point is not the best but it is not the worst,\" Emery said.\n\"We were aware it would be difficult to get a victory today.\"\nThere were chances aplenty in an end-to-end game at the Vitality Stadium, with Emiliano Martinez particularly busy in the Villa goal.\nThe Argentina goalkeeper twice blocked from Solanke from close range and also denied substitute Luis Sinisterra.\nVilla had the ball in the net in the first half with the score at 1-1 when Diego Carlos swept home, only for VAR to rule it out for offside.\nAfter Solanke's composed finish put the Cherries ahead seven minutes into the second half, a deflected shot from Jhon Duran struck the post as Villa pushed to get back on terms.\nWatkins, who had been an injury doubt for this match, was subdued for much of the game but made a telling contribution as injury time beckoned.\nThe England striker got on the end of Moussa Diaby's cross to flick a glancing header beyond the diving Neto to score his eighth goal of the season.\nSolanke said the result \"felt like a loss conceding so late\", while Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola felt his side's performance merited more.\n\"We deserved to win the game but against this type of opposition this can happen,\" Iraola said. \"One point is not enough for us today.\"\nVilla dig deep\nVilla have been in imperious form under Emery this season, prompting talk of a sustained push for a top-four finish and a place in next season's Champions League.\nBut against Bournemouth, they were uncharacteristically sloppy at the back, lacked bite in midfield and struggled to make an impact up front.\nWith only four players picked from the starting line-up from their Europa League win over Legia Warsaw during the week, fatigue could hardly be used as an excuse.\nHowever, the strongest indicator that they have the capacity to go the distance in the scrap to finish in the Premier League top four is that they did not crumple here.\nEven though it was not their day, Villa's players rolled up their sleeves and stayed in the contest at a time when Bournemouth should really have put the game to bed.\nVilla were especially indebted to Martinez's indefatigable spirit, and his presence between the sticks paved the way for Watkins to steal a point.\n\"It shows our resilience but we are not starting games well away from home,\" the striker said.\n\"If we can iron that out, it will help us. Every game we want to win. We are in good form. We fancy ourselves against anybody.\"\nSolanke ripening for Cherries\nSolanke has now bettered his final league goal tally from last season - six in 33 appearances - with seven after 14 games of this campaign.\nHis finish for the goal epitomised a striker who looks brimming with confidence.\nThe 26-year-old allowed Milos Kerkez's cross to run across his body as he turned his back to goal to shield it from Pau Torres. He then adroitly spun the Villa defender and wrong-footed Martinez with a clinical low finish into the net.\nThe former Chelsea and Liverpool striker has been touted for great things since he was the player of the tournament at the 2017 Under-20 World Cup - won by England.\nAfter not quite living up to that early hype, he has now entered what should be the peak years of his career and is primed to kick on further.\nSolanke has been capped once by England - as a 75th-minute substitute a friendly against Brazil at Wembley six years ago.\nIf he keeps up his goalscoring form throughout the remainder of the season, he could force himself into the mix alongside Watkins to be Harry Kane's understudy at next summer's European Championships in Germany.\nHow did you rate Bournemouth's performance?

The Cottagers had won just two of their past 36 visits coming into Sunday's fixture and had never before scored more than once in the Premier League at Anfield.\nYet they were three minutes plus stoppage time away from a stunning victory.\nFormer Liverpool winger Wilson had equalised for the visitors with his side's first attack, slotting in Antonee Robinson's cross.\nFulham's second leveller was only granted after a lengthy video assistant referee review. Raul Jimenez nodded a corner on to Tete, who flicked into the net. The strike was initially flagged for offside, but that call was eventually overturned.\nThe delay caused by the video assistant referee decision, and an earlier head injury for Fulham keeper Leno, meant there were 12 minutes of first-half injury time.\nAnd Fulham played their best football during that additional time, seemingly adding a third when Tim Ream, who ultimately timed his run too early and was ruled offside, tapped in a rebound after Kelleher did well to keep out a Joao Palhinha header.\nHaving soaked up plenty of Liverpool pressure in the second half, Fulham made a late break forward and Willian combined with fellow substitute De Cordova-Reid, heading in his dinked cross.\nBut Marco Silva's side were unable to hold on, and their wait continued for a first Premier League away win since beating Everton on the opening day."

They were organised at the back and, for all Brighton's possession, Chelsea defended stoutly and chances were at a premium.\n\"We deserved the win, but it was a complicated second half with one player less,\" Pochettino told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Brighton are a very good team and are playing well. Sometimes they force you to play deep but the attitude of the players was really good.\n\"The team is tired, we are all tired but overall happy. After Newcastle, we needed to show a different face. That's why I'm happy.\"\nJoao Pedro's late goal led to some late drama but Chelsea stood firm enough. The quality in their squad is clear but here they showed the kind of grit that will stand them in good stead going forward.\nBrighton fall short at end of memorable week\nComing back from two goals down to take a point, possibly three, at Stamford Bridge would have capped an already historic week for Roberto de Zerbi's side.\nReaching the Europa League knockout phase with a win at AEK Athens on Thursday was an uplifting but tiring achievement.\nDespite their best efforts in this game, it was not to be for the Seagulls.\n\"I think we played much better than Chelsea,\" Brighton manager De Zerbi told BBC Match of the Day.\nWhile Brighton responded admirably to going 2-0 down and enjoyed nearly 80% of possession in the second half, the frustration will be that they lacked the sharpness in the final third to really make it count.\nFatigue may have played a part, but with a busy December ahead and more European football to come in the new year, that is something Brighton will need to get used to.\n\"I'm really happy for the future of the club, but I want to win now and I want to reach the target now because we have to do better,\" De Zerbi added. \"We have to play in a stronger way.\"\nWith so many injuries and suspensions to contend with, even in defeat there were points of encouragement for the Seagulls, and they will focus now on capitalising on home assignments against Brentford and Burnley in the coming days.\nHow did you rate Chelsea's performance?

This point is not the best but it is not the worst,\" Emery said.\n\"We were aware it would be difficult to get a victory today.\"\nThere were chances aplenty in an end-to-end game at the Vitality Stadium, with Emiliano Martinez particularly busy in the Villa goal.\nThe Argentina goalkeeper twice blocked from Solanke from close range and also denied substitute Luis Sinisterra.\nVilla had the ball in the net in the first half with the score at 1-1 when Diego Carlos swept home, only for VAR to rule it out for offside.\nAfter Solanke's composed finish put the Cherries ahead seven minutes into the second half, a deflected shot from Jhon Duran struck the post as Villa pushed to get back on terms.\nWatkins, who had been an injury doubt for this match, was subdued for much of the game but made a telling contribution as injury time beckoned.\nThe England striker got on the end of Moussa Diaby's cross to flick a glancing header beyond the diving Neto to score his eighth goal of the season.\nSolanke said the result \"felt like a loss conceding so late\", while Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola felt his side's performance merited more.\n\"We deserved to win the game but against this type of opposition this can happen,\" Iraola said. \"One point is not enough for us today.\"\nVilla dig deep\nVilla have been in imperious form under Emery this season, prompting talk of a sustained push for a top-four finish and a place in next season's Champions League.\nBut against Bournemouth, they were uncharacteristically sloppy at the back, lacked bite in midfield and struggled to make an impact up front.\nWith only four players picked from the starting line-up from their Europa League win over Legia Warsaw during the week, fatigue could hardly be used as an excuse.\nHowever, the strongest indicator that they have the capacity to go the distance in the scrap to finish in the Premier League top four is that they did not crumple here.\nEven though it was not their day, Villa's players rolled up their sleeves and stayed in the contest at a time when Bournemouth should really have put the game to bed.\nVilla were especially indebted to Martinez's indefatigable spirit, and his presence between the sticks paved the way for Watkins to steal a point.\n\"It shows our resilience but we are not starting games well away from home,\" the striker said.\n\"If we can iron that out, it will help us. Every game we want to win. We are in good form. We fancy ourselves against anybody.\"\nSolanke ripening for Cherries\nSolanke has now bettered his final league goal tally from last season - six in 33 appearances - with seven after 14 games of this campaign.\nHis finish for the goal epitomised a striker who looks brimming with confidence.\nThe 26-year-old allowed Milos Kerkez's cross to run across his body as he turned his back to goal to shield it from Pau Torres. He then adroitly spun the Villa defender and wrong-footed Martinez with a clinical low finish into the net.\nThe former Chelsea and Liverpool striker has been touted for great things since he was the player of the tournament at the 2017 Under-20 World Cup - won by England.\nAfter not quite living up to that early hype, he has now entered what should be the peak years of his career and is primed to kick on further.\nSolanke has been capped once by England - as a 75th-minute substitute a friendly against Brazil at Wembley six years ago.\nIf he keeps up his goalscoring form throughout the remainder of the season, he could force himself into the mix alongside Watkins to be Harry Kane's understudy at next summer's European Championships in Germany.\nHow did you rate Bournemouth's performance?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Spurs' display? Send us your views here\nTottenham led early through Son Heung-min, only for the Tottenham skipper to divert Julian Alvarez's cross into his own net three minutes later.\nPhil Foden finished off a slick City attack to put the hosts in front at the break.\nGiovani Lo Celso pulled Tottenham level with an excellent curling effort from the edge of the area midway through the second half, but Yves Bissouma was soon punished for losing possession close to the Spurs area.\nFoden fed Haaland, who delivered the low cross for Grealish to convert.\nKulusevski's late intervention - a mix of head and shoulder sending the ball in off the bar - ensured Tottenham avoided a fourth successive Premier League defeat, with Ange Postecoglou's side fifth on 27 points, three behind champions City, who drop to third.\nAttack, attack, attack\nAs predicted, there could be no complaints about the excitement value of a contest that pitted together two managers completely committed to an expansive game.\nBy half-time, the tally stood at three goals, two shots that hit the woodwork, 14 shots and 10 corners. At the final whistle, there had been six goals, 26 shots, 18 corners and no one left complaining about a lack of entertainment.\nIt really was brilliant stuff, with both sides at their most vulnerable when they were attacking their opponents' goal.\nRelive Sunday's Premier League action\nWhen observers glibly talk about the Premier League being the 'best in the world', they often fail to explain what criteria they are using.\nThe technical quality, attacking invention and simple desire to score goals in this contest would bring joy to any set of supporters.\nTottenham knew they would not dominate possession, but even under the most severe pressure they tried to play quickly out from the back.\nThe tactic brought them the opener, as they swept forward from a City corner, with Son shrugging off Jeremy Doku and completing a 40-yard burst by ramming his shot past Ederson.\nOnly a Ruben Dias interception of a Brennan Johnson cross that was about to be met by Son denied the South Korean a second. Additionally, Son could not contain his fury when Bryan Gil took three touches and then gave the ball away after a rare stray pass from Bernardo Silva invited a first-time pass to the Tottenham captain.\nAnd this was in the first-half period that City dominated.\nThe second period was more even, but it still came as a surprise on both occasions when Tottenham got themselves level.\nThe first time was after Son had created the opening for Lo Celso, and the second when Kulusevski met Brennan Johnson's cross.\nFurious Haaland draws a blank\nHaaland was genuinely furious as he stormed down the tunnel.\nHis frustration was obvious to everyone and pity the poor door when he entered the City dressing room.\nHooper's decision was hasty, but chances are that Haaland was already simmering over his two incredible first-half failures to score.\nThe Norwegian sent one shot wide from 10 yards when it appeared he had to score with the goal at his mercy. Towards the end of the opening period, Haaland skied a shot over after Alvarez prodded a pass into his path.\nEven then, the forward's reflective reaction was not that of someone who was entirely happy with his lot - and his temper had not improved by the end.\nCity were still excellent overall and Foden's goal was a thing of beauty.\nIn a slick exchange, Haaland played a first-time pass to Doku, who immediately found Alvarez, and he spun round and presented Foden with an invitation to score which the England man immediately accepted.\nIf there was a moment to sum up the excellence on show, that was it."

We hit 14 points relatively early and 17 would have been a fairly healthy return.\n\"Of course it's changed but the mentality and the performance levels are right. I think we're looking like an improved outfit.\"\nForest threw everything at Everton's goal as the game headed towards the final whistle and the visitors were indebted to Jordan Pickford's late heroics.\nThe England goalkeeper raced off his line to make a tackle to deny Anthony Elanga and produced a fine diving save to keep an effort from Murillo.\nEverton's margin of victory might have been greater had Beto not fluffed a golden chance and McNeil seen a goal-bound effort cleared off the line.\nForest, who had earlier seen Morgan Gibbs-White strike the side netting and Murillo hit the base of the post, were left to rue missed chances of their own.\nGritty win for Dyche's battlers\nEverton's first game after they were handed a 10-point deduction by the Premier League for financial rule breaches ended in anti-climax last weekend.\nThe Goodison Park crowd were galvanised by the sense of injustice but on the pitch they surrendered to a tame 3-0 defeat to Manchester United..\nAgainst Forest, the visiting fans continued to vocalise their views of the biggest sporting sanction - which the club will appeal - meted out in Premier League history.\nThis time they had something to celebrate at the final whistle though, as Dyche's side produced a determined performance bristling with the kind of unity which will serve them well as they look to climb out of the drop zone.\nA familiar concern of last season's relegation battle - just who will score the goals to keep them up? - had initially looked to damage those hopes.\nBeto, handed an opportunity in place of the injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin, blazed over with the goal at his mercy midway through the first half.\nDyche turned on his heels and exhaled his frustrations with the Portuguese forward's finishing in the direction of the bench.\nThe Everton manager's breath cut through the night air again moments before half-time when McNeil saw his effort blocked on the line by Murillo.\nBy full-time though, Dyche was cheerfully slapping the backs of Everton's players after victory was secured thanks to McNeil's fine strike at the back post on 67 minutes.\n\"The points deduction? It's definitely galvanised us and we are more together and that shows on the pitch,\" McNeil said.\n\"We know we have the fans behind us. It was a massive result after what's happened.\"\nForest unable to deliver Cooper's message\nCuriously, before kick-off, Cooper emerged from the tunnel before both teams and applauded all four sides of the City Ground then made his way to his seat in the dug out.\nThe 43-year-old Welshman, who is respected and liked by supporters for his achievements with Forest, received a generous reception.\nBut whatever message Cooper had intended to send - to Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis, or otherwise - was not matched by the result and he was left picking the bones out of their seventh defeat in 14 matches.\nHis side have now lost consecutive Premier League games at the City Ground for the first time since a run of three defeats in August and September last year.\nEqually worryingly, they are now winless in the last 10 top-flight matches without Taiwo Awoniyi, having lost six of those. It looks like the Nigeria striker will not be back until early 2024 because of a groin injury.\nThe 26-year-old aggravated the problem playing for Nigeria during the international break and has had an operation for the issue.\nCooper will want to address the unwanted statistics and find some cutting edge elsewhere - and quickly - if he is keep both his job and Forest out of trouble.\n\"We've not shown the real guile and quality to create chances,\" Cooper added.\n\"We've lost three games on the bounce. I think what's frustrating is that we've lost games knowing that we can do better.\n\"We've not lost games because the opponents have been much better than us, which was often the case last year.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Spurs' display? Send us your views here\nTottenham led early through Son Heung-min, only for the Tottenham skipper to divert Julian Alvarez's cross into his own net three minutes later.\nPhil Foden finished off a slick City attack to put the hosts in front at the break.\nGiovani Lo Celso pulled Tottenham level with an excellent curling effort from the edge of the area midway through the second half, but Yves Bissouma was soon punished for losing possession close to the Spurs area.\nFoden fed Haaland, who delivered the low cross for Grealish to convert.\nKulusevski's late intervention - a mix of head and shoulder sending the ball in off the bar - ensured Tottenham avoided a fourth successive Premier League defeat, with Ange Postecoglou's side fifth on 27 points, three behind champions City, who drop to third.\nAttack, attack, attack\nAs predicted, there could be no complaints about the excitement value of a contest that pitted together two managers completely committed to an expansive game.\nBy half-time, the tally stood at three goals, two shots that hit the woodwork, 14 shots and 10 corners. At the final whistle, there had been six goals, 26 shots, 18 corners and no one left complaining about a lack of entertainment.\nIt really was brilliant stuff, with both sides at their most vulnerable when they were attacking their opponents' goal.\nRelive Sunday's Premier League action\nWhen observers glibly talk about the Premier League being the 'best in the world', they often fail to explain what criteria they are using.\nThe technical quality, attacking invention and simple desire to score goals in this contest would bring joy to any set of supporters.\nTottenham knew they would not dominate possession, but even under the most severe pressure they tried to play quickly out from the back.\nThe tactic brought them the opener, as they swept forward from a City corner, with Son shrugging off Jeremy Doku and completing a 40-yard burst by ramming his shot past Ederson.\nOnly a Ruben Dias interception of a Brennan Johnson cross that was about to be met by Son denied the South Korean a second. Additionally, Son could not contain his fury when Bryan Gil took three touches and then gave the ball away after a rare stray pass from Bernardo Silva invited a first-time pass to the Tottenham captain.\nAnd this was in the first-half period that City dominated.\nThe second period was more even, but it still came as a surprise on both occasions when Tottenham got themselves level.\nThe first time was after Son had created the opening for Lo Celso, and the second when Kulusevski met Brennan Johnson's cross.\nFurious Haaland draws a blank\nHaaland was genuinely furious as he stormed down the tunnel.\nHis frustration was obvious to everyone and pity the poor door when he entered the City dressing room.\nHooper's decision was hasty, but chances are that Haaland was already simmering over his two incredible first-half failures to score.\nThe Norwegian sent one shot wide from 10 yards when it appeared he had to score with the goal at his mercy. Towards the end of the opening period, Haaland skied a shot over after Alvarez prodded a pass into his path.\nEven then, the forward's reflective reaction was not that of someone who was entirely happy with his lot - and his temper had not improved by the end.\nCity were still excellent overall and Foden's goal was a thing of beauty.\nIn a slick exchange, Haaland played a first-time pass to Doku, who immediately found Alvarez, and he spun round and presented Foden with an invitation to score which the England man immediately accepted.\nIf there was a moment to sum up the excellence on show, that was it.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nMavropanos had the chance to make amends for his earlier mistake when he rose to meet a ball into the box but his header landed just wide of the far post.\nPablo Fornals' cross was met by Jarrod Bowen in added time but it could only land in the grateful arms of away goalkeeper Sam Johnstone as West Ham had to settle for a point.\nHammers frustrated after dropping points\nWest Ham could have made it three consecutive league wins but were unable to make the most of their opportunities against Palace.\nMavrapanos' error was West Ham's only lapse in concentration throughout the match but it proved costly with David Moyes' side unable to find another opening.\nEngland forward Bowen, back in the starting line-up after suffering a minor knee issue during the international break, got beyond Joachim Andersen but was unable to lift the ball over Johnstone for the required finish.\nKudus was in the thick of the action, regularly troubling the Palace defence and he thought he had a second for the hosts just after the break but it was ruled out for offside with Tomas Soucek deemed to be interfering with play and in the eyeline of Johnstone.\nLucas Paqueta whipped in a brilliant ball at the back post but Emerson was unable to sort his feet out and ended up blazing it over the bar.\nA worrying trend continued for West Ham, who have now lost 12 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, with only Burnley (14) losing more.\nMoyes told BBC Sport: \"It was a really tight Premier League game. We got in front but gave away a horrendous goal.\n\"Sometimes in these games, you just have to see it out, but I have to say we made two or three chances at the end which on another day we might have scored.\n\"It wasn't our best point, it wasn't our best performance but we will take something from the game.\"\nPalace lack cutting edge\nPalace, who had lost four of their previous five league games, did not manage a shot on target in the first half, despite a decent start - Edouard hooking a volley wide in the 12th minute as he was unable to shift his body position.\nWithin a minute of that miss, they were behind, and battling to find a way back. Michael Olise, recently returned from a hamstring injury, was Palace's main threat but struggled to create much of note. A threaded pass through to Edouard was cut out as the Frenchman tried to move his side further up the pitch.\nJordan Ayew, in for the injured Eberechi Eze, skewed an effort well wide, and Tyrick Mitchell put in a poor cross from a promising position, while an Andersen free-kick hit the West Ham wall and deflected out for a corner.\nRoy Hodgson's side have not scored in the first half in 11 of their 14 matches, with only newly promoted Luton Town (13) and Sheffield United (12) failing to score more often.\nEdouard did find an equaliser early in the second half, but Palace's lack of cutting edge was laid bare as their last shot of the match was taken by Olise in the 55th minute.\nA midweek match against Bournemouth is followed by fixtures against high-flying Liverpool and Manchester City, which will require Palace to be much sharper.\nHodgson told BBC Sport: \"I thought for large parts of the game, especially the bulk of the first half in particular,we actually played well. We established a lot of control and the game was even during that period.\n\"I think their [West Ham's] first attempt in our penalty area put them 1-0 up but where we really had to show resilience was at the end - because the 1-1 is basically there for you, you've earned it but unfortunately on the back of two bad results, the anxiety tends to creep in.\n\"Hats off to the players. I hope they're satisfied with their performance and I hope they get some confidence from it because I certainly got some confidence from the team's performance today.\""

I think everyone was really ready to go for it and we calmed that down.\n\"The first goal was a great goal and the second goal was outstanding - we would have loved to have ended it earlier but we take the three points and keep going.\"\nHowever, there was bad news for Liverpool, with Klopp's post-match confirmation that centre-back Joel Matip has ruptured an anterior cruciate knee ligament - an injury sustained during Sunday's win over Fulham.\nPositives for Wilder despite defeat\nIf the Bramall Lane board were after an immediate reaction by reappointing self-confessed Blades fan Wilder, they got it.\n\"He's one of our own,\" chanted the home supporters prior to the first whistle and Wilder's demands for a return to the Blades' core values, after a number of embarrassing defeats, were certainly met.\nA team who had conceded 39 goals in their previous 14 league games - including eight to Newcastle and five to both Burnley and Arsenal - gave free-scoring Liverpool relatively few sniffs in open play.\nIndeed, it was the Blades who fashioned the best chance of the opening half-hour as Cameron Archer robbed Joe Gomez and fed James McAtee, whose shot was well saved by Caoimhin Kelleher.\nOwner relationship repaired a long time ago - Wilder\nChief among the positives for Wilder will have been the efforts of Archer, a real livewire on the counter, who caused the Liverpool defence constant concern but just lacked support at the vital times.\nBrentford and Luton are the next two visitors to Bramall Lane and, despite only taking five points from a possible 45, United are far from cast adrift thanks to the paucity of points gathered by their rivals at the foot of the table.\n\"First and foremost I asked for a performance and I definitely got that but I'm disappointed we haven't got a result,\" Wilder told BBC Match of the Day.\nOn his welcome back, he added: \"It will stay with me forever, that. I enjoyed watching a Sheffield United performance tonight and the reception they gave me was incredible.\"\nRuthless Reds get the job done\nWhile this was far from a classic Liverpool display, boss Jurgen Klopp will have taken delight in the businesslike manner they handled proceedings, considering the occasion and partisan atmosphere.\nStand-in goalkeeper Kelleher - arguably at fault for two of Fulham's goals at Anfield on Sunday - made that key early save to thwart McAtee when the Reds were caught on the counter.\nAnd Alexander-Arnold continued to answer his critics with yet another goal involvement, providing the delivery for Van Dijk's opener.\nHe now has 75 assists in all competitions for Liverpool - only Kevin De Bruyne (129) and Mohamed Salah (80) have more in the Premier League since Alexander-Arnold made his debut in 2016.\nThe biggest negative for Klopp was the sight of Alexis Mac Allister limping off to add to an injury list that includes first-choice keeper Alisson, Diogo Jota, Joel Matip, Andrew Robertson and Thiago.\nSalah was denied his 200th Liverpool goal by a fine save from Wes Foderingham, who also excellently foiled Nunez one-on-one, but the Reds still claimed a first away league win in five attempts.\nThere was still the odd sign of the defensive issues that have plagued Liverpool this season but they registered a first clean sheet in nine away trips.\nHowever, they did enjoy the benefit of officiating decisions that could have gone either way for both of their goals as well as over a possible nudge, which went unpunished, by Ibrahima Konate on McAtee in the Liverpool area.\nSzoboszlai - the rise of Liverpool's Hungarian hero"

That admission came from current manager Ten Hag, who had endorsed the exclusion of four members of the media for his pre-match press conference.\nUnited's ninth-minute penalty underlined the issue.\nWhen the ball was played to Antony, had he been confident with his right foot, he would have taken it into space and a shooting opportunity would have presented himself.\nInstead, as he tends to do, he cut inside and into trouble. As it happened Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez slid across his foot as he came to make a tackle and, while the incident was missed in real time, the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) freeze-frame provided referee Chris Kavanagh with the evidence to overturn his decision.\nRobert Sanchez's save to his right was one of a number from Chelsea's Spanish keeper.\nAntony, Rasmus Hojlund and Garnacho were all denied in conventional fashion. Very much from the unorthodox - or lucky - variety was the double stop to repel McTominay.\nThe Scot's point-blank header hit Sanchez and the rebound came straight back after striking the United midfielder, but again the Chelsea keeper was in the way.\nGarnacho's attempt at repeating his phenomenal volleyed goal at Everton was always destined to fail as more chances came and went.\nBy the time Marcus Rashford was introduced into the fray six minutes from time after being left out of the starting line-up for a Premier League or Champions League game for the first time this season other than due to illness or suspension, Ten Hag had reverted to containment mode.\nLocal boy Palmer on target\nChelsea forward Palmer was brought up close to Old Trafford in Wythenshawe.\nHis ties to the area are so strong he was a notable presence at a Sunday League cup final last spring.\nEvidently, Palmer is far better than that level. He is also impatient given he opted to quit Manchester City for Chelsea this summer despite scoring the winner for Pep Guardiola's side in the Uefa Super Cup.\nHe had already hurt his old club with a last-minute equaliser in the 4-4 epic at Stamford Bridge. On his first appearance at Old Trafford, Palmer cut on to his left foot on the edge of the area as the opening period drew to a close and squeezed a low shot between Victor Lindelof and Maguire and into the bottom corner.\nIt was his fifth goal for the Blues, but also his last decent opportunity.\nMykhailo Mudryk wasted two first-half chances and Fernandez failed to turn home Reece James' cross inside the six-yard box as Chelsea suffered their sixth defeat of what is turning into another season of chronic inconsistency.\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance?

I take responsibility for that.\n\"I didn't deserve that tonight from the supporters - we all let them down and we have to take responsibility.\"\nIwobi set the Cottagers on their way to victory after 30 minutes when he beat the offside trap to convert Willian's beautifully whipped cross, before Jimenez doubled the lead four minutes later by firing emphatically into the top right corner.\nThe Mexican forward showed strength and composure to grab his second and Fulham's third early in the second half, shrugging off Forest defender Ola Aina, rounding goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos and then dispatching a cheeky back-heel\nIwobi was allowed far too much space in the box and met Harry Wilson's cross to score Fulham's fourth, and the scoring was rounded off by substitute Tom Cairney late on as Forest's defence was nowhere to be seen.\nThe win moves Fulham up to 12th with an 11-point cushion to the relegation zone, while Forest - with just one win in their last 11 matches in the Premier League - are three points further back in 16th.\nPerforming on the road still a problem for Forest\nNottingham Forest fans have become accustomed to seeing their team struggle on the road, picking up just eight of they 38 points they collected in 2022-23 away from the City Ground.\nThey have won just two of their 27 away fixtures since earning promotion from the Championship.\nAnother away fixture looms on Saturday with a trip to Wolves, before they face a double-header against Tottenham and Bournemouth at the City Ground prior to Christmas.\nForest are preparing for a busy period with five fixtures across the next 24 days, and Cooper will certainly want to see more desire from his players in those matches than he did at Craven Cottage.\nCooper added: \"[It is] painful, and painful in so many ways. It's a result we have to accept is our fault and we deserve.\n\"It's on the back of technical and tactical failings. On top of that, not enough desire or will. [Desire] is not something I questioned before.\n\"Tonight we lacked everything to have any chance of success in the game - we fell short in so many ways.\"\nCottagers starting to click\nFulham made a poor start to the season, winning just two of their opening seven matches, but have clicked into gear over recent weeks and are a force to be reckoned with in attack.\nMarco Silva's men scored only 10 goals in their opening 12 fixtures, but have now found the net 11 times in their last three, having hit three against both Liverpool in Sunday's 4-3 defeat and in the preceding victory over Wolves.\nJimenez, signed in the summer from Wolves, seems to be finding his feet following a rough three years since suffering a significant head injury and is beginning to demonstrate that he is capable of succeeding former talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic.\nIwobi also caught the eye with his work ethic and goals to ensure the Cottagers made easy work of their lacklustre visitors.\nFollow live text coverage of Fulham v Nottingham Forest, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Fulham's performance?

It's an unbelievable feeling.\n\"It's my first game at the Amex in front of all the fans. I'm delighted to get the goal and three points, it's a brilliant feeling.

I think everyone was really ready to go for it and we calmed that down.\n\"The first goal was a great goal and the second goal was outstanding - we would have loved to have ended it earlier but we take the three points and keep going.\"\nHowever, there was bad news for Liverpool, with Klopp's post-match confirmation that centre-back Joel Matip has ruptured an anterior cruciate knee ligament - an injury sustained during Sunday's win over Fulham.\nPositives for Wilder despite defeat\nIf the Bramall Lane board were after an immediate reaction by reappointing self-confessed Blades fan Wilder, they got it.\n\"He's one of our own,\" chanted the home supporters prior to the first whistle and Wilder's demands for a return to the Blades' core values, after a number of embarrassing defeats, were certainly met.\nA team who had conceded 39 goals in their previous 14 league games - including eight to Newcastle and five to both Burnley and Arsenal - gave free-scoring Liverpool relatively few sniffs in open play.\nIndeed, it was the Blades who fashioned the best chance of the opening half-hour as Cameron Archer robbed Joe Gomez and fed James McAtee, whose shot was well saved by Caoimhin Kelleher.\nOwner relationship repaired a long time ago - Wilder\nChief among the positives for Wilder will have been the efforts of Archer, a real livewire on the counter, who caused the Liverpool defence constant concern but just lacked support at the vital times.\nBrentford and Luton are the next two visitors to Bramall Lane and, despite only taking five points from a possible 45, United are far from cast adrift thanks to the paucity of points gathered by their rivals at the foot of the table.\n\"First and foremost I asked for a performance and I definitely got that but I'm disappointed we haven't got a result,\" Wilder told BBC Match of the Day.\nOn his welcome back, he added: \"It will stay with me forever, that. I enjoyed watching a Sheffield United performance tonight and the reception they gave me was incredible.\"\nRuthless Reds get the job done\nWhile this was far from a classic Liverpool display, boss Jurgen Klopp will have taken delight in the businesslike manner they handled proceedings, considering the occasion and partisan atmosphere.\nStand-in goalkeeper Kelleher - arguably at fault for two of Fulham's goals at Anfield on Sunday - made that key early save to thwart McAtee when the Reds were caught on the counter.\nAnd Alexander-Arnold continued to answer his critics with yet another goal involvement, providing the delivery for Van Dijk's opener.\nHe now has 75 assists in all competitions for Liverpool - only Kevin De Bruyne (129) and Mohamed Salah (80) have more in the Premier League since Alexander-Arnold made his debut in 2016.\nThe biggest negative for Klopp was the sight of Alexis Mac Allister limping off to add to an injury list that includes first-choice keeper Alisson, Diogo Jota, Joel Matip, Andrew Robertson and Thiago.\nSalah was denied his 200th Liverpool goal by a fine save from Wes Foderingham, who also excellently foiled Nunez one-on-one, but the Reds still claimed a first away league win in five attempts.\nThere was still the odd sign of the defensive issues that have plagued Liverpool this season but they registered a first clean sheet in nine away trips.\nHowever, they did enjoy the benefit of officiating decisions that could have gone either way for both of their goals as well as over a possible nudge, which went unpunished, by Ibrahima Konate on McAtee in the Liverpool area.\nSzoboszlai - the rise of Liverpool's Hungarian hero",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Aston Villa 1-0 Manchester City: Leon Bailey scores winner as super hosts leapfrog struggling visitors\nLeon Bailey's deflected shot gave Aston Villa a fully deserved victory over Manchester City as the visitors' recent slump in form continued.\nVilla were superior throughout against the lacklustre champions, who have now gone four Premier League games without a win for the first time in more than seven years.\nCity once again missed the influence of the suspended Rodri, having lost their last five games when the Spaniard has been unavailable, but nothing must detract from an outstanding Villa performance which confirmed their stunning development under the management of Unai Emery.\nVilla were fearless going forward from the outset, with City keeper Ederson making two fine early saves from Pau Torres and Bailey, while opposite number Emi Martinez did superbly to deny Erling Haaland twice in quick succession.\nCity lacked composure and were ran ragged at times, and the Villa breakthrough came 16 minutes from time when Bailey's shot from the edge of the area took a touch off Ruben Dias as it looped beyond the helpless Ederson.\nThe win moves Villa, who have now won 14 consecutive home Premier League matches, into third place in the table, while City are six points adrift of leaders Arsenal.\nVilla look the real deal\nEmery is producing outstanding progress at Villa and the emphatic manner in which they overpowered last season's Treble winners is arguably the finest demonstration of his impact so far.\nVilla secured their 14th home league win in a row with a high-quality display allied to a fierce intensity and organisation that is the trademark of their manager.\nThe 22 shots Villa fired at Ederson's goal are the most Pep Guardiola has seen his side face since taking over at City, whose meagre two efforts in total was a fair reflection of the hosts' superiority.\nBailey's pace and ingenuity tormented City out wide while John McGinn was the epitome of Villa's tireless attitude that they maintained until the final whistle.\nIf City had snatched an equaliser, not that looked likely to do so at any stage, it would have been robbery and desperately cruel on Villa.\nIn the end Villa survived comfortably, even looking the more likely to score again as the match drifted towards full-time.\nThe rapturous reception for Emery and his players once the whistle had blown was totally merited.\n\"We were preparing the match trying to get this good performance collectively,\" said Emery. \"We did good work defensively with a high press and we were trying to be aggressive.\n\"We did a fantastic match, but there is still work to do for Saturday [at home to Arsenal]. The goalkeeper saved us in one or two actions.\n\"We were getting more comfortable and we're connected with our supporters, they pushed us.\n\"When you are playing Manchester City you have to get your moments and try to control the game. We created chances but it was a very tough match.\n\"Leon Bailey is a very good player, and sometimes - what a player. Our challenge with him is to be consistent. He played amazingly and I will try to get him to do the same on Saturday. He was fantastic and we can enjoy it with him.\"\nMan City out of form and off the pace\nCity's fall off in form can hardly be described as a crisis, but this run of four league games without a win will undoubtedly be a source of concern to Guardiola.\nYes, City were without Rodri, but there was far more behind this defeat than his absence.\nCity, remarkably, lacked creativity and were over-run on occasions by Villa's sheer hunger and determination in a fierce Villa Park atmosphere.\nIn their previous three draws - against Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham - City could justifiably claim they played well enough to have won, but they can make no such case this time.\nThey were second best throughout and the increase in tempo and pressure most inside Villa Park expected to come after the break did not materialise.\nCity, obviously, are missing the world-class Kevin De Bruyne through injury, and former captain Ilkay Gundogan has not yet been adequately replaced.

I take responsibility for that.\n\"I didn't deserve that tonight from the supporters - we all let them down and we have to take responsibility.\"\nIwobi set the Cottagers on their way to victory after 30 minutes when he beat the offside trap to convert Willian's beautifully whipped cross, before Jimenez doubled the lead four minutes later by firing emphatically into the top right corner.\nThe Mexican forward showed strength and composure to grab his second and Fulham's third early in the second half, shrugging off Forest defender Ola Aina, rounding goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos and then dispatching a cheeky back-heel\nIwobi was allowed far too much space in the box and met Harry Wilson's cross to score Fulham's fourth, and the scoring was rounded off by substitute Tom Cairney late on as Forest's defence was nowhere to be seen.\nThe win moves Fulham up to 12th with an 11-point cushion to the relegation zone, while Forest - with just one win in their last 11 matches in the Premier League - are three points further back in 16th.\nPerforming on the road still a problem for Forest\nNottingham Forest fans have become accustomed to seeing their team struggle on the road, picking up just eight of they 38 points they collected in 2022-23 away from the City Ground.\nThey have won just two of their 27 away fixtures since earning promotion from the Championship.\nAnother away fixture looms on Saturday with a trip to Wolves, before they face a double-header against Tottenham and Bournemouth at the City Ground prior to Christmas.\nForest are preparing for a busy period with five fixtures across the next 24 days, and Cooper will certainly want to see more desire from his players in those matches than he did at Craven Cottage.\nCooper added: \"[It is] painful, and painful in so many ways. It's a result we have to accept is our fault and we deserve.\n\"It's on the back of technical and tactical failings. On top of that, not enough desire or will. [Desire] is not something I questioned before.\n\"Tonight we lacked everything to have any chance of success in the game - we fell short in so many ways.\"\nCottagers starting to click\nFulham made a poor start to the season, winning just two of their opening seven matches, but have clicked into gear over recent weeks and are a force to be reckoned with in attack.\nMarco Silva's men scored only 10 goals in their opening 12 fixtures, but have now found the net 11 times in their last three, having hit three against both Liverpool in Sunday's 4-3 defeat and in the preceding victory over Wolves.\nJimenez, signed in the summer from Wolves, seems to be finding his feet following a rough three years since suffering a significant head injury and is beginning to demonstrate that he is capable of succeeding former talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic.\nIwobi also caught the eye with his work ethic and goals to ensure the Cottagers made easy work of their lacklustre visitors.\nFollow live text coverage of Fulham v Nottingham Forest, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Fulham's performance?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of West Ham's display? Send us your views here\nBowen epitomises tireless performance\nWest Ham are in a purple patch, but for much of the first half against their London rivals the Hammers barely had a touch as Tottenham seemed to dictate play at will.\nGhanaian Mohammed Kudus had a strike ruled out for offside and Lucas Paqueta sent a header narrowly wide as the visitors got a foothold just before the break.\nHaving absorbed Spurs' pressure West Ham were fortunate to level when Kudus' shot deflected off both Romero and Ben Davies and into the path of Bowen who dinked the ball over onrushing Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario.\nTwenty minutes later Bowen, again playing up front with regular number nine Michail Antonio recovering from a hamstring injury, forced Vicario to rush off his line to deal with Udogie's horror backpass.\nThe Italian pushed the ball straight to Ward-Prowse who duly netted West Ham's second after first striking the post.\n\"We were up against it tonight, we had to dig in and thankfully we just about scraped it,\" Moyes added on Amazon Prime.\n\"[It was a] huge performance because of the quality of the opposition. We are a team who can give some of the good teams a bloody nose, we have that in us.\"\nWest Ham were clinical when they needed to be with leading scorer Bowen epitomising his side's tireless performance.\nThey have won 10 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season - only Brighton (11) and Liverpool (15) have recovered more.\nAnd the visitors' latest win means they remain ninth in the table and face Fulham in their next league match on Sunday.\nSpurs drop points from winning positions again\nJust over a month ago, Tottenham beat Crystal Palace to go five points clear at the top of the Premier League table with their eighth league victory in 10 matches.\nFive games without a win have followed, Spurs' longest winless run since November 2019.\nHaving taken an early lead, Ange Postecoglou's side were seemingly cruising and almost had a second just before the break when Giovani Lo Celso's dangerous cross was deflected on to the woodwork by returning West Ham captain Kurt Zouma.\nAnd in the 70th minute, with the scores level at 1-1, substitute Richarlison should have headed Spurs back in front, but glanced a Porro cross wide from close range.\nDefeat means Tottenham have lost 16 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nThey stayed fifth in the table, three points off Manchester City in fourth and face seventh-placed Newcastle in their next match on Sunday."

Without those 10 points, we'd be in an amazing position - 20 points would be amazing relatively to the last two seasons here.\n\"We will see what the appeal brings. The mentality is key for me, we took a knock but there have been a lot of knocks here over the last couple of years.\n\"But the team mentality is growing. I can't emphasise it enough, the commitment to each other and the connection is a powerful thing because I know we've got quality.\"\nLatest Everton news, analysis and fan views\nGet Blues news notifications\nWin a 'reward' for fans' backing\nThe feeling of injustice following the biggest sporting sanction handed down in top-flight history remains raw at Goodison Park.\nBefore the game, the Premier League anthem was loudly jeered once more while new protest cards were published and held aloft with 'Protecting the few, not the many' printed on them.\nBut the anger that had simmered beforehand turned to sheer joy by full-time.\nTwo players who have been so important under Dyche came to the fore once more, with Dwight McNeil scoring his 16th career goal, with 14 of those coming under the ex-Burnley boss, while Abdoulaye Doucoure netted his 10th under the manager.\nThere was time for summer signing Beto to get his first in the league too to give Everton a thoroughly deserved victory.\nEverton came into the game following a 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest on Saturday and their away home has been excellent so far, but it is their troubles at home that has needed fixing.\nThey did this in emphatic fashion to collect just their second Premier League victory in front of their fans this season and achieve back-to-back league wins for the first time under Dyche.\nThe viewpoint from fans and pundits has been that is it a 'good season' to be docked points as Luton, Burnley and Sheffield United - who currently occupy the relegation spots - could face an immediate return to the Championship.\nDyche said: \"With so many enforced changes, I was so pleased. You have heard me talk about the mentality this season and you can sense a connected group. We are on to something.\n\"I don't change my storyline, my value is a season's work. The ups and downs of it are what you have to control as a manager and the results too but the end of the season is where it counts.\n\"The points [deduction] is done therefore let's get on with it and the players have been responsive to that and parked it.\n\"We cannot guarantee anything coming back but we have to keep playing hard like we were anyway.\n\"It was a good performance against Manchester United [a 3-0 defeat in their previous home game] and we backed that up with another two good performances.\n\"The amount of fans that get in here every time we play here is a reward for them. They have supported us without doubt in their numbers but also in voice.\"\nFormer Everton forward James McFadden, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, emphasised the importance of Thursday's win.\n\"Being out of the bottom three is massive for Everton,\" he said.\n\"This season they have created chance after chance, not taken them and not got the points their play has deserved - and it looked like it might be that way again.\n\"It's massive psychologically for them to get the win.\"\nOur coverage of Everton is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Everton - go straight to all the best content",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 2-1 Chelsea: Scott McTominay double lands hosts crucial win\nFor the second time this season, Scott McTominay scored twice at Old Trafford to secure a precious victory for Manchester United and ease the pressure on manager Erik ten Hag.\nThe Scotland midfielder's latest effort against Chelsea was not as thrilling as the two he scored in injury-time to beat Brentford in October.\nBut on a night when United contrived to waste a succession of chances - including a Bruno Fernandes penalty - amid a total of 28 shots, it was just as welcome.\nMcTominay's first effort was an instinctive strike from 12 yards as the rebound from Harry Maguire's blocked header bounced kindly for him.\nThen, after Cole Palmer had levelled just before the break, McTominay stole in at the far post to power home Alejandro Garnacho's cross 21 minutes from time.\nHe should have had a first career hat-trick after being set up by Antony but scuffed his finish into the ground.\nIn the end, it didn't matter, as United survived late Chelsea pressure, including substitute Armando Broja heading against a post.\nIt was just over 15 years since these two met in a Champions League final, part of a seven-year period where one or the other ended up as Premier League title winners.\nThe bragging rights on this occasion only secured the hosts a move up to sixth spot, while the visitors remained 10th.\nIt also extended United's recent dominance in these matches to 12 games, while Chelsea's wait for an away win will now extend beyond 11 years.\nAntony flatters to deceive\nAntony gave an interview to one of United's fan channels in the build-up to the game in which he complained about former players who have been critical of his performances.\nThe Brazilian, of course, did not sanction the \u00a382m fee his club paid Ajax for him just over 15 months ago.\nIt does, however, make Antony the second most expensive player in the history of a club where defeats bring criticism. That admission came from current manager Ten Hag, who had endorsed the exclusion of four members of the media for his pre-match press conference.\nUnited's ninth-minute penalty underlined the issue.\nWhen the ball was played to Antony, had he been confident with his right foot, he would have taken it into space and a shooting opportunity would have presented himself.\nInstead, as he tends to do, he cut inside and into trouble. As it happened Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez slid across his foot as he came to make a tackle and, while the incident was missed in real time, the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) freeze-frame provided referee Chris Kavanagh with the evidence to overturn his decision.\nRobert Sanchez's save to his right was one of a number from Chelsea's Spanish keeper.\nAntony, Rasmus Hojlund and Garnacho were all denied in conventional fashion. Very much from the unorthodox - or lucky - variety was the double stop to repel McTominay.\nThe Scot's point-blank header hit Sanchez and the rebound came straight back after striking the United midfielder, but again the Chelsea keeper was in the way.\nGarnacho's attempt at repeating his phenomenal volleyed goal at Everton was always destined to fail as more chances came and went.\nBy the time Marcus Rashford was introduced into the fray six minutes from time after being left out of the starting line-up for a Premier League or Champions League game for the first time this season other than due to illness or suspension, Ten Hag had reverted to containment mode.\nLocal boy Palmer on target\nChelsea forward Palmer was brought up close to Old Trafford in Wythenshawe.\nHis ties to the area are so strong he was a notable presence at a Sunday League cup final last spring.\nEvidently, Palmer is far better than that level. He is also impatient given he opted to quit Manchester City for Chelsea this summer despite scoring the winner for Pep Guardiola's side in the Uefa Super Cup.\nHe had already hurt his old club with a last-minute equaliser in the 4-4 epic at Stamford Bridge. On his first appearance at Old Trafford, Palmer cut on to his left foot on the edge of the area as the opening period drew to a close and squeezed a low shot between Victor Lindelof and Maguire and into the bottom corner.\nIt was his fifth goal for the Blues, but also his last decent opportunity.\nMykhailo Mudryk wasted two first-half chances and Fernandez failed to turn home Reece James' cross inside the six-yard box as Chelsea suffered their sixth defeat of what is turning into another season of chronic inconsistency.\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance?

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Aston Villa 1-0 Manchester City: Leon Bailey scores winner as super hosts leapfrog struggling visitors\nLeon Bailey's deflected shot gave Aston Villa a fully deserved victory over Manchester City as the visitors' recent slump in form continued.\nVilla were superior throughout against the lacklustre champions, who have now gone four Premier League games without a win for the first time in more than seven years.\nCity once again missed the influence of the suspended Rodri, having lost their last five games when the Spaniard has been unavailable, but nothing must detract from an outstanding Villa performance which confirmed their stunning development under the management of Unai Emery.\nVilla were fearless going forward from the outset, with City keeper Ederson making two fine early saves from Pau Torres and Bailey, while opposite number Emi Martinez did superbly to deny Erling Haaland twice in quick succession.\nCity lacked composure and were ran ragged at times, and the Villa breakthrough came 16 minutes from time when Bailey's shot from the edge of the area took a touch off Ruben Dias as it looped beyond the helpless Ederson.\nThe win moves Villa, who have now won 14 consecutive home Premier League matches, into third place in the table, while City are six points adrift of leaders Arsenal.\nVilla look the real deal\nEmery is producing outstanding progress at Villa and the emphatic manner in which they overpowered last season's Treble winners is arguably the finest demonstration of his impact so far.\nVilla secured their 14th home league win in a row with a high-quality display allied to a fierce intensity and organisation that is the trademark of their manager.\nThe 22 shots Villa fired at Ederson's goal are the most Pep Guardiola has seen his side face since taking over at City, whose meagre two efforts in total was a fair reflection of the hosts' superiority.\nBailey's pace and ingenuity tormented City out wide while John McGinn was the epitome of Villa's tireless attitude that they maintained until the final whistle.\nIf City had snatched an equaliser, not that looked likely to do so at any stage, it would have been robbery and desperately cruel on Villa.\nIn the end Villa survived comfortably, even looking the more likely to score again as the match drifted towards full-time.\nThe rapturous reception for Emery and his players once the whistle had blown was totally merited.\n\"We were preparing the match trying to get this good performance collectively,\" said Emery. \"We did good work defensively with a high press and we were trying to be aggressive.\n\"We did a fantastic match, but there is still work to do for Saturday [at home to Arsenal]. The goalkeeper saved us in one or two actions.\n\"We were getting more comfortable and we're connected with our supporters, they pushed us.\n\"When you are playing Manchester City you have to get your moments and try to control the game. We created chances but it was a very tough match.\n\"Leon Bailey is a very good player, and sometimes - what a player. Our challenge with him is to be consistent. He played amazingly and I will try to get him to do the same on Saturday. He was fantastic and we can enjoy it with him.\"\nMan City out of form and off the pace\nCity's fall off in form can hardly be described as a crisis, but this run of four league games without a win will undoubtedly be a source of concern to Guardiola.\nYes, City were without Rodri, but there was far more behind this defeat than his absence.\nCity, remarkably, lacked creativity and were over-run on occasions by Villa's sheer hunger and determination in a fierce Villa Park atmosphere.\nIn their previous three draws - against Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham - City could justifiably claim they played well enough to have won, but they can make no such case this time.\nThey were second best throughout and the increase in tempo and pressure most inside Villa Park expected to come after the break did not materialise.\nCity, obviously, are missing the world-class Kevin De Bruyne through injury, and former captain Ilkay Gundogan has not yet been adequately replaced. Perhaps there is something of a hangover from last season's superb Treble, too.\nOnly a fool would question or write off a side as brilliant as Guardiola's City, but there is no doubt something is currently missing from what is normally a slick footballing machine.\nFollow live text coverage of Aston Villa v Manchester City, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of West Ham's display? Send us your views here\nBowen epitomises tireless performance\nWest Ham are in a purple patch, but for much of the first half against their London rivals the Hammers barely had a touch as Tottenham seemed to dictate play at will.\nGhanaian Mohammed Kudus had a strike ruled out for offside and Lucas Paqueta sent a header narrowly wide as the visitors got a foothold just before the break.\nHaving absorbed Spurs' pressure West Ham were fortunate to level when Kudus' shot deflected off both Romero and Ben Davies and into the path of Bowen who dinked the ball over onrushing Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario.\nTwenty minutes later Bowen, again playing up front with regular number nine Michail Antonio recovering from a hamstring injury, forced Vicario to rush off his line to deal with Udogie's horror backpass.\nThe Italian pushed the ball straight to Ward-Prowse who duly netted West Ham's second after first striking the post.\n\"We were up against it tonight, we had to dig in and thankfully we just about scraped it,\" Moyes added on Amazon Prime.\n\"[It was a] huge performance because of the quality of the opposition. We are a team who can give some of the good teams a bloody nose, we have that in us.\"\nWest Ham were clinical when they needed to be with leading scorer Bowen epitomising his side's tireless performance.\nThey have won 10 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season - only Brighton (11) and Liverpool (15) have recovered more.\nAnd the visitors' latest win means they remain ninth in the table and face Fulham in their next league match on Sunday.\nSpurs drop points from winning positions again\nJust over a month ago, Tottenham beat Crystal Palace to go five points clear at the top of the Premier League table with their eighth league victory in 10 matches.\nFive games without a win have followed, Spurs' longest winless run since November 2019.\nHaving taken an early lead, Ange Postecoglou's side were seemingly cruising and almost had a second just before the break when Giovani Lo Celso's dangerous cross was deflected on to the woodwork by returning West Ham captain Kurt Zouma.\nAnd in the 70th minute, with the scores level at 1-1, substitute Richarlison should have headed Spurs back in front, but glanced a Porro cross wide from close range.\nDefeat means Tottenham have lost 16 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nThey stayed fifth in the table, three points off Manchester City in fourth and face seventh-placed Newcastle in their next match on Sunday.",

Without those 10 points, we'd be in an amazing position - 20 points would be amazing relatively to the last two seasons here.\n\"We will see what the appeal brings. The mentality is key for me, we took a knock but there have been a lot of knocks here over the last couple of years.\n\"But the team mentality is growing.

You have heard me talk about the mentality this season and you can sense a connected group. We are on to something.\n\"I don't change my storyline, my value is a season's work. The ups and downs of it are what you have to control as a manager and the results too but the end of the season is where it counts.\n\"The points [deduction] is done therefore let's get on with it and the players have been responsive to that and parked it.\n\"We cannot guarantee anything coming back but we have to keep playing hard like we were anyway.\n\"It was a good performance against Manchester United [a 3-0 defeat in their previous home game] and we backed that up with another two good performances.\n\"The amount of fans that get in here every time we play here is a reward for them. They have supported us without doubt in their numbers but also in voice.\"\nFormer Everton forward James McFadden, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, emphasised the importance of Thursday's win.\n\"Being out of the bottom three is massive for Everton,\" he said.\n\"This season they have created chance after chance, not taken them and not got the points their play has deserved - and it looked like it might be that way again.\n\"It's massive psychologically for them to get the win.\"\nOur coverage of Everton is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Everton - go straight to all the best content"

We're too together to let outside influence get involved.\"\nOn whether he's had any conversations with the Forest ownership about his future, Cooper said: \"I don't think about that. I can only tell you how I genuinely feel.\n\"The greater good of this football club is always the most important for me and the only thing in my head since Fulham was how do we play well at Wolves, how do we get a result. Nothing else has entered my head. Anyone's situation including mine is irrelevant.\"\nOn Saturday, Toffolo put Forest ahead at Molineux after 12 minutes with the left wing-back rising to head home Neco Williams' deep cross, beating the covering Wolves defenders.\nBut the hosts upped their game and equalised following a slick passing move, culminating in Pablo Sarabia cutting back for Cunha, with the Brazilian applying the finish.\nCheikhou Kouyate should have put Forest ahead shortly before half-time but was denied, one-on-one by Jose Sa, who returned in goal for Wolves after missing Tuesday's win over Burnley with a back spasm.\nAnthony Elanga smacked the bar from eight yards out early in the second half and Toffolo missed a golden chance with another header as Forest dominated while seeking a much-needed winner.\nFollow all the action live from today's Premier League matches\nForest tweaks not enough for three points\nCooper appears to be on borrowed time as Forest manager despite Saturday's result. However, he still has the backing of the players, said Toffolo.\n\"We were embarrassed on Wednesday,\" Toffolo told Sky Sports of the Fulham defeat. \"We came here and knew we had to put it right.\n\"The love and support we've got for the manager, you can see it in abundance out there, you can see how together the group is, how much everyone wants to play for this manager. We're really proud to be part of that performance.\"\nIf the man who guided his side back to the Premier League in 2022 is to leave the club, he will not go without trying everything first.\nCooper made seven changes to the starting XI from the side thumped at Craven Cottage, including a change of goalkeeper with Matt Turner returning and, crucially, a change of formation to a 3-5-2 after playing a back four against Fulham.\nThat change of shape was crucial in putting Forest ahead, as the wing-backs combined for the opener - Williams' cross from the right met by Toffolo steaming in from the left.\nIt delighted the noisy and sizable travelling support, who sang Cooper's name from the opening seconds to after the final whistle.\n\"It was just gratitude,\" Cooper said when asked about his post-match interactions with fans.\n\"We've succeeded over the last two years, the core of that has been the belief and the connection between supporters. We want to represent the city and football club as best we can and we've done that with real togetherness.\n\"The supporters are incredible and once again they show how to support a football club on the world stage of the Premier League. You saw the culture at its strongest today.\"\nBut despite all those changes, Forest remain porous at the back and were cut apart when Wolves got their passing moves going. They have now conceded 12 goals in their past four away league matches - and were grateful to Turner who made a good low save from Cunha in the second half.\nMilestones for Cunha and O'Neil\nWhile several of Wolves' games this season have been defined more by VAR than action on the field, Gary O'Neil's side are capable of playing some very good football.\nCentral to that is Cunha, who has become the fourth Brazilian to score or assist in five consecutive Premier League games, after Arsenal players Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli and former Manchester City midfielder Elano.\nWolves have now scored in 15 consecutive Premier League matches, as they climb further away from what looked like early relegation worries.\nWolves rise to 12th in the Premier League, which will give O'Neil reason to cheer in his 50th Premier League game.",

They now have 15 in their past four and, after a slow start, are looking up the table.\nMeanwhile, this was a day to quickly forget for West Ham and David Moyes - just three days after the Hammers boss described his side's comeback win over Tottenham as \"one of the biggest wins\" of his career.\nA win could have moved the visitors level with fifth-placed Tottenham, but with that opportunity missed they must now dust themselves down as they seek to clinch top spot in their Europa League group when they host Freiburg on Thursday night.\n\"Probably the Tottenham game played a big part in today. Mentally and physically we found it tough,\" Moyes said.\n\"We used up too much energy in midweek and we weren't able to get ourselves back. [But there is] no excuse for the result,\" he added."

He wanted to come back here after last season.\n\"I'm delighted to be managing him and to have the chance of trying to get something out of him.\"\nBrentford 'have to keep going'\nThe Bees have slipped into a poor run of form as they face a stern test of their squad depth with a host of injuries to key players.\nYoane Wissa had a couple of half-chances saved as Brentford rarely threatened an equaliser but boss Thomas Frank said he cannot complain about the effort of his players.\n\"This is the Premier League. You can quickly run into a patch of games and you can lose four in five.\n\"Unfortunately it has happened right now. We have to keep going. Injuries don't help any team. I think we have a little bit too many,\" he added."

This is the challenge that we have ahead of us. Prove them wrong and still be there.\"\nVictory means the defending champions stay fourth, four points behind leaders Liverpool, while third-from-bottom Luton are now four points off safety following Everton's win over Chelsea.\nHow did you rate Luton's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester City's display? Send us your views here\nCity record first league win in five weeks\nCity came into Sunday's fixture on the back of their joint-longest run without a win under Guardiola.\nWhile key players Rodri and Grealish returned after missing Wednesday's loss to Aston Villa through suspension, leading scorer Erling Haaland was absent having picked up a foot injury in training.\n'I don't know' - Guardiola on Haaland injury recovery time\nAt half-time there was a real sense of jeopardy for City, who would have been seven points off Liverpool with a loss.\nBut in the second half, despite not having Haaland's imposing presence up front, City returned to their ruthless selves.\nJust before their goals they hit the bar through Ruben Diaz's thunderous shot following Nathan Ake's cutback.\nAnd once they took the lead they held Luton at arm's length to record their first league win since beating Bournemouth 6-1 on 4 November.\n\"The way they run and fight coming here and behave like we behaved, I am really, really, really proud,\" said Guardiola.\n\"We were seven points behind before the game. Now we are four, so we are a little bit closer. In my experience in this country the Premier League is so long, so it never ends.\"\nLuton slip further adrift\nLuton have faced last season's top two in the space of five days and have taken the lead in both matches only to be stung by second-half comebacks.\nIt is a testament to how far the Hatters have risen up the football pyramid in recent seasons, and a bouncing Kenilworth Road was again witness to Luton going ahead against a powerhouse of English football.\nHowever, outside of Adebayo's goal, the hosts were limited to half-chances. And, despite two promising performances, Edwards' side have lost their past three matches and won only one of their past 10.\nLuton were also fortunate not to have been reduced to 10 men in the 70th minute when Jacob Brown caught Phil Foden above the Englishman's ankle. But, after a video assistant review, the Scotland forward went unpunished.\n\"We can take confidence; we are playing well, performing well,\" Luton manager Rob Edwards told Match of the Day.\n\"We tried to not let them get their rhythm, get their game going. The goal was an excellent example of that.\n\"(Defeat) is frustrating, especially when you go 1-0 up. Full credit to Manchester City - that's what top teams do.\"\nA gap is re-emerging between the bottom three and the rest of the division. At half-time on Sunday Luton were a point above the relegation zone in the as-things-stand table.\nBut their loss, coupled with Everton's win, means they ended the day further adrift in the bottom three and in desperate need of points.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool: Mohamed Salah scores 200th Reds goal in comeback win\nMohamed Salah scored his 200th Liverpool goal as Jurgen Klopp's side produced a late comeback against 10-man Crystal Palace to move top of the Premier League and increase the pressure on former boss Roy Hodgson.\nSalah became only the fifth player to reach that landmark for the club, joining Ian Rush, Roger Hunt, Gordon Hodgson and Billy Liddell, when he ignited the fightback with a 76th-minute equaliser.\nIt was Harvey Elliott who delivered the decisive moment inside the first of 10 minutes of added time, producing a stunning strike from the edge of the penalty area to lift Liverpool above Arsenal.\nSalah's goal arrived just 98 seconds after Jordan Ayew was dismissed for a second bookable offence, and the visitors had failed to land a shot on target prior to that moment.\nPalace, booed off by their supporters following a disappointing home loss to Bournemouth on Wednesday, were on course to deliver a surprise blow to the Reds' title aspirations following Jean-Philippe Mateta's penalty.\nThe game had continued for more than one minute after Jarell Quansah caught Mateta when attempting to clear a cross before the video assistant referee intervened - but referee Andy Madley did not take long to award Palace a spot-kick after being sent to the pitchside monitor.\nPalace had seen a penalty decision in their favour overturned during the first half when Madley took three minutes to review a challenge by Will Hughes on Endo in the lead-up to Virgil van Dijk's foul on Odsonne Edouard inside the box.\nLiverpool, though dominant, struggled throughout to break the hosts down and the returning Alisson came to his side's rescue in stunning fashion in the first half when he pushed Jefferson Lerma's first-time shot on to the post.\nThe visitors again had the Brazilian to thank for another excellent stop to prevent Joachim Andersen providing a dramatic twist with a header from a free-kick in the 100th minute.\nHaving eventually ended Palace's spirited resistance, victory took the Reds one point above last season's runners-up Arsenal, who lost 1-0 to third-placed Aston Villa later on Saturday.\n\"I told the boys that's the first game I've seen somebody play as bad as we did for 76 minutes and still win,\" Klopp told TNT Sports.\n\"In this period of the year we have to get through, we need results. Nobody is in for the Oscar award for best football game ever, it's about three points. We got them and we are more than happy.\"\nGame heading in wrong direction, says Hodgson\nLiverpool show title momentum\nAfter this late show, at the end of a largely frustrating match in which they found clear-cut chances difficult to come by, Liverpool's sole league defeat this season remains the controversial stoppage-time loss at Tottenham. They appear genuine title contenders.\nKlopp's side, like current closest rivals Arsenal, are demonstrating an ability to turn setbacks into victories.\nThey have scored a league-leading 14 goals in the last 15 minutes of matches this season, while the 18 points they have taken from losing positions is also unmatched.\nWhile champions Manchester City have stuttered, the Reds extended their unbeaten run to nine games to leapfrog Arsenal.\nKlopp, who has made no secret of his disdain for early Saturday kick-offs, refreshed his side from Wednesday's win over Sheffield United with five changes -goalkeeper Alisson's return from a two-match injury absence among them.\nBut despite their control, the visit to Selhurst Park was shaping up to be a missed opportunity as Liverpool failed to test Sam Johnstone and had Alisson's quick reactions to thank for not trailing sooner.\nThey were significantly aided in their pursuit of rescuing a late result by Ayew's exit, but Liverpool were relentless after Salah equalised and Elliott's stunner was their reward.\nSalah's tally of 200 goals has arrived in 327 appearances for the club since joining from Roma for \u00a334m in June 2017, also contributing 86 assists in that time, and he will undoubtedly be key to their ability to maintain a title push.\n\"I see the mentality to keep fighting until the end. We keep doing that,\" said Salah, who also reached 150 Premier League goals, on the similarities between the current side and Liverpool's 2019-20 title winners.\n\"We have a new team now because there's six or seven [new] players. We need to give them advice. They're learning a lot and they're really nice. We can do something special this year.\"\nPressure on Hodgson to inspire change of fortune\nWhile this was an improved performance on the loss to Bournemouth, Palace remain in a precarious position - and with the pressure mounting on Hodgson to prove he can inspire a change in fortunes.\nRecent results certainly do not make for pleasant reading. Palace have won only once in their past nine league matches, suffering six defeats and amassing just five points.\nThat run leaves them seven points above the bottom three before the rest of the weekend's action, and it is the recent defeats by Everton, Luton and Bournemouth - three of the six sides currently below them - which will be of most concern to supporters.\nHodgson has not helped his own situation, this week apologising to the fans after saying the boos which greeted the full-time whistle on Wednesday were evidence they had been \"spoiled\" in recent times.\nSacked after 20 matches as Liverpool boss in 2011, Hodgson has lost all eight meetings with his former club during Klopp's tenure - but he would have been sensing an opportunity as his side battled to protect their advantage until the latter stages.\nBut Ayew's dismissal - his second yellow card awarded for preventing a Liverpool counter-attack - marked the start of Palace's collapse, and they have now suffered four consecutive Premier League home defeats for the first time since February 2017.\nThings do not get any easier, with a trip to Manchester City next.\n\"To say I'm gutted about the way that game went and the result we have had to accept today would be an incredible understatement,\" Hodgson told BBC Sport.\n\"I am very disappointed. I think we were very harshly treated. Unfortunately going down to 10 men cost us. I told the referee what I thought at the end of the game. I'm not going to repeat it. He might.\"\nWhat happened to the children taken by Russian forces?: Panorama uncovers a trail of evidence leading to the Russian Parliament\nA Christmas party playlist from Radio 1: Featuring festive hits from artists such as Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus and Ed Sheeran"

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Arsenal's display? Send us your views here\nAre Villa title contenders?\nOnly in 1980-81, when they last won the title, have Aston Villa taken more points after 16 games of a top-flight season, and there is a real belief that they can break into the top four.\nThere are even whispers that Unai Emery, once of Arsenal, could manage an outside push for the title.\nVilla are the only Premier League club not to have dropped a point from a winning position this season, and, although Arsenal had the better chances after falling behind, Villa did create a few more of their own.\nOllie Watkins forced two good saves from Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya, one of them when clean through, although the England striker was soon flagged for offside.\nIn the second period Lucas Digne and Watkins both had shots saved following counter-attacks.\nVilla defended with discipline and intensity, ultimately benefitting from a late VAR call to stay third, one point off Arsenal in second place, and win their opening eight home matches in a top-flight season for the first time since 1932-33.\nLate VAR drama denies Arsenal\nArsenal started Saturday top of the table, dropping to second after Liverpool's win over Crystal Palace at lunchtime.\nMikel Arteta's side's last defeat had come at Newcastle at the start of November and his team had been enjoying a four-match winning run in the league.\nThey created plenty of chances at a boisterous Villa Park. Bukayo Saka put a shot wide from close range just before McGinn's opener and Gabriel Martinelli dinked the ball over Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez but saw his effort hacked off the line by Diego Carlos in the first half.\nArsenal captain Martin Odegaard had good chances from 12 yards out either side of the break. The first was saved by Martinez, while the second skidded wide.\nThey also had a penalty shout just after half-time when Douglas Luiz caught Gabriel Jesus' ankle in the area, only for the VAR to uphold referee Gillett's decision to wave play on.\nThe Gunners came close again midway through the second period when a routine corner was spilled by Martinez and deflected off Watkins on to the post before being cleared away with William Saliba lurking.\nAnd Saka had the ball in the net in the second half after dribbling around Martinez but had timed his run a fraction too early.\nBut the real drama was still to come. In stoppage time Havertz brought down a cross and hacked the ball into the Villa net.\nThe goal was immediately ruled out on the field, but it took a VAR review to confirm Havertz had inadvertently controlled the ball with his hand.\nArsenal would not create another clear chance, slipping to a second league defeat of the season.",

It was almost a perfect afternoon for us,\" said Silva.\n\"Confidence builds confidence and the best example of this is Raul [Jimenez],\" the Fulham manager added. \"We are not really different now, we changed and adjusted some things but the faith in our players was always there.\"\nFollow live text commentary of Sunday's Premier League action here\nJimenez and Fulham hit their stride\nJimenez has struggled to rediscover his former level since he suffered that potentially career-ending head injury playing for Wolves against Arsenal in November 2020.\nBut the goals are beginning to flow for the 32-year-old again - as they are for a Fulham side whose shortcomings in attack appeared a major concern only a matter of weeks ago.\nJimenez's current run of four goals in five Premier League games is as many as he managed in his previous 49 appearances in the competition.\nBut, having scored twice in a Premier League game for the first time since January 2020 in the midweek thrashing of Forest, he has now scored in consecutive appearances for the first time since October 2020.\nAnd, crucially for Fulham, the club's \u00a35m summer signing is beginning to demonstrate he is capable of filling the void left by talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic's departure.\nThe Mexican's thumping header after 22 minutes ignited Fulham, who had been second best in the opening stages - though James Ward-Prowse's superbly hit free-kick from more than 30 yards out was Bernd Leno's only save of note.\nWest Ham, desperately lacking energy and ideas, were subsequently blown away in the space of 18 minutes as Fulham treated their fans to another excellent home performance.\nA half-time substitute after the lively Willian picked up an injury which Silva will hope is not serious, Wilson hit the best goal of Fulham's five-star showing before collecting Harrison Reed's ball over the top and allowing Vinicius to slot in from close range.\nThe Cottagers scored just 10 goals in their opening 12 league games of the season. They now have 15 in their past four and, after a slow start, are looking up the table.\nMeanwhile, this was a day to quickly forget for West Ham and David Moyes - just three days after the Hammers boss described his side's comeback win over Tottenham as \"one of the biggest wins\" of his career.\nA win could have moved the visitors level with fifth-placed Tottenham, but with that opportunity missed they must now dust themselves down as they seek to clinch top spot in their Europa League group when they host Freiburg on Thursday night.\n\"Probably the Tottenham game played a big part in today. Mentally and physically we found it tough,\" Moyes said.\n\"We used up too much energy in midweek and we weren't able to get ourselves back. [But there is] no excuse for the result,\" he added.",

We're too together to let outside influence get involved.\"\nOn whether he's had any conversations with the Forest ownership about his future, Cooper said: \"I don't think about that. I can only tell you how I genuinely feel.\n\"The greater good of this football club is always the most important for me and the only thing in my head since Fulham was how do we play well at Wolves, how do we get a result. Nothing else has entered my head. Anyone's situation including mine is irrelevant.\"\nOn Saturday, Toffolo put Forest ahead at Molineux after 12 minutes with the left wing-back rising to head home Neco Williams' deep cross, beating the covering Wolves defenders.\nBut the hosts upped their game and equalised following a slick passing move, culminating in Pablo Sarabia cutting back for Cunha, with the Brazilian applying the finish.\nCheikhou Kouyate should have put Forest ahead shortly before half-time but was denied, one-on-one by Jose Sa, who returned in goal for Wolves after missing Tuesday's win over Burnley with a back spasm.\nAnthony Elanga smacked the bar from eight yards out early in the second half and Toffolo missed a golden chance with another header as Forest dominated while seeking a much-needed winner.\nFollow all the action live from today's Premier League matches\nForest tweaks not enough for three points\nCooper appears to be on borrowed time as Forest manager despite Saturday's result. However, he still has the backing of the players, said Toffolo.\n\"We were embarrassed on Wednesday,\" Toffolo told Sky Sports of the Fulham defeat. \"We came here and knew we had to put it right.\n\"The love and support we've got for the manager, you can see it in abundance out there, you can see how together the group is, how much everyone wants to play for this manager. We're really proud to be part of that performance.\"\nIf the man who guided his side back to the Premier League in 2022 is to leave the club, he will not go without trying everything first.\nCooper made seven changes to the starting XI from the side thumped at Craven Cottage, including a change of goalkeeper with Matt Turner returning and, crucially, a change of formation to a 3-5-2 after playing a back four against Fulham.\nThat change of shape was crucial in putting Forest ahead, as the wing-backs combined for the opener - Williams' cross from the right met by Toffolo steaming in from the left.\nIt delighted the noisy and sizable travelling support, who sang Cooper's name from the opening seconds to after the final whistle.\n\"It was just gratitude,\" Cooper said when asked about his post-match interactions with fans.\n\"We've succeeded over the last two years, the core of that has been the belief and the connection between supporters. We want to represent the city and football club as best we can and we've done that with real togetherness.\n\"The supporters are incredible and once again they show how to support a football club on the world stage of the Premier League. You saw the culture at its strongest today.\"\nBut despite all those changes, Forest remain porous at the back and were cut apart when Wolves got their passing moves going. They have now conceded 12 goals in their past four away league matches - and were grateful to Turner who made a good low save from Cunha in the second half.\nMilestones for Cunha and O'Neil\nWhile several of Wolves' games this season have been defined more by VAR than action on the field, Gary O'Neil's side are capable of playing some very good football.\nCentral to that is Cunha, who has become the fourth Brazilian to score or assist in five consecutive Premier League games, after Arsenal players Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli and former Manchester City midfielder Elano.\nWolves have now scored in 15 consecutive Premier League matches, as they climb further away from what looked like early relegation worries.\nWolves rise to 12th in the Premier League, which will give O'Neil reason to cheer in his 50th Premier League game."

It's about small steps. Everybody played their part,\" he added.\nThe win is only Sheffield United's second in the Premier League this season and came in Wilder's second match back in charge following a 2-0 defeat against Liverpool in midweek.\nIt was also the Blades' first clean sheet of the season but it was not enough for them to jump off the foot of the table as they remain bottom on goal difference from Burnley, with both sides on eight points from 16 games.\nRelive text commentary of Saturday's Premier League games here\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance?

Send us your views here\nBlades sub Anis Ben Slimane missed a great chance to make it 2-0 after 56 minutes as he shot straight at Mark Flekken in the Brentford goal.\nBrentford, without top scorer Bryan Mbeumo through injury, struggled to create many openings as they fell to a fourth defeat in their last five games.\n\"We have had two days training [since I arrived]. We were a bit off in the first half. Is that because of what they did on Wednesday? Possibly,\" said Wilder.\n\"We possibly should have put the game to bed before the end. This is a day to be celebrated and then we move on to Chelsea [next Saturday],\" he added.\nGoalmouth action had been few and far between when Brentford's Frank Onyeka was cautioned in the 29th minute for a tackle on Vini Souza with the high challenge checked for a potential red card by the video assistant referee but it remained a yellow.\nThe game suddenly sprung to life in the closing moments of the first half as Sheffield United forward Will Osula hit the side-netting after being played through by Gustavo Hamer before Brentford's Neal Maupay was denied by Jack Robinson's block.\nMagical McAtee makes the difference\nMcAtee's goal came after the visitors made a mess of clearing the ball and Gustavo Hamer found the 21-year-old who stepped inside and hit a shot which gave Flekken no chance.\nWilder was full of praise for McAtee's \"outstanding\" performance.\nHe added: \"He has great ability and he loves playing for this club. He wanted to come back here after last season.\n\"I'm delighted to be managing him and to have the chance of trying to get something out of him.\"\nBrentford 'have to keep going'\nThe Bees have slipped into a poor run of form as they face a stern test of their squad depth with a host of injuries to key players.\nYoane Wissa had a couple of half-chances saved as Brentford rarely threatened an equaliser but boss Thomas Frank said he cannot complain about the effort of his players.\n\"This is the Premier League.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Arsenal's display? Send us your views here\nAre Villa title contenders?\nOnly in 1980-81, when they last won the title, have Aston Villa taken more points after 16 games of a top-flight season, and there is a real belief that they can break into the top four.\nThere are even whispers that Unai Emery, once of Arsenal, could manage an outside push for the title.\nVilla are the only Premier League club not to have dropped a point from a winning position this season, and, although Arsenal had the better chances after falling behind, Villa did create a few more of their own.\nOllie Watkins forced two good saves from Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya, one of them when clean through, although the England striker was soon flagged for offside.\nIn the second period Lucas Digne and Watkins both had shots saved following counter-attacks.\nVilla defended with discipline and intensity, ultimately benefitting from a late VAR call to stay third, one point off Arsenal in second place, and win their opening eight home matches in a top-flight season for the first time since 1932-33.\nLate VAR drama denies Arsenal\nArsenal started Saturday top of the table, dropping to second after Liverpool's win over Crystal Palace at lunchtime.\nMikel Arteta's side's last defeat had come at Newcastle at the start of November and his team had been enjoying a four-match winning run in the league.\nThey created plenty of chances at a boisterous Villa Park. Bukayo Saka put a shot wide from close range just before McGinn's opener and Gabriel Martinelli dinked the ball over Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez but saw his effort hacked off the line by Diego Carlos in the first half.\nArsenal captain Martin Odegaard had good chances from 12 yards out either side of the break. The first was saved by Martinez, while the second skidded wide.\nThey also had a penalty shout just after half-time when Douglas Luiz caught Gabriel Jesus' ankle in the area, only for the VAR to uphold referee Gillett's decision to wave play on.\nThe Gunners came close again midway through the second period when a routine corner was spilled by Martinez and deflected off Watkins on to the post before being cleared away with William Saliba lurking.\nAnd Saka had the ball in the net in the second half after dribbling around Martinez but had timed his run a fraction too early.\nBut the real drama was still to come. In stoppage time Havertz brought down a cross and hacked the ball into the Villa net.\nThe goal was immediately ruled out on the field, but it took a VAR review to confirm Havertz had inadvertently controlled the ball with his hand.\nArsenal would not create another clear chance, slipping to a second league defeat of the season."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool: Mohamed Salah scores 200th Reds goal in comeback win\nMohamed Salah scored his 200th Liverpool goal as Jurgen Klopp's side produced a late comeback against 10-man Crystal Palace to move top of the Premier League and increase the pressure on former boss Roy Hodgson.\nSalah became only the fifth player to reach that landmark for the club, joining Ian Rush, Roger Hunt, Gordon Hodgson and Billy Liddell, when he ignited the fightback with a 76th-minute equaliser.\nIt was Harvey Elliott who delivered the decisive moment inside the first of 10 minutes of added time, producing a stunning strike from the edge of the penalty area to lift Liverpool above Arsenal.\nSalah's goal arrived just 98 seconds after Jordan Ayew was dismissed for a second bookable offence, and the visitors had failed to land a shot on target prior to that moment.\nPalace, booed off by their supporters following a disappointing home loss to Bournemouth on Wednesday, were on course to deliver a surprise blow to the Reds' title aspirations following Jean-Philippe Mateta's penalty.\nThe game had continued for more than one minute after Jarell Quansah caught Mateta when attempting to clear a cross before the video assistant referee intervened - but referee Andy Madley did not take long to award Palace a spot-kick after being sent to the pitchside monitor.\nPalace had seen a penalty decision in their favour overturned during the first half when Madley took three minutes to review a challenge by Will Hughes on Endo in the lead-up to Virgil van Dijk's foul on Odsonne Edouard inside the box.\nLiverpool, though dominant, struggled throughout to break the hosts down and the returning Alisson came to his side's rescue in stunning fashion in the first half when he pushed Jefferson Lerma's first-time shot on to the post.\nThe visitors again had the Brazilian to thank for another excellent stop to prevent Joachim Andersen providing a dramatic twist with a header from a free-kick in the 100th minute.\nHaving eventually ended Palace's spirited resistance, victory took the Reds one point above last season's runners-up Arsenal, who lost 1-0 to third-placed Aston Villa later on Saturday.\n\"I told the boys that's the first game I've seen somebody play as bad as we did for 76 minutes and still win,\" Klopp told TNT Sports.\n\"In this period of the year we have to get through, we need results. Nobody is in for the Oscar award for best football game ever, it's about three points. We got them and we are more than happy.\"\nGame heading in wrong direction, says Hodgson\nLiverpool show title momentum\nAfter this late show, at the end of a largely frustrating match in which they found clear-cut chances difficult to come by, Liverpool's sole league defeat this season remains the controversial stoppage-time loss at Tottenham. They appear genuine title contenders.\nKlopp's side, like current closest rivals Arsenal, are demonstrating an ability to turn setbacks into victories.\nThey have scored a league-leading 14 goals in the last 15 minutes of matches this season, while the 18 points they have taken from losing positions is also unmatched.\nWhile champions Manchester City have stuttered, the Reds extended their unbeaten run to nine games to leapfrog Arsenal.\nKlopp, who has made no secret of his disdain for early Saturday kick-offs, refreshed his side from Wednesday's win over Sheffield United with five changes -goalkeeper Alisson's return from a two-match injury absence among them.\nBut despite their control, the visit to Selhurst Park was shaping up to be a missed opportunity as Liverpool failed to test Sam Johnstone and had Alisson's quick reactions to thank for not trailing sooner.\nThey were significantly aided in their pursuit of rescuing a late result by Ayew's exit, but Liverpool were relentless after Salah equalised and Elliott's stunner was their reward.\nSalah's tally of 200 goals has arrived in 327 appearances for the club since joining from Roma for \u00a334m in June 2017, also contributing 86 assists in that time, and he will undoubtedly be key to their ability to maintain a title push.\n\"I see the mentality to keep fighting until the end. We keep doing that,\" said Salah, who also reached 150 Premier League goals, on the similarities between the current side and Liverpool's 2019-20 title winners.\n\"We have a new team now because there's six or seven [new] players. We need to give them advice. They're learning a lot and they're really nice. We can do something special this year.\"\nPressure on Hodgson to inspire change of fortune\nWhile this was an improved performance on the loss to Bournemouth, Palace remain in a precarious position - and with the pressure mounting on Hodgson to prove he can inspire a change in fortunes.\nRecent results certainly do not make for pleasant reading. Palace have won only once in their past nine league matches, suffering six defeats and amassing just five points.\nThat run leaves them seven points above the bottom three before the rest of the weekend's action, and it is the recent defeats by Everton, Luton and Bournemouth - three of the six sides currently below them - which will be of most concern to supporters.\nHodgson has not helped his own situation, this week apologising to the fans after saying the boos which greeted the full-time whistle on Wednesday were evidence they had been \"spoiled\" in recent times.\nSacked after 20 matches as Liverpool boss in 2011, Hodgson has lost all eight meetings with his former club during Klopp's tenure - but he would have been sensing an opportunity as his side battled to protect their advantage until the latter stages.\nBut Ayew's dismissal - his second yellow card awarded for preventing a Liverpool counter-attack - marked the start of Palace's collapse, and they have now suffered four consecutive Premier League home defeats for the first time since February 2017.\nThings do not get any easier, with a trip to Manchester City next.\n\"To say I'm gutted about the way that game went and the result we have had to accept today would be an incredible understatement,\" Hodgson told BBC Sport.\n\"I am very disappointed. I think we were very harshly treated. Unfortunately going down to 10 men cost us. I told the referee what I thought at the end of the game. I'm not going to repeat it.

At the beginning [under Andoni Iraola] we were still trying to find our feet with a new philosophy.\n\"We've definitely started gelling in the last few weeks and it has showed on the pitch. To win away at Old Trafford is touching for everyone.\"\nIt could have been even worse for United, but substitute Dango Ouattara had a fourth for Bournemouth ruled out in stoppage time by the video assistant referee for handball.\nSquad not good enough to be consistent - Ten Hag\nComing only three days before United's Champions League meeting with Bayern Munich - which they must win to stand any chance of reaching the last 16 - it was about as bad a day as possible for Ten Hag, winner of the Premier League's latest manager of the month prize.\nHis side have now suffered seven defeats in 16 league games. In all competitions they have lost as many matches - 11 - as they have won. They have been beaten 3-0 three times at home.\nVirtually no-one wearing a red shirt emerged with any credit, with Ten Hag's surprising decision to start Antony Martial backfiring.\nSolanke the striking star\nIn the aftermath of United's tepid defeat at Newcastle last Saturday, it was Martial and Marcus Rashford who came in for the most severe criticism.\nBoth were dropped for the subsequent victory against Chelsea, so it was something of a surprise that Martial was recalled so quickly. The French forward dropped deep on a couple of occasions to link play, but he was no threat to the Bournemouth goal.\nIt did not help that a couple of misreads meant he did not get to one through ball and Alejandro Garnacho failed to react to one of his.\nMartial's only shot of note, from the edge of the area midway through the opening period, did not have any power behind it and was gathered easily by Neto.\nThe contrast with Solanke was striking.\nEvery time the former Chelsea and Liverpool man took possession around the United box, his first instinct was to threaten the goal.\nHis finish maximised the sodden conditions as he used the pace of the low cross after Lewis Cook had taken advantage of static United defending as Bruno Fernandes looped a clearance out of the penalty area to steer the ball in at the far post.\nSolanke was a constant threat. He also struck the base of a post with another shot across goal and it was his header that led to Marcus Tavernier turning home what he thought was a second, which was ruled out for offside.\nThere was not even an hour played when Martial was replaced by Rasmus Hojlund, a move that brought loud cheers from the home support.\nThe substitution made little difference.\nFirst Billing, as he leapt above Luke Shaw, then Senesi, left unmarked at a corner, exposed United frailties in the air to seal a sensational win for Bournemouth.\nFurious Ten Hag\nThe stern look on Ten Hag's face as his players left the field suggested the Dutchman was furious at what he had seen. In that regard, he would not have been on his own.\nThousands of empty red seats shining through the gloom at the final whistle told their own story of a pitiful performance.\nIn both penalty areas, United were deficient and Ten Hag could not seem to find any answers.\nIf anything, it was even worse than the display at St James' Park seven days ago which drew such criticism and triggered reports of splits in the camp.\nShould United not salvage their Champions League status in midweek, they will go to old rivals Liverpool next weekend - when skipper Bruno Fernandes will be suspended after picking up a fifth booking - fearing the kind of hammering inflicted on them last season, when they were beaten 7-0."

It was a joy to watch from the start to the end,\" said Arsenal boss Arteta, whose jubilant celebrations indicated the magnitude of the win.\n\"The way we played against a phenomenal Brighton side was incredible. We were patient, kept going, kept believing and got what we deserved.\"\nWith Liverpool frustrated at home by United, Arsenal now have 39 points from 17 games and next head to Anfield on Saturday for a crucial meeting with Jurgen Klopp's side.\nVisit our dedicated Arsenal page\nAccess all our Brighton content\nArsenal continue to ask questions of Liverpool and Man City\nWith Liverpool playing later on Sunday, and defending champions Manchester City still behind them after dropping points against Crystal Palace, Arsenal had an opportunity to throw down the gauntlet to their rivals.\nLosing a pulsating contest at Aston Villa last weekend had seen the Gunners' relinquish their spot at the summit and a five-match winning streak in the top flight come to an end.\nNevertheless, the mood in the camp remained upbeat with Arteta and his players stressing the positives from a defeat where they had created enough decent chances to earn something.\nAgainst Brighton, Arteta kept faith with the same starting XI and urged them to make amends in front of their home fans.\nThe Gunners were unbeaten in 12 home games - since losing 3-0 to Brighton in May - but the first half followed a familiar pattern.\nArsenal moved the ball with pace and purpose against a deep-lying Brighton side, creating several chances for Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel and Gabriel Martinelli in a one-sided first half.\nHowever, they were unable to find the ruthless streak which Arteta had demanded.\n\"I didn't want to have the feeling of it being another game where we couldn't score - but you think about it. We had so many chances to put the game to bed,\" said Arteta.\nArsenal went into half-time with 15 attempts at goal, of which only three were on target, and the second half started with Odegaard dallying on another chance.\nThe Gunners' skipper was guilty of taking too long when presented with the ball in the box, taking a touch instead of a first-time shot allowing Brighton defender Jan Paul van Hecke to brilliantly nip in.\nThat inadvertently teed up the opening goal, with Van Hecke flicking the resulting corner on to the far post where Jesus pounced.\nArsenal and their fans knew the importance of scoring a second goal to kill off the game, which was further emphasised when Gross slid wide from a cross which he should have converted.\nEventually the hosts did seal victory when Havertz finished off a slick attacking move with a fourth goal in his past seven games.\nSeagulls feed on scraps as scoring streak ends\nBrighton are facing a different challenge this season as they juggle domestic and European campaigns with a squad stretched by injury.\nThree days after they clinched a place in the Europa League last 16, the Seagulls faced a tight turnaround for one of the toughest trips in the Premier League.\nBrighton boss Roberto de Zerbi said they had only one training session to prepare for the game, but refused to look for excuses after a performance where they offered little attacking threat.\nNevertheless, the game would have had a completely different complexion had Gross equalised.\nThe German perhaps should have slid in with his right leg instead of his left and the miss contributed to Brighton not scoring for the first time in 33 Premier League games.\n\"I'm disappointed for the result but not for the other things. We deserved to lose. Arsenal played much better than us, they deserved to win the game,\" said De Zerbi.\n\"We had the chance to score in the second half. Maybe it could have been different but we didn't deserve any points.\""

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Aston Villa's display? Send us your views here\nUgly scenes could get both teams in trouble\nBoth sides could well face disciplinary action from the Football Association for failing to control their players in a few unpleasant incidents during the closing stages of the match.\nBrentford and Aston Villa each had a player sent off, six players were booked for Brentford, four for Villa, and both managers were cautioned.\nWatkins spent three years at Brentford between 2017 and 2020 and scored 49 goals for the Bees during that time.\nHowever, he celebrated what proved to be the winning goal by standing inside the goal and pointing at a supporter, who may have been abusive towards the England striker.\nBrentford's Saman Ghoddos then shoved Watkins, which caused the first of the scuffles with players from both sides getting involved.\nAfter that came farcical scenes between Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Brentford forward Neal Maupay.\nVilla's Bailey nearly scored an own goal with a misjudged backpass from nearly the halfway line, with the ball hitting the side netting. Maupay, looking to get the ball for the corner, then ran into Martinez, who made a lot of what appeared to be minimal contact.\nThe pair were then involved in another incident, with this time Maupay over-reacting to little contact from the goalkeeper.\nMartinez tried to forcefully lift Maupay off the ground and that sparked pushing from both sides' players with Kamara shoving the face of substitute Yarmoliuk and getting a red card.\nEmery, who appeared to move Martinez away from the incident, was then cautioned in a fiery end to the encounter.\nVilla maintain good run\nThe scenes at the end overshadowed what had developed into an intriguing encounter between two fiercely committed sides.\nBrentford had lost four of their last five matches, while Villa were playing for the second time in four days after their 1-1 draw in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday against Zrinjski Mostar, a result that took Villa into the last 16 of the Europa Conference League.\nThe visitors wanted Brentford to go down to 10 men early in the second half when Christian Norgaard caught John McGinn on the shin, with the home player receiving a yellow card.\nUntil Mee's sending-off, Villa were looking far from their best, with Yoane Wissa missing a glorious chance to double Brentford's advantage, denied by Martinez's excellent save.\nMoreno had earlier missed a couple of chances but made it 1-1 in the 77th minute before Watkins, who had been kept quiet by the Brentford defence, scored an 85th-minute winner.\nVilla have won 12, drawn three and lost only once in their past 16 matches in all competitions. They began the day third in the Premier League and moved up to second, although they will drop back to third if Liverpool avoid defeat against Manchester United in the late kick-off.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Sheffield United's display? Send us your comment here\nBlues make dominance count\nChelsea have endured a bitterly disappointing 2023 but Pochettino will hope Saturday's hard-fought victory is the start of a more encouraging end to the year, with a Carabao Cup quarter-final with Newcastle and league games against Wolves, Crystal Palace and Luton to come.\nDespite enjoying swathes of possession they struggled to penetrate a dogged Sheffield United rearguard in the first half, Gallagher shooting tamely into Foderingham's arms before Jackson curled narrowly wide from the edge of the box.\nTheir first-half efforts were perhaps best summed up by Mykhailo Mudryk, who blazed wildly off target midway through the first period after nutmegging Max Lowe and cutting in from the left.\nThere was an outpouring of relief around Stamford Bridge when Palmer converted Sterling's cross for his eighth goal of the season. Palmer's opener and Jackson's close-range effort were both checked for offside by the video assistant referee (VAR) but no infringement was spotted.\nBroja will be wondering how he failed to score his second Premier League goal of the season late in the game but, thankfully for Pochettino's side, the Albanian's miss did not prove costly.\nChelsea have had a dreadful time with injuries of late but there was positive news before kick-off as Christopher Nkunku was named in the matchday squad for the first time since signing from RB Leipzig in June.\nThe France forward has not featured for the Blues since suffering a knee injury in a pre-season friendly with Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund in August.\nBlades fall short despite encouraging display\nChris Wilder's team claimed only their second Premier League win of the season against Brentford last weekend but were unable to build on that 1-0 victory despite another spirited display in west London.\nOperating with a back four, United restricted their hosts to half chances in the opening 45 minutes and went close themselves when Archer shot wide in a rare foray.\nThey made a bright start to the second half too, but their resistance was broken by Palmer not long after half-time, and Jackson's effort minutes later left the visitors with a mountain to climb.\n\"In the first half we got it spot on,\" Wilder said. \"We limited them to very few chances. It's just the naivety of our approach in the first 15 minutes [of the second half], when we didn't have to go after the ball.\n\"We quickly went from being in the game to being out of the game.\"\nUnited have now failed to score in seven of their 17 league games this term - more than any other side in the division.\nIt does not get any easier for the Blades over the festive period, with games against in-form Aston Villa and champions Manchester City either side of a crucial home clash with fellow strugglers Luton on 26 December."

Nevertheless, Jimenez's challenge on Longstaff proved costly to his club with the home midfielder lucky to avoid any injury.\nFulham, even with 10 men, were a threat on the counter-attack in the first half with Alex Iwobi having a shot saved, but they were overrun after the break.\nIndeed, Newcastle's winning margin could have been greater but England striker Callum Wilson shot against the post in injury-time.\nThe negatives for Newcastle were first-half injuries to Fabian Schar and Joelinton, who both sustained what appeared to be hamstring problems, although Howe's team received a late boost with the return of defender Sven Botman for his first appearance since a knee injury in September.\nBoth Newcastle and Fulham will be aiming for wins in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, away at Chelsea and Everton respectively.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here\nA win made in Burnley\nDyche took charge of the Clarets for over 400 games and brought them up twice from the Championship, but he was dismissed in April 2022 and the team eventually went down again.\nWhen Everton were deducted 10 points for breaching Premier League financial rules last month, some thought the sanction could destroy morale and result in the team and their manager ending up in the second tier.\nDyche has instead injected fresh impetus into their season and the outstanding form has continued, his players collecting their 10th victory in the past 14 games in all competitions to move up to 16th in the table.\nThis was their eighth league win of the top-flight campaign so far, matching their haul from the entirety of last season, and that alone highlights the progress they have made under Dyche.\nNot only did Burnley's old manager come back to haunt them, but two former Clarets players did too as McNeil - who headed narrowly wide when it was goalless - provided the assist for the opener and Keane scored the second.\nCentre-half Keane could have had another in the second half but struck the post from close range, as Everton kept their fourth straight shutout, with only leaders Liverpool and second-placed Arsenal conceding fewer goals than the Blues this term.\nBurnley staring into the abyss\nBurnley have indicated firm support for manager Vincent Kompany, but there is growing concern at the direction of their season, with chairman Alan Pace watching this latest setback from the stands.\nThey have won just two of their 17 Premier League games this season and are off the bottom of the table only on goal difference ahead of fellow strugglers Sheffield United.\nTheir home form is the worst of any team in the competition, winning once at Turf Moor and losing the other eight games, and no team has survived with only eight points at this stage of a Premier League campaign.\nBurnley failed to draw a save from Pickford in the first half and, after going into the interval 2-0 behind, Amdouni's effort from range which was tipped wide by the England goalkeeper was the closest they came to providing any cheer for their despondent supporters.\nThe Clarets travel to Fulham in their next game on 23 December, aiming for three points to avoid a miserable Christmas and provide some hope that they might avoid an immediate return to the Championship."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 0-3 Bournemouth: Dominic Solanke, Phillip Billing & Marco Senesi score\nBournemouth striker Dominic Solanke says the Cherries feel capable of \"beating anyone\" after their \"magnificent\" victory away to Manchester United.\nSolanke's early goal laid the foundations for the visitors' first win at Old Trafford, which increases the pressure on under-fire United manager Erik ten Hag.\nSecond-half headers from Philip Billing and Marcos Senesi in the space of five minutes completed what must go down as one of the most famous triumphs in Bournemouth's history.\n\"The boys are delighted,\" said Solanke. \"We've been building a lot in the last few weeks and we're feeling confident.\n\"I think we've just started clicking. At the beginning [under Andoni Iraola] we were still trying to find our feet with a new philosophy.\n\"We've definitely started gelling in the last few weeks and it has showed on the pitch. To win away at Old Trafford is touching for everyone.\"\nIt could have been even worse for United, but substitute Dango Ouattara had a fourth for Bournemouth ruled out in stoppage time by the video assistant referee for handball.\nSquad not good enough to be consistent - Ten Hag\nComing only three days before United's Champions League meeting with Bayern Munich - which they must win to stand any chance of reaching the last 16 - it was about as bad a day as possible for Ten Hag, winner of the Premier League's latest manager of the month prize.\nHis side have now suffered seven defeats in 16 league games. In all competitions they have lost as many matches - 11 - as they have won. They have been beaten 3-0 three times at home.\nVirtually no-one wearing a red shirt emerged with any credit, with Ten Hag's surprising decision to start Antony Martial backfiring.\nSolanke the striking star\nIn the aftermath of United's tepid defeat at Newcastle last Saturday, it was Martial and Marcus Rashford who came in for the most severe criticism.\nBoth were dropped for the subsequent victory against Chelsea, so it was something of a surprise that Martial was recalled so quickly. The French forward dropped deep on a couple of occasions to link play, but he was no threat to the Bournemouth goal.\nIt did not help that a couple of misreads meant he did not get to one through ball and Alejandro Garnacho failed to react to one of his.\nMartial's only shot of note, from the edge of the area midway through the opening period, did not have any power behind it and was gathered easily by Neto.\nThe contrast with Solanke was striking.\nEvery time the former Chelsea and Liverpool man took possession around the United box, his first instinct was to threaten the goal.\nHis finish maximised the sodden conditions as he used the pace of the low cross after Lewis Cook had taken advantage of static United defending as Bruno Fernandes looped a clearance out of the penalty area to steer the ball in at the far post.\nSolanke was a constant threat. He also struck the base of a post with another shot across goal and it was his header that led to Marcus Tavernier turning home what he thought was a second, which was ruled out for offside.\nThere was not even an hour played when Martial was replaced by Rasmus Hojlund, a move that brought loud cheers from the home support.\nThe substitution made little difference.\nFirst Billing, as he leapt above Luke Shaw, then Senesi, left unmarked at a corner, exposed United frailties in the air to seal a sensational win for Bournemouth.\nFurious Ten Hag\nThe stern look on Ten Hag's face as his players left the field suggested the Dutchman was furious at what he had seen. In that regard, he would not have been on his own.\nThousands of empty red seats shining through the gloom at the final whistle told their own story of a pitiful performance.\nIn both penalty areas, United were deficient and Ten Hag could not seem to find any answers.\nIf anything, it was even worse than the display at St James' Park seven days ago which drew such criticism and triggered reports of splits in the camp.\nShould United not salvage their Champions League status in midweek, they will go to old rivals Liverpool next weekend - when skipper Bruno Fernandes will be suspended after picking up a fifth booking - fearing the kind of hammering inflicted on them last season, when they were beaten 7-0."

This is the challenge that we have ahead of us. Prove them wrong and still be there.\"\nVictory means the defending champions stay fourth, four points behind leaders Liverpool, while third-from-bottom Luton are now four points off safety following Everton's win over Chelsea.\nHow did you rate Luton's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester City's display? Send us your views here\nCity record first league win in five weeks\nCity came into Sunday's fixture on the back of their joint-longest run without a win under Guardiola.\nWhile key players Rodri and Grealish returned after missing Wednesday's loss to Aston Villa through suspension, leading scorer Erling Haaland was absent having picked up a foot injury in training.\n'I don't know' - Guardiola on Haaland injury recovery time\nAt half-time there was a real sense of jeopardy for City, who would have been seven points off Liverpool with a loss.\nBut in the second half, despite not having Haaland's imposing presence up front, City returned to their ruthless selves.\nJust before their goals they hit the bar through Ruben Diaz's thunderous shot following Nathan Ake's cutback.\nAnd once they took the lead they held Luton at arm's length to record their first league win since beating Bournemouth 6-1 on 4 November.\n\"The way they run and fight coming here and behave like we behaved, I am really, really, really proud,\" said Guardiola.\n\"We were seven points behind before the game. Now we are four, so we are a little bit closer. In my experience in this country the Premier League is so long, so it never ends.\"\nLuton slip further adrift\nLuton have faced last season's top two in the space of five days and have taken the lead in both matches only to be stung by second-half comebacks.\nIt is a testament to how far the Hatters have risen up the football pyramid in recent seasons, and a bouncing Kenilworth Road was again witness to Luton going ahead against a powerhouse of English football.\nHowever, outside of Adebayo's goal, the hosts were limited to half-chances. And, despite two promising performances, Edwards' side have lost their past three matches and won only one of their past 10.\nLuton were also fortunate not to have been reduced to 10 men in the 70th minute when Jacob Brown caught Phil Foden above the Englishman's ankle. But, after a video assistant review, the Scotland forward went unpunished.\n\"We can take confidence; we are playing well, performing well,\" Luton manager Rob Edwards told Match of the Day.\n\"We tried to not let them get their rhythm, get their game going. The goal was an excellent example of that.\n\"(Defeat) is frustrating, especially when you go 1-0 up. Full credit to Manchester City - that's what top teams do.\"\nA gap is re-emerging between the bottom three and the rest of the division. At half-time on Sunday Luton were a point above the relegation zone in the as-things-stand table.\nBut their loss, coupled with Everton's win, means they ended the day further adrift in the bottom three and in desperate need of points.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 3-0 Fulham: Lewis Miley sets Magpies record with first goal in Premier League win\nSeventeen-year-old Lewis Miley became Newcastle's youngest Premier League goalscorer as the Magpies bounced back from Champions League elimination with a win over 10-man Fulham.\nFulham had striker Raul Jimenez sent off after 22 minutes following a dangerous, jumping challenge into Sean Longstaff, which caught the Newcastle man in the face.\nOn-pitch referee Sam Barrott originally showed Jimenez a yellow card before video assistant referee Michael Salisbury told Barrott to review the Mexican's challenge, which was then upgraded to a red card.\nAnthony Gordon hit the crossbar for the hosts in the first half, before substitute Miley, who joined the club's academy at the age of seven, fired a low shot past Bernd Leno early in the second half.\nMiguel Almiron added a second goal shortly afterwards when the ball broke to him a few yards out after Callum Wilson thought he had been fouled by Antonee Robinson.\nDan Burn grabbed a third late on, bundling the ball over the line after his header had been parried by Leno.\nThe result ended Newcastle's run of three successive defeats. It came three days after the 2-1 home loss to AC Milan not only led to elimination from the Champions League, but also saw them finish bottom of their group to end their involvement in European competition this season.\nSaturday's Premier League action as it happened\nHow did you rate Newcastle's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Fulham's display? Send us your views here\nThat had been Newcastle's first European adventure since 2012-13 and their first Champions League campaign since 2003-04.\nHowe targets return to Europe's elite\nManager Eddie Howe and defender Burn, writing in the matchday programme, stated how they wanted an instant return to that level next season.\n\"Every disappointment becomes the motivation to push on and we are all hungry to experience the Champions League again and we will work hard to earn the right to compete in it once more,\" said Howe.\n\"Had our squad been less stretched, we believe we had the quality to go further and compete in the latter stages.\"\nThis win, which always looked inevitable after Jimenez's first-half red card, saw Newcastle move up into sixth and above Manchester United, with the Red Devils playing at Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday.\nIt also extended Newcastle's excellent home league record, with this being their seventh successive victory at St James' Park in the competition. Of the 29 points they have earned, 24 of those have come at home.\nFulham up against it early on\nFor Fulham, the outcome meant their poor away run continued and they have now failed to win any of their last eight league matches on their travels. They had beaten both Nottingham Forest and West Ham by 5-0 margins in their past two games, both at Craven Cottage, but hopes of another win were severely dented by Jimenez's dismissal.\nJust before being sent off, the frontman had been caught by a flailing arm by Jamaal Lascelles, with the Newcastle defender not getting booked. Nevertheless, Jimenez's challenge on Longstaff proved costly to his club with the home midfielder lucky to avoid any injury.\nFulham, even with 10 men, were a threat on the counter-attack in the first half with Alex Iwobi having a shot saved, but they were overrun after the break.\nIndeed, Newcastle's winning margin could have been greater but England striker Callum Wilson shot against the post in injury-time.\nThe negatives for Newcastle were first-half injuries to Fabian Schar and Joelinton, who both sustained what appeared to be hamstring problems, although Howe's team received a late boost with the return of defender Sven Botman for his first appearance since a knee injury in September.\nBoth Newcastle and Fulham will be aiming for wins in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, away at Chelsea and Everton respectively."

It was a joy to watch from the start to the end,\" said Arsenal boss Arteta, whose jubilant celebrations indicated the magnitude of the win.\n\"The way we played against a phenomenal Brighton side was incredible. We were patient, kept going, kept believing and got what we deserved.\"\nWith Liverpool frustrated at home by United, Arsenal now have 39 points from 17 games and next head to Anfield on Saturday for a crucial meeting with Jurgen Klopp's side.\nVisit our dedicated Arsenal page\nAccess all our Brighton content\nArsenal continue to ask questions of Liverpool and Man City\nWith Liverpool playing later on Sunday, and defending champions Manchester City still behind them after dropping points against Crystal Palace, Arsenal had an opportunity to throw down the gauntlet to their rivals.\nLosing a pulsating contest at Aston Villa last weekend had seen the Gunners' relinquish their spot at the summit and a five-match winning streak in the top flight come to an end.\nNevertheless, the mood in the camp remained upbeat with Arteta and his players stressing the positives from a defeat where they had created enough decent chances to earn something.\nAgainst Brighton, Arteta kept faith with the same starting XI and urged them to make amends in front of their home fans.\nThe Gunners were unbeaten in 12 home games - since losing 3-0 to Brighton in May - but the first half followed a familiar pattern.\nArsenal moved the ball with pace and purpose against a deep-lying Brighton side, creating several chances for Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel and Gabriel Martinelli in a one-sided first half.\nHowever, they were unable to find the ruthless streak which Arteta had demanded.\n\"I didn't want to have the feeling of it being another game where we couldn't score - but you think about it. We had so many chances to put the game to bed,\" said Arteta.\nArsenal went into half-time with 15 attempts at goal, of which only three were on target, and the second half started with Odegaard dallying on another chance.\nThe Gunners' skipper was guilty of taking too long when presented with the ball in the box, taking a touch instead of a first-time shot allowing Brighton defender Jan Paul van Hecke to brilliantly nip in.\nThat inadvertently teed up the opening goal, with Van Hecke flicking the resulting corner on to the far post where Jesus pounced.\nArsenal and their fans knew the importance of scoring a second goal to kill off the game, which was further emphasised when Gross slid wide from a cross which he should have converted.\nEventually the hosts did seal victory when Havertz finished off a slick attacking move with a fourth goal in his past seven games.\nSeagulls feed on scraps as scoring streak ends\nBrighton are facing a different challenge this season as they juggle domestic and European campaigns with a squad stretched by injury.\nThree days after they clinched a place in the Europa League last 16, the Seagulls faced a tight turnaround for one of the toughest trips in the Premier League.\nBrighton boss Roberto de Zerbi said they had only one training session to prepare for the game, but refused to look for excuses after a performance where they offered little attacking threat.\nNevertheless, the game would have had a completely different complexion had Gross equalised.\nThe German perhaps should have slid in with his right leg instead of his left and the miss contributed to Brighton not scoring for the first time in 33 Premier League games.\n\"I'm disappointed for the result but not for the other things. We deserved to lose. Arsenal played much better than us, they deserved to win the game,\" said De Zerbi.\n\"We had the chance to score in the second half. Maybe it could have been different but we didn't deserve any points.\""

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 2-0 Sheffield United: Blues overcome dogged Blades at Stamford Bridge\nChelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino hailed Cole Palmer's \"massive\" contribution to the Blues' attack after the former Manchester City youngster registered a goal and an assist in Saturday's hard-fought victory over Sheffield United.\nPalmer broke the Blades' resistance when he slotted home Raheem Sterling's pass early in the second half, before teeing up Nicolas Jackson for the Blues' second not long afterwards.\nThe 21-year-old has been directly involved in 13 goals during his 19 appearances since signing from the 2022-23 Treble winners in the summer.\n\"For me he's a playmaker - a player who can link the team,\" Pochettino told BBC Match of the Day. \"He also has the capacity to score goals and give assists.\n\"The contribution of Cole Palmer from day one has been massive.\"\nChelsea enjoyed almost 80% possession across the 90 minutes, but Conor Gallagher's long-range effort was their only shot on target in a forgettable first half for Pochettino's team.\nCameron Archer curled wide for the visitors in the first half and full Chelsea debutant Djordje Petrovic pulled off a fine save from Gustavo Hamer's low free-kick, but that was the closest the visitors came to a breakthrough.\nSecond-half substitute Armando Broja should have increased Chelsea's lead late in the second half but somehow skewed Palmer's low delivery off target from point-blank range.\nThe Blues move up to tenth place on 22 points, while Sheffield United are now six points from safety at the foot of the table.\nReaction to Chelsea v Sheffield United and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Chelsea's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Sheffield United's display? Send us your comment here\nBlues make dominance count\nChelsea have endured a bitterly disappointing 2023 but Pochettino will hope Saturday's hard-fought victory is the start of a more encouraging end to the year, with a Carabao Cup quarter-final with Newcastle and league games against Wolves, Crystal Palace and Luton to come.\nDespite enjoying swathes of possession they struggled to penetrate a dogged Sheffield United rearguard in the first half, Gallagher shooting tamely into Foderingham's arms before Jackson curled narrowly wide from the edge of the box.\nTheir first-half efforts were perhaps best summed up by Mykhailo Mudryk, who blazed wildly off target midway through the first period after nutmegging Max Lowe and cutting in from the left.\nThere was an outpouring of relief around Stamford Bridge when Palmer converted Sterling's cross for his eighth goal of the season. Palmer's opener and Jackson's close-range effort were both checked for offside by the video assistant referee (VAR) but no infringement was spotted.\nBroja will be wondering how he failed to score his second Premier League goal of the season late in the game but, thankfully for Pochettino's side, the Albanian's miss did not prove costly.\nChelsea have had a dreadful time with injuries of late but there was positive news before kick-off as Christopher Nkunku was named in the matchday squad for the first time since signing from RB Leipzig in June.\nThe France forward has not featured for the Blues since suffering a knee injury in a pre-season friendly with Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund in August.\nBlades fall short despite encouraging display\nChris Wilder's team claimed only their second Premier League win of the season against Brentford last weekend but were unable to build on that 1-0 victory despite another spirited display in west London.\nOperating with a back four, United restricted their hosts to half chances in the opening 45 minutes and went close themselves when Archer shot wide in a rare foray.\nThey made a bright start to the second half too, but their resistance was broken by Palmer not long after half-time, and Jackson's effort minutes later left the visitors with a mountain to climb.\n\"In the first half we got it spot on,\" Wilder said. \"We limited them to very few chances. It's just the naivety of our approach in the first 15 minutes [of the second half], when we didn't have to go after the ball.\n\"We quickly went from being in the game to being out of the game.\"\nUnited have now failed to score in seven of their 17 league games this term - more than any other side in the division.\nIt does not get any easier for the Blades over the festive period, with games against in-form Aston Villa and champions Manchester City either side of a crucial home clash with fellow strugglers Luton on 26 December."

To go and perform as they have after last week, words fail me.\n\"We wanted to do it for Tom. It wasn't extra motivation, we just wanted to embody what he's about. He's brave, determined, a fighter, and I thought we showed all of those attributes today.\"\nThe clean sheet - Luton's first since promotion - would have been another tonic for central defender Lockyer as he continues his recovery at home with his family.\nMagpies' rotten run on road goes on\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe spoke before the game about the atmosphere his side were expecting but by the time they came to terms with it, it was too late.\nThey were ultimately undone by a muted first-half showing in which they suffered the latest in a series of seemingly never-ending injury blows as centre-back Jamaal Lascelles limped off.\nDespite their woes, the Magpies should really have taken the lead but Callum Wilson directed his close-range header from Anthony Gordon's cross too close to Thomas Kaminski, who made a smart reaction stop.\nGuimaraes and Gordon were off target with decent openings when the visitors finally kicked into gear, while Isak's cool and classy finish was ruled out by the referee's assistant, the decision confirmed by VAR.\nHowe's side are now seven points off the top four after a disappointing fortnight in which they also exited the Champions League and Carabao Cup - with a paltry away return of just five points from a possible 27 not aiding their domestic cause.",

We have never really been short of confidence as a team,\" Trafford said.\n\"We believe in the whole process. The performances have been there and it was only a matter of time before the results came.\"\nFulham, for their part, were unable to convert their dominance in the first half into goals.\nWhen they fell behind the Cottagers started to look jaded as the exertions of a penalty shootout victory over Everton in the EFL Cup during the week caught up with them.\nFulham have now lost their past three home league games against the Clarets and Marco Silva will look for a quick response at Bournemouth on 26 December.\n\"I think after we conceded the first goal we lost some principles. Clearly we deserved more from the game,\" Silva said.\n\"They had two shots on target but the reality is they were more ruthless.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Newcastle's display? Send us your views here\n\"He's an incredible person. He had the issue [an atrial fibrillation ] at Wembley [in the Championship play-off final] and put his body, his life on the line for the first 16 games.\n\"So we are doing it for him - and we are going to keep doing it for him until if and when he is fit to come back.\n\"It was an emotional rollercoaster [today] but thankfully we got the win at the end of it.\"\nOnly the woodwork denied Luton a more straightforward victory as the excellent Ross Barkley struck the bar with a 35-yard thunderbolt and Jacob Brown also hit the frame of the goal from closer in.\nNewcastle did mount increasing second-half pressure as Alexander Isak had an equaliser ruled out for a marginal offside while Bruno Guimaraes and Anthony Gordon also went close.\nHowever, they slipped to a fourth successive away league defeat to stay seventh while Luton remain 18th but move within two points of safety.\nThe Hatters also have a game in hand on Nottingham Forest, the side directly above them, but Townsend says such concerns pale in comparison with their captain's plight.\n\"In a way it was easy to not feel too much pressure, to not be anxious or worried about where we are in the table,\" he added.\n\"It puts things into perspective - we didn't do much tactical work in the week, it was all about making sure we were in the right frame of mind, knowing there are more important things than football.\"\nHatters hold out to cheer Luton 'legend' Lockyer\nPrior to the game, Luton boss Rob Edwards admitted he did not quite know how his players would react after the scare suffered by Lockyer, a player he described as \"a hugely influential and important figure for this club\".\nMuch of the matchday programme was devoted to Lockyer while both sets of fans unveiled banners with well wishes and there was a fourth-minute period of applause for both the 29-year-old and those who came to his aid.\nEdwards revealed the captain had messaged him prior to the match against Newcastle, telling him to \"get those three points\" which prompted the manager to say his side wanted to make the day special.\nThey did just that, adding to a growing collection of memorable top-flight displays already this season, producing a typically high-energy effort headlined by their two former England players, Townsend and Barkley.\nIt was Barkley who flicked on the corner to give an unmarked Townsend the simplest of headers for the decisive goal and the ex-Everton man was unlucky to see a 'Goal of the Season' contender denied by the crossbar.\nLuton's lead should have been greater as Elijah Adebayo - found by a lovely through ball from Barkley - was thwarted by Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka, who also foiled Brown, Townsend and substitute Ryan Giles.\nThe Hatters have let leads slip on several occasions this season but, backed by a support who at times seemed to will the ball away from danger, they held out amid a barrage of attacks in the last half-hour.\nThe final whistle was greeted with a mixture of relief and delight - and the importance of both result and occasion was evidenced by the time Edwards and his team spent on the pitch afterwards applauding the fans, taking turns to carry Lockyer's shirt.\n\"It's been the greatest challenge of my football career - no coaching badges prepare you for something like this,\" Edwards told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"I've needed the support of everybody and the players have been incredible. To go and perform as they have after last week, words fail me.\n\"We wanted to do it for Tom. It wasn't extra motivation, we just wanted to embody what he's about. He's brave, determined, a fighter, and I thought we showed all of those attributes today.\"\nThe clean sheet - Luton's first since promotion - would have been another tonic for central defender Lockyer as he continues his recovery at home with his family.\nMagpies' rotten run on road goes on\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe spoke before the game about the atmosphere his side were expecting but by the time they came to terms with it, it was too late.\nThey were ultimately undone by a muted first-half showing in which they suffered the latest in a series of seemingly never-ending injury blows as centre-back Jamaal Lascelles limped off.\nDespite their woes, the Magpies should really have taken the lead but Callum Wilson directed his close-range header from Anthony Gordon's cross too close to Thomas Kaminski, who made a smart reaction stop.\nGuimaraes and Gordon were off target with decent openings when the visitors finally kicked into gear, while Isak's cool and classy finish was ruled out by the referee's assistant, the decision confirmed by VAR.\nHowe's side are now seven points off the top four after a disappointing fortnight in which they also exited the Champions League and Carabao Cup - with a paltry away return of just five points from a possible 27 not aiding their domestic cause."

A good team performance and a good result.\"\nBurnley's Trafford was comfortably the busier of the two goalkeepers throughout, and he made two vital saves in the first half with the scoreline goalless.\nThe England Under-21s stopper did well to keep out Harry Wilson's effort at the near post after a jinking run and pushed a deflected Alex Iwobi shot wide of the post.\nA scramble in the box shortly before half-time saw also Iwobi shoot at goal but Zeki Amdouni managed to block.\nBurnley began the second half on the front foot and their early endeavour was rewarded with a fine opening goal.\nOdobert exchanged a neat one-two with Lyle Foster and then opened up his body to spectacularly curl the ball beyond the diving Bernd Leno.\nFrom there Burnley had a spring in their step and Norway midfielder Berge, allowed freedom by a Fulham defence in retreat, fired in a second from the edge of the box.\nFulham piled on the pressure but could not find a way past Trafford, who saved well from Timothy Castagne late on.\nThe result helped Burnley, bottom at kick-off, leapfrog Sheffield United up to 19th place - four points adrift of safety, as Fulham slipped down to 12th.\nClarets show plenty of grit\nThis was a much-needed boost for Kompany's side heading into a festive period in which they will face tough games against Liverpool and Aston Villa.\nWhat will have pleased the Belgian most is the character and stomach for the fight from his side to end a five-match run away from home without a win.\nKeeper Trafford has epitomised that spirit in recent weeks as one of Burnley's most impressive performers, but in this contest he was backed up by the rest of his team-mates.\nThe Clarets pressed, chased and harried when not in possession and showed a real willingness to put their bodies on the line.\nA ruthlessness in front of goal - scoring from their only two shots on target - ensured they have now picked up five more points away from home than at Turf Moor.\nEqually important was Burnley's first clean sheet for 15 Premier League away matches.\nThey will need more of the same if they are to have any chance of avoiding relegation after winning promotion back to the top flight last season.\n\"The whole team really values wins and clean sheets. We have never really been short of confidence as a team,\" Trafford said.\n\"We believe in the whole process. The performances have been there and it was only a matter of time before the results came.\"\nFulham, for their part, were unable to convert their dominance in the first half into goals.\nWhen they fell behind the Cottagers started to look jaded as the exertions of a penalty shootout victory over Everton in the EFL Cup during the week caught up with them.\nFulham have now lost their past three home league games against the Clarets and Marco Silva will look for a quick response at Bournemouth on 26 December.\n\"I think after we conceded the first goal we lost some principles. Clearly we deserved more from the game,\" Silva said.\n\"They had two shots on target but the reality is they were more ruthless.

This did not happen and the final scoreline of 1-1 will suit the pursuing new Club World Cup champions Manchester City more than the two teams on show here.\nCity and Pep Guardiola would have been concerned that the victor here could steal a march while they celebrated their triumph in Saudi Arabia - but this was the result they would have wanted.\nLiverpool, justifiably, will argue they had the better of the chances as substitute Harvey Elliott grazed the outside of a post in the second half and Alexander-Arnold wasted the best chance to win the game when he thrashed a finish against the bar late on.\nThey will also be puzzled how a clear handball by Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard in the first half was missed by the officials and VAR.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nIn the final reckoning, however, Arsenal will take a point with satisfaction despite having been pegged back by Mohamed Salah's 29th-minute thunderbolt after defender Gabriel had headed Arsenal in front after only four minutes.\nIf we are using that old Anfield measure, then their performance here showed an Arsenal team more measured and mature than last season, tough to break down and with a stronger temperament when then going gets tough and the Kop's decibels rise, as they did in the second half.\nLiverpool had stellar performers in defenders Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez but two Arsenal standouts produced the best evidence that they are in good shape for another tilt at the title.\nDeclan Rice was a guarantee of quality and influence, even at \u00a3105m when signed from West Ham United, and proved it again here from before the first whistle to the last.\nRice, it was, who delivered strong messages to his Arsenal team-mates in the pre-match huddle before producing the performance of a thoroughbred.\nThe midfielder's game awareness was peerless, cleaning up danger, picking passes and acting as a constant source of guidance to his team-mates throughout. Rice barely wasted the ball and his presence acts as a source of calm, ideal on the occasions when the storm raged.\nWilliam Saliba took the honours along with him for a magnificent performance in defence but this was no rearguard action by Arsenal, whose clear intent was to win this game and they had it under control until Salah's brilliant finish from Alexander-Arnold's raking pass. Yes, they had to suffer but this was not a timid performance. Arsenal were brave and willing to attack when the chance presented itself.\nGo straight to our Arsenal homepage\nThere was no doubt who was happiest at the final whistle, even though the door has now been left ajar for City, who next play at Everton on 27 December.\nLiverpool manager Klopp, despite his frustration, was equally impressed by Arsenal when he said: \"Oh my God. How strong are they? The good news is we are good as well.\"\nAnd Klopp is not wrong, although he would have hoped for a better haul than two points from home games against Manchester United and the Gunners.\nIt is the first time Liverpool have two gone successive Premier League games at Anfield without winning since October 2021, but it is a testament to their character that they have recovered 19 points from losing positions in the title race this season, more than any other side. They have lost just one league game in 2023-24 despite falling behind in 10.\nFor Arsenal, this was a test in a wider context.\nHistory shows this particular game is examined for flaws in the Gunners' mental and footballing make-up. There were not too many on show here as they left Anfield with an important point and showed they will be right in the Premier League title race once more.\nIs Daisy May Cooper's house really haunted?

They have now have failed to convert 36 big chances in the league this season - the most of any team.\nPochettino said: \"We feel very disappointed because I think we deserve much more. This competition wounds you when you are not clinical enough.\n\"We created chances, that is why it is so disappointing. We conceded after a few corners and it was really difficult.\n\"We have players playing for the first time in the league, they need to adapt. It is confidence and about quality. We need to score if we want to win the games.\"\nNicolas Jackson's contribution was so underwhelming his exit 10 minutes from time was cheered by the Chelsea fans.\nThe result leaves the club 10th, seven points off qualification for the Europa Conference League, which, even at this stage, looks the best the Londoners can hope for.\nNo side has lost more Premier League matches in 2023 than Chelsea (19), while only Almeria (24), Werder Bremen (20) and Empoli (20) have lost more games than the Blues across the big five European leagues this calendar year.\nWolves are now level on points with Pochettino's men after a battling display, although the victory came at a price as experienced defender Craig Dawson limped off during the second half with what appeared to be a serious injury.\nNkunku provides some hope for Chelsea\nIf Chelsea are to make up their deficit on the Premier League's contenders for European places over the second half of the season, they need to get their attack firing.\nFrance international Nkunku's first goal showed what he can deliver, guiding Raheem Sterling's deep cross into the corner of the net after being afforded only minimal space by Wolves skipper Max Kilman.\nPochettino has cautioned about expecting too much from Nkunku, 26, who came on as a second-half substitute after recovering from a knee injury sustained in pre-season.\nHowever, the former RB Leipzig man has the potential to be a game-changer for the Blues after their struggles over the first half of the campaign, which were clearly on display in the first half at Wolves.\nChelsea should have gone in ahead at the break, but first Jackson allowed Sterling's astute far-post chip to roll under his foot when the move was begging for a control and first-time finish.\nThen Sterling, who had responded to the first failed effort with a spin of obvious frustration, raced through on the Wolves goal after nicking the ball off Joao Gomes 40 yards out, but fired straight at Jose Sa.\nIn the second period, by which time Chelsea had fallen behind, Jackson found himself with a clear sight of goal but could not sort his feet out and lost his balance before he could manage a shot.\nJackson now has more yellow cards than Premier League goals and the reception he received from his own fans as he left the field will not do much for his confidence.\nPochettino, said: \"We are going to lose him for one month to AFCON.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Aston Villa's display? Send us your views here\nUgly scenes could get both teams in trouble\nBoth sides could well face disciplinary action from the Football Association for failing to control their players in a few unpleasant incidents during the closing stages of the match.\nBrentford and Aston Villa each had a player sent off, six players were booked for Brentford, four for Villa, and both managers were cautioned.\nWatkins spent three years at Brentford between 2017 and 2020 and scored 49 goals for the Bees during that time.\nHowever, he celebrated what proved to be the winning goal by standing inside the goal and pointing at a supporter, who may have been abusive towards the England striker.\nBrentford's Saman Ghoddos then shoved Watkins, which caused the first of the scuffles with players from both sides getting involved.\nAfter that came farcical scenes between Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Brentford forward Neal Maupay.\nVilla's Bailey nearly scored an own goal with a misjudged backpass from nearly the halfway line, with the ball hitting the side netting. Maupay, looking to get the ball for the corner, then ran into Martinez, who made a lot of what appeared to be minimal contact.\nThe pair were then involved in another incident, with this time Maupay over-reacting to little contact from the goalkeeper.\nMartinez tried to forcefully lift Maupay off the ground and that sparked pushing from both sides' players with Kamara shoving the face of substitute Yarmoliuk and getting a red card.\nEmery, who appeared to move Martinez away from the incident, was then cautioned in a fiery end to the encounter.\nVilla maintain good run\nThe scenes at the end overshadowed what had developed into an intriguing encounter between two fiercely committed sides.\nBrentford had lost four of their last five matches, while Villa were playing for the second time in four days after their 1-1 draw in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday against Zrinjski Mostar, a result that took Villa into the last 16 of the Europa Conference League.\nThe visitors wanted Brentford to go down to 10 men early in the second half when Christian Norgaard caught John McGinn on the shin, with the home player receiving a yellow card.\nUntil Mee's sending-off, Villa were looking far from their best, with Yoane Wissa missing a glorious chance to double Brentford's advantage, denied by Martinez's excellent save.\nMoreno had earlier missed a couple of chances but made it 1-1 in the 77th minute before Watkins, who had been kept quiet by the Brentford defence, scored an 85th-minute winner.\nVilla have won 12, drawn three and lost only once in their past 16 matches in all competitions. They began the day third in the Premier League and moved up to second, although they will drop back to third if Liverpool avoid defeat against Manchester United in the late kick-off.",

They have now have failed to convert 36 big chances in the league this season - the most of any team.\nPochettino said: \"We feel very disappointed because I think we deserve much more. This competition wounds you when you are not clinical enough.\n\"We created chances, that is why it is so disappointing. We conceded after a few corners and it was really difficult.\n\"We have players playing for the first time in the league, they need to adapt. It is confidence and about quality. We need to score if we want to win the games.\"\nNicolas Jackson's contribution was so underwhelming his exit 10 minutes from time was cheered by the Chelsea fans.\nThe result leaves the club 10th, seven points off qualification for the Europa Conference League, which, even at this stage, looks the best the Londoners can hope for.\nNo side has lost more Premier League matches in 2023 than Chelsea (19), while only Almeria (24), Werder Bremen (20) and Empoli (20) have lost more games than the Blues across the big five European leagues this calendar year.\nWolves are now level on points with Pochettino's men after a battling display, although the victory came at a price as experienced defender Craig Dawson limped off during the second half with what appeared to be a serious injury.\nNkunku provides some hope for Chelsea\nIf Chelsea are to make up their deficit on the Premier League's contenders for European places over the second half of the season, they need to get their attack firing.\nFrance international Nkunku's first goal showed what he can deliver, guiding Raheem Sterling's deep cross into the corner of the net after being afforded only minimal space by Wolves skipper Max Kilman.\nPochettino has cautioned about expecting too much from Nkunku, 26, who came on as a second-half substitute after recovering from a knee injury sustained in pre-season.\nHowever, the former RB Leipzig man has the potential to be a game-changer for the Blues after their struggles over the first half of the campaign, which were clearly on display in the first half at Wolves.\nChelsea should have gone in ahead at the break, but first Jackson allowed Sterling's astute far-post chip to roll under his foot when the move was begging for a control and first-time finish.\nThen Sterling, who had responded to the first failed effort with a spin of obvious frustration, raced through on the Wolves goal after nicking the ball off Joao Gomes 40 yards out, but fired straight at Jose Sa.\nIn the second period, by which time Chelsea had fallen behind, Jackson found himself with a clear sight of goal but could not sort his feet out and lost his balance before he could manage a shot.\nJackson now has more yellow cards than Premier League goals and the reception he received from his own fans as he left the field will not do much for his confidence.\nPochettino, said: \"We are going to lose him for one month to AFCON. If we compare Jackson with different players, he has scored goals. We cannot blame him, it is the team. He is young and expectation is massive at Chelsea.\n\"The quality players are here, they wouldn't be at Chelsea otherwise. It is about how you mix these players together. It takes time to work.

This did not happen and the final scoreline of 1-1 will suit the pursuing new Club World Cup champions Manchester City more than the two teams on show here.\nCity and Pep Guardiola would have been concerned that the victor here could steal a march while they celebrated their triumph in Saudi Arabia - but this was the result they would have wanted.\nLiverpool, justifiably, will argue they had the better of the chances as substitute Harvey Elliott grazed the outside of a post in the second half and Alexander-Arnold wasted the best chance to win the game when he thrashed a finish against the bar late on.\nThey will also be puzzled how a clear handball by Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard in the first half was missed by the officials and VAR.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nIn the final reckoning, however, Arsenal will take a point with satisfaction despite having been pegged back by Mohamed Salah's 29th-minute thunderbolt after defender Gabriel had headed Arsenal in front after only four minutes.\nIf we are using that old Anfield measure, then their performance here showed an Arsenal team more measured and mature than last season, tough to break down and with a stronger temperament when then going gets tough and the Kop's decibels rise, as they did in the second half.\nLiverpool had stellar performers in defenders Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez but two Arsenal standouts produced the best evidence that they are in good shape for another tilt at the title.\nDeclan Rice was a guarantee of quality and influence, even at \u00a3105m when signed from West Ham United, and proved it again here from before the first whistle to the last.\nRice, it was, who delivered strong messages to his Arsenal team-mates in the pre-match huddle before producing the performance of a thoroughbred.\nThe midfielder's game awareness was peerless, cleaning up danger, picking passes and acting as a constant source of guidance to his team-mates throughout. Rice barely wasted the ball and his presence acts as a source of calm, ideal on the occasions when the storm raged.\nWilliam Saliba took the honours along with him for a magnificent performance in defence but this was no rearguard action by Arsenal, whose clear intent was to win this game and they had it under control until Salah's brilliant finish from Alexander-Arnold's raking pass. Yes, they had to suffer but this was not a timid performance. Arsenal were brave and willing to attack when the chance presented itself.\nGo straight to our Arsenal homepage\nThere was no doubt who was happiest at the final whistle, even though the door has now been left ajar for City, who next play at Everton on 27 December.\nLiverpool manager Klopp, despite his frustration, was equally impressed by Arsenal when he said: \"Oh my God. How strong are they? The good news is we are good as well.\"\nAnd Klopp is not wrong, although he would have hoped for a better haul than two points from home games against Manchester United and the Gunners.\nIt is the first time Liverpool have two gone successive Premier League games at Anfield without winning since October 2021, but it is a testament to their character that they have recovered 19 points from losing positions in the title race this season, more than any other side. They have lost just one league game in 2023-24 despite falling behind in 10.\nFor Arsenal, this was a test in a wider context.\nHistory shows this particular game is examined for flaws in the Gunners' mental and footballing make-up. There were not too many on show here as they left Anfield with an important point and showed they will be right in the Premier League title race once more.\nIs Daisy May Cooper's house really haunted?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester United's display? Send us your views here\nWest Ham find way to win\nWest Ham are used to watching their opponents dominate possession - they have beaten Arsenal and Tottenham over the past two months with less than 30% possession.\nBut David Moyes' side struggled to be effective on the counter in the first half in a flat game of poor quality on both sides.\nBowen's brilliant header from a corner required Onana to tip over the bar as West Ham struggled to find their rhythm.\nBut after Paqueta's sublime ball set up Bowen, West Ham upped the tempo and the volume from the crowd increased with it.\nFormer Manchester United and England midfielder Paul Scholes said Paqueta - who Manchester City attempted to sign in the summer - reminded him of Eric Cantona.\n\"With performances like that - there will be big clubs wanting him,\" Scholes said on TNT Sports.\n\"You can see Real Madrid, Man City, Arsenal all wanting him. He is a unit and reminds me a bit of Cantona.\"\nKudus doubled the hosts' lead with his 10th goal of the season, nine of which have come at London Stadium, as Manchester United struggled to get back in the game.\nFans have called for West Ham manager Moyes to enter the transfer market in January for a striker but with the threat of Bowen, Kudus and Paqueta, who has assisted the Hammers' last five goals in the league, West Ham look on track to enjoy another fruitful season.\nAn unhappy Christmas for Manchester United\nAfter Manchester United secured a point against Liverpool at Anfield last time out, the mood of negativity seemed to ease but, following a poor performance against a team managed by their former manager, the statistics make for grim reading.\nUnited have lost 13 games in all competitions already this season - the last season they lost more matches before Christmas was in 1930-31 (16), a campaign in which they finished bottom of the top flight.\nThey have also recorded more defeats so far this season than in all 62 competitive games last term.\nAnd they have failed to score in their last four matches in all competitions for the first time since November 1992 under Alex Ferguson.\nRasmus Hojlund, who was replaced by Marcus Rashford after 55 minutes, is still yet to register a goal in the Premier League while Antony has failed to score or provide an assist in all 19 appearances this season.\nWhile Ten Hag's list of injuries is extensive, forcing him to turn to the academy and hand a first senior appearance to 19-year-old defender Willy Kambwala, the lack of chances created with the forward players at his disposal will be a concern for the Dutchman.\nTheir response to going behind appeared to be indifference and they will have to quickly pick themselves up with the prospect of an in-form Villa on the horizon.\nOff the pitch, uncertainty around their ownership continues to rumble on and a resolution looks increasingly unlikely before Christmas."

We didn't have loads of control but we had big opportunities to go one-on-one and we caused them problems.\"\nBees' worries build\nIn his pre-match comments, Brentford boss Thomas Frank said he expected to see his side \"come out flying\" after a 10-day gap since their last game, the unfortunate home loss to Aston Villa.\nBut if anything, their inaction, due to Manchester City's involvement in the Club World Cup, had the opposite effect.\nThey allowed a clinical Wolves side, who had lost their four previous matches on their travels and their last 14 in London, to take complete control in the opening half an hour.\nBoth of Hwang's goals could be classed as belated Christmas gifts from the Brentford backline, while Bellegarde's also came courtesy of a dreadful Collins pass straight to Matheus Cunha on the edge of his own penalty area.\nWorryingly for Frank, his team's sixth defeat in seven games was also the first time they have shipped four at home in the Premier League.\nAnd on this evidence, he will need some players to return soon, with the losses of the suspended Ivan Toney and injured Bryan Mbeumo in particular sorely felt in the final third.\n\"When it rains it pours,\" said Frank. \"This moment in time it doesn't go our way.\n\"We had so many promising attacks and big chances that could have given us a little bit. But it didn't. We performed well, we just made too many big mistakes that killed the game.\"\nHe said they did not deserve the scoreline, but added: \"We made two big mistakes, which doesn't help us, and we conceded two other goals we definitely could avoid. But let's give a bit of credit to Wolves.\"\nResurgent Wolves\nWhile Wolves have beaten the likes of Manchester City and Chelsea at Molineux, they had struggled to replicate those sorts of performances on the road.\nBut if they continue in this vein, it would not be unreasonable for O'Neil and his team to target a European spot.\nThey will, though, have to manage the loss of Hwang for the Asia Cup, with his growing stature and assuredness in front of goal a huge asset.\n\"He's a dream. I just write his name down and let him get on with it,\" O'Neil told Amazon Prime.\n\"When it falls to him at the goal, I get really relaxed because he's got fantastic quality. He shows it all the time in training.\"\nO'Neil will at least be heartened that Hwang's absence will be offset by the return of Portuguese playmaker Pedro Neto, who was on the Wolves bench after a two-month absence with a hamstring injury.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

We have to get back on the bike pretty quickly. You can't just turn a game over like that.\"\nHatters show incredible spirit\nLuton's players celebrated in front of their own fans after a significant win that strengthens their hopes of climbing out of trouble.\nThe Hatters remain in the bottom three but are just one point from safety, with out-of-sorts Chelsea the visitors to Kenilworth Road on Saturday (12:30 GMT) as they hunt a third successive league win.\nAfter the trauma of captain Tom Lockyer having cardiac arrest on the pitch at Bournemouth, Luton have shown incredible spirit to secure six points from their past two games which could be crucial to securing their Premier League future.\n\"I don't know,\" said boss Rob Edwards when asked if what happened to Lockyer had brought his squad even closer together.\n\"I get we have won two games in a row but we have been playing well for some time now.\n\"That said we do want to embody what Tom is.

But we're positive and we need to show that we can compete.\"\n'Tough pill to swallow' as Palace winless in eight\nPalace have not won since 4 November and Roy Hodgson's side are now just three points above third-bottom Luton Town, who have played one game fewer.\nThey may have been second-best for much of the match, but the Eagles still had several opportunities after the restart and had more shots overall than their hosts.\nEze fired a free-kick just wide and Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta both forced Chelsea keeper Djordje Petrovic into fine stops at his near post.\n\"I think the team's performance meant it was a tough pill to swallow,\" Hodgson told BBC Match of the Day. \"We're near the bottom of table but the fact is we have had a difficult run of games.\"\nSince their last success there have been reasons to be cheerful for Palace, including a battling point at Manchester City in December.\nBut there have also been gut-wrenching, last-gasp defeats against Liverpool and now Chelsea.\nPalace need to get back to winning ways and quickly. They are eight league matches without a victory (D3 L5), their longest run without a win under Hodgson since an eight-game streak in June and July, 2020.\n\"As far as I am concerned there are 38 games in a season and we've played half of them,\" added the Palace boss.\n\"Are we good enough?

We didn't have loads of control but we had big opportunities to go one-on-one and we caused them problems.\"\nBees' worries build\nIn his pre-match comments, Brentford boss Thomas Frank said he expected to see his side \"come out flying\" after a 10-day gap since their last game, the unfortunate home loss to Aston Villa.\nBut if anything, their inaction, due to Manchester City's involvement in the Club World Cup, had the opposite effect.\nThey allowed a clinical Wolves side, who had lost their four previous matches on their travels and their last 14 in London, to take complete control in the opening half an hour.\nBoth of Hwang's goals could be classed as belated Christmas gifts from the Brentford backline, while Bellegarde's also came courtesy of a dreadful Collins pass straight to Matheus Cunha on the edge of his own penalty area.\nWorryingly for Frank, his team's sixth defeat in seven games was also the first time they have shipped four at home in the Premier League.\nAnd on this evidence, he will need some players to return soon, with the losses of the suspended Ivan Toney and injured Bryan Mbeumo in particular sorely felt in the final third.\n\"When it rains it pours,\" said Frank. \"This moment in time it doesn't go our way.\n\"We had so many promising attacks and big chances that could have given us a little bit. But it didn't. We performed well, we just made too many big mistakes that killed the game.\"\nHe said they did not deserve the scoreline, but added: \"We made two big mistakes, which doesn't help us, and we conceded two other goals we definitely could avoid. But let's give a bit of credit to Wolves.\"\nResurgent Wolves\nWhile Wolves have beaten the likes of Manchester City and Chelsea at Molineux, they had struggled to replicate those sorts of performances on the road.\nBut if they continue in this vein, it would not be unreasonable for O'Neil and his team to target a European spot.\nThey will, though, have to manage the loss of Hwang for the Asia Cup, with his growing stature and assuredness in front of goal a huge asset.\n\"He's a dream. I just write his name down and let him get on with it,\" O'Neil told Amazon Prime.\n\"When it falls to him at the goal, I get really relaxed because he's got fantastic quality. He shows it all the time in training.\"\nO'Neil will at least be heartened that Hwang's absence will be offset by the return of Portuguese playmaker Pedro Neto, who was on the Wolves bench after a two-month absence with a hamstring injury.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Brighton's tally has only been bettered twice in Premier League history by Liverpool in 1998 (25) and 1994 (22).\nPedro was a constant handful, looking to exploit Spurs' high defensive line, and took both of his penalties clinically.\nEstupinan's excellent strike put the gloss on the win, with the Ecuador left-back featuring for the first time since 30 September.\nThere will be disappointment they were unable to keep a clean sheet - they have now conceded in 23 straight league games - and that they had to weather a late storm, with De Zerbi throwing a water bottle in frustration during stoppage time.\nAll in all, this was a display that served as a reminder of what Brighton can do as we reach the halfway mark of the season.\n\"I am really lucky to be this coach of this team with these players. I am very pleased with the passion they have, they have everything,\" added De Zerbi.\n\"You can't forget we are Brighton. Sometimes they forget we are Brighton. We are not Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle or Arsenal, we are still Brighton.\"\nReinforcements needed for threadbare Spurs\nFor much of the game, this felt like one game too many for Spurs' threadbare squad.\nBoss Ange Postecoglou was forced into two changes, with centre-back Christian Romero ruled out for more than a month with a hamstring injury and midfielder Oliver Skipp out with a knock.\nFor the majority of the match, Spurs' defence was run ragged and the midfield was simply outclassed and outfought by Brighton.\nPostecoglou has made no secret of his desire to add defensive reinforcements in the January transfer window and this will only intensify that search, with full-back Emerson Royal struggling centrally and Eric Dier, who was an unused substitute, clearly not fancied.\nSpurs did look a threat going forward throughout, but Richarlison was ill-disciplined as he led the line, with the run for his second disallowed goal particularly poorly judged.\nPostecoglou will be happy with the late spirit his side showed as Veliz scored his first goal for the club and Davies powered home a back-post header.\nThey then laid siege to Brighton's goal, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hitting the post and Pedro Porro's follow-up being blocked behind, but ultimately they left themselves too much to do.\n\"It is fair to say we looked like a tired team today,\" Postecoglou told Match of the Day.\n\"We've asked a lot of these players for a very long time and we lacked a little bit of energy today. They are a good team and we struggled to cope with them.\n\"We hung in there and that's all you can ask for, they left everything out there.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

Send us your views here\nReds show resilience for top spot\nLiverpool are top of the pile approaching the end of the year, but what should have been a canter to victory turned out to be a triumph that had to be grinded out.\nKlopp's men had a total of 19 shots and worked Trafford into eight saves, hitting the woodwork once and having two goals disallowed.\nBut they have shown a formidable resilience so far this term and Nunez's early strike with his eighth goal of the season and Jota's well-taken finish late on secured maximum points.\nThe Reds should have been out of sight in the first half but Trafford made a string of saves, including to keep out low efforts from Wataru Endo and Salah.\nThe Egypt international came inches away from adding to his 12 league goals this term but smashed the top of the bar when through on goal, and was also judged to be offside after referee Paul Tierney consulted the pitchside monitor after Elliott's first-time finish.\nLiverpool may also feel aggrieved that VAR did not allow Gakpo's thunderous effort to stand in the first half, but it did not matter in a contest they dominated from start to finish.\nThey have won their last seven games on 26 December and also continued their excellent form on the road, now scoring in their last 14 successive away games.\nTrafford keeps it to single digits\nBurnley won the Championship last season with 101 points but have had little joy in the Premier League and are staring at an immediate return to the second tier.\nAbove them, Luton and Nottingham Forest both won earlier on Tuesday, making Burnley's daunting task against Liverpool even more important - but in truth they did not lay a glove on their opponents.\nThis was their ninth loss in 10 league games at Turf Moor this season, and although they battled for much of the encounter they were unable to get a shot on target.\nJohann Berg Gudmundsson might have levelled the scores when he sent his free header over the bar in the second half and Sander Berge also dragged a shot wide to leave their side with only three wins at the halfway stage of the season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",

We are not Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle or Arsenal, we are still Brighton.\"\nReinforcements needed for threadbare Spurs\nFor much of the game, this felt like one game too many for Spurs' threadbare squad.\nBoss Ange Postecoglou was forced into two changes, with centre-back Christian Romero ruled out for more than a month with a hamstring injury and midfielder Oliver Skipp out with a knock.\nFor the majority of the match, Spurs' defence was run ragged and the midfield was simply outclassed and outfought by Brighton.\nPostecoglou has made no secret of his desire to add defensive reinforcements in the January transfer window and this will only intensify that search, with full-back Emerson Royal struggling centrally and Eric Dier, who was an unused substitute, clearly not fancied.\nSpurs did look a threat going forward throughout, but Richarlison was ill-disciplined as he led the line, with the run for his second disallowed goal particularly poorly judged.\nPostecoglou will be happy with the late spirit his side showed as Veliz scored his first goal for the club and Davies powered home a back-post header.\nThey then laid siege to Brighton's goal, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hitting the post and Pedro Porro's follow-up being blocked behind, but ultimately they left themselves too much to do.\n\"It is fair to say we looked like a tired team today,\" Postecoglou told Match of the Day.\n\"We've asked a lot of these players for a very long time and we lacked a little bit of energy today. They are a good team and we struggled to cope with them.\n\"We hung in there and that's all you can ask for, they left everything out there.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

Gabriel Martinelli's curling shot from the left was palmed out by former Gunners keeper Bernd Leno, and Saka stuck out his right leg to loop the ball into the net from six yards.\nBut Fulham reacted well and equalised in the 29th minute when Willian, another ex-Arsenal player in the home ranks, fed captain Tom Cairney down the left and his dangerous low cross was swept in by Jimenez.\nMarco Silva's men claimed a deserved winner from a corner when Decordova-Reid stabbed a finish past David Raya following pinball in the box - condemning Arsenal to consecutive losses following the 2-0 home defeat by West Ham on Thursday.\nReaction from Sunday's Premier League games\nWhat did you make of Fulham's display? Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Arsenal's performance? Have your say here\nBlunt Arsenal winless in three games\nThis result and performance was the closing act of a dismal Christmas period for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal, in which they have failed to win in three successive Premier League matches for the first time this season.\nThey have picked up just one point over the past eight days, and would find themselves five behind leaders Liverpool should the Reds beat Newcastle.\nGiven Arsenal were top at Christmas after taking a point at Anfield on 23 December, it represents a worrying turnaround which Arteta will need to address quickly.\nHe did make changes here from the loss against West Ham, including starting Eddie Nketiah up front in place of the benched Gabriel Jesus.\nBut while Nketiah again showed plenty of endeavour, he struggled to make a meaningful impact in attack as Arsenal continue to lack a cutting edge, which will only heighten talk of Arteta needing to sign another striker in January.\nSaka's goal made him the club's top scorer in the league with six.\nJimenez return fires up Fulham\nStarting this game just six points above the drop zone, Fulham were very grateful to welcome back Jimenez, and also Willian from a hamstring injury.\nBrazilian Willian - whose three-year contract at Arsenal was ended in 2021 after a difficult year - had missed the previous three league games, all of which Fulham lost without scoring. Jimenez was sent off for a high tackle in the 3-0 defeat at Newcastle. Both clearly add extra class to Fulham's attack.\nThe victory ensured the club did not suffer four consecutive league defeats without scoring for the first time since 1971, and showed where their strengths lie as they bid to climb the table.\nFulham are still seven points worse off than they were after 20 games last season - but with Jimenez back and firing, Silva's worries will be somewhat alleviated.\nThey could have won by a more comprehensive margin had Raya not made a flying save to deny Cairney in the second half, while Andreas Pereira struck the bar with a late free-kick."

Big result. That performance was absolutely outstanding.\n\"There's been a lot of Premier League seasons but I can't think of too many that have been as thrilling at the halfway stage as we have now, and so many teams in the title race.\"\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville said: \"If you told Klopp at the start of the season that they would be a few points clear at the top, they wouldn't have believed, but now they can start to believe.\n\"They are potential champions just because of where they are. Their manager is a sensational manager who knows how to do it and they've got three or four players that are world-class.\n\"If they get into that run-in, they'll probably be the one team that Manchester City don't want against them because they know they've actually beat them before.\"\nLiverpool beat Newcastle to go clear at the top\n'What a firework'\nLiverpool attempted a joint league-high 34 shots against Newcastle and had an xG of 7.27 - the highest in a Premier League game since records began in 2010-11.\nThey were relentless throughout, are unbeaten in 22 games at Anfield and have lost only one of their past 52 home league games.\n\"It was a sensational game from my team,\" Klopp told BBC Sport. \"Super game. I loved so many aspects of the game bar the goals we conceded.\"\nHe told Sky Sports: \"There was only one winner tonight. Football is like that.\n\"Around the two goals we conceded, the game was absolutely exceptional. What a firework.\n\"We played through Newcastle, around Newcastle, behind Newcastle. We had chances from everywhere.\"\nHow big a loss will 'goalscoring machine' Salah be?\nLiverpool now face a run of fixtures without Mohamed Salah, who will go to the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt.\nThe final of that competition is on 11 February, so if Egypt go all the way then Salah could miss eight games for Liverpool if they progress in the FA Cup.\nThat run includes Arsenal in the FA Cup third round on Sunday, and in the Premier League on 4 February.\nThere is also the two-legged Carabao Cup semi-final against Fulham and league games against Bournemouth, Chelsea and Burnley.\nSalah is Liverpool's top scorer with 18 in all competitions this season. He has also set up eight goals for team-mates.\nAgainst Newcastle, despite missing a first-half penalty, he scored twice and passed 150 top-flight goals for Liverpool, with Klopp describing him as a \"goalscoring machine\".\nThere is no doubt Salah will be a huge miss for Klopp's side, but they have fared well without him in the past.\nThey are unbeaten in all 10 Premier League games in which Salah has not appeared, since he joined in 2017-18.\n\"I want to win [the Africa Cup of Nations],\" Salah told Sky Sports. \"It means a lot to play for the national team. It's something I cannot take for granted. I would love to win it.\"\nSalah says Liverpool are well equipped to deal without him, adding: \"We have some really good players. We have players who can play in my position.\n\"We believe a lot. We need to work hard and express ourselves on the field. If we manage to do that then we can keep winning.\"\nOur coverage of Liverpool is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Liverpool - go straight to all the best content",

Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Sheffield United's performance? Have your say here\nCity chasing more glory in 2024\nCity had dropped points through conceding late equalisers in each of their past three home league games, but there was never any danger of a repeat of that here.\nAs well as the victory, which means they have secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since the start of November, they also had a first clean sheet in eight games to celebrate.\nIt had already been a productive festive period for Pep Guardiola's side, who saw all the teams above them drop points, and they appear to have put any talk of a pre-Christmas crisis well behind them.\n\"We are not top, but I could not expect that with the results we had,\" Guardiola said afterwards.\n\"Apart from two or three games, we played really well without the results that maybe we deserved - but in football what you deserve doesn't count, it is a business and you have to win games - and here we did it.\n\"I am really pleased for the guys, after two days rest [after beating Everton on Wednesday].\n\"It was an intense month for all the Premier League teams I would say but the travel to Saudi Arabia was an incredibly positive impact on all of us, for the trophy first and to be together, after the disappointment of drawing with Crystal Palace after an incredibly good performance.\"\nCity can look back with pride at their achievements in 2023, but they also have lots to look forward to in 2024.\nDe Bruyne's seemingly imminent return to action is a major boost and they will hope to welcome Erling Haaland and Jeremy Doku back from injury in January, as they push on in search of more silverware - starting in the FA Cup, where they host Huddersfield next weekend.\n\"In terms of titles and prizes, the past year was really good,\" Guardiola added. \"To see the five trophies on the pitch was really nice.\n\"We are so satisfied and proud but at the same time, now they are in the trophy cabinet and it is Huddersfield next.\"\nBlades show spirit but lack quality\nWhile Sheffield United showed plenty of spirit here, they were clearly short of sufficient quality to seriously trouble their hosts.\nThe Blades end the year bottom of the table and they must make history if they are to stay up from here, as no Premier League team has managed that after earning so few points after 20 games.\nIt is difficult to assess exactly where Wilder needs reinforcements going on this display, given the gulf between these two sides.\nBut the fact that, so far, they have so far scored the fewest goals in the top flight, as well as conceding the most, suggests improvements are needed all over the pitch when the January transfer window opens, if they are to have any hope of survival.\n\"There's no downside from this game, with the experience it's given some of our younger players,\" Wilder said afterwards.\n\"For me it wasn't just regarding this game, because we always knew it would be incredibly tough to go and get a result at City. It is the overall six games [since he took charge] that I have reflected on when I spoke to the players afterwards - what they have given me, and what they have shown.\n\"I said after the first game against Liverpool, don't kid me, is this a one off? And it wasn't, in terms of their attitude.\n\"And now what we have is hopefully some additions coming into the group [in January] and precious time to work on the training ground, where we can work on all aspects of our play.\n\"But I think if you asked any Sheffield United supporter what they've taken from the past six games, it's that the team has got fight in them, and it's the same from my point of view.\""

He has been brilliant and it's really tough what he's going through. He deserved it.\"\nThe home side added a second on 53 minutes when Hwang Hee-chan picked out an easy finish for Matheus Cunha at the far post and the Brazilian then turned provider when Craig Dawson poked home a low cross.\nStruggling Everton failed to work goalkeeper Jose Sa into a save and their three straight defeats leave them only one point above the relegation zone.\nFollow live coverage of Saturday's Premier League games\nHow did you rate Wolves' performance?

Send us your views here\nO'Neil adds bite to Wolves\nA summer of cost-cutting measures saw Wolves lose captain Ruben Neves, as well as other key players including Raul Jimenez, Matheus Nunez and Nathan Collins, so a season of struggling may have been expected for the club.\nBut ex-Bournemouth boss O'Neil has performed a sterling job so far, leading the side to three consecutive Premier League wins for the first time since January 2022.\nO'Neil said: \"An incredible week really. Nine points in six days with players missing - an incredible effort from everyone. The work that goes in behind the scenes has helped the team.\n\"It was probably my favourite performance of the season. The togetherness is huge.\"\nWolves played Everton off the park for much of the contest and are making Molineux a fortress, extending their unbeaten run at home to eight matches and netting in their last 17 matches there.\nCunha's shot from outside the box which flew wide gave the Toffees' defenders an early warning sign before defender Kilman put his side in front ahead of the break.\nHaving chanted Lemina's name during the game and applauding his father's memory in the fifth minute, the celebrations after the opening goal were poignant, with Kilman leading the tribute by holding aloft the midfielder's number five shirt.\nWolves blew Everton away in the second period with Cunha and Dawson converting - but it could have been so much worse for the forlorn-looking Sean Dyche and his side.\nIn-form Hwang smacked the post and then drew a stunning save from Pickford and Joao Gomes' drive was straight at the England number one, while Hwang and Pedro Neto both had goals ruled out for offside.\nWolves face Brentford in the FA Cup third round on Friday (19:15 GMT) and enjoy a break from Premier League action until Monday, 22 January, when they travel to Brighton (19:45).\nMiserable loss for teetering Everton\nEverton's 10-point deduction did not look to be much of a problem when they claimed four wins in a row, but consecutive defeats since leaves them teetering above the bottom three.\nThey were far from their best in the Midlands and gave Sa a comfortable game, unable to manage a shot on target - and the injury problems are mounting up too.\nWith key man Abdoulaye Doucoure and Idrissa Gueye already out, fellow midfielder Amadou Onana limped through most of the game and defender Branthwaite also seemed to be nursing an injury.\nGiving a start to Michael Keane and deploying three centre-halves backfired for Dyche as they were outfought and outplayed in key areas.\nCaptain Seamus Coleman came on in the second half for a club record-equalling 354th Premier League appearance, but that will be of little joy to supporters as they end a tumultuous year with a miserable loss.\nDyche said: \"We have just come off the back of a run of [lots of] games with injuries. We've come a long way since the second game of the season but we lacked that bit of fizz and energy to take the game on.\n\"We fell short with the physicality of the game. They played really well and exposed moments when we looked jaded.\"\nEverton travel to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup third round on Thursday, 4 January (20:00 GMT) and are in Premier League action on Sunday, 14 January (14:00), hosting Aston Villa.",

Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Burnley's performance? Have your say here\nVilla set club record with late win\nVilla opened the scoring on 29 minutes when Bailey picked up Ollie Watkins' pass across the box, cut in from the right and fired into the roof of the net via a deflection.\nBurnley equalised almost immediately when a high free-kick from the left was headed back across goal by Dara O'Shea, allowing Amdouni to acrobatically volley in from close range.\nVilla went back in front with Watkins - narrowly judged onside by the video assistant referee - again the provider as the England striker pulled the ball back for Diaby to finish.\nBurnley's hopes of another comeback were dented in the second half when midfielder Berge received a second booking for pulling Luiz's shirt.\nBut after Villa missed several chances, Foster streaked clear of their defence and beat Emiliano Martinez at the near post.\nIt was Foster's first goal since October, following a two-month break to look after his mental health, and it looked to have earned Burnley a point from a losing position for the first time in the Premier League this season.\nBut Ramsey - a Villa academy product who joined Burnley in the summer, and whose brother Jacob started for the hosts - clipped Duran in the area to allow Luiz the opportunity to win the game from the spot.\nThe midfielder's penalty twice struck the bar - hitting the woodwork then bouncing up from the grass and off it again before crossing the line - but it was enough to earn Villa a 32nd victory in league and cup matches this calendar year, surpassing the previous club record set in 1977.\nMissed chances nearly costly for hosts\nHaving passed up the opportunity to top the Premier League at Christmas for the first time in 25 years, Villa's surprise Premier League challenge was in danger of unwrapping further over the festive period as they laboured against Burnley.\nTheir 3-2 defeat to Manchester United on Boxing Day after being two goals ahead followed a draw against Sheffield United, and Villa looked poised to drop more points at home to a side in the relegation zone.\nAs against Sheffield United, Villa often looked weighed down by the pressure that comes from finding themselves in a lofty position that is perhaps unexpected.\nDiaby, despite his goal, was particularly guilty of missing several good chances while Burnley keeper James Trafford once again made a string of fine saves.\nThey had some luck too, with Diego Carlos cleared by VAR despite appearing to handle the ball under pressure from Clarets striker Foster.\nBut as they did with a 97th-minute equaliser against Sheffield United, Unai Emery's side fought to the end to earn a result that was better than their performance.\nWatkins was central to their efforts, despite the England striker failing to match Andy Gray's record of most Villa goals in a calendar year - he netted 21 times in 2023, two fewer than the Scotland forward in 1976.\nWhile he was unable to find the net, the former Brentford striker's endless running and selfless play was invaluable - and he provided the assists for Villa's opening two goals."

The spaces were there and it's a credit to the players because we have only been here for 10 days and they are the ones really working very hard.\"\nIt was another desperate night for Ten Hag, and it was in front of Sir Dave Brailsford, who will have a significant say in United's on-field operations following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 25% purchase of the club.\nIt was United's 14th defeat of a dreadful campaign, their highest number of losses before the end of a year since 1930-31.\nUnited have been beaten four times in December alone and could end this round of matches in ninth spot, just three points in front of Chelsea.\n\u2018Inconsistent\u2019 & \u2018awful\u2019 Man Utd are \u2018back to worst\u2019\nReaction to Nottingham Forest v Manchester United\nMan Utd fans, send your thoughts\nAnother bad night for Antony\nTen Hag told Brailsford he did not want to speak to him yet because of the packed Christmas programme but has said he feels Ineos are looking forward to working with him.\nThose talks are bound to happen in January, when United only have a single Premier League game, although whether Ten Hag will want to disrupt preparations before a potentially perilous FA Cup third-round tie at League One Wigan on 8 January is open to debate.\nIt is clear one of the issues Brailsford and fellow Ineos representative Jean Claude-Blanc need to sort out as a matter of priority is recruitment - and there is no greater evidence of where United have gone wrong in that department than Brazil winger Antony.\nIt is 16 months since Ten Hag pushed to sign Antony, United eventually paying \u00a381m for the winger, making him their second most expensive signing after Paul Pogba.\nSat together in the directors' box, neither Brailsford nor Sir Alex Ferguson could possibly have been thinking his latest performance made the fee look value for money.\nThe winger's supporters say he does not shirk work and can be trusted to track back.\nThat may well be true, but it ignores the point there is little end product from him.\nTowards the end of the first half, Rashford presented him with a shooting opportunity inside the penalty area but before he could decide how to manipulate the position into a chance, Forest defenders surrounded him and the chance disappeared.\nA few moments later, he shaped as if he was going to take his opponent on at the touchline but, stuck between going down the line or cutting inside as he prefers, he did nothing and the ball ended up going out for a throw.\nWhen he was replaced by Amad Diallo after 54 minutes it meant Antony had failed to score or set up a goal in 21 consecutive appearances.\nAmad cost \u00a319m and did not do much to justify that smaller fee either - but the Ivory Coast youngster has only just returned from a serious knee injury, so judgement on him should be reserved.\nForest fans, tell us what you think of the victory against Man Utd\nAgony to ecstasy for keeper Turner\nThe relief on the face of Forest keeper Turner at the final whistle was clear for all to see.\nThe United States international had a shaky start to the game, with a couple of wayward passes putting the hosts in trouble as he attempted to follow Nuno's demand to play out from the back.\nHis propensity to misplace passes ultimately proved costly as Rashford celebrated an equaliser where the blame lay squarely at his door.\nAn attempt to play out of his area was intercepted by the alert Alejandro Garnacho, who found Rashford and he applied a superb first-time finish.\nAnguish soon turned to relief for the former Arsenal man, though. His save from Eriksen allowed him to start a counter that ended with Gibbs-White driving home his second goal of the season.\n\"At half-time the manager said we needed to be more aggressive with and without the ball,\" Gibbs-White told BBC Sport.\n\"I am delighted to help the boys get the three points. I saw the space was there, stayed composed, breathed, and picked my spot. Thankfully it went in. I believe this club is really creating history.\n\"The only way now is forward, especially with the manager coming and the players believing and trusting in him.\"\nAs Gibbs-White raced to celebrate with the Trent End faithful, at the other end of the field Turner was repeatedly punching the air.\nHe still had one more bit of work to do, repelling a deflected Bruno Fernandes effort as United pushed forward in desperation - and the ruffle of hair from Moussa Niakhate underlined he had earned a memorable reprieve.\n\"We had Morgan Gibbs-White [at Wolves] when he was 16 but now he is a different man and the credit must go to Steve Cooper, because I have found a different player,\" added Nuno.\n\"He is mature. What we want from him is to be this guy we can rely on and to give him the ball because he is so talented.\"",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here\nInjury-hit Spurs find way to win\nAfter a strong start to the season under Postecoglou, Tottenham had lost five of their past nine games and continue to battle with injuries.\nThe surprise return of Bentancur to the starting XI was a welcome sight for Spurs fans after he recovered from an ankle injury earlier than anticipated.\nThe home side got off to the perfect start with Sarr's slotted finish but had to hang in there as Bournemouth were on top for large periods.\nSpurs created little in the second half but Son's goal knocked the wind out of the visitors and Richarlison wrapped up the points.\n\"Every week is a battle and we had to battle today,\" said Postecoglou. \"We've not been able to rotate but we're still putting in performances and effort like we are today.\n\"We had to show a bit of everything - resilience, character and discipline.\n\"We're three points off the top, so if that is the difference between having a great season and where we are I'll take it.\"\nBut there was more injury misery for Postecoglou as Sarr went down in the first half and left the field visibly upset before Alejo Veliz hobbled off in tears late on, forcing Spurs to see out the final few minutes with 10 men, having made all their substitutions.\nWhile they showed quality to withstand Bournemouth's pressure, Spurs' injury situation is a concern, but Postecoglou stood by his previous statement that fans should not expect \"magic\" in the January transfer window.\n\"Each window gives an opportunity to strengthen and grow. It's nothing to do with the injury situation; it's to do with building the side,\" he said.\nSpurs also paid tribute to goalkeeper Hugo Lloris at half-time after he joined Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC on a free transfer, having made 447 appearances in 11 years for Tottenham.\nWhat business must Spurs do in the January transfer window? Have your say here\nBournemouth rue missed chances\nHaving earned only three points from their first nine league games this season, Bournemouth arrived at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on a seven-match unbeaten run, six of them wins.\nDespite going behind early on, the Cherries posed a threat throughout and will perhaps wonder how they did not manage to take something from the game.\nRicharlison got a crucial touch on Marcus Tavernier's free-kick to ensure it whistled wide before Solanke's effort almost found the back of the net when Ben Davies diverted it on to the top of the crossbar.\nSolanke had nine chances, the most he has had in any top-flight match this season, forcing Guglielmo Vicario into a good reaction save with a header and going close from Tavernier's low cross.\nThe scoreline perhaps flattered Spurs somewhat but, for all their efforts, Bournemouth struggled to get many chances on target and will be disappointed to have let the match get away from them.\n\"We had a lot of opportunities and we've won games playing worse than today, but they were better, especially finishing,\" said Iraola.\nIt has, however, been a stellar run for Iraola's side and they will enter 2024 confident of their Premier League status.\n\"We started the season bad but have been in a very good run,\" said Iraola. \"We have 25 points - a good amount, but we still need more. We have to keep improving and the performance today was really good.\"\nWhat does Cherries' ideal January transfer window look like? Who do they need to bring in? Have your say here"

Gabriel Martinelli's curling shot from the left was palmed out by former Gunners keeper Bernd Leno, and Saka stuck out his right leg to loop the ball into the net from six yards.\nBut Fulham reacted well and equalised in the 29th minute when Willian, another ex-Arsenal player in the home ranks, fed captain Tom Cairney down the left and his dangerous low cross was swept in by Jimenez.\nMarco Silva's men claimed a deserved winner from a corner when Decordova-Reid stabbed a finish past David Raya following pinball in the box - condemning Arsenal to consecutive losses following the 2-0 home defeat by West Ham on Thursday.\nReaction from Sunday's Premier League games\nWhat did you make of Fulham's display? Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Arsenal's performance? Have your say here\nBlunt Arsenal winless in three games\nThis result and performance was the closing act of a dismal Christmas period for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal, in which they have failed to win in three successive Premier League matches for the first time this season.\nThey have picked up just one point over the past eight days, and would find themselves five behind leaders Liverpool should the Reds beat Newcastle.\nGiven Arsenal were top at Christmas after taking a point at Anfield on 23 December, it represents a worrying turnaround which Arteta will need to address quickly.\nHe did make changes here from the loss against West Ham, including starting Eddie Nketiah up front in place of the benched Gabriel Jesus.\nBut while Nketiah again showed plenty of endeavour, he struggled to make a meaningful impact in attack as Arsenal continue to lack a cutting edge, which will only heighten talk of Arteta needing to sign another striker in January.\nSaka's goal made him the club's top scorer in the league with six.\nJimenez return fires up Fulham\nStarting this game just six points above the drop zone, Fulham were very grateful to welcome back Jimenez, and also Willian from a hamstring injury.\nBrazilian Willian - whose three-year contract at Arsenal was ended in 2021 after a difficult year - had missed the previous three league games, all of which Fulham lost without scoring. Jimenez was sent off for a high tackle in the 3-0 defeat at Newcastle. Both clearly add extra class to Fulham's attack.\nThe victory ensured the club did not suffer four consecutive league defeats without scoring for the first time since 1971, and showed where their strengths lie as they bid to climb the table.\nFulham are still seven points worse off than they were after 20 games last season - but with Jimenez back and firing, Silva's worries will be somewhat alleviated.\nThey could have won by a more comprehensive margin had Raya not made a flying save to deny Cairney in the second half, while Andreas Pereira struck the bar with a late free-kick.",

The spaces were there and it's a credit to the players because we have only been here for 10 days and they are the ones really working very hard.\"\nIt was another desperate night for Ten Hag, and it was in front of Sir Dave Brailsford, who will have a significant say in United's on-field operations following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 25% purchase of the club.\nIt was United's 14th defeat of a dreadful campaign, their highest number of losses before the end of a year since 1930-31.\nUnited have been beaten four times in December alone and could end this round of matches in ninth spot, just three points in front of Chelsea.\n\u2018Inconsistent\u2019 & \u2018awful\u2019 Man Utd are \u2018back to worst\u2019\nReaction to Nottingham Forest v Manchester United\nMan Utd fans, send your thoughts\nAnother bad night for Antony\nTen Hag told Brailsford he did not want to speak to him yet because of the packed Christmas programme but has said he feels Ineos are looking forward to working with him.\nThose talks are bound to happen in January, when United only have a single Premier League game, although whether Ten Hag will want to disrupt preparations before a potentially perilous FA Cup third-round tie at League One Wigan on 8 January is open to debate.\nIt is clear one of the issues Brailsford and fellow Ineos representative Jean Claude-Blanc need to sort out as a matter of priority is recruitment - and there is no greater evidence of where United have gone wrong in that department than Brazil winger Antony.\nIt is 16 months since Ten Hag pushed to sign Antony, United eventually paying \u00a381m for the winger, making him their second most expensive signing after Paul Pogba.\nSat together in the directors' box, neither Brailsford nor Sir Alex Ferguson could possibly have been thinking his latest performance made the fee look value for money.\nThe winger's supporters say he does not shirk work and can be trusted to track back.\nThat may well be true, but it ignores the point there is little end product from him.\nTowards the end of the first half, Rashford presented him with a shooting opportunity inside the penalty area but before he could decide how to manipulate the position into a chance, Forest defenders surrounded him and the chance disappeared.\nA few moments later, he shaped as if he was going to take his opponent on at the touchline but, stuck between going down the line or cutting inside as he prefers, he did nothing and the ball ended up going out for a throw.\nWhen he was replaced by Amad Diallo after 54 minutes it meant Antony had failed to score or set up a goal in 21 consecutive appearances.\nAmad cost \u00a319m and did not do much to justify that smaller fee either - but the Ivory Coast youngster has only just returned from a serious knee injury, so judgement on him should be reserved.\nForest fans, tell us what you think of the victory against Man Utd\nAgony to ecstasy for keeper Turner\nThe relief on the face of Forest keeper Turner at the final whistle was clear for all to see.\nThe United States international had a shaky start to the game, with a couple of wayward passes putting the hosts in trouble as he attempted to follow Nuno's demand to play out from the back.\nHis propensity to misplace passes ultimately proved costly as Rashford celebrated an equaliser where the blame lay squarely at his door.\nAn attempt to play out of his area was intercepted by the alert Alejandro Garnacho, who found Rashford and he applied a superb first-time finish.\nAnguish soon turned to relief for the former Arsenal man, though. His save from Eriksen allowed him to start a counter that ended with Gibbs-White driving home his second goal of the season.\n\"At half-time the manager said we needed to be more aggressive with and without the ball,\" Gibbs-White told BBC Sport.\n\"I am delighted to help the boys get the three points. I saw the space was there, stayed composed, breathed, and picked my spot. Thankfully it went in. I believe this club is really creating history.\n\"The only way now is forward, especially with the manager coming and the players believing and trusting in him.\"\nAs Gibbs-White raced to celebrate with the Trent End faithful, at the other end of the field Turner was repeatedly punching the air.\nHe still had one more bit of work to do, repelling a deflected Bruno Fernandes effort as United pushed forward in desperation - and the ruffle of hair from Moussa Niakhate underlined he had earned a memorable reprieve.\n\"We had Morgan Gibbs-White [at Wolves] when he was 16 but now he is a different man and the credit must go to Steve Cooper, because I have found a different player,\" added Nuno.\n\"He is mature. What we want from him is to be this guy we can rely on and to give him the ball because he is so talented.\""

Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Sheffield United's performance? Have your say here\nCity chasing more glory in 2024\nCity had dropped points through conceding late equalisers in each of their past three home league games, but there was never any danger of a repeat of that here.\nAs well as the victory, which means they have secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since the start of November, they also had a first clean sheet in eight games to celebrate.\nIt had already been a productive festive period for Pep Guardiola's side, who saw all the teams above them drop points, and they appear to have put any talk of a pre-Christmas crisis well behind them.\n\"We are not top, but I could not expect that with the results we had,\" Guardiola said afterwards.\n\"Apart from two or three games, we played really well without the results that maybe we deserved - but in football what you deserve doesn't count, it is a business and you have to win games - and here we did it.\n\"I am really pleased for the guys, after two days rest [after beating Everton on Wednesday].\n\"It was an intense month for all the Premier League teams I would say but the travel to Saudi Arabia was an incredibly positive impact on all of us, for the trophy first and to be together, after the disappointment of drawing with Crystal Palace after an incredibly good performance.\"\nCity can look back with pride at their achievements in 2023, but they also have lots to look forward to in 2024.\nDe Bruyne's seemingly imminent return to action is a major boost and they will hope to welcome Erling Haaland and Jeremy Doku back from injury in January, as they push on in search of more silverware - starting in the FA Cup, where they host Huddersfield next weekend.\n\"In terms of titles and prizes, the past year was really good,\" Guardiola added. \"To see the five trophies on the pitch was really nice.\n\"We are so satisfied and proud but at the same time, now they are in the trophy cabinet and it is Huddersfield next.\"\nBlades show spirit but lack quality\nWhile Sheffield United showed plenty of spirit here, they were clearly short of sufficient quality to seriously trouble their hosts.\nThe Blades end the year bottom of the table and they must make history if they are to stay up from here, as no Premier League team has managed that after earning so few points after 20 games.\nIt is difficult to assess exactly where Wilder needs reinforcements going on this display, given the gulf between these two sides.\nBut the fact that, so far, they have so far scored the fewest goals in the top flight, as well as conceding the most, suggests improvements are needed all over the pitch when the January transfer window opens, if they are to have any hope of survival.\n\"There's no downside from this game, with the experience it's given some of our younger players,\" Wilder said afterwards.\n\"For me it wasn't just regarding this game, because we always knew it would be incredibly tough to go and get a result at City. It is the overall six games [since he took charge] that I have reflected on when I spoke to the players afterwards - what they have given me, and what they have shown.\n\"I said after the first game against Liverpool, don't kid me, is this a one off? And it wasn't, in terms of their attitude.\n\"And now what we have is hopefully some additions coming into the group [in January] and precious time to work on the training ground, where we can work on all aspects of our play.\n\"But I think if you asked any Sheffield United supporter what they've taken from the past six games, it's that the team has got fight in them, and it's the same from my point of view.\"",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here\nInjury-hit Spurs find way to win\nAfter a strong start to the season under Postecoglou, Tottenham had lost five of their past nine games and continue to battle with injuries.\nThe surprise return of Bentancur to the starting XI was a welcome sight for Spurs fans after he recovered from an ankle injury earlier than anticipated.\nThe home side got off to the perfect start with Sarr's slotted finish but had to hang in there as Bournemouth were on top for large periods.\nSpurs created little in the second half but Son's goal knocked the wind out of the visitors and Richarlison wrapped up the points.\n\"Every week is a battle and we had to battle today,\" said Postecoglou. \"We've not been able to rotate but we're still putting in performances and effort like we are today.\n\"We had to show a bit of everything - resilience, character and discipline.\n\"We're three points off the top, so if that is the difference between having a great season and where we are I'll take it.\"\nBut there was more injury misery for Postecoglou as Sarr went down in the first half and left the field visibly upset before Alejo Veliz hobbled off in tears late on, forcing Spurs to see out the final few minutes with 10 men, having made all their substitutions.\nWhile they showed quality to withstand Bournemouth's pressure, Spurs' injury situation is a concern, but Postecoglou stood by his previous statement that fans should not expect \"magic\" in the January transfer window.\n\"Each window gives an opportunity to strengthen and grow. It's nothing to do with the injury situation; it's to do with building the side,\" he said.\nSpurs also paid tribute to goalkeeper Hugo Lloris at half-time after he joined Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC on a free transfer, having made 447 appearances in 11 years for Tottenham.\nWhat business must Spurs do in the January transfer window? Have your say here\nBournemouth rue missed chances\nHaving earned only three points from their first nine league games this season, Bournemouth arrived at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on a seven-match unbeaten run, six of them wins.\nDespite going behind early on, the Cherries posed a threat throughout and will perhaps wonder how they did not manage to take something from the game.\nRicharlison got a crucial touch on Marcus Tavernier's free-kick to ensure it whistled wide before Solanke's effort almost found the back of the net when Ben Davies diverted it on to the top of the crossbar.\nSolanke had nine chances, the most he has had in any top-flight match this season, forcing Guglielmo Vicario into a good reaction save with a header and going close from Tavernier's low cross.\nThe scoreline perhaps flattered Spurs somewhat but, for all their efforts, Bournemouth struggled to get many chances on target and will be disappointed to have let the match get away from them.\n\"We had a lot of opportunities and we've won games playing worse than today, but they were better, especially finishing,\" said Iraola.\nIt has, however, been a stellar run for Iraola's side and they will enter 2024 confident of their Premier League status.\n\"We started the season bad but have been in a very good run,\" said Iraola. \"We have 25 points - a good amount, but we still need more.

Big result. That performance was absolutely outstanding.\n\"There's been a lot of Premier League seasons but I can't think of too many that have been as thrilling at the halfway stage as we have now, and so many teams in the title race.\"\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville said: \"If you told Klopp at the start of the season that they would be a few points clear at the top, they wouldn't have believed, but now they can start to believe.\n\"They are potential champions just because of where they are. Their manager is a sensational manager who knows how to do it and they've got three or four players that are world-class.\n\"If they get into that run-in, they'll probably be the one team that Manchester City don't want against them because they know they've actually beat them before.\"\nLiverpool beat Newcastle to go clear at the top\n'What a firework'\nLiverpool attempted a joint league-high 34 shots against Newcastle and had an xG of 7.27 - the highest in a Premier League game since records began in 2010-11.\nThey were relentless throughout, are unbeaten in 22 games at Anfield and have lost only one of their past 52 home league games.\n\"It was a sensational game from my team,\" Klopp told BBC Sport. \"Super game. I loved so many aspects of the game bar the goals we conceded.\"\nHe told Sky Sports: \"There was only one winner tonight. Football is like that.\n\"Around the two goals we conceded, the game was absolutely exceptional. What a firework.\n\"We played through Newcastle, around Newcastle, behind Newcastle. We had chances from everywhere.\"\nHow big a loss will 'goalscoring machine' Salah be?\nLiverpool now face a run of fixtures without Mohamed Salah, who will go to the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt.\nThe final of that competition is on 11 February, so if Egypt go all the way then Salah could miss eight games for Liverpool if they progress in the FA Cup.\nThat run includes Arsenal in the FA Cup third round on Sunday, and in the Premier League on 4 February.\nThere is also the two-legged Carabao Cup semi-final against Fulham and league games against Bournemouth, Chelsea and Burnley.\nSalah is Liverpool's top scorer with 18 in all competitions this season. He has also set up eight goals for team-mates.\nAgainst Newcastle, despite missing a first-half penalty, he scored twice and passed 150 top-flight goals for Liverpool, with Klopp describing him as a \"goalscoring machine\".\nThere is no doubt Salah will be a huge miss for Klopp's side, but they have fared well without him in the past.\nThey are unbeaten in all 10 Premier League games in which Salah has not appeared, since he joined in 2017-18.\n\"I want to win [the Africa Cup of Nations],\" Salah told Sky Sports. \"It means a lot to play for the national team. It's something I cannot take for granted. I would love to win it.\"\nSalah says Liverpool are well equipped to deal without him, adding: \"We have some really good players. We have players who can play in my position.\n\"We believe a lot. We need to work hard and express ourselves on the field. If we manage to do that then we can keep winning.\"\nOur coverage of Liverpool is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Liverpool - go straight to all the best content"

Nine points in six days with players missing - an incredible effort from everyone.

We've come a long way since the second game of the season but we lacked that bit of fizz and energy to take the game on.\n\"We fell short with the physicality of the game. They played really well and exposed moments when we looked jaded.\"\nEverton travel to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup third round on Thursday, 4 January (20:00 GMT) and are in Premier League action on Sunday, 14 January (14:00), hosting Aston Villa."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Nottingham Forest's display? Send us your views here\nUnusually, replays of Neal Maupay's winner were shown on the big screen on top of the stand opposite the dug-outs at the Gtech Community Stadium. Manager Nuno Espirito Santo evidently felt the ball had hit Maupay's hand, his assistant Rui Pedro Silva was even more sure and after the VAR decision had gone against Forest, the pair let fourth official Thomas Bramall know in no uncertain manner.\nSilva was booked by referee Darren England as Nuno pointed skywards towards the screen.\nThe chaotic manner of victory was in keeping with a switchback contest the visitors had initially led through Danilo's fabulous control and shot from the edge of the area after just three minutes.\nToney's goal ensured Brentford were level at the break, with Ben Mee putting the hosts ahead when he rose to head home Mathias Jensen's near-post corner 13 minutes into the second period.\nChris Wood flicked home Forest's equaliser but parity only lasted three minutes before Maupay controlled and spun inside the area before applying the excellent finish.\nIt ended a run of one win in eight points for Brentford, who climbed above their opponents into 14th spot.\nDefeat ended a four-match unbeaten run for Forest and left them four points above the relegation zone at the end of a week that began with them being charged for breaking the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules.\nThat ruling leaves them sweating on a points deduction when the hearing is due to be heard at the beginning of April.\nToney makes his mark\nBrentford set the game up to mark the return of a hero.\nToney was made skipper by manager Thomas Frank, who admitted his side 'needed' the player who had scored 20 Premier League goals last season before his contribution was brought to a premature end.\nFor some, this was an uncomfortable decision given the nature of his suspension. There was irony in both sides wearing shirts showing a main sponsor associated with the gambling industry. On the Forest bench was Harry Toffolo, who was given a suspended five-month ban by the FA in September, also for breaching gambling rules.\nThese bans underline the difficult relationship football has with gambling, with the Premier League's ban on the sector providing front of shirt sponsorship due to take effect from the 2026-27 season.\nAs for the football, Frank was right. Brentford need Toney.\nHis goal was executed brilliantly, not just round the wall but chipped off the ground with just enough force to get it over the man lying behind it.\nToney also provided the second-half cross Keane Lewis-Potter failed to covert from close range and also, through his strength and awareness, triggered an attack that ended with the former Hull man scuffing a shot wide.\nForest frustration\nNuno has vowed not to be distracted by Forest's off-field woes but their fans will look at the Premier League table after every game and wonder if they have enough of a cushion to survive should their legal team fail to prove their innocence.\nAt the final whistle, he strode across the pitch towards the officials as though he was going to unload a volley of abuse. Instead, he bit his tongue and merely acknowledged them, although the manner of his march down the tunnel after he had applauded the Forest fans suggested his mood was dark.\nDanilo did score the goal of the game and if the visitors had been able to build on the Brazilian's inspired effort, they would probably have won.\nCallum Hudson-Odoi in particular was a major threat, supplying the curling cross Wood clinically turned home for his ninth goal of the season.\nWith a succession of matches against either big or in-form - or both - clubs to come before a 16 March trip to Luton, there must be a fear for what Forest's season will look like before famed KC Nick de Marco tries to score a victory in what could be the club's most significant match-up of the entire season.",

Fernandez crossed for Sterling in the 50th minute, with the England forward flicking his header against a post, although any finish would have been ruled out for offside.\nVictory meant Mauricio Pochettino's side won a fourth home league match on the bounce for the first time since July 2020.\nAfter winning only 12 of their 43 league games in 2023 - the fewest they had recorded in a calendar year since 1995 - Chelsea's 2024 league campaign has got off to the perfect start.\nThey play Middlesbrough in the semi-final second leg on 23 January.\nFulham still stuttering on the road\nFulham's poor away run continued.

Send us your views here\nRelive Everton v Aston Villa and all of Sunday's Premier League action\nCalvert-Lewin struggles continue\nEverton's lack of a goalscoring spearhead has been a constant source of concern but it was hoped the return to fitness of England striker Calvert-Lewin after a couple of injury-plagued seasons would provide the answer.\nHe showed signs of promise on his return earlier this season but has been suffering a barren spell. This was his 13th game without a goal and he was replaced by Beto after 63 minutes.\nCalvert-Lewin last scored in the win at West Ham United in October and his lack of confidence was painfully illustrated when he missed the best chance Everton carved out just before half-time.\nHe raced clear with time and space, and with only Martinez to beat, but he never looked convincing and his finish was kept out by the Villa keeper.\n\"I keep reminding him the further away it gets, the closer it gets. One will go in,\" said Everton boss Sean Dyche.\n\"He did everything right, hit it hard and low and the keeper makes a good save. I hope he's not worried about it. He's working hard all the time, that's what we want.\"\nCalvert-Lewin is not short of endeavour but he is struggling badly. Everton will need him to pull out of the slump quickly as more goals will be a crucial commodity in their fight for Premier League survival. It may not be long before Dyche is tempted to give \u00a325m signing Beto an extended run.\nElsewhere, it was a landmark day for Everton's 35-year-old captain Seamus Coleman, who established a club record by making his 355th Premier League appearance.\nColeman has been a magnificent servant for Everton since he was signed for \u00a360,000 from Sligo Rovers in January 2009. The right-back's subsequent career has been an outstanding example of professionalism - and money well spent.\nMixed feelings for Villa\nAston Villa may feel a draw at Goodison Park against this well-drilled Everton side is not an unacceptable outcome but in reality they should have claimed all three points.\nThey were denied Moreno's first-half strike by VAR and while Everton had Calvert-Lewin's big chance late in the first half, it was Villa doing all the pressing after half-time.\nJohn McGinn was narrowly wide from the edge of the area, Everton defender Vitaliy Mykolenko made a crucial block from Matty Cash, while Duran's late glance went narrowly wide of the far post.\nIn the end, deadlock was the outcome and Everton will probably be happier with that conclusion than Villa.\n\"It is not enough for us, the point we achieved today,\" said Villa boss Emery.\n\"Now we have 43 points and are keeping more or less the the same position for the next couple of weeks (Villa do not play again in the Premier League until 30 January) but we have to be focused on each match, but also to improve what we can.\"\nIt was only the third time this season that Villa have failed to score in the Premier League, the other occasions being defeats at Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.\nEmery's proud record of never having a goalless draw as a Premier League manager is over. And this was just the type of undistinguished game that deserved to end it."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Aston Villa's display? Send us your views here\nRelive Everton v Aston Villa and all of Sunday's Premier League action\nCalvert-Lewin struggles continue\nEverton's lack of a goalscoring spearhead has been a constant source of concern but it was hoped the return to fitness of England striker Calvert-Lewin after a couple of injury-plagued seasons would provide the answer.\nHe showed signs of promise on his return earlier this season but has been suffering a barren spell. This was his 13th game without a goal and he was replaced by Beto after 63 minutes.\nCalvert-Lewin last scored in the win at West Ham United in October and his lack of confidence was painfully illustrated when he missed the best chance Everton carved out just before half-time.\nHe raced clear with time and space, and with only Martinez to beat, but he never looked convincing and his finish was kept out by the Villa keeper.\n\"I keep reminding him the further away it gets, the closer it gets. One will go in,\" said Everton boss Sean Dyche.\n\"He did everything right, hit it hard and low and the keeper makes a good save. I hope he's not worried about it. He's working hard all the time, that's what we want.\"\nCalvert-Lewin is not short of endeavour but he is struggling badly. Everton will need him to pull out of the slump quickly as more goals will be a crucial commodity in their fight for Premier League survival. It may not be long before Dyche is tempted to give \u00a325m signing Beto an extended run.\nElsewhere, it was a landmark day for Everton's 35-year-old captain Seamus Coleman, who established a club record by making his 355th Premier League appearance.\nColeman has been a magnificent servant for Everton since he was signed for \u00a360,000 from Sligo Rovers in January 2009. The right-back's subsequent career has been an outstanding example of professionalism - and money well spent.\nMixed feelings for Villa\nAston Villa may feel a draw at Goodison Park against this well-drilled Everton side is not an unacceptable outcome but in reality they should have claimed all three points.\nThey were denied Moreno's first-half strike by VAR and while Everton had Calvert-Lewin's big chance late in the first half, it was Villa doing all the pressing after half-time.\nJohn McGinn was narrowly wide from the edge of the area, Everton defender Vitaliy Mykolenko made a crucial block from Matty Cash, while Duran's late glance went narrowly wide of the far post.\nIn the end, deadlock was the outcome and Everton will probably be happier with that conclusion than Villa.\n\"It is not enough for us, the point we achieved today,\" said Villa boss Emery.\n\"Now we have 43 points and are keeping more or less the the same position for the next couple of weeks (Villa do not play again in the Premier League until 30 January) but we have to be focused on each match, but also to improve what we can.\"\nIt was only the third time this season that Villa have failed to score in the Premier League, the other occasions being defeats at Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.\nEmery's proud record of never having a goalless draw as a Premier League manager is over. And this was just the type of undistinguished game that deserved to end it.",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester United 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Rodrigo Bentancur equalises as visitors fight back twice\nTottenham came back from behind twice in a pulsating Premier League encounter to deny Manchester United a victory in front of new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\nRatcliffe, attending his first game since a proposed 25% purchase of his boyhood club was confirmed on Christmas Eve, said beforehand that he was \"very excited\" to be there.\nAnd he saw Rasmus Hojlund drive United into a third-minute lead.\nBut Ratcliffe's pre-match assertion that United \"normally do well against Spurs\" wasn't quite borne out here.\nBrazilian striker Richarlison levelled with his sixth goal in as many Premier League games for the visitors, who were without three players, including captain Son Heung-min - away with South Korea at the Asian Cup.\nMarcus Rashford put the hosts ahead before the break, but Rodrigo Bentancur wiped out the advantage a minute after the restart with a blistering shot, his first goal since April, during which time he has recovered from a cruciate knee ligament injury and an ankle problem.\nThe rest of the game would have been an education for Ratcliffe, who sat next to Sir Alex Ferguson in the directors' box. United had less than 40% possession, nine shots against Tottenham's 16 and only a third of the visitors' six on target.\nA draw was not enough to take Tottenham above rivals Arsenal and into the top four. But it did allow them to maintain an eight-point advantage over their hosts, who could drop to 10th before they are next in action against Wolves on 1 February.\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Spurs' display? Send us your views here\nRelive Manchester United v Tottenham and all of Sunday's Premier League action\nSir Jim Ratcliffe: What issues need addressing at Man Utd?\nHojlund and Rashford's rare double\nPrior to this game, Hojlund and Rashford had only scored four Premier League goals between them this season. Ratcliffe was privileged indeed, therefore, to see both get on the scoresheet in his first 45 minutes as a returning 'fan'. That the pair also had a significant involvement in the other's goal just added to the sense of occasion.\nIt was only in United's last home game, against Aston Villa on 26 December, that Hojlund broke his duck with a memorable late winner.\nHis latest effort smacked of someone who is having a surge of confidence. Hojlund wasted little time in blasting a shot high into the Tottenham goal after Destiny Udogie had stepped in to halt Rashford's charge across the penalty area.\nRashford has achieved so much that confidence should not be an issue. But he has been a shadow of the player who broke the 30-goal mark for the first time last season. There was an element of being unsure of himself when he delayed getting a shot away having found himself in the perfect position just before half-time. By then, though he had already found the net once.\nBruno Fernandes was a significant factor, spraying a superb pass out to the England forward. But it was Hojlund who then provided the perfect return pass, which Tottenham's defenders were too slow to react to as Rashford sent his shot into the bottom corner.\nMidway through the second half, manager Erik ten Hag had an extended chat with Rashford during a break in play. It seemed more tactical than an assessment of the forward's latest wasted opportunity as Pedro Porro matched him for speed during a rapid chase into the Tottenham area before the full-back outwitted his opponent as he tried to check onto his right foot.\nWhen Rashford was eventually replaced by Antony three minutes from time, he did not seem happy, chuntering to himself as he took his seat.\nBentancur shines\nTottenham fans' favourite Betancur had an eventful day as he works his way back from the ankle injury that followed a month after his recovery from cruciate surgery.\nThe Uruguayan had an early effort cleared off the line by Dalot and then earned himself a caution in ridiculous fashion as he kicked the ball away after a flag had gone up for an offside, ludicrously arguing he was giving the ball back to United when he had, in fact, sent it yards away from where it needed to be.\nHis first goal since the day he suffered his injury was an excellent effort. Debutant Timo Werner provided the pass - a collectors' item given he only managed one assist in 21 league appearances during his final season at Chelsea - and after that, Bentancur steadied himself before belting a drive past Africa Cup of Nations-bound Andre Onana at his near post.\nA draw was the least Tottenham deserved, as \u00a325m new arrival Radu Dragusin made his debut as a late substitute, although they will hope the injury that forced off Micky van de Ven near the end is nothing more than fatigue related given the Dutchman was returning after a two-month absence with a hamstring injury.\nAfter the game, Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou praised his players as he revealed that some of his squad had struggled with illness during the week.\nDejan Kulusevski was one of those who missed out because he had been unwell and Postecoglou said: \"He struggled all week, he was desperate to play, Skippy [Oliver Skipp], Destiny [Udogie], two or three others struggled this week.\n\"It doesn't matter - these guys don't make excuses. If we didn't play well today, they wouldn't want me to make excuses.\n\"It was an enormous effort from the lads.\"",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Brentford 3-2 Nottingham Forest: Ivan Toney scores on his return as Bees beat Forest\nIvan Toney marked his return from an eight-month ban for breaking gambling rules by scoring with his first shot as Brentford registered a controversial victory in a five-goal thriller with Nottingham Forest.\nIt was Toney's first goal in 266 days since he scored the equaliser against Forest in the corresponding fixture last season on 29 April.\nAfter running to the bench to celebrate his goal, Toney raised a shirt proclaiming 'For You Uncle Brian', which is believed to be in honour of a family member.\nThe visitors were furious with the goal, believing Brentford had been allowed to move the ball into a more advantageous position that allowed Toney to curl a low free-kick beyond Forest keeper Matt Turner.\nYet by the end, Forest had even more reason to rage.\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Nottingham Forest's display? Send us your views here\nUnusually, replays of Neal Maupay's winner were shown on the big screen on top of the stand opposite the dug-outs at the Gtech Community Stadium. Manager Nuno Espirito Santo evidently felt the ball had hit Maupay's hand, his assistant Rui Pedro Silva was even more sure and after the VAR decision had gone against Forest, the pair let fourth official Thomas Bramall know in no uncertain manner.\nSilva was booked by referee Darren England as Nuno pointed skywards towards the screen.\nThe chaotic manner of victory was in keeping with a switchback contest the visitors had initially led through Danilo's fabulous control and shot from the edge of the area after just three minutes.\nToney's goal ensured Brentford were level at the break, with Ben Mee putting the hosts ahead when he rose to head home Mathias Jensen's near-post corner 13 minutes into the second period.\nChris Wood flicked home Forest's equaliser but parity only lasted three minutes before Maupay controlled and spun inside the area before applying the excellent finish.\nIt ended a run of one win in eight points for Brentford, who climbed above their opponents into 14th spot.\nDefeat ended a four-match unbeaten run for Forest and left them four points above the relegation zone at the end of a week that began with them being charged for breaking the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules.\nThat ruling leaves them sweating on a points deduction when the hearing is due to be heard at the beginning of April.\nToney makes his mark\nBrentford set the game up to mark the return of a hero.\nToney was made skipper by manager Thomas Frank, who admitted his side 'needed' the player who had scored 20 Premier League goals last season before his contribution was brought to a premature end.\nFor some, this was an uncomfortable decision given the nature of his suspension. There was irony in both sides wearing shirts showing a main sponsor associated with the gambling industry. On the Forest bench was Harry Toffolo, who was given a suspended five-month ban by the FA in September, also for breaching gambling rules.\nThese bans underline the difficult relationship football has with gambling, with the Premier League's ban on the sector providing front of shirt sponsorship due to take effect from the 2026-27 season.\nAs for the football, Frank was right. Brentford need Toney.\nHis goal was executed brilliantly, not just round the wall but chipped off the ground with just enough force to get it over the man lying behind it.\nToney also provided the second-half cross Keane Lewis-Potter failed to covert from close range and also, through his strength and awareness, triggered an attack that ended with the former Hull man scuffing a shot wide.\nForest frustration\nNuno has vowed not to be distracted by Forest's off-field woes but their fans will look at the Premier League table after every game and wonder if they have enough of a cushion to survive should their legal team fail to prove their innocence.\nAt the final whistle, he strode across the pitch towards the officials as though he was going to unload a volley of abuse. Instead, he bit his tongue and merely acknowledged them, although the manner of his march down the tunnel after he had applauded the Forest fans suggested his mood was dark.\nDanilo did score the goal of the game and if the visitors had been able to build on the Brazilian's inspired effort, they would probably have won.\nCallum Hudson-Odoi in particular was a major threat, supplying the curling cross Wood clinically turned home for his ninth goal of the season.\nWith a succession of matches against either big or in-form - or both - clubs to come before a 16 March trip to Luton, there must be a fear for what Forest's season will look like before famed KC Nick de Marco tries to score a victory in what could be the club's most significant match-up of the entire season."

United had less than 40% possession, nine shots against Tottenham's 16 and only a third of the visitors' six on target.\nA draw was not enough to take Tottenham above rivals Arsenal and into the top four. But it did allow them to maintain an eight-point advantage over their hosts, who could drop to 10th before they are next in action against Wolves on 1 February.\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Spurs' display? Send us your views here\nRelive Manchester United v Tottenham and all of Sunday's Premier League action\nSir Jim Ratcliffe: What issues need addressing at Man Utd?\nHojlund and Rashford's rare double\nPrior to this game, Hojlund and Rashford had only scored four Premier League goals between them this season. Ratcliffe was privileged indeed, therefore, to see both get on the scoresheet in his first 45 minutes as a returning 'fan'. That the pair also had a significant involvement in the other's goal just added to the sense of occasion.\nIt was only in United's last home game, against Aston Villa on 26 December, that Hojlund broke his duck with a memorable late winner.\nHis latest effort smacked of someone who is having a surge of confidence. Hojlund wasted little time in blasting a shot high into the Tottenham goal after Destiny Udogie had stepped in to halt Rashford's charge across the penalty area.\nRashford has achieved so much that confidence should not be an issue. But he has been a shadow of the player who broke the 30-goal mark for the first time last season. There was an element of being unsure of himself when he delayed getting a shot away having found himself in the perfect position just before half-time. By then, though he had already found the net once.\nBruno Fernandes was a significant factor, spraying a superb pass out to the England forward. But it was Hojlund who then provided the perfect return pass, which Tottenham's defenders were too slow to react to as Rashford sent his shot into the bottom corner.\nMidway through the second half, manager Erik ten Hag had an extended chat with Rashford during a break in play. It seemed more tactical than an assessment of the forward's latest wasted opportunity as Pedro Porro matched him for speed during a rapid chase into the Tottenham area before the full-back outwitted his opponent as he tried to check onto his right foot.\nWhen Rashford was eventually replaced by Antony three minutes from time, he did not seem happy, chuntering to himself as he took his seat.\nBentancur shines\nTottenham fans' favourite Betancur had an eventful day as he works his way back from the ankle injury that followed a month after his recovery from cruciate surgery.\nThe Uruguayan had an early effort cleared off the line by Dalot and then earned himself a caution in ridiculous fashion as he kicked the ball away after a flag had gone up for an offside, ludicrously arguing he was giving the ball back to United when he had, in fact, sent it yards away from where it needed to be.\nHis first goal since the day he suffered his injury was an excellent effort. Debutant Timo Werner provided the pass - a collectors' item given he only managed one assist in 21 league appearances during his final season at Chelsea - and after that, Bentancur steadied himself before belting a drive past Africa Cup of Nations-bound Andre Onana at his near post.\nA draw was the least Tottenham deserved, as \u00a325m new arrival Radu Dragusin made his debut as a late substitute, although they will hope the injury that forced off Micky van de Ven near the end is nothing more than fatigue related given the Dutchman was returning after a two-month absence with a hamstring injury.\nAfter the game, Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou praised his players as he revealed that some of his squad had struggled with illness during the week.\nDejan Kulusevski was one of those who missed out because he had been unwell and Postecoglou said: \"He struggled all week, he was desperate to play, Skippy [Oliver Skipp], Destiny [Udogie], two or three others struggled this week.\n\"It doesn't matter - these guys don't make excuses. If we didn't play well today, they wouldn't want me to make excuses.\n\"It was an enormous effort from the lads.\""

The ball then brushed Antonee Robinson and rolled back towards the goal, only for Timothy Castagne to poke it away in the nick of time.\nCastagne was on the receiving end of a goalline clearance later in the first half when his fierce shot was deflected past Jordan Pickford and Tarkowski was on hand to block.\nAfter a fairly even first half, Fulham dominated the second with Castagne's flicked header coming back off the bar and Pickford making a stunning save to keep out a Tosin Adarabioyo header that looked destined to find the net.\nMarco Silva's side kept their visitors penned inside their own half for much of the second period but failed to make the most of numerous promising situations and were nearly punished.\nEverton substitute Beto headed over from point-bank range in injury time and the Toffees were unable to force the ball home during a scramble on the edge of the Fulham six-yard box a minute later.\nTo add to Fulham's frustrations, Raul Jimenez went off holding his hamstring at the end of the first 45 minutes and had to be replaced at half-time, with Diop also grabbing the back of his thigh after being substituted in the second half.\nHow did you rate Fulham's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here\nRelive Fulham v Everton and all of Tuesday's Premier League action\nFamiliar frustration for Fulham\nIt is now five games without a win in all competitions for Fulham after they were unable to put the finishing touches to an encouraging display.\nThe Cottagers have failed to score in a league-high 10 games this season and despite having 25 shots their profligacy in front of goal remained.\nJimenez was missed as they pushed to break the deadlock in the second half but he was guilty of passing up a very good opportunity when he sent his shot spinning wide after Castagne's effort was cleared off the line.\nTheir lack of ruthlessness in front of goal was exemplified on the hour mark as Bobby Decordova-Reid broke free after winning a 50-50 challenge with Jarrad Branthwaite.\nWillian was up in support but a superb two-on-one situation did not even result in a shot as Decordova-Reid delayed the pass just long enough so that shooting became the better option, and Ben Godfrey was able to cut it out.\n\"I have to say the goals are going to come. We cannot keep creating chances and not score,\" Silva told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"The decision-making has to be better and be calm enough to make the right decisions. The decision-making is having a big impact when you arrive in so many dangerous situations and we have to do better to score more goals.\"\nSilva's team should not be involved in a relegation scrap this season but will know that until they can become more clinical, they risk being dragged in.\nA point gained and two dropped for Everton?\nGiven the way the second half played out, Everton would surely have happily accepted a point when the board went up to indicate six added minutes.\nHowever, given the glaring nature of Beto's miss and the opportunities for the Portuguese forward and Godfrey in the goalmouth chaos that came soon after, Sean Dyche will be wondering how his side managed not to win.\nIt would have been a significant boost at the start of a crucial week for the club as their appeal against a points deduction gets under way.\nThat they now find themselves in the relegation zone only serves to highlight how much is riding on the outcome.\nDyche was able to use the initial punishment as a way of galvanising his players but after a good spell before Christmas their form has dipped, albeit during a tough run of fixtures, and they were distinctly second-best after half-time in west London.\n\"We're a bit stretched at the moment, but there was maximum effort and maximum mentality,\" Dyche told Match of the Day.\n\"A good 0-0, if there is such a thing, but we're stretched and asking a lot of them, even from players that are not totally match fit.\n\"The group are giving everything, supported by a fantastic fanbase. There is a lot of work to do but clear signs of a group giving everything for the cause, even when we have a lot of injuries.\"\nEvery point counts and this one could make all the difference come May, they can only hope that they aren't looking back and seeing this as a vital two points dropped.",

First, Udogie raced forward from left-back and exchanged passes with Timo Werner, before finishing at the second time of asking after his first shot was blocked.\nSeventy-three seconds later Werner was the provider again with a low cross from the left finished from close range by Johnson with just his second touch after coming on as a half-time sub - before Richarlison completed the goal rush with the follow-up after Maddison's shot was deflected.\nRicharlison has now scored seven goals in his past seven league appearances, one more than he managed in his previous 47 top-flight outings.\nSpurs allowed Brentford back in the game in farcical circumstances with Udogie playing a backpass straight to Toney, who calmly slipped the ball past Vicario for his second goal in as many matches since returning from his eight-month ban for betting offences.\nBut Brentford could not find an equaliser and remain 15th, just four points above the relegation zone.\nMaddison 'sharpens his tools' on Spurs return\nMuch of the focus before the game was on James Maddison, who made his first start since 6 November following his return from injury off the bench against Manchester City.\nMaddison was crucial in Spurs' electric early-season form, and his last start before injury came against Chelsea at home - their first league defeat of the season.\nSpurs fans were hoping the England midfielder could inspire them back into the top four, and a jinking run through the defence after 10 minutes - before being crowded out in the area - gave hope he could make the difference in attack.\nBut Spurs' comeback after the break came when Maddison was moved into a deeper role, with Johnson introduced at half-time in place of Oliver Skipp as part of a double substitution.\nWhile Maddison did find himself in the area to inadvertently assist Spurs' third, the change of shape allowed Werner and Johnson to flourish out wide.\n\"He's been out for a while - today he showed why we missed him so much,\" Johnson told Match of the Day. \"He has the X-factor. Today was him sharpening his tools again.\"\nTheir fast start to the second half extends Spurs' club-record run of now scoring in 34 successive league matches.\nAlthough they still have clear flaws - particularly in defence, as showed in second-half stoppage time when they allowed Shandon Baptiste space in the box for a volley which Vicario tipped over acrobatically - Spurs are certainly stronger with Maddison in the side, whatever his role.\nBrentford rue '10-minute blackout'\nBrentford played Tottenham perfectly in the first half, both in exploiting their high line - Mads Roerslev finished a slick move minutes before Maupay's opener, only for Mathias Jensen to be caught offside in the build-up - and in getting inside their heads.\nMaupay was central in needling the Tottenham players, encapsulated by him replicating Maddison's darts-throwing celebration following the opening goal.\nHis celebration aggravated some of the home supporters and Maddison himself, who shared an unfriendly exchange of words and head pats with Maupay afterwards.\nIt clearly riled Maddison's team-mates too, with both Johnson and Richarlison pulling out the darts celebrations after their goals as Brentford capitulated in a 10-minute spell which manager Thomas Frank rued.\n\"We frustrated them with the high press, we were good with the low block, on the break and transition we were very dangerous,\" Frank told Match of the Day.\n\"Then we had a blackout, so it is about being smarter. The second goal is the most disappointing - don't concede from the kick-off.\"\nThe Bees have now dropped a league-high 23 points from winning positions this campaign, and have lost five league games this season after scoring the opening goal, more than any other side in the division - and once more than Tottenham."

We looked much like ourselves and we have players coming back.\"\nAt the other end of the pitch, Schar was clinical. He gave Ezri Konsa the slip to strike the ball home and open the scoring as Villa's defending was punished when they allowed Kieran Trippier's corner to drop into the six-yard box.\nNewcastle's second was pure opportunism from Schar. He stayed in the box following a corner and stabbed the ball home after Gordon saw his deflected effort bounce out off the underside of the crossbar with Emiliano Martinez already committed.\n\"We know what we are capable of but we haven't shown it enough,\" Schar told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Today we know we were going to have to be at our best. This should give us a lot of confidence and hopefully we can build on these last two results.\"\nThe game was effectively over as a contest seven minutes after half-time when Moreno could not prevent himself sliding Jacob Murphy's low finish into the net.\nNewcastle showed renewed energy and intensity after a dip. If the green shoots of recovery came in an FA Cup fourth-round win over Fulham last weekend, now there is further cause for optimism.\nVilla title challenge hits buffers\nUnai Emery never quite managed to break the La Liga stranglehold of Barcelona and Real Madrid in his homeland.\nThree third-placed finishes with Valencia between 2009 and 2012 were the best he managed as he came up short when faced with Spanish football's behemoths.\nEmery's Villa side had looked in contention to make it four-horse race with Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool in the Premier League this season.\nBefore this encounter they had 13 wins and 43 points - their best record after 21 top-flight fixtures of a season for 125 years - and were unbeaten at Villa Park.\nHowever, the landscape looks a little different after a defeat in which their players looked tired.\n\"It is a little frustrating. The first 60 minutes, they were better,\" Emery told Match of the Day.\n\"We couldn't take chances to draw but we have to accept and remind the players everything we did here was not perfect. We then have to correct what we did here.\n\"We have to be demanding that we can improve. We have to react tactically.\"\nEmery's side have now dropped points in four of their past five games and a title tilt which always looked unlikely appears to be firmly on the wane.\nVilla's players appeared jaded and flat-footed here. Emery's reluctance to rotate - either through choice or design - suggests they have not got the depth to go the distance, either.\nThe upside is that at least Watkins has ended a run of six appearances without a goal with a smart finish for his 50th in the Premier League. He was a whisker away from a second, too.\nA place in the top four should still be within Villa's grasp, as well a shot at either the Europa League or the FA Cup. There is still plenty to play for.",

Matheus Nunes chipped a superb cross into the six-yard box for Alvarez to head home in the 16th minute.\nFollow Manchester City v Burnley and the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Burnley's display? Send us your views here\nAnd just six minutes later, Alvarez profited from a brilliantly worked training ground free-kick routine as Kevin de Bruyne shaped to curl a cross into the box but instead rolled a perfect 20-yard pass which just needed the first-time finish.\nRodri added a third in trademark fashion in the opening minute of the second-half, driving home Phil Foden's cut-back from the edge of the area.\nBurnley boss, and former City captain, Vincent Kompany would have been pleased with the way his side kept battling until the end.\nThey were at least able to grab an injury-time consolation as defender Ameen Al-Dakhil bundled in their first goal in seven visits to this stadium since 2018.\nThey were ultimately powerless, though, to stop second-placed City's eighth successive win in all competitions - and 13th consecutive victory against second-bottom Burnley.\nCity are five points behind leaders Liverpool with a game in hand, and level with third-placed Arsenal as they pursue an unprecedented fourth consecutive league title.\nAnd boss Pep Guardiola believes his side need a significant winning run if they are to retain the title.\n\"With this Liverpool that we have faced for eight years, and Arsenal, with Mikel [Arteta] who has settled his squad, I don't have the feeling that they're going to drop much points,\" he said.\n\"We have to win as many games as possible and, at the end, we will see what happens.\"\nPraise for City backroom hero Vicens\nOnce he had expressed delight at Alvarez's second goal, Guardiola turned to his bench and located Carlos Vicens.\nA decent youth player from the Balearic Islands, Vicens spent his career in the Spanish lower leagues before eventually turning to coaching.\nRemarkably, he initially came to City on work experience in 2017 and was eventually appointed assistant coach to the under-12s and under-13s teams before working his way up to under-18 level.\nVicens is now City's set-piece coach and Guardiola appreciated the work that would have gone into an initial idea being executed to perfection in a Premier League game.\nOf course, the plan is only one aspect. You also need players with the ability to execute and in De Bruyne City have one of the very best in the world.\nStarting for the first time since suffering a recurrence of the hamstring injury he initially sustained in the Champions League final at Burnley on the opening day of the season, De Bruyne took deception to 'Traitors' levels. He stared into the penalty area and raised his arms to indicate the kind of cross that was coming before quickly changing his body shape to roll his pass straight into Alvarez's path.\nWith City in control after that strike, it was just a case of waiting for Haaland's return to action.\nThe forward was cheered when he came out for his warm-up and again when he replaced De Bruyne.\nThere was a familiar menace about his running style and the way Haaland attacked the ball. But after being ignored by Jeremy Doku as he ran into the box, then came the moment that will doubtless be the topic of much dressing banter.\nOnce the inevitable rust disappears, it should not be too long before Haaland makes the right contact and starts scoring again.\n\"It has been really good without him for the last two months,\" added Guardiola. \"But with him we are a better team and we are really pleased that he is back.\"\nBurnley relegation concern continues\nMore than most, Burnley have reason to await the outcome of the profitability and sustainability rules charges faced by Everton and Nottingham Forest with interest.\nWithout Everton's 10-point deduction, they would already be eight points adrift and Forest would be just above the relegation zone.\nKompany knows more than most what to expect in this stadium and will be disappointed his players were not alive enough to react to either Nunes' impudent cross or De Bruyne's clever free-kick.\nGiven Burnley had conceded 28 times since they last scored against City, victory was implausible for the Clarets - who have won just three times this season -once they went behind.\nThey did threaten sporadically on the break, with Lyle Foster curling an effort just wide shortly before half-time and Zeki Amdouni firing over with only Ederson to beat.\nBut there was never any real belief they could make a proper game of it, with even Al-Dakhil's first goal since joining Burnley 12 months ago from Belgian outfit Sint-Truiden coming as something of a surprise at the end.\n\"We played one of the best teams in the world,\" Kompany told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"In these games it's about being able to build chances and momentum. I felt if we had the last pass coming off, if we put it in the back of the net, it would help of course.\n\"We had our moments. I can dissect it as much as I want, but we have to move on to Fulham now.\"",

The ball then brushed Antonee Robinson and rolled back towards the goal, only for Timothy Castagne to poke it away in the nick of time.\nCastagne was on the receiving end of a goalline clearance later in the first half when his fierce shot was deflected past Jordan Pickford and Tarkowski was on hand to block.\nAfter a fairly even first half, Fulham dominated the second with Castagne's flicked header coming back off the bar and Pickford making a stunning save to keep out a Tosin Adarabioyo header that looked destined to find the net.\nMarco Silva's side kept their visitors penned inside their own half for much of the second period but failed to make the most of numerous promising situations and were nearly punished.\nEverton substitute Beto headed over from point-bank range in injury time and the Toffees were unable to force the ball home during a scramble on the edge of the Fulham six-yard box a minute later.\nTo add to Fulham's frustrations, Raul Jimenez went off holding his hamstring at the end of the first 45 minutes and had to be replaced at half-time, with Diop also grabbing the back of his thigh after being substituted in the second half.\nHow did you rate Fulham's performance?

Send us your views here\nRelive Fulham v Everton and all of Tuesday's Premier League action\nFamiliar frustration for Fulham\nIt is now five games without a win in all competitions for Fulham after they were unable to put the finishing touches to an encouraging display.\nThe Cottagers have failed to score in a league-high 10 games this season and despite having 25 shots their profligacy in front of goal remained.\nJimenez was missed as they pushed to break the deadlock in the second half but he was guilty of passing up a very good opportunity when he sent his shot spinning wide after Castagne's effort was cleared off the line.\nTheir lack of ruthlessness in front of goal was exemplified on the hour mark as Bobby Decordova-Reid broke free after winning a 50-50 challenge with Jarrad Branthwaite.\nWillian was up in support but a superb two-on-one situation did not even result in a shot as Decordova-Reid delayed the pass just long enough so that shooting became the better option, and Ben Godfrey was able to cut it out.\n\"I have to say the goals are going to come. We cannot keep creating chances and not score,\" Silva told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"The decision-making has to be better and be calm enough to make the right decisions. The decision-making is having a big impact when you arrive in so many dangerous situations and we have to do better to score more goals.\"\nSilva's team should not be involved in a relegation scrap this season but will know that until they can become more clinical, they risk being dragged in.\nA point gained and two dropped for Everton?\nGiven the way the second half played out, Everton would surely have happily accepted a point when the board went up to indicate six added minutes.\nHowever, given the glaring nature of Beto's miss and the opportunities for the Portuguese forward and Godfrey in the goalmouth chaos that came soon after, Sean Dyche will be wondering how his side managed not to win.\nIt would have been a significant boost at the start of a crucial week for the club as their appeal against a points deduction gets under way.\nThat they now find themselves in the relegation zone only serves to highlight how much is riding on the outcome.\nDyche was able to use the initial punishment as a way of galvanising his players but after a good spell before Christmas their form has dipped, albeit during a tough run of fixtures, and they were distinctly second-best after half-time in west London.\n\"We're a bit stretched at the moment, but there was maximum effort and maximum mentality,\" Dyche told Match of the Day.\n\"A good 0-0, if there is such a thing, but we're stretched and asking a lot of them, even from players that are not totally match fit.\n\"The group are giving everything, supported by a fantastic fanbase. There is a lot of work to do but clear signs of a group giving everything for the cause, even when we have a lot of injuries.\"\nEvery point counts and this one could make all the difference come May, they can only hope that they aren't looking back and seeing this as a vital two points dropped."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Aston Villa 1-3 Newcastle United: Fabian Schar double ends run of four Premier League defeats\nFabian Schar scored twice as Newcastle ended a run of four consecutive Premier League defeats with a tenacious victory at Aston Villa.\nSwitzerland defender Schar finished well from close range for both goals as Villa stuttered to their first home league defeat of the season.\nAn own goal from Alex Moreno gave Newcastle a three-goal cushion before Ollie Watkins pulled a goal back.\nWatkins had the ball in the net for a second time but was flagged offside.\nVilla were left to rue the chance to make up ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool and remain in fourth spot - five points behind the Reds having played a game more.\nNewcastle climbed up to seventh in the table but are still 11 points adrift of Villa in the battle to secure a place in next season's Champions League.\nReaction and analysis from Tuesday's Premier League matches\nSchar's spirit reignites Howe's side\nThe Magpies played with the greater panache against a Villa side who had collected 28 points out of a possible 30 on home turf before this encounter, and were deserved victors.\nAnthony Gordon, in particular, spearheaded their attacking play with a guile and flair as he frequently outfoxed the Villa defence with his movement and tricky.\nEqually, Alexander Isak looked a threat in attack before his premature withdrawal in the first half through injury.\nBut Eddie Howe will have been especially pleased with the substance to his side, as well as the eye-catching moments of style, en route to only their second away win of the season.\nSchar was the embodiment of that: disciplined, gritty and organised in his defensive work, never shirking a block or challenge.\n\"It was mixed emotions for me because that team is an elite team,\" Howe told TNT Sports.\n\"The mixed part is that we haven't seen that for a number of weeks. We looked much like ourselves and we have players coming back.\"\nAt the other end of the pitch, Schar was clinical. He gave Ezri Konsa the slip to strike the ball home and open the scoring as Villa's defending was punished when they allowed Kieran Trippier's corner to drop into the six-yard box.\nNewcastle's second was pure opportunism from Schar. He stayed in the box following a corner and stabbed the ball home after Gordon saw his deflected effort bounce out off the underside of the crossbar with Emiliano Martinez already committed.\n\"We know what we are capable of but we haven't shown it enough,\" Schar told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Today we know we were going to have to be at our best. This should give us a lot of confidence and hopefully we can build on these last two results.\"\nThe game was effectively over as a contest seven minutes after half-time when Moreno could not prevent himself sliding Jacob Murphy's low finish into the net.\nNewcastle showed renewed energy and intensity after a dip. If the green shoots of recovery came in an FA Cup fourth-round win over Fulham last weekend, now there is further cause for optimism.\nVilla title challenge hits buffers\nUnai Emery never quite managed to break the La Liga stranglehold of Barcelona and Real Madrid in his homeland.\nThree third-placed finishes with Valencia between 2009 and 2012 were the best he managed as he came up short when faced with Spanish football's behemoths.\nEmery's Villa side had looked in contention to make it four-horse race with Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool in the Premier League this season.\nBefore this encounter they had 13 wins and 43 points - their best record after 21 top-flight fixtures of a season for 125 years - and were unbeaten at Villa Park.\nHowever, the landscape looks a little different after a defeat in which their players looked tired.\n\"It is a little frustrating. The first 60 minutes, they were better,\" Emery told Match of the Day.\n\"We couldn't take chances to draw but we have to accept and remind the players everything we did here was not perfect. We then have to correct what we did here.\n\"We have to be demanding that we can improve. We have to react tactically.\"\nEmery's side have now dropped points in four of their past five games and a title tilt which always looked unlikely appears to be firmly on the wane.\nVilla's players appeared jaded and flat-footed here. Emery's reluctance to rotate - either through choice or design - suggests they have not got the depth to go the distance, either.\nThe upside is that at least Watkins has ended a run of six appearances without a goal with a smart finish for his 50th in the Premier League. He was a whisker away from a second, too.\nA place in the top four should still be within Villa's grasp, as well a shot at either the Europa League or the FA Cup. There is still plenty to play for."

The striker slid in to finish from close range from Shaw's low cross as the Wolves defence failed to clear.\nIt has been a chastening week for Rashford and United, with Ten Hag forced to field plenty of questions about the forward's future at Old Trafford.\nWhile Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho were forced to leave United after fallouts with the Dutch manager, Rashford has been reintegrated - and showed why he has the trust of Ten Hag.\nAfter scoring early doors, Rashford tracked back nearly 50 yards to hassle Matheus Cunha into shooting straight at Onana - himself returning to the XI, following Cameroon's early exit from the Africa Cup of Nations.\nIndeed, the entire United team was seemingly renewed as they swarmed Wolves in the first 45 minutes. Hojlund was unlucky not to make it three when he charged down a Sa clearance, and both he and Casemiro had goals ruled out by the offside flag.\nBut United's issues with inconsistency were laid bare after the break as Wolves were allowed to get back in the game - and ultimately they were left to rely on another academy product in Mainoo to bail them out.",

The striker slid in to finish from close range from Shaw's low cross as the Wolves defence failed to clear.\nIt has been a chastening week for Rashford and United, with Ten Hag forced to field plenty of questions about the forward's future at Old Trafford.\nWhile Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho were forced to leave United after fallouts with the Dutch manager, Rashford has been reintegrated - and showed why he has the trust of Ten Hag.\nAfter scoring early doors, Rashford tracked back nearly 50 yards to hassle Matheus Cunha into shooting straight at Onana - himself returning to the XI, following Cameroon's early exit from the Africa Cup of Nations.\nIndeed, the entire United team was seemingly renewed as they swarmed Wolves in the first 45 minutes. Hojlund was unlucky not to make it three when he charged down a Sa clearance, and both he and Casemiro had goals ruled out by the offside flag.\nBut United's issues with inconsistency were laid bare after the break as Wolves were allowed to get back in the game - and ultimately they were left to rely on another academy product in Mainoo to bail them out."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 Brentford: Spurs come from behind to move fourth in Premier League\nTottenham Hotspur moved back into the Premier League top four with a thrilling and at times chaotic home victory over Brentford.\nThe visitors led at half-time at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium via a scrambled Neal Maupay finish.\nBut Tottenham blitzed the Bees with three goals in eight minutes after the interval, through Destiny Udogie, Brennan Johnson and Richarlison.\nIvan Toney pulled one back following a dreadful Udogie backpass, but Spurs held on to win and move back into the top four for the first time in 2024, after Ange Postecoglou's side dropped from the Champions League places following the 4-2 defeat by Brighton on 28 December.\nIt was a frenetic game with 28 shots across both teams in which Spurs were drawn into squabbles with Brentford during the first half before pulling away in the second with an early blitz.\n\"It's a young, maturing team,\" Postecoglou told BBC Sport. \"Friday [the FA Cup defeat by Manchester City] showed we have a long way to go and tonight was another test. Arguing with the opponents isn't going to help us.\"\nSpurs started the game on top, but were caught out with their high defensive line as Toney was played through. His shot was saved by Gigi Vicario, but Maupay pounced on the rebound.\nAlthough the Frenchman kicked the ball against his standing foot, it deflected into the corner to give Maupay his fourth goal in consecutive matches.\nBut Spurs came out with a bang after half-time, scoring three times in eight minutes. First, Udogie raced forward from left-back and exchanged passes with Timo Werner, before finishing at the second time of asking after his first shot was blocked.\nSeventy-three seconds later Werner was the provider again with a low cross from the left finished from close range by Johnson with just his second touch after coming on as a half-time sub - before Richarlison completed the goal rush with the follow-up after Maddison's shot was deflected.\nRicharlison has now scored seven goals in his past seven league appearances, one more than he managed in his previous 47 top-flight outings.\nSpurs allowed Brentford back in the game in farcical circumstances with Udogie playing a backpass straight to Toney, who calmly slipped the ball past Vicario for his second goal in as many matches since returning from his eight-month ban for betting offences.\nBut Brentford could not find an equaliser and remain 15th, just four points above the relegation zone.\nMaddison 'sharpens his tools' on Spurs return\nMuch of the focus before the game was on James Maddison, who made his first start since 6 November following his return from injury off the bench against Manchester City.\nMaddison was crucial in Spurs' electric early-season form, and his last start before injury came against Chelsea at home - their first league defeat of the season.\nSpurs fans were hoping the England midfielder could inspire them back into the top four, and a jinking run through the defence after 10 minutes - before being crowded out in the area - gave hope he could make the difference in attack.\nBut Spurs' comeback after the break came when Maddison was moved into a deeper role, with Johnson introduced at half-time in place of Oliver Skipp as part of a double substitution.\nWhile Maddison did find himself in the area to inadvertently assist Spurs' third, the change of shape allowed Werner and Johnson to flourish out wide.\n\"He's been out for a while - today he showed why we missed him so much,\" Johnson told Match of the Day. \"He has the X-factor. Today was him sharpening his tools again.\"\nTheir fast start to the second half extends Spurs' club-record run of now scoring in 34 successive league matches.\nAlthough they still have clear flaws - particularly in defence, as showed in second-half stoppage time when they allowed Shandon Baptiste space in the box for a volley which Vicario tipped over acrobatically - Spurs are certainly stronger with Maddison in the side, whatever his role.\nBrentford rue '10-minute blackout'\nBrentford played Tottenham perfectly in the first half, both in exploiting their high line - Mads Roerslev finished a slick move minutes before Maupay's opener, only for Mathias Jensen to be caught offside in the build-up - and in getting inside their heads.\nMaupay was central in needling the Tottenham players, encapsulated by him replicating Maddison's darts-throwing celebration following the opening goal.\nHis celebration aggravated some of the home supporters and Maddison himself, who shared an unfriendly exchange of words and head pats with Maupay afterwards.\nIt clearly riled Maddison's team-mates too, with both Johnson and Richarlison pulling out the darts celebrations after their goals as Brentford capitulated in a 10-minute spell which manager Thomas Frank rued.\n\"We frustrated them with the high press, we were good with the low block, on the break and transition we were very dangerous,\" Frank told Match of the Day.\n\"Then we had a blackout, so it is about being smarter. The second goal is the most disappointing - don't concede from the kick-off.\"\nThe Bees have now dropped a league-high 23 points from winning positions this campaign, and have lost five league games this season after scoring the opening goal, more than any other side in the division - and once more than Tottenham.",

Matheus Nunes chipped a superb cross into the six-yard box for Alvarez to head home in the 16th minute.\nFollow Manchester City v Burnley and the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Burnley's display? Send us your views here\nAnd just six minutes later, Alvarez profited from a brilliantly worked training ground free-kick routine as Kevin de Bruyne shaped to curl a cross into the box but instead rolled a perfect 20-yard pass which just needed the first-time finish.\nRodri added a third in trademark fashion in the opening minute of the second-half, driving home Phil Foden's cut-back from the edge of the area.\nBurnley boss, and former City captain, Vincent Kompany would have been pleased with the way his side kept battling until the end.\nThey were at least able to grab an injury-time consolation as defender Ameen Al-Dakhil bundled in their first goal in seven visits to this stadium since 2018.\nThey were ultimately powerless, though, to stop second-placed City's eighth successive win in all competitions - and 13th consecutive victory against second-bottom Burnley.\nCity are five points behind leaders Liverpool with a game in hand, and level with third-placed Arsenal as they pursue an unprecedented fourth consecutive league title.\nAnd boss Pep Guardiola believes his side need a significant winning run if they are to retain the title.\n\"With this Liverpool that we have faced for eight years, and Arsenal, with Mikel [Arteta] who has settled his squad, I don't have the feeling that they're going to drop much points,\" he said.\n\"We have to win as many games as possible and, at the end, we will see what happens.\"\nPraise for City backroom hero Vicens\nOnce he had expressed delight at Alvarez's second goal, Guardiola turned to his bench and located Carlos Vicens.\nA decent youth player from the Balearic Islands, Vicens spent his career in the Spanish lower leagues before eventually turning to coaching.\nRemarkably, he initially came to City on work experience in 2017 and was eventually appointed assistant coach to the under-12s and under-13s teams before working his way up to under-18 level.\nVicens is now City's set-piece coach and Guardiola appreciated the work that would have gone into an initial idea being executed to perfection in a Premier League game.\nOf course, the plan is only one aspect. You also need players with the ability to execute and in De Bruyne City have one of the very best in the world.\nStarting for the first time since suffering a recurrence of the hamstring injury he initially sustained in the Champions League final at Burnley on the opening day of the season, De Bruyne took deception to 'Traitors' levels. He stared into the penalty area and raised his arms to indicate the kind of cross that was coming before quickly changing his body shape to roll his pass straight into Alvarez's path.\nWith City in control after that strike, it was just a case of waiting for Haaland's return to action.\nThe forward was cheered when he came out for his warm-up and again when he replaced De Bruyne.\nThere was a familiar menace about his running style and the way Haaland attacked the ball. But after being ignored by Jeremy Doku as he ran into the box, then came the moment that will doubtless be the topic of much dressing banter.\nOnce the inevitable rust disappears, it should not be too long before Haaland makes the right contact and starts scoring again.\n\"It has been really good without him for the last two months,\" added Guardiola. \"But with him we are a better team and we are really pleased that he is back.\"\nBurnley relegation concern continues\nMore than most, Burnley have reason to await the outcome of the profitability and sustainability rules charges faced by Everton and Nottingham Forest with interest.\nWithout Everton's 10-point deduction, they would already be eight points adrift and Forest would be just above the relegation zone.\nKompany knows more than most what to expect in this stadium and will be disappointed his players were not alive enough to react to either Nunes' impudent cross or De Bruyne's clever free-kick.\nGiven Burnley had conceded 28 times since they last scored against City, victory was implausible for the Clarets - who have won just three times this season -once they went behind.\nThey did threaten sporadically on the break, with Lyle Foster curling an effort just wide shortly before half-time and Zeki Amdouni firing over with only Ederson to beat.\nBut there was never any real belief they could make a proper game of it, with even Al-Dakhil's first goal since joining Burnley 12 months ago from Belgian outfit Sint-Truiden coming as something of a surprise at the end.\n\"We played one of the best teams in the world,\" Kompany told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"In these games it's about being able to build chances and momentum. I felt if we had the last pass coming off, if we put it in the back of the net, it would help of course.\n\"We had our moments. I can dissect it as much as I want, but we have to move on to Fulham now.\""

Send us your views here\nRicharlison receives Everton respect despite Spurs double\nAfter a brilliant start under Postecoglou, Tottenham faced questions when they lost four and drew one of their games during a poor run in November and December.\nThey seemed to show a renewed mettle after that - and were heading for a sixth win in eight league games as they led Everton - but familiar failings let them down again.\nThe draw meant they missed the chance to go level on 46 points with Manchester City and Arsenal above them in the table and claw themselves back into the title race.\nFor much of the game, though, a former Evertonian looked like being the difference maker with his instinctive finishing.\nBrazil striker Richarlison has not found it easy since moving to north London for \u00a360m in July 2022, netting only two goals in his first 39 league games.\nBut he looks like he has finally settled in, netting nine goals in his past eight league appearances, including a delightful curling strike from outside the area for his second here.\nRicharlison did not celebrate either of his goals, instead gesturing an apology towards the home faithful, who repaid the act with a round of applause.\nPostecoglou said: \"He's been great, Richy. He worked really hard for the team and he is the one who deserves all the credit.\n\"There is more to come from him, he's working really hard to improve.\"\nHe could have had a hat-trick in the second half but was denied by Jordan Pickford's sharp save and further stops from the England international proved vitally important.\nPickford made excellent saves to deny James Maddison twice and keep out Pedro Porro's stinging drive, before wildly celebrating Branthwaite's goal.\nLate goal could kick-start season\nEverton claimed a well-earned point, which brought sheer joy to those inside the stadium, following another pre-match protest over their 10-point deduction.\nBranthwaite's late goal may provide inspiration to kick-start their season - even though his team remain short of victories as they fight relegation.\nEverton have now won only one of their past 10 games in all competitions and have remarkably beaten Spurs just once in their past 23 league meetings.\nBut Dyche added: \"There are so many good things and so much character in the team. It shows even when we're stretched, young lads coming off the bench, there are good signs about what we are trying to achieve here amid all the adversity and all the noise.\n\"We know they are a good side. We were very good today, worked to cause trouble for them and I thought we did enough to get something from the game.\"\nCalvert-Lewin thought he had ended a barren run without scoring with Everton's first equaliser but the goal was given to Harrison and the forward has now failed to net in 17 games, a run stretching back to October.\nDyche sent on young striker Chermiti with 10 minutes remaining and the Portuguese prodded a weak effort straight at Vicario in the 88th minute, but with seven minutes added on, Branthwaite took advantage by popping up at the back post for the leveller."

It was a real good team performance and an enjoyable one for us, I can't lie,\" O'Neil told BBC Sport.\n\"We have come back from setbacks a lot. We suffered heartbreak three days ago. But it was straight back to business.\"\nA week to forget for Chelsea\nFour days after being outclassed in a 4-1 midweek defeat at leaders Liverpool, Chelsea were outfought as their 10-match unbeaten home run in all competitions was brought to a painful end.\nWhile there is an acceptance that they are in the early phases of a long-term project under Pochettino, Sunday's meeting with a Wolves side keen to replace them in the top half was an important one as the hosts sought a positive response.\nThey made a promising start as Palmer scored his 10th goal in 20 league appearances during an outstanding first season at the club - but it was far from enough.\nHesitant Chelsea passing had already presented Neto and Cunha with early opportunities before the Blues went on to surrender their first-half advantage.\nThey struggled to create opportunities when chasing the game - a late flurry of chances when already three goals down aside - with Christopher Nkunku in particular starved of service in only his second league start.\nWhat did you make of Chelsea's display? Send us your views here\nThe Blues have the same points tally as they did at this stage last season under Graham Potter, who was sacked six games later.\nWhile Pochettino does not currently appear to find himself under the same pressure, the Chelsea fans were clear at full-time that this performance was not acceptable.\n\"I apologise to the fans and thanks to those who stayed and supported the team until the end. We are sorry and so disappointed,\" Pochettino said.\n\"It is normal that we are not matching the history of the club. It is a different project and it is always a matter of time but it is difficult for me to always ask for time, time, time. It's normal that the patience is not infinite.\"",

Send us your views here\nBurnley show grit as new signings impress\nNo Premier League team has stayed up after taking just 12 points from their first 22 matches - Burnley's total before Saturday's fixture.\nThey realistically needed to start mounting their escape here, with an unkind fixture list featuring Liverpool away and Arsenal at home in their next two games.\nAnd the Clarets started well - only a last-gasp Tim Ream tackle denied Odobert a glorious chance after eight minutes, while the young French winger shot just wide after weaving through the away defence later in the first half - but Fulham's quick one-two punch knocked the wind out of Vincent Kompany's side.\nThe introduction of Fofana helped to rouse the hosts, and there were also encouraging performances from Kompany's other January acquisitions to provide Burnley fans with some hope they can launch a survival bid.\nRight-back Lorenz Assignon started after arriving on loan from Rennes and put in a lively display, while their other deadline day signing - central defender Maxime Esteve - provided stability after coming on at half time.\n\"It was all round positive from the players we recruited,\" Kompany told BBC Match of the Day. \"Assignon against Willian played really well, and Fofana with his intensity gave us something different.\"\nThis draw marks the first time in 19 Premier League games where Burnley have avoided defeat after falling behind.\n\"The two goals we conceded, that's not something we can be happy about,\" Kompany added. \"The second half we had a go, it was exciting, and a great contribution from the new boys.\n\"The fans are brilliant, they have stuck behind us. There is fight in this team, we are going to carry on. 15 games left, we'll go full steam ahead.\"\nFor Fulham, their away frustration continues - although a point ends a five-match losing run away from Craven Cottage in the league.\nIt was a good day personally for Brazilian forward Muniz, who started after Raul Jimenez was ruled out by a hamstring issue, while Armando Broja was on the bench having joined on loan from Chelsea on deadline day.\nWith his game time perhaps about to be severely restricted, Muniz seized his chance to demonstrate his qualities to manager Marco Silva and looked emotional while celebrating his goal.\n\"A very good performance from him,\" Silva said of Muniz. \"A very good first half, good moments in the second half too. He's a young boy who works very hard.\""

I don't think anyone can make head or tail of it.\"\n'One of their worst performances' but Spurs' future 'really bright' - Jermaine Jenas analysis\nFollow live action of Saturday's Premier League games\nHow did you rate Everton's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Spurs' display? Send us your views here\nRicharlison receives Everton respect despite Spurs double\nAfter a brilliant start under Postecoglou, Tottenham faced questions when they lost four and drew one of their games during a poor run in November and December.\nThey seemed to show a renewed mettle after that - and were heading for a sixth win in eight league games as they led Everton - but familiar failings let them down again.\nThe draw meant they missed the chance to go level on 46 points with Manchester City and Arsenal above them in the table and claw themselves back into the title race.\nFor much of the game, though, a former Evertonian looked like being the difference maker with his instinctive finishing.\nBrazil striker Richarlison has not found it easy since moving to north London for \u00a360m in July 2022, netting only two goals in his first 39 league games.\nBut he looks like he has finally settled in, netting nine goals in his past eight league appearances, including a delightful curling strike from outside the area for his second here.\nRicharlison did not celebrate either of his goals, instead gesturing an apology towards the home faithful, who repaid the act with a round of applause.\nPostecoglou said: \"He's been great, Richy. He worked really hard for the team and he is the one who deserves all the credit.\n\"There is more to come from him, he's working really hard to improve.\"\nHe could have had a hat-trick in the second half but was denied by Jordan Pickford's sharp save and further stops from the England international proved vitally important.\nPickford made excellent saves to deny James Maddison twice and keep out Pedro Porro's stinging drive, before wildly celebrating Branthwaite's goal.\nLate goal could kick-start season\nEverton claimed a well-earned point, which brought sheer joy to those inside the stadium, following another pre-match protest over their 10-point deduction.\nBranthwaite's late goal may provide inspiration to kick-start their season - even though his team remain short of victories as they fight relegation.\nEverton have now won only one of their past 10 games in all competitions and have remarkably beaten Spurs just once in their past 23 league meetings.\nBut Dyche added: \"There are so many good things and so much character in the team. It shows even when we're stretched, young lads coming off the bench, there are good signs about what we are trying to achieve here amid all the adversity and all the noise.\n\"We know they are a good side. We were very good today, worked to cause trouble for them and I thought we did enough to get something from the game.\"\nCalvert-Lewin thought he had ended a barren run without scoring with Everton's first equaliser but the goal was given to Harrison and the forward has now failed to net in 17 games, a run stretching back to October.\nDyche sent on young striker Chermiti with 10 minutes remaining and the Portuguese prodded a weak effort straight at Vicario in the 88th minute, but with seven minutes added on, Branthwaite took advantage by popping up at the back post for the leveller.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nHodgson's side failed to create many openings of note and Palace's supporters once again expressed their frustration with the club ownership and management with banners calling for change.\nBrighton, who made five changes from the side who lost 4-0 to Luton in midweek, looked rejuvenated.\nThe intensity they showed on the pitch was matched by their manager, who picked up his third booking of the season while appealing against a decision, and so will have to watch their next game from the stands.\nDefeat for Hodgson puts Palace's form back under the microscope. While they defeated Sheffield United last Tuesday, they have won just four of their past 17 league matches.\nThe Palace boss will point to the fact that he did not have his best players, with Eberechi Eze not fit enough to be in the squad and Michael Olise limping off just 11 minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute.\nBrighton cruise to victory\nComing into this game, the Seagulls had only won three of their past 16 league matches.\nHowever, they are in a much better place than their rivals - in touch with the Premier League's European qualification spots, still in the FA Cup, and in the Europa League last 16.\nTheir football is a joy to watch, with De Zerbi is able to get the best out of the players in his squad.\nThey have an excellent blend of experience and youth, with 18-year-old Hinshelwood and 19-year-old Buonanotte both scoring.\nBrighton have a number of key players out injured but if they can get some of them back towards the end of the season, it could be an exciting time for the club.\nPressure continues to build on Hodgson\nAs far as Palace supporters are concerned, the manner of this heavy defeat against their biggest rivals puts Hodgson back under pressure.\nThe Eagles have won two of their past four Premier League games, but the two defeats in that sequence have been heavy - with a 5-0 loss at Arsenal before Brighton's convincing win.\nSupporters had already made their feelings known about the club's leadership with a banner during the defeat at Arsenal and there was another display of discontent at Amex Stadium.\nWithout Eze, who scored twice against Sheffield United on Tuesday, and with Olise only able to feature briefly, Palace were toothless in attack.\nFan feeling is far from positive, and given their poor results over the past four months, some may ask if the club will feel it's time to make a change."

Have your say here\nBailey also shone in a fluid Villa attack which repeatedly sliced open the hosts' defence with ease, the Jamaica forward displaying his quality in front of goal with a well-taken finish in a complete performance.\nVilla threatened to humiliate the hosts when Moreno made it five shortly after half-time, but that tally was enough to give Villa their biggest away win in the Premier League since April 2008 as Emery's side comfortably saw out victory.\n\"I'm happy because before the match we were very focused to react [to the Newcastle loss]. We scored goals, created chances and stopped them,\" Emery told BBC Sport.\n\"We have to try to focus each match. We're really happy. Our aggression was fantastic.\"\nDismal Blades outclassed and in trouble\nSheffield United were outclassed in every department and, on this evidence, appear destined for an immediate return to the Championship.\nIn Premier League history, the three previous teams to accumulate as few as 10 points at this stage of the season have all been relegated.\nThe Blades look increasingly likely to suffer the same fate. In desperate need of a rapid upturn in form, they instead suffered a significant setback here - not least to their belief.\nThey have won twice all season, are winless in seven league games, and have conceded the most goals of any side at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1965-66.\nThe seats were rapidly emptying inside 30 minutes, with loud boos at the full-time whistle. United have now lost 31 of their 40 most recent Premier League games under Wilder, who has overseen one win in eight games since he was reappointed in early December.\nWhat did you make of Sheff Utd's display? Send us your views here\nTheir only threatening spell arrived inside the closing 15 minutes, when Emiliano Martinez was forced to make a double save and Jack Robinson had an attempt headed off the line.\nBut there were few positives for Wilder, who made five changes from the midweek loss to Crystal Palace, and his players must now recover for a crucial trip to fellow promoted side Luton Town next weekend.\n\"We have to apologise to our supporters because they've been superb. We've let them down this evening,\" said Wilder.\n\"I don't think there's anything to take out of today's performance. Nothing at all. We've been well and truly pumped.\""

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Liverpool's display? Send us your views here\nBelow-par Liverpool lack usual spark\nLiverpool did not deserve anything from this display, its off-colour nature summed up by the manner of the two goals that gave Arsenal a victory they fully merited.\nJurgen Klopp's side were fortunate to go in level at half-time, having been presented with an equaliser no-one in the stadium saw coming, although there were signs early in the second half that they were in the mood to cash in on that gift.\nInstead, Arsenal's win was rubber-stamped by farcical defending that put the Gunners back in charge.\nVan Dijk was far too casual and seemed barely aware of Martinelli's presence as he went to deal with a routine long clearance, the situation not helped by Alisson's injudicious dash from goal and air-kick, leaving Arsenal's forward to complete the formalities.\nAfter Konate had been sent off, Trossard was allowed to run unchallenged before embarrassing Alisson once more with a low shot through the keeper's legs which completed a miserable match for the Brazilian.\nLiverpool have coped superbly with the absence of Mohamed Salah, away with Egypt at the Africa Cup Of Nations where he sustained a hamstring injury, but were crying out for his brilliance here as they failed to even mount the traditional surge that has been their trademark.\nThere is no need to panic for the Reds, who are still clear at the top of the table, but there will be real disappointment that they delivered such a poor performance in a game where they could conceivably have killed off Arsenal's title challenge."

Have your say here\nBailey also shone in a fluid Villa attack which repeatedly sliced open the hosts' defence with ease, the Jamaica forward displaying his quality in front of goal with a well-taken finish in a complete performance.\nVilla threatened to humiliate the hosts when Moreno made it five shortly after half-time, but that tally was enough to give Villa their biggest away win in the Premier League since April 2008 as Emery's side comfortably saw out victory.\n\"I'm happy because before the match we were very focused to react [to the Newcastle loss]. We scored goals, created chances and stopped them,\" Emery told BBC Sport.\n\"We have to try to focus each match. We're really happy. Our aggression was fantastic.\"\nDismal Blades outclassed and in trouble\nSheffield United were outclassed in every department and, on this evidence, appear destined for an immediate return to the Championship.\nIn Premier League history, the three previous teams to accumulate as few as 10 points at this stage of the season have all been relegated.\nThe Blades look increasingly likely to suffer the same fate. In desperate need of a rapid upturn in form, they instead suffered a significant setback here - not least to their belief.\nThey have won twice all season, are winless in seven league games, and have conceded the most goals of any side at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1965-66.\nThe seats were rapidly emptying inside 30 minutes, with loud boos at the full-time whistle. United have now lost 31 of their 40 most recent Premier League games under Wilder, who has overseen one win in eight games since he was reappointed in early December.\nWhat did you make of Sheff Utd's display? Send us your views here\nTheir only threatening spell arrived inside the closing 15 minutes, when Emiliano Martinez was forced to make a double save and Jack Robinson had an attempt headed off the line.\nBut there were few positives for Wilder, who made five changes from the midweek loss to Crystal Palace, and his players must now recover for a crucial trip to fellow promoted side Luton Town next weekend.\n\"We have to apologise to our supporters because they've been superb. We've let them down this evening,\" said Wilder.\n\"I don't think there's anything to take out of today's performance. Nothing at all. We've been well and truly pumped.\"",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nHodgson's side failed to create many openings of note and Palace's supporters once again expressed their frustration with the club ownership and management with banners calling for change.\nBrighton, who made five changes from the side who lost 4-0 to Luton in midweek, looked rejuvenated.\nThe intensity they showed on the pitch was matched by their manager, who picked up his third booking of the season while appealing against a decision, and so will have to watch their next game from the stands.\nDefeat for Hodgson puts Palace's form back under the microscope. While they defeated Sheffield United last Tuesday, they have won just four of their past 17 league matches.\nThe Palace boss will point to the fact that he did not have his best players, with Eberechi Eze not fit enough to be in the squad and Michael Olise limping off just 11 minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute.\nBrighton cruise to victory\nComing into this game, the Seagulls had only won three of their past 16 league matches.\nHowever, they are in a much better place than their rivals - in touch with the Premier League's European qualification spots, still in the FA Cup, and in the Europa League last 16.\nTheir football is a joy to watch, with De Zerbi is able to get the best out of the players in his squad.\nThey have an excellent blend of experience and youth, with 18-year-old Hinshelwood and 19-year-old Buonanotte both scoring.\nBrighton have a number of key players out injured but if they can get some of them back towards the end of the season, it could be an exciting time for the club.\nPressure continues to build on Hodgson\nAs far as Palace supporters are concerned, the manner of this heavy defeat against their biggest rivals puts Hodgson back under pressure.\nThe Eagles have won two of their past four Premier League games, but the two defeats in that sequence have been heavy - with a 5-0 loss at Arsenal before Brighton's convincing win.\nSupporters had already made their feelings known about the club's leadership with a banner during the defeat at Arsenal and there was another display of discontent at Amex Stadium.\nWithout Eze, who scored twice against Sheffield United on Tuesday, and with Olise only able to feature briefly, Palace were toothless in attack.\nFan feeling is far from positive, and given their poor results over the past four months, some may ask if the club will feel it's time to make a change.",

The manager has said what he has, I can't make other clubs come and get me. I'll just keep scoring goals.\"\nWith a Premier League goal ratio of one in two, and the kind of clinical finish here craved by the top sides in tight games, it feels the speculation of where he will be playing his football next season will only intensify.\nRare day when Wolves lack bite\nToney almost joined Wolves in 2014 only for the deal to reportedly fall through\n, external\nbecause of a failed medical.\nThey could have done with a striker with his cutting edge in this encounter given their impressive wide play but lack of penalty-box threat.\nIt should be noted, though, that Wolves have played much of the season without a recognised front man and, in truth, goals have not been that hard to come by without an out-and-out striker.\nIndeed, this was their first blank after finding the net in 18 consecutive home league games since February last year - their longest scoring streak since a run of 22 games in the 1960s.\nTheir cause was not helped by an injured Cunha - who had been involved in 12 goals in Wolves' past 12 league games before this one, scoring seven and setting up five. His hat-trick had helped Wolves to a 4-2 win at Chelsea last time out.\nWolves fans will be relieved that the early prognosis is positive.\n\"He felt something in his hamstring but it doesn't feel too bad now. He was a big loss today,\" O'Neil said.\nWith top-scorer Hwang Hee-chan not featuring, having just returned after the Asian Cup, the Wolves boss had few options to change the game once they fell behind.\nHe introduced rookie forward Nathan Fraser, with just seven minutes of Premier League football under his belt, at half-time.\nBut the 18-year-old struggled to make an impact with two chances for Neto - a header and low-angled shot against the post - their best efforts aside from Dawson's disallowed attempt.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Forest's display? Send us your views here\nAfter a dramatic 4-4 draw against Luton Town the previous weekend, Eddie Howe's side played out another thrilling game.\nNewcastle pulled off a clever short corner routine to go ahead in the 10th minute, with Kieran Tripper whipping a fierce ball to the back post where Guimaraes had timed his arrival to perfection to poke home the volley.\nThe atmosphere around the City Ground improved drastically when Morgan Gibbs-White threaded a well-weighted ball through the centre of the pitch and Elanga outpaced Newcastle's defenders to slot it past Martin Dubravka.\nIn a first half full of momentum shifts, Newcastle restored their lead as Schar met Sven Botman's header on the half-volley, firing it back across goal and into the bottom left corner.\nAgain Forest responded, with Hudson-Odoi's strike from 20 yards out taking a big deflection off Lewis Miley to wrong-foot Dubravka.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side may feel hard done by after referee Anthony Taylor waved away two penalty appeals, first for a light shove on Elanga by Anthony Gordon and then for Dubravka's outstretched arms bringing down Taiwo Awoniyi.\nForest pushed forward in search of a third equaliser, but a lack of a clinical finisher in front of goal cost them as they failed to make a single shot on target in the second half.\nGuimaraes shines to save Newcastle\nOne moment of brilliance from Guimaraes proved the difference for Newcastle and he was met with a huge roar from the away fans after full-time.\nThe Brazilian made a clever run into the box for his first, and he showed the same footballing intelligence for the winning goal - latching on to a loose pass from Elanga before looking up and perfectly picking out his spot in the Forest net.\nHowever, concerns will remain for Howe over his side's defensive record, having failed to keep a clean sheet since before Christmas.\nThe Newcastle boss was forced to defend Dan Burn earlier in the week, calling him \"Newcastle through and through\" after he came under scrutiny for his performance against Luton.\nAston Villa's Leon Bailey and Luton's Chiedozie Ogbene tormented the defender for speed in Newcastle's last two league outings and Elanga was able to target the same weakness here, peeling away from Burn for Forest's first equaliser.\nForest still searching for first league win of 2024\nForest find themselves in a perilous position in the Premier League, sitting 16th in the table with only a two-point safety cushion.\nThey may feel unlucky to have come away from Saturday's match without a point, having twice fought back from a goal down and pushing hard in the dying moments.\nPerhaps Wednesday's FA Cup fourth-round replay took it's toll, with Forest needing 120 minutes plus a penalty shootout to overcome Championship side Bristol City.\nBoth of Forest's two victories in 2024 have come in FA Cup replays, but they are still without a much-needed league win.\nNuno will be boosted by the imminent return of Ivory Coast trio Serge Aurier, Willy Boly and Ibrahim Sangare along with and Nigeria's Ola Aina, who are preparing to face one another in the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday.",

But he needed a striker's instinct to be in position to take advantage of Ollie Watkins' failure to react to the possibility of Maguire heading Bruno Fernandes deep corner into the danger zone.\nHojlund now has 11 goals in all competitions and is on the kind of run Marcus Rashford was last season as he propelled United towards the top four.\nAfter they dropped so many needless points over the first half of the campaign, it is going to take more than a single striker to steer them into next season's Champions League.\nMcTominay is certainly doing his bit. Two goals to turn what seemed like a defeat against Brentford on its head, two more - including the winner - against Chelsea, and now this.\nThe Scotland midfielder had all the desire needed to dominate Cash in their aerial duel. Villa boss Unai Emery's look of despair as the ball flew past Emi Martinez and into the roof of the net said everything about the importance of the goal.\nVilla connection\nWith just over 20 minutes to go, as the visitors got themselves into a tangle trying to play out from the back, Watkins set off on a sprint as the ball rolled back to Onana. As the United keeper deliberated, Watkins closed in. Onana hurriedly tried to clear, Watkins blocked it and the ball rolled out for a goal-kick. The Holte End erupted.\nIn terms of the actual game, it was a footnote, but the action and response to it said everything about the desire of the Villa players and their connection with the fans. That has not always been a given in recent times but the supporters are understandably responding positively to the team Emery has assembled.\nSuch has been United's dominance in recent meetings between the sides, Villa were attempting to record successive home league victories against them for the first time since 1977.\nHad Cameroon reached the Africa Cup of Nations semi-finals, and thus denied the visitors of Onana, they might well have got it. At times, it felt like he was a one-man blockade.\nJohn McGinn thought his vicious 20-yard effort was going in but Onana managed to tip it over the bar. Minutes later, the Villa skipper played Watkins in only for the goalkeeper to advance smartly to block at close range.\nLeon Bailey thought he had left Jacob Ramsey with only Onana to beat inside the box but somehow the youngster could not collect the pass and the ball rolled through to the United keeper. Onana even denied Clement Lenglet with a magnificent reaction save in the moments before Luiz finally found the target with an instinctive close-range effort.\nAt that point it seemed if anyone was going to win, it would be Villa.\nBut McTominay provided a sickening conclusion from their perspective. They have slipped out of the top four, and three home defeats in a row show Villa Park is no longer the fortress it has been for most of this season.\nThe fans are still with their team, though. And that could take them a long way.\nLife-and-death decisions on the frontline: The Bafta award-winning Ambulance returns to Greater Manchester\nHow is Irish stout made?

The manager has said what he has, I can't make other clubs come and get me. I'll just keep scoring goals.\"\nWith a Premier League goal ratio of one in two, and the kind of clinical finish here craved by the top sides in tight games, it feels the speculation of where he will be playing his football next season will only intensify.\nRare day when Wolves lack bite\nToney almost joined Wolves in 2014 only for the deal to reportedly fall through\n, external\nbecause of a failed medical.\nThey could have done with a striker with his cutting edge in this encounter given their impressive wide play but lack of penalty-box threat.\nIt should be noted, though, that Wolves have played much of the season without a recognised front man and, in truth, goals have not been that hard to come by without an out-and-out striker.\nIndeed, this was their first blank after finding the net in 18 consecutive home league games since February last year - their longest scoring streak since a run of 22 games in the 1960s.\nTheir cause was not helped by an injured Cunha - who had been involved in 12 goals in Wolves' past 12 league games before this one, scoring seven and setting up five. His hat-trick had helped Wolves to a 4-2 win at Chelsea last time out.\nWolves fans will be relieved that the early prognosis is positive.\n\"He felt something in his hamstring but it doesn't feel too bad now. He was a big loss today,\" O'Neil said.\nWith top-scorer Hwang Hee-chan not featuring, having just returned after the Asian Cup, the Wolves boss had few options to change the game once they fell behind.\nHe introduced rookie forward Nathan Fraser, with just seven minutes of Premier League football under his belt, at half-time.\nBut the 18-year-old struggled to make an impact with two chances for Neto - a header and low-angled shot against the post - their best efforts aside from Dawson's disallowed attempt."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Forest's display? Send us your views here\nAfter a dramatic 4-4 draw against Luton Town the previous weekend, Eddie Howe's side played out another thrilling game.\nNewcastle pulled off a clever short corner routine to go ahead in the 10th minute, with Kieran Tripper whipping a fierce ball to the back post where Guimaraes had timed his arrival to perfection to poke home the volley.\nThe atmosphere around the City Ground improved drastically when Morgan Gibbs-White threaded a well-weighted ball through the centre of the pitch and Elanga outpaced Newcastle's defenders to slot it past Martin Dubravka.\nIn a first half full of momentum shifts, Newcastle restored their lead as Schar met Sven Botman's header on the half-volley, firing it back across goal and into the bottom left corner.\nAgain Forest responded, with Hudson-Odoi's strike from 20 yards out taking a big deflection off Lewis Miley to wrong-foot Dubravka.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side may feel hard done by after referee Anthony Taylor waved away two penalty appeals, first for a light shove on Elanga by Anthony Gordon and then for Dubravka's outstretched arms bringing down Taiwo Awoniyi.\nForest pushed forward in search of a third equaliser, but a lack of a clinical finisher in front of goal cost them as they failed to make a single shot on target in the second half.\nGuimaraes shines to save Newcastle\nOne moment of brilliance from Guimaraes proved the difference for Newcastle and he was met with a huge roar from the away fans after full-time.\nThe Brazilian made a clever run into the box for his first, and he showed the same footballing intelligence for the winning goal - latching on to a loose pass from Elanga before looking up and perfectly picking out his spot in the Forest net.\nHowever, concerns will remain for Howe over his side's defensive record, having failed to keep a clean sheet since before Christmas.\nThe Newcastle boss was forced to defend Dan Burn earlier in the week, calling him \"Newcastle through and through\" after he came under scrutiny for his performance against Luton.\nAston Villa's Leon Bailey and Luton's Chiedozie Ogbene tormented the defender for speed in Newcastle's last two league outings and Elanga was able to target the same weakness here, peeling away from Burn for Forest's first equaliser.\nForest still searching for first league win of 2024\nForest find themselves in a perilous position in the Premier League, sitting 16th in the table with only a two-point safety cushion.\nThey may feel unlucky to have come away from Saturday's match without a point, having twice fought back from a goal down and pushing hard in the dying moments.\nPerhaps Wednesday's FA Cup fourth-round replay took it's toll, with Forest needing 120 minutes plus a penalty shootout to overcome Championship side Bristol City.\nBoth of Forest's two victories in 2024 have come in FA Cup replays, but they are still without a much-needed league win.\nNuno will be boosted by the imminent return of Ivory Coast trio Serge Aurier, Willy Boly and Ibrahim Sangare along with and Nigeria's Ola Aina, who are preparing to face one another in the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton' display? Send us your views here\nHaaland's wait is over\nHaaland's opening goal was his first for 419 minutes in the Premier League and ended his longest scoreless run in the competition, as well as his longest streak of unsuccessful shots - 17.\nHe had missed five league games and 10 in all competitions at the turn of the year while recovering from a stress fracture in his foot, but remained top of the scoring charts even before ending his mini-drought.\nIn his absence, City faltered at first but, since Christmas, they have begun to find their stride even without Haaland's goals. If he is back in the sort of form that saw him score 36 league goals last season, they will be even harder to stop.\nDe Bruyne's return from injury has also been a huge boost and he was the catalyst here after coming off the bench just before the hour mark.\nThe Belgian upped City's passing tempo and increased the pressure on Everton's tiring legs, punishing them at the end with the precise pass for his side's second goal.\nCalvert-Lewin's drought goes on\nEverton boss Sean Dyche, watching from the stands because of a touchline ban, must have been pleased with his side's efforts despite the result.\nHis gameplan worked perfectly for more than an hour but Everton's resistance could not last, and their cause was not helped by their failure to make the most of the few chances they created.\nIt meant they left Manchester without any reward for a battling performance, something Dyche has seen a lot of from his side this season.\nTheir high press forced some defensive errors from City in the first half, but the Toffees were let down by some wild finishing in front of goal.\nJack Harrison sliced one shot high and wide when a cross bounced into his path and Dominic Calvert-Lewin's weak chipped effort when he found himself in space was just as bad.\nWhile Haaland's drought is over, Calvert-Lewin has now gone 18 games without a goal and, until he finds his shooting boots, Everton's main attacking threat remains set-pieces - of which they had very few at Etihad Stadium.\nLife and death decisions on the frontline: The Bafta award-winning Ambulance returns to Greater Manchester\nHow is Irish stout made?

They know our injury problems and our team selection problems at the moment,\" Hodgson said.\n\"They also know there are some young players who are trying to find their way in the game. I would like to think they will take all those things into consideration.\n\"I don't know what people are thinking and what their attitude is going to be, but I do think that today the team gave their very best and did give the fair-minded supporter a chance to believe in this team and believe in this club as we go forward.\"\nThey remain 15th in the table and travel to Everton next Monday, before hosting Burnley."

They were thwarted on numerous occasions by United keeper Andre Onana, and despite the urgings of the home support were unable to draw level a second time.\nReaction to Aston Villa v Manchester United\n'They have momentum' - Man Utd 'hunting down' rivals\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester United's display? Send us your views here\nFive-star Hojlund\nIn the high-ability world of elite sport, confidence plays such a key part.\nWhen Hojlund lined up for the reverse fixture between these sides on 26 December, he was yet to score a league goal and his overall contribution was coming under major scrutiny.\nWind the clock forward seven weeks and the 21-year-old is the second youngest player in Premier League history to have scored in five successive games, behind only Nicolas Anelka.\nThe Dane had already passed up one opportunity, created for him by Alejandro Garnacho, when he was given another by Harry Maguire.\nThe finish was not a tricky one, with Hojlund unmarked and only six yards out. But he needed a striker's instinct to be in position to take advantage of Ollie Watkins' failure to react to the possibility of Maguire heading Bruno Fernandes deep corner into the danger zone.\nHojlund now has 11 goals in all competitions and is on the kind of run Marcus Rashford was last season as he propelled United towards the top four.\nAfter they dropped so many needless points over the first half of the campaign, it is going to take more than a single striker to steer them into next season's Champions League.\nMcTominay is certainly doing his bit. Two goals to turn what seemed like a defeat against Brentford on its head, two more - including the winner - against Chelsea, and now this.\nThe Scotland midfielder had all the desire needed to dominate Cash in their aerial duel. Villa boss Unai Emery's look of despair as the ball flew past Emi Martinez and into the roof of the net said everything about the importance of the goal.\nVilla connection\nWith just over 20 minutes to go, as the visitors got themselves into a tangle trying to play out from the back, Watkins set off on a sprint as the ball rolled back to Onana. As the United keeper deliberated, Watkins closed in. Onana hurriedly tried to clear, Watkins blocked it and the ball rolled out for a goal-kick. The Holte End erupted.\nIn terms of the actual game, it was a footnote, but the action and response to it said everything about the desire of the Villa players and their connection with the fans. That has not always been a given in recent times but the supporters are understandably responding positively to the team Emery has assembled.\nSuch has been United's dominance in recent meetings between the sides, Villa were attempting to record successive home league victories against them for the first time since 1977.\nHad Cameroon reached the Africa Cup of Nations semi-finals, and thus denied the visitors of Onana, they might well have got it. At times, it felt like he was a one-man blockade.\nJohn McGinn thought his vicious 20-yard effort was going in but Onana managed to tip it over the bar. Minutes later, the Villa skipper played Watkins in only for the goalkeeper to advance smartly to block at close range.\nLeon Bailey thought he had left Jacob Ramsey with only Onana to beat inside the box but somehow the youngster could not collect the pass and the ball rolled through to the United keeper. Onana even denied Clement Lenglet with a magnificent reaction save in the moments before Luiz finally found the target with an instinctive close-range effort.\nAt that point it seemed if anyone was going to win, it would be Villa.\nBut McTominay provided a sickening conclusion from their perspective. They have slipped out of the top four, and three home defeats in a row show Villa Park is no longer the fortress it has been for most of this season.\nThe fans are still with their team, though. And that could take them a long way.\nLife-and-death decisions on the frontline: The Bafta award-winning Ambulance returns to Greater Manchester\nHow is Irish stout made?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton' display? Send us your views here\nHaaland's wait is over\nHaaland's opening goal was his first for 419 minutes in the Premier League and ended his longest scoreless run in the competition, as well as his longest streak of unsuccessful shots - 17.\nHe had missed five league games and 10 in all competitions at the turn of the year while recovering from a stress fracture in his foot, but remained top of the scoring charts even before ending his mini-drought.\nIn his absence, City faltered at first but, since Christmas, they have begun to find their stride even without Haaland's goals. If he is back in the sort of form that saw him score 36 league goals last season, they will be even harder to stop.\nDe Bruyne's return from injury has also been a huge boost and he was the catalyst here after coming off the bench just before the hour mark.\nThe Belgian upped City's passing tempo and increased the pressure on Everton's tiring legs, punishing them at the end with the precise pass for his side's second goal.\nCalvert-Lewin's drought goes on\nEverton boss Sean Dyche, watching from the stands because of a touchline ban, must have been pleased with his side's efforts despite the result.\nHis gameplan worked perfectly for more than an hour but Everton's resistance could not last, and their cause was not helped by their failure to make the most of the few chances they created.\nIt meant they left Manchester without any reward for a battling performance, something Dyche has seen a lot of from his side this season.\nTheir high press forced some defensive errors from City in the first half, but the Toffees were let down by some wild finishing in front of goal.\nJack Harrison sliced one shot high and wide when a cross bounced into his path and Dominic Calvert-Lewin's weak chipped effort when he found himself in space was just as bad.\nWhile Haaland's drought is over, Calvert-Lewin has now gone 18 games without a goal and, until he finds his shooting boots, Everton's main attacking threat remains set-pieces - of which they had very few at Etihad Stadium.\nLife and death decisions on the frontline: The Bafta award-winning Ambulance returns to Greater Manchester\nHow is Irish stout made?

They know our injury problems and our team selection problems at the moment,\" Hodgson said.\n\"They also know there are some young players who are trying to find their way in the game. I would like to think they will take all those things into consideration.\n\"I don't know what people are thinking and what their attitude is going to be, but I do think that today the team gave their very best and did give the fair-minded supporter a chance to believe in this team and believe in this club as we go forward.\"\nThey remain 15th in the table and travel to Everton next Monday, before hosting Burnley."

Three of his nine efforts were from clear sights of goal but he squandered an early header from Julian Alvarez's cross, then miscued when Phil Foden set him up and missed the target from De Bruyne's pinpoint delivery.\nSome big decisions went against the home side too, with Kyle Walker certain he deserved a penalty after tangling with Sterling in the box, and a Levi Colwill handball going unpunished in stoppage time.\nThe video assistant referee ruled in Chelsea's favour on both occasions, to the obvious frustration of Guardiola, but it must be some consolation that his side still picked up a point.",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Fulham 1-2 Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins double helps Villa return to Premier League top four\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery called Ollie Watkins \"clinical\" and \"amazing\" after the Villa striker scored twice at Fulham to help his side return to the Premier League's top four.\nJacob Ramsey pinched the ball off Willian after a poor throw-in from Antonee Robinson and set up Watkins who slotted Villa into a 23rd-minute lead.\nAnd the England forward deservedly doubled his tally when he buried Youri Tielemans' through-ball just after the restart.\nThe hosts were gifted a way back into the match as Rodrigo Muniz capitalised on a mix-up between Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez and defender Clement Lenglet.\nMartinez was then called into two fine saves in second-half injury time, but Emery's side held on. They now sit fourth in the table after rivals Tottenham were beaten 2-1 by Wolves on Saturday.\n\"He [Watkins] worked for it,\" Emery told BBC Match of the Day. \"It was a very tough match for him as well and he was fighting with [Fulham defender] Issa Diop.\n\"He was clinical today and really amazing.\"\nHow did you rate Fulham's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Aston Villa's display? Send us your views here\nWatkins stars as Villa produce 'massive reaction'\nWatkins was superb at Craven Cottage and has now scored 18 goals in all competitions this season, while his statistics speak for themselves.\nHis 23 goal involvements in the top flight this season (13 goals and 10 assists in 25 games), is only bettered by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (24).\nAnd in terms of goal involvements for Villa, only Dwight Yorke (27 in 1995-96) can boast more in a single Premier League campaign.\nHis latest performance also ends a comparatively dry run where he managed just two goals in 10 matches before Saturday, having missed a number of chances in Villa's narrow defeat to Manchester United last time out.\n\"Personally I'm not dwelling on that and as a team we're not,\" Watkins told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"It's nice to get back on the scoresheet. It was a massive reaction to come here and win today.\"\nTwo points clear as form begins to turn\nIt is no secret that Aston Villa have not had the start to 2024 the club would have wanted.\nAfter missing out on a chance to go top of the Premier League on Boxing Day, Villa have lost four of their past 10 matches in all competitions, and had slipped down to fifth in the league table.\nThe visitors started brightly with Tielemans, in for the injured Boubacar Kamara, setting up Watkins, only for his goal to be ruled offside in the first two minutes.\nAfter the forward's opener, Leon Bailey struck the crossbar with a curling effort and Tielemans was denied by Fulham keeper Bernd Leno when through on goal.\nAlex Moreno also had a first-half headed finish ruled out for a tight offside, timing his run a fraction too early to meet Watkins' flick on.\n\"It's a very important win,\" Emery added to BBC Match of the Day. \"We are trying to push and be successful. Today was a match to show it, and they showed it.\"\nVilla, now two points clear of Tottenham in fifth, face Nottingham Forest at home in their next match next Saturday.\nMuniz impresses but 'sloppy' Fulham fall just short\nFulham were the creators of their own downfall at Craven Cottage, with manager Marco Silva admitting his side were far \"too sloppy\" in periods.\nRobinson's loose throw-in set up Villa's first, and poor defending enabled their second.\n\"We were punished by the mistakes we made,\" Silva told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We cannot concede goals the way we did it. We were too sloppy, we were too open in those moments.\"\nMinutes before the opener, Tim Ream had a goal disallowed for offside when he rounded the keeper after Joao Palhinha's flick-on.\nMuniz, who scored his fourth goal in three games, looked dangerous from crosses into the box and halved the deficit in the 63rd minute after Martinez and Lenglet hesitated following a low Robinson cross.\nBuoyed by that strike, Fulham pushed for an equaliser with Harry Wilson volleying wide and Alex Iwobi, back from Africa Cup of Nations action, having a shot saved by the feet of Martinez.\nAnd the Argentine goalkeeper made up for his earlier error, brilliantly racing off his line to deny former Villa forward Adama Traore in injury time.\nFulham, who are away to Manchester United in their next match, will be without Palhinha, who will now serve a two-match ban after picking up his 10th yellow card of the season."

It is huge setback for us in the approach to the overall game.\n\"I am torn, I am a competitor and I understand that it was a very, very strong challenge and the game has moved on.\"\n'The decision was right' - what they said\n\"The red card killed the game, killed our plan and killed everything we worked for,\" Sheffield United captain Anel Ahmedhodzic told BBC Match of the Day.\nAhmedhodzic said he did not think the red card was fair, although he did say he had not seen a replay of the incident.\nHolgate won the ball with his standing foot, but that was after he had caught Mitoma with his studs.\n\"He's obviously won the ball, but he's followed through,\" Brighton striker Welbeck told Sky Sports.\n\"It was one of those challenges where I did think it was a red card straight away.\"\nOn BBC Radio 5 Live former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson described it as \"a really bad tackle\" and added: \"I'm sure when Sheffield United fans get home and watch Match of the Day Two, they'll realise the decision was right.\"\nBrighton boss Roberto de Zerbi said he did not want to talk about the challenge.\nHolgate is the only player to have received a red card in each of the past three Premier League seasons.\nThe defender joined United in February after being recalled from his loan at Southampton earlier this season.\nBrighton enjoy record away win\nSunday's victory was only Brighton's second in the league in 2024, although they have won twice in the FA Cup, including a 5-2 triumph against United at Bramall Lane in the fourth round.\nEven before Holgate's dismissal De Zerbi's side were routinely carving forward.\nAdingra, back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, had a cross deflected off Ahmedhodzic and was narrowly kept out by a diving Foderingham.\nAt 2-0, Yasser Larouci twice cleared off the line for United - denying Mitoma and Gross from close range - while Foderingham also smartly kept out Welbeck and Mitoma.\nIt is Brighton's biggest win away from home in the top flight, and they have now scored four or more goals seven times in all competitions this season.\nDe Zerbi's seventh-placed team now face sides who are in the bottom half of the table in their next five games, starting with Everton next weekend.\nBlades miss chance to move off bottom\n\"It feels like we get one back and then we lose one,\" Wilder told Sky Sports.\nThe Blades boss was talking about Cameron Archer failing a fitness test before kick-off, but the point does also aptly sum up his side.\nAfter winning 3-1 at Luton last week, the visitors needed only a point to move off the foot of the table.\nBut as soon as they went a player down, a positive result looked unlikely.\nThey did almost level shortly after conceding, but James McAtee's shot after a mazy run was kept out by Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen, who was starting ahead of Jason Steele.\nAnd there was confusion surrounding Osborn's disallowed goal, which was first ruled out for a foul but then was ultimately chalked off for an offside after referee Stuart Attwell consulted the pitchside monitor.\nUnited travel to Wolves for their next league match on 25 February.",

Palace defender Richards' presence may have put him off but an in-form Calvert-Lewin would surely have converted the chance.\n52% of Everton's league goals this season have come from set pieces and it is no wonder with the aerial presence in their side.\nMcNeil provided the assist - his fifth of the season, more than any other Everton player - for Onana's header as one of his excellent crosses was finally converted.\nThe Toffees travel to Brighton on Saturday (15:00 GMT) as they look to end an eight-match winless run in the league."

It was a massive reaction to come here and win today.\"\nTwo points clear as form begins to turn\nIt is no secret that Aston Villa have not had the start to 2024 the club would have wanted.\nAfter missing out on a chance to go top of the Premier League on Boxing Day, Villa have lost four of their past 10 matches in all competitions, and had slipped down to fifth in the league table.\nThe visitors started brightly with Tielemans, in for the injured Boubacar Kamara, setting up Watkins, only for his goal to be ruled offside in the first two minutes.\nAfter the forward's opener, Leon Bailey struck the crossbar with a curling effort and Tielemans was denied by Fulham keeper Bernd Leno when through on goal.\nAlex Moreno also had a first-half headed finish ruled out for a tight offside, timing his run a fraction too early to meet Watkins' flick on.\n\"It's a very important win,\" Emery added to BBC Match of the Day. \"We are trying to push and be successful. Today was a match to show it, and they showed it.\"\nVilla, now two points clear of Tottenham in fifth, face Nottingham Forest at home in their next match next Saturday.\nMuniz impresses but 'sloppy' Fulham fall just short\nFulham were the creators of their own downfall at Craven Cottage, with manager Marco Silva admitting his side were far \"too sloppy\" in periods.\nRobinson's loose throw-in set up Villa's first, and poor defending enabled their second.\n\"We were punished by the mistakes we made,\" Silva told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We cannot concede goals the way we did it. We were too sloppy, we were too open in those moments.\"\nMinutes before the opener, Tim Ream had a goal disallowed for offside when he rounded the keeper after Joao Palhinha's flick-on.\nMuniz, who scored his fourth goal in three games, looked dangerous from crosses into the box and halved the deficit in the 63rd minute after Martinez and Lenglet hesitated following a low Robinson cross.\nBuoyed by that strike, Fulham pushed for an equaliser with Harry Wilson volleying wide and Alex Iwobi, back from Africa Cup of Nations action, having a shot saved by the feet of Martinez.\nAnd the Argentine goalkeeper made up for his earlier error, brilliantly racing off his line to deny former Villa forward Adama Traore in injury time.\nFulham, who are away to Manchester United in their next match, will be without Palhinha, who will now serve a two-match ban after picking up his 10th yellow card of the season.",

It would be hard to say there have been many better times at West Ham.\n\"Maybe they want something different. Maybe there would be managers who excite them more, but the one who is sitting here wins more.\n\"My response would be to say we are hurting really badly as a team and a manager because we have not had good results for five or six weeks.\n\"This year already we have beaten Tottenham, Man Utd, Chelsea, Arsenal. We must not forget there were good times not so long ago.\n\"We're sitting in a strong position - last season we were sitting near the bottom.\n\"It was only three years ago that we were Nottingham Forest and fighting relegation. We've moved on a long way from there.\"\nLucas Paqueta's absence is a significant blow, but West Ham fans will point to a squad that are among the strongest the club have had.\nMoyes knows the home game against Brentford is one he dare not lose.\nHudson-Odoi hits purple patch\nHudson-Odoi made his Chelsea debut in 2017 and was soon regarded as one of the Premier League's most exciting prospects - with Bayern Munich's interest in him proof of the potential he had shown.\nA full England debut followed against Montenegro in March 2019 but an Achilles tendon injury the following month stalled his progress.\nThe 23-year-old has not been a fixture in the Forest side since his transfer in the summer but his goal against West Ham was his third in consecutive games to suggest the forward is enjoying life under new Forest manager Nuno.\nAlong with the powerful Awoniyi and gifted playmaker Gibbs-White, Forest will have a fine attacking trio that is the envy of the bottom half of the table if Hudson-Odoi maintains this kind of form.\nAwoniyi was withdrawn with injury and if he is missing for any length of time, Forest will look to goals from the in-form Hudson-Odoi to ensure their top-flight status."

Send us your views here\nRitchie rescues fragile Newcastle\nManchester United's pursuit of Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth has dominated the headlines on Tyneside this week, with Howe saying on Friday that he wants a \"quick resolution\" to the issue.\nThe fear is that speculation over Ashworth, who was in attendance on Saturday, could have a destabilising effect on Howe's team as they seek an immediate route back into Europe this season.\nTwo wins and a draw from their previous three league games had lifted Newcastle back into the top seven, but they were indebted to goalkeeper Dubravka in the first half as their defence was repeatedly stretched by Bournemouth's attack.\nDubravka's luck deserted him for the visitors' opener, the Slovakia international losing his footing and gifting Solanke an easy tap-in - moments after Miguel Almiron had blazed over the crossbar for Newcastle.\nNewcastle's penalty was awarded following a lengthy review by the video assistant referee (VAR), which centred on whether Adam Smith's tug on Fabian Schar's shirt was inside the box and if the Switzerland international had been in an offside position.\nReferee Michael Salisbury eventually pointed to the spot and Gordon made no mistake, beating Neto low to his left.\nBournemouth remained a threat, however, and Semenyo's strike - the 12th goal Newcastle have conceded in their past four home matches - left the hosts staring at the prospect of a third home defeat in four top-flight games.\nBut Ritchie, who has been reduced to a bit-part player since Newcastle's Saudi Arabia-backed takeover in 2022, salvaged a point from close range.\nPositives for Bournemouth despite late blow\nDespite looking the more accomplished of the two teams early on, Bournemouth were given a huge let-off inside 10 minutes when Neto's attempted clearance struck the onrushing Gordon and bounced past his left-hand post.\nThey could have gone in front moments later, though, as Dubravka saved well from Marcus Tavernier before twice denying Solanke from close range.\nThere was an element of fortune about Solanke's opener but the striker's 14th league goal of the season was no less than Andoni Iraola's team deserved.\nThe Bournemouth boss was unhappy with the decision to award Newcastle a penalty soon afterwards, believing that Schar was offside - and interfering with play - while his shirt was being pulled by Smith.\n\"It's an offside position,\" Iraola told BBC Match of the Day. \"My player grabs him because he's offside and going to go for the ball.\n\"It's a very, very soft foul. At set-pieces, people grab players [all the time] and nobody's giving anything - but we have to accept it.\"\nBournemouth responded well to Gordon's effort, and Semenyo's fourth goal of the season left them on course for their first league double over Newcastle - but they could not see the game out.\nThe Cherries have now lost 19 points from winning positions in the top flight this season - only Brentford, with 26, have lost more.\nBournemouth host champions Manchester City on 24 February but, with matches against Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton in the next few weeks, Cherries fans will be confident of seeing their team return to winning ways sooner rather than later.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester City 1-0 Brentford: Erling Haaland scores as champions cut gap on leaders Liverpool\nErling Haaland scored a vital winner 19 minutes from time as Manchester City eventually broke Brentford's stubborn resistance to close within a point of the Premier League summit.\nWhat looked set to be a night of frustration at Etihad Stadium for Pep Guardiola's men turned on a moment of huge fortune.\nBrentford defender Kristoffer Ajer appeared to have the situation under control when Julian Alvarez played a pass into the visitors' half as City countered.\nBut as Haaland began the chase, Ajer slipped and could not regain his feet as the Norwegian sped past.\nThe 23-year-old kept his cool to beat Mark Flekken with a precise shot. It was Haaland's 22nd goal of the season and means he has now scored against every Premier League opponent he has faced.\nMore importantly, it secured a victory that took City above Arsenal into second spot and kept a record fourth consecutive title in their own hands given they still have to visit leaders Liverpool on 10 March.\nWhile the result was not exactly harsh on Brentford given City's dominance, the manner of it was unfortunate. Thomas Frank's side were much more organised than they were in the heavy defeat against Liverpool at the weekend.\nHowever, with six points from their past 11 games, they are only five points off the relegation zone and still searching for the sustained improvement that will get them away from trouble.\n'Haaland will shut your mouth' - Guardiola taunts journalists\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brentford's display? Send us your views here\nReaction to Manchester City v Brentford\nHaaland is back\nAfter failing to convert a succession of chances he would normally snaffle without a thought in the draw against Chelsea at the weekend, Haaland seemed like a man on a mission from the first whistle.\nIn the opening minutes he dropped deep to collect possession, overhit a pass to Alvarez, chased after it himself, then, as Brentford tried to play out, bullied Sergio Reguilon off the ball by the touchline before charging towards the edge of the box and driving in a shot that Flekken saved.\nNot long afterwards, the league's top scorer sent an acrobatic effort over the bar.\nWhile there may have been disappointment at not scoring on either occasion and understandable frustration at the limited number of sights at goal that followed as Brentford attempted to keep him quiet, there was always the sense that if anyone was going to break the deadlock it would be Haaland.\nPhil Foden, hat-trick hero when these sides met in west London a fortnight ago, had a chance but ballooned his shot over the bar after being set up by Bernardo Silva.\nSo it was down to Haaland. Ajer - and Brentford - were unlucky in how the Norwegian got through. But once it was striker versus goalkeeper, the outcome was inevitable.\nHaaland thought he had put City 2-0 up late on, but his close-range header was ruled out for offside against full-back Kyle Walker.\nHe is now two clear of Mo Salah in the Golden Boot standings. Whoever wins that personal battle will go a long way to deciding where the title ends up.\nBrentford frustrate Guardiola\nAbout half an hour into the game, after Brentford had again threatened the City goal, an audible grumble of anxiety rolled round the stadium.\nGuardiola responded with half a dozen exaggerated 'calm down' hand signals waved in the general direction of the supporters directly above him.\nBy half-time, he was the one needing to cool off as he spun on his heels and marched down the tunnel.\nThe City boss had become increasingly irritated at what he felt were Brentford's time-wasting tactics, which, surprisingly in the era of double-digit injury-time, only brought a couple of additional minutes to the opening period.\nIn addition to retrieving the ball for a Brentford throw, Guardiola's response to Flekken's delayed goal-kicks and Yoane Wissa going down to earn John Stones a booking was to have a couple of long stares at opposite number Frank, someone the City boss said in his programme notes he 'really respects', chunter at the fourth official and offer a frustrated wave at referee Darren England.\nIt could have been worse. Ivan Toney was inches away from finding the target after Reguilon nudged a free-kick into his path while Frank Onyeka brought a full-length save out of Ederson.\nAfter winning the corresponding fixture last season, Brentford's attempt to follow Manchester United as the only side to beat City in successive away games during Guardiola's time as manager was not fanciful.\nFor a brief moment at the start of the second half, as Onyeka led a break downfield, it seemed as though they would go in front, but he held on too long then ballooned his cross out for a throw on the other side of the pitch.\nBrentford didn't properly threaten again until the fifth minute of injury time when they won a corner, which Haaland cleared.\nIt really was his night."

At set-pieces, people grab players [all the time] and nobody's giving anything - but we have to accept it.\"\nBournemouth responded well to Gordon's effort, and Semenyo's fourth goal of the season left them on course for their first league double over Newcastle - but they could not see the game out.\nThe Cherries have now lost 19 points from winning positions in the top flight this season - only Brentford, with 26, have lost more.\nBournemouth host champions Manchester City on 24 February but, with matches against Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton in the next few weeks, Cherries fans will be confident of seeing their team return to winning ways sooner rather than later."

It's a tough place to come and we deserved to win.\n\"We knew we could get Hwang [Hee-chan] and Pedro in behind and we thought we could play through the press.

He made an impact as a substitute when setting up Brennan Johnson's stoppage-time winner in the 2-1 win over Brighton last weekend, so his selection was expected.\nWolves also recalled their own South Korean, Hwang, and he came in for the unfortunate Matheus Cunha.\nThe Brazilian forward, who has nine Premier League goals this season, suffered a significant hamstring injury in the 2-0 loss to Brentford and faces a lengthy absence.\nHwang should have got his 11th league goal of the campaign after only five minutes.\nSemedo's effort was parried by Guglielmo Vicario and, with the keeper still on the floor, the rebound fell to Hwang but he produced an awful attempt and fired over from six yards out with the goal gaping.\nSpurs had scored in each of their past 36 Premier League games but were off form in the first half with visiting goalkeeper Sa not having to make a save.\nWolves took a deserved lead through Gomes' first goal since he scored a late winner on his debut in the 2-1 win at Southampton on 11 February 2023, just after his \u00a315m move from Brazilian side Flamengo.\nThe goal also meant Spurs have only kept one clean sheet in their past 16 Premier League games and again tested the recovery powers of Postecoglou's side.\nThis was the eighth time in this campaign his team had conceded the first goal, although they had gone on to win four and draw twice in the seven previous occasions.\nSpurs had to improve in the second half and instantly did with Kulusevski's goal.\nBut a failure to add a second proved costly, as did an error from Yves Bissouma 25 yards out from the Wolves goal that led to the counter-attack which brought Gomes' winning goal.\n\"Both goals conceded are disappointing from our point of view,\" said Postecoglou. \"We paid the price for not being as concentrated or disciplined in our football.\n\"It wasn't through the lack of effort. We had them camped in their half and then they break and score the goal.\n\"You can't keep coming from behind and doing that every week. We needed to be better in the first half.\"",

It would be hard to say there have been many better times at West Ham.\n\"Maybe they want something different. Maybe there would be managers who excite them more, but the one who is sitting here wins more.\n\"My response would be to say we are hurting really badly as a team and a manager because we have not had good results for five or six weeks.\n\"This year already we have beaten Tottenham, Man Utd, Chelsea, Arsenal. We must not forget there were good times not so long ago.\n\"We're sitting in a strong position - last season we were sitting near the bottom.\n\"It was only three years ago that we were Nottingham Forest and fighting relegation. We've moved on a long way from there.\"\nLucas Paqueta's absence is a significant blow, but West Ham fans will point to a squad that are among the strongest the club have had.\nMoyes knows the home game against Brentford is one he dare not lose.\nHudson-Odoi hits purple patch\nHudson-Odoi made his Chelsea debut in 2017 and was soon regarded as one of the Premier League's most exciting prospects - with Bayern Munich's interest in him proof of the potential he had shown.\nA full England debut followed against Montenegro in March 2019 but an Achilles tendon injury the following month stalled his progress.\nThe 23-year-old has not been a fixture in the Forest side since his transfer in the summer but his goal against West Ham was his third in consecutive games to suggest the forward is enjoying life under new Forest manager Nuno.\nAlong with the powerful Awoniyi and gifted playmaker Gibbs-White, Forest will have a fine attacking trio that is the envy of the bottom half of the table if Hudson-Odoi maintains this kind of form.\nAwoniyi was withdrawn with injury and if he is missing for any length of time, Forest will look to goals from the in-form Hudson-Odoi to ensure their top-flight status.",

It was Haaland's 22nd goal of the season and means he has now scored against every Premier League opponent he has faced.\nMore importantly, it secured a victory that took City above Arsenal into second spot and kept a record fourth consecutive title in their own hands given they still have to visit leaders Liverpool on 10 March.\nWhile the result was not exactly harsh on Brentford given City's dominance, the manner of it was unfortunate. Thomas Frank's side were much more organised than they were in the heavy defeat against Liverpool at the weekend.\nHowever, with six points from their past 11 games, they are only five points off the relegation zone and still searching for the sustained improvement that will get them away from trouble.\n'Haaland will shut your mouth' - Guardiola taunts journalists\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brentford's display? Send us your views here\nReaction to Manchester City v Brentford\nHaaland is back\nAfter failing to convert a succession of chances he would normally snaffle without a thought in the draw against Chelsea at the weekend, Haaland seemed like a man on a mission from the first whistle.\nIn the opening minutes he dropped deep to collect possession, overhit a pass to Alvarez, chased after it himself, then, as Brentford tried to play out, bullied Sergio Reguilon off the ball by the touchline before charging towards the edge of the box and driving in a shot that Flekken saved.\nNot long afterwards, the league's top scorer sent an acrobatic effort over the bar.\nWhile there may have been disappointment at not scoring on either occasion and understandable frustration at the limited number of sights at goal that followed as Brentford attempted to keep him quiet, there was always the sense that if anyone was going to break the deadlock it would be Haaland.\nPhil Foden, hat-trick hero when these sides met in west London a fortnight ago, had a chance but ballooned his shot over the bar after being set up by Bernardo Silva.\nSo it was down to Haaland. Ajer - and Brentford - were unlucky in how the Norwegian got through. But once it was striker versus goalkeeper, the outcome was inevitable.\nHaaland thought he had put City 2-0 up late on, but his close-range header was ruled out for offside against full-back Kyle Walker.\nHe is now two clear of Mo Salah in the Golden Boot standings. Whoever wins that personal battle will go a long way to deciding where the title ends up.\nBrentford frustrate Guardiola\nAbout half an hour into the game, after Brentford had again threatened the City goal, an audible grumble of anxiety rolled round the stadium.\nGuardiola responded with half a dozen exaggerated 'calm down' hand signals waved in the general direction of the supporters directly above him.\nBy half-time, he was the one needing to cool off as he spun on his heels and marched down the tunnel.\nThe City boss had become increasingly irritated at what he felt were Brentford's time-wasting tactics, which, surprisingly in the era of double-digit injury-time, only brought a couple of additional minutes to the opening period.\nIn addition to retrieving the ball for a Brentford throw, Guardiola's response to Flekken's delayed goal-kicks and Yoane Wissa going down to earn John Stones a booking was to have a couple of long stares at opposite number Frank, someone the City boss said in his programme notes he 'really respects', chunter at the fourth official and offer a frustrated wave at referee Darren England.\nIt could have been worse. Ivan Toney was inches away from finding the target after Reguilon nudged a free-kick into his path while Frank Onyeka brought a full-length save out of Ederson.\nAfter winning the corresponding fixture last season, Brentford's attempt to follow Manchester United as the only side to beat City in successive away games during Guardiola's time as manager was not fanciful.\nFor a brief moment at the start of the second half, as Onyeka led a break downfield, it seemed as though they would go in front, but he held on too long then ballooned his cross out for a throw on the other side of the pitch.\nBrentford didn't properly threaten again until the fifth minute of injury time when they won a corner, which Haaland cleared.\nIt really was his night."

However, the on-loan Manchester City midfielder saw a tame first-half effort easily saved by Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa and he fizzed a second-half shot just wide of the bottom right corner.\nMcAtee's left-wing cross also provided Rhian Brewster with an opportunity to level, but the forward, who had already blazed well wide earlier on from a good position, was unable to turn his effort past Portugal goalkeeper Sa.\nHowever, Wilder would not have been pleased at the sight of two of his players - Vinicius Souza and Jack Robinson - squaring up and jostling each other during the first half.\nIt was a moment of embarrassment for the visitors, who remain eight points adrift of safety and appear to be seeing their slim survival prospects fade with each defeat.\nFollow reaction from Wolves v Sheffield United\nHow did you rate Wolves' performance?

We have to always be positive, and focus on each match.\"\nEmery's side moved 15 points clear of eighth-placed Newcastle, who can close the gap when they visit Arsenal at 20:00 GMT on Saturday.\nForest remain 16th, four points clear of the relegation zone.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action and reaction to Aston Villa v Nottingham Forest\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Forest's display? Send us your views here\nVilla get home form back on track\nVilla's charge into the Champions League places - and as possible title contenders a few weeks ago - has been based around an exemplary home record that saw them go 17 games unbeaten, winning 16.\nTheir slight drop-off in recent weeks has coincided with that run ending with successive defeats by Newcastle and Manchester United.\nThis win was earned in a rip-roaring opening half an hour where they consistently caused issues down their right wing.\nThe opener saw Bailey nip past Murillo, with his cross nutmegging Felipe and put on a plate for Watkins to tap home.\nBoth of Luiz's goals came down the same side, with Ramsey showing brilliant composure to pick out the Brazil midfielder and McGinn's cross pinpoint.\nThe three first-half goals mean Villa have now scored a league-high 27 in the opening period this season.\nEmery will be disappointed by both of the goals they conceded, with Niakhete and Gibbs-White allowed unchallenged efforts on their goal.\nHowever, with Europa Conference League football on the horizon again in a fortnight, he will be grateful for the gap his side are opening on their challengers.\n\"It was very important,\" Emery told Match of the Day.\n\"We adapted well at Sheffield United and Fulham after defeats at home, but we needed confidence here and a reaction. We are feeling very comfortable and confident at Villa Park.\n\"We played a really fantastic match in the first half and only the first 15 minutes of the second half we had some doubts, but we stayed calm and reacted well.\"\nEnforced change sees Forest exploited\nForest had picked up 10 points from the first eight games of Nuno Espirito Santo's tenure but they were blown away by Villa here.\nThey were forced into one change from their win over West Ham last weekend with Nuno Tavares missing out through injury, and Villa duly exploited centre-back Niakhete playing at left-back.\nHe was often out of position, dragging centre-backs Murillo and Felipe, who were both booked in the first half, wider.\nNuno was clearly furious with his side's first-half display, opting to make a triple switch at the break, and his team were better in the second period.\nAt 3-2 Forest had a big chance to equalise when Anthony Elanga went through on goal but dragged his effort wide of the target.\nBailey's goal came from efficient Villa pressing.\nForest have now scored 17 Premier League goals in Nuno's time in charge - the same as in the first 17 games of the season under Steve Cooper - and that is a positive heading into the final stretch of the season.\nHowever, their Premier League status may well depend on the outcome of the charge against the club for alleged breaches of profit and sustainability rules in their accounts for 2022-23.\n\"We started very bad, we conceded too easily. This is something we have to improve,\" Nuno told Match of the Day.\n\"It is too easy for the opponent to score. We are always able to score, so we need to balance these two parts of the game.\"",

We're all happy to wait until closer to the end of the season.\"\nAsked whether he wanted to be part of more big wins at London Stadium like on Monday night, he told Sky Sports: \"I'll not be going away, that's for sure.\n\"I enjoy it here, the club has been good to me. We have really enjoyed the football over the years. When you think we were a relegation team not so long ago and now we are up around Europe.\"\nWest Ham had not won a game in 2024 before Monday night, with their last fixture at London Stadium a 6-0 loss to Arsenal that saw hundreds of home fans leave at half-time.\nBut the Hammers responded in style as they went 2-0 up inside 10 minutes against the struggling Bees.\nBowen got his first goal in the fifth minute with a strike that went in off the post, before the England forward scored again two minutes later as he slotted in Vladimir Coufal's pass.\nNeal Maupay swiftly halved the deficit with a scooped finish, then Brentford had claims for a penalty waved away when Mohammed Kudus nudged Sergio Reguilon over inside the box.\nA nervous spell followed as Brentford threatened to level but Bowen headed home his third midway through the second half, much to the relief of the Hammers fans.\nEmerson capped a perfect night for West Ham, taking a touch before lashing a fantastic strike into the top corner from 25 yards, and although Yoane Wissa scored a second for Brentford it was not enough to deny the hosts victory.\nWest Ham move up to eighth in the Premier League while Brentford stay 16th, five points above the relegation zone.\n'Unplayable' Bowen will be 'in Southgate's mind', says Moyes\nRead reaction to Monday's game between West Ham and Brentford\nHow did you rate West Ham's performance?

It's an inconsistent season so far.\n\"These players have a fantastic mentality and work ethic but we didn't have a high enough performance today.\""

It's a tough place to come and we deserved to win.\n\"We knew we could get Hwang [Hee-chan] and Pedro in behind and we thought we could play through the press. We pretty much envisaged it how we got it.\n\"But we were more than just counter-attacking and when we had the ball we caused them loads of problems and kept missing chances. I was a little bit frustrated that we weren't more clinical but we kept going and kept threatening.\"\nSpurs began the day in fourth place, but Aston Villa's 2-1 win at Fulham saw them move above Ange Postecoglou's side.\nFollow live text and radio coverage of Saturday's Premier League games\nHow did you rate Spurs' performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Wolves' display? Send us your views here\nFor Tottenham, this result ended a five-game winning run at home in the league.\nWolves completed the double over Spurs, having beaten them 2-1 at Molineux in November, and briefly moved up to 10th in the table, only to drop back to 11th when Chelsea drew 1-1 at Manchester City in the late kick-off.\nSpurs unable to produce another winning comeback\nSpurs welcomed captain Son Heung-min into their starting line-up for the first time since he represented South Korea at the Asian Cup. He made an impact as a substitute when setting up Brennan Johnson's stoppage-time winner in the 2-1 win over Brighton last weekend, so his selection was expected.\nWolves also recalled their own South Korean, Hwang, and he came in for the unfortunate Matheus Cunha.\nThe Brazilian forward, who has nine Premier League goals this season, suffered a significant hamstring injury in the 2-0 loss to Brentford and faces a lengthy absence.\nHwang should have got his 11th league goal of the campaign after only five minutes.\nSemedo's effort was parried by Guglielmo Vicario and, with the keeper still on the floor, the rebound fell to Hwang but he produced an awful attempt and fired over from six yards out with the goal gaping.\nSpurs had scored in each of their past 36 Premier League games but were off form in the first half with visiting goalkeeper Sa not having to make a save.\nWolves took a deserved lead through Gomes' first goal since he scored a late winner on his debut in the 2-1 win at Southampton on 11 February 2023, just after his \u00a315m move from Brazilian side Flamengo.\nThe goal also meant Spurs have only kept one clean sheet in their past 16 Premier League games and again tested the recovery powers of Postecoglou's side.\nThis was the eighth time in this campaign his team had conceded the first goal, although they had gone on to win four and draw twice in the seven previous occasions.\nSpurs had to improve in the second half and instantly did with Kulusevski's goal.\nBut a failure to add a second proved costly, as did an error from Yves Bissouma 25 yards out from the Wolves goal that led to the counter-attack which brought Gomes' winning goal.\n\"Both goals conceded are disappointing from our point of view,\" said Postecoglou. \"We paid the price for not being as concentrated or disciplined in our football.\n\"It wasn't through the lack of effort. We had them camped in their half and then they break and score the goal.\n\"You can't keep coming from behind and doing that every week. We needed to be better in the first half.\"",

I don't think it was our best performance but it was OK for the start.\n\"We can build up our ideas, we can work and it's also important to stay humble now. We know it was a very good performance but they could also see many things we could improve and we will continue working on it.\"\nRelive Saturday's Premier League action\nGlasner makes instant impact\nIt's the first time that Glasner has taken charge of a team midway through a season and in his pre-match press conference he said supporters would see changes step by step.\nHowever, this win will give them a lot of hope for what is to come.\nThe Austrian only had three training sessions prior to the meeting with the Clarets but you could see the subtle tweaks he has made in that short time.\nThe Eagles tried a couple of well-worked short corners and changed the takers each side with Lerma going close on one occasion.\nPalace had played with a three-man defence at Everton on Monday night and Glasner has favoured a similar formation at his other clubs.\nGlasner said that Eberechi Eze should be back with the squad next week and he will hope he is the first of Palace's key players to come back to fitness, with Marc Guehi and Michael Olise still in the treatment room.\nThe 49-year-old's double change of Franca and Naouirou Ahamada paid off, with the former creating the last two Palace goals.\nSome felt Franca, signed in summer for a potential \u00a322m, should have been given more game time under previous boss Roy Hodgson and his cameo in this match serves as a positive start for him under the new manager.\nPalace were somewhat lucky to keep a clean sheet when Datro Fofana's late goal was ruled out for offside but Glasner will be delighted with what he saw from his side.\nBurnley cause their own problems\nAfter the defeat by Palace, the Clarets are now eight points from safety in the Premier League as they sit in 19th position.\nPalace were struggling to create any clear-cut chances against Vincent Kompany's side and arguably their best opportunities in the first half came through Burnley's own mistakes.\nCharlie Taylor's volleyed back pass almost caught Trafford out before the Burnley goalkeeper's pass to Brownhill put him under severe pressure and led to him being sent off.\n\"It's difficult to play in a game of this magnitude and it's really not something we could afford today, and it happened, and then after that it's difficult to summarise what we've seen today,\" Kompany said of the red card.\n\"It's one of them where you've got to pick yourself up again, because this one hurts, but the overall riding disappointment is on the fact that we had such a key event in a game where we couldn't afford it.\"\nIt was an uphill battle for Burnley after going down to 10 men and they will have to produce something special to climb out of the relegation zone.\nThey have now conceded 58 goals and scored just 25 in what is proving to be a difficult season back in the top flight."

When you think we were a relegation team not so long ago and now we are up around Europe.\"\nWest Ham had not won a game in 2024 before Monday night, with their last fixture at London Stadium a 6-0 loss to Arsenal that saw hundreds of home fans leave at half-time.\nBut the Hammers responded in style as they went 2-0 up inside 10 minutes against the struggling Bees.\nBowen got his first goal in the fifth minute with a strike that went in off the post, before the England forward scored again two minutes later as he slotted in Vladimir Coufal's pass.\nNeal Maupay swiftly halved the deficit with a scooped finish, then Brentford had claims for a penalty waved away when Mohammed Kudus nudged Sergio Reguilon over inside the box.\nA nervous spell followed as Brentford threatened to level but Bowen headed home his third midway through the second half, much to the relief of the Hammers fans.\nEmerson capped a perfect night for West Ham, taking a touch before lashing a fantastic strike into the top corner from 25 yards, and although Yoane Wissa scored a second for Brentford it was not enough to deny the hosts victory.\nWest Ham move up to eighth in the Premier League while Brentford stay 16th, five points above the relegation zone.\n'Unplayable' Bowen will be 'in Southgate's mind', says Moyes\nRead reaction to Monday's game between West Ham and Brentford\nHow did you rate West Ham's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brentford's display? Send us your views here\nBowen delivers much-needed win for Moyes\nAs well as last year's success in Europe, Moyes has regularly had his side battling in the top half of the table, but he has come under pressure recently following a run of poor results.\nThe 6-0 loss to Arsenal was followed by a 2-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest, which led to some fans holding up banners calling for him to go.\n, external\nIt prompted Moyes to defend his record at the club, but there is no doubt he needed a positive result and performance against Brentford to avoid further calls for his departure.\nHe could hardly have hoped for a better outcome, and had Bowen to thank for that.\nThe former Hull City attacker has been deployed more as a striker under Moyes this season and has responded with his best scoring form in the Premier League, with this treble taking him on to 14 goals in the Premier League this season.\nLoss leaves Brentford looking over shoulder\nLike West Ham, Brentford's recent form has been poor, with just two wins in their past 11 Premier League games before this defeat.\nThey dropped a place on Monday without kicking a ball after Everton's penalty for breaching Premier League financial rules was reduced from 10 points to six after an appeal, moving the Toffees above Thomas Frank's side.\nBrentford are five points above the relegation zone but could not have got off to a worse start in their bid to claim a much-needed win with the two early West Ham goals.\nThey did improve after Maupay got a goal back but another two quickfire strikes after the break ended their hopes of a fightback and leaves them nervously looking over their shoulder.\nIt does not get any easier for Brentford with Chelsea at home and Arsenal away over the next two Saturdays.\n\"The frustration is we performed badly overall,\" said Bees boss Frank.\n\"It seems after a very good performance against Manchester City, it's two steps back again. It's an inconsistent season so far.\n\"These players have a fantastic mentality and work ethic but we didn't have a high enough performance today.\"",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Man City 1-1 Chelsea: Late Rodri strike rescues a point for City\nRodri dramatically rescued a point with a late leveller for Manchester City to deny Chelsea victory and maintain his side's long unbeaten home record.\nCity still lost ground in the title race after seeing Liverpool and Arsenal both post emphatic wins earlier on Saturday, but this has to go down as a point gained given how close they came to defeat.\nRaheem Sterling gave Chelsea the lead against his old team just before half-time, finishing off a brilliant counter-attack by meeting Nicolas Jackson's cross, cutting inside Kyle Walker and curling his shot home.\nThe visitors looked threatening on the break all game, with Jackson earlier spurning an even better chance from Malo Gusto's cross when a heavy touch allowed Ederson to smother his shot, and City's keeper also denied Sterling a second from point-blank range.\nCity were racking up the chances too, but seemed unable to take any of them, or even seriously test Chelsea goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic despite piling on the pressure in the second half.\nErling Haaland was the main culprit, with his worst miss coming when he somehow headed wide from a delicious Kevin de Bruyne cross.\nThe defending champions were facing their first home league defeat since November 2022, until Rodri struck with seven minutes to go.\nAfter Walker's shot was deflected into his path on the edge of the box, Rodri fired in a ferocious first-time strike that was going in anyway but took a touch off Chelsea substitute Trevoh Chalobah on its way into the net.\nThe draw sees City drop to third in the table, four points behind leaders Liverpool but with a game in hand - they can close the gap, and leapfrog second-placed Arsenal, if they beat Brentford here on Tuesday.\nChelsea, who were minutes away from a third successive away win, stay 10th, but head to Wembley for next weekend's Carabao Cup final on the back of one of their best displays of an erratic campaign.\nSaka scores twice as ruthless Arsenal thrash Burnley\nSalah scores on return as Liverpool beat Brentford\nReaction from Man City v Chelsea and all Saturday's Premier League games\n'My responsibility' that Palmer left City - Guardiola\nChelsea's defiance not enough for victory\nThis game did not have the goals or indeed the chaos of the 4-4 draw that these sides fought out in November, but Chelsea's resistance, and threat on the break, made for another enthralling encounter.\nJust as at Stamford Bridge, it was mostly played in appalling weather - and Mauricio Pochettino's side were again good value for their point in the pouring rain.\nCity had most of the ball from the start, but Chelsea's plan to spring forward when they won it back worked on several occasions even before they broke the deadlock.\nSterling, who won four Premier League titles in his seven years at the Etihad, was often criticised for his finishing during his time with City, but he showed great composure to beat Walker and made no mistake when he fired past Ederson too.\nThe England forward was unlucky not to make it 2-0 after the break, when he met Gusto's cross from the right, but this time Ederson reacted brilliantly to keep the ball out.\nChelsea were far less of a threat in the closing stages but defensive organisation and sheer will looked like it would carry them home for the three points, before City's determination and desperation eventually told.\nCity struggle to convert their chances\nPep Guardiola's side were caught cold defensively too often in the first half, but after the break they assumed more control and poured forward in search of an equaliser.\nCity had 31 attempts at scoring but, until Rodri's late strike, it appeared this would be a day where even a single goal would elude them.\nHaaland, in particular, will wonder how he failed to score. Three of his nine efforts were from clear sights of goal but he squandered an early header from Julian Alvarez's cross, then miscued when Phil Foden set him up and missed the target from De Bruyne's pinpoint delivery.\nSome big decisions went against the home side too, with Kyle Walker certain he deserved a penalty after tangling with Sterling in the box, and a Levi Colwill handball going unpunished in stoppage time.\nThe video assistant referee ruled in Chelsea's favour on both occasions, to the obvious frustration of Guardiola, but it must be some consolation that his side still picked up a point."

I don't think it was our best performance but it was OK for the start.\n\"We can build up our ideas, we can work and it's also important to stay humble now. We know it was a very good performance but they could also see many things we could improve and we will continue working on it.\"\nRelive Saturday's Premier League action\nGlasner makes instant impact\nIt's the first time that Glasner has taken charge of a team midway through a season and in his pre-match press conference he said supporters would see changes step by step.\nHowever, this win will give them a lot of hope for what is to come.\nThe Austrian only had three training sessions prior to the meeting with the Clarets but you could see the subtle tweaks he has made in that short time.\nThe Eagles tried a couple of well-worked short corners and changed the takers each side with Lerma going close on one occasion.\nPalace had played with a three-man defence at Everton on Monday night and Glasner has favoured a similar formation at his other clubs.\nGlasner said that Eberechi Eze should be back with the squad next week and he will hope he is the first of Palace's key players to come back to fitness, with Marc Guehi and Michael Olise still in the treatment room.\nThe 49-year-old's double change of Franca and Naouirou Ahamada paid off, with the former creating the last two Palace goals.\nSome felt Franca, signed in summer for a potential \u00a322m, should have been given more game time under previous boss Roy Hodgson and his cameo in this match serves as a positive start for him under the new manager.\nPalace were somewhat lucky to keep a clean sheet when Datro Fofana's late goal was ruled out for offside but Glasner will be delighted with what he saw from his side.\nBurnley cause their own problems\nAfter the defeat by Palace, the Clarets are now eight points from safety in the Premier League as they sit in 19th position.\nPalace were struggling to create any clear-cut chances against Vincent Kompany's side and arguably their best opportunities in the first half came through Burnley's own mistakes.\nCharlie Taylor's volleyed back pass almost caught Trafford out before the Burnley goalkeeper's pass to Brownhill put him under severe pressure and led to him being sent off.\n\"It's difficult to play in a game of this magnitude and it's really not something we could afford today, and it happened, and then after that it's difficult to summarise what we've seen today,\" Kompany said of the red card.\n\"It's one of them where you've got to pick yourself up again, because this one hurts, but the overall riding disappointment is on the fact that we had such a key event in a game where we couldn't afford it.\"\nIt was an uphill battle for Burnley after going down to 10 men and they will have to produce something special to climb out of the relegation zone.\nThey have now conceded 58 goals and scored just 25 in what is proving to be a difficult season back in the top flight.",

We have to always be positive, and focus on each match.\"\nEmery's side moved 15 points clear of eighth-placed Newcastle, who can close the gap when they visit Arsenal at 20:00 GMT on Saturday.\nForest remain 16th, four points clear of the relegation zone.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action and reaction to Aston Villa v Nottingham Forest\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Forest's display? Send us your views here\nVilla get home form back on track\nVilla's charge into the Champions League places - and as possible title contenders a few weeks ago - has been based around an exemplary home record that saw them go 17 games unbeaten, winning 16.\nTheir slight drop-off in recent weeks has coincided with that run ending with successive defeats by Newcastle and Manchester United.\nThis win was earned in a rip-roaring opening half an hour where they consistently caused issues down their right wing.\nThe opener saw Bailey nip past Murillo, with his cross nutmegging Felipe and put on a plate for Watkins to tap home.\nBoth of Luiz's goals came down the same side, with Ramsey showing brilliant composure to pick out the Brazil midfielder and McGinn's cross pinpoint.\nThe three first-half goals mean Villa have now scored a league-high 27 in the opening period this season.\nEmery will be disappointed by both of the goals they conceded, with Niakhete and Gibbs-White allowed unchallenged efforts on their goal.\nHowever, with Europa Conference League football on the horizon again in a fortnight, he will be grateful for the gap his side are opening on their challengers.\n\"It was very important,\" Emery told Match of the Day.\n\"We adapted well at Sheffield United and Fulham after defeats at home, but we needed confidence here and a reaction. We are feeling very comfortable and confident at Villa Park.\n\"We played a really fantastic match in the first half and only the first 15 minutes of the second half we had some doubts, but we stayed calm and reacted well.\"\nEnforced change sees Forest exploited\nForest had picked up 10 points from the first eight games of Nuno Espirito Santo's tenure but they were blown away by Villa here.\nThey were forced into one change from their win over West Ham last weekend with Nuno Tavares missing out through injury, and Villa duly exploited centre-back Niakhete playing at left-back.\nHe was often out of position, dragging centre-backs Murillo and Felipe, who were both booked in the first half, wider.\nNuno was clearly furious with his side's first-half display, opting to make a triple switch at the break, and his team were better in the second period.\nAt 3-2 Forest had a big chance to equalise when Anthony Elanga went through on goal but dragged his effort wide of the target.\nBailey's goal came from efficient Villa pressing.\nForest have now scored 17 Premier League goals in Nuno's time in charge - the same as in the first 17 games of the season under Steve Cooper - and that is a positive heading into the final stretch of the season.\nHowever, their Premier League status may well depend on the outcome of the charge against the club for alleged breaches of profit and sustainability rules in their accounts for 2022-23.\n\"We started very bad, we conceded too easily. This is something we have to improve,\" Nuno told Match of the Day.\n\"It is too easy for the opponent to score. We are always able to score, so we need to balance these two parts of the game.\""

However, the on-loan Manchester City midfielder saw a tame first-half effort easily saved by Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa and he fizzed a second-half shot just wide of the bottom right corner.\nMcAtee's left-wing cross also provided Rhian Brewster with an opportunity to level, but the forward, who had already blazed well wide earlier on from a good position, was unable to turn his effort past Portugal goalkeeper Sa.\nHowever, Wilder would not have been pleased at the sight of two of his players - Vinicius Souza and Jack Robinson - squaring up and jostling each other during the first half.\nIt was a moment of embarrassment for the visitors, who remain eight points adrift of safety and appear to be seeing their slim survival prospects fade with each defeat.\nFollow reaction from Wolves v Sheffield United\nHow did you rate Wolves' performance?

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Arsenal 4-1 Newcastle United: Hosts record their sixth consecutive Premier League win\nArsenal underlined their Premier League title credentials as they recorded their sixth consecutive win with a dominant display against Newcastle.\nThe result sees Mikel Arteta's side sit two points behind leaders Liverpool and a point behind second-placed Manchester City at the top of the table.\nThe outcome of this contest appeared inevitable from the moment visiting defender Sven Botman turned the ball in after Gabriel's header from a corner had been well saved by Newcastle goalkeeper Loris Karius.\nWhile there was an element of bad luck to that for the Dutch defender, who simply could not get out of the way as his Newcastle team-mate Tino Livramento tried to clear, there was little else about Arsenal's performance that was owed to good fortune.\nThe Gunners' intensity and fluent passing repeatedly carved Eddie Howe's side apart, particularly down the Magpies' left flank with Livramento and Botman enduring difficult evenings.\nKai Havertz swept in a deserved second shortly after, with Gabriel Martinelli making the most of indecision in the Newcastle defence to cut the ball back into the German forward's path.\nWith Arsenal continuing to press, Bukayo Saka twisted and turned Livramento one way and then another before dispatching a left-foot shot into the bottom left corner add to the hosts' advantage.\nArteta also enjoyed the luxury of being able to take off his captain Martin Odegaard, Havertz and Saka well before full-time after Jakub Kiwior's effort deflected past the helpless Karius from another Declan Rice corner.\nNewcastle, who remain eighth in the table, managed a late consolation courtesy of Joe Willock's looping header, but there was little else for the visiting supporters to cheer.\nReaction as Arsenal thrash Newcastle\nArsenal look real deal this time around\nBy this stage last term Arsenal's title challenge had already begun to implode, with defeats by Everton and City sandwiched either side of a home draw against Brentford.\nIn the end they finished five points behind Pep Guardiola's side, having enjoyed an eight-point advantage towards the end of January.\nHowever, while their early-season form has not been as impressive this time around, they look to be peaking nicely for the run-in.\nAn outstanding sequence of results since January has included a deserved victory over Liverpool, and they have now scored 25 goals and conceded just three times in six matches in the English top flight.\nNot only are they playing with the swagger of early last season, there seems to be a new resilience to this Arsenal team that has perhaps not been evident since their last title triumph in 2004.\nAt times in the intervening period, Arsenal have been notably targeted aerially by other Premier League sides at corners and free-kicks.\nHowever, Arteta has a physically imposing side - with the likes of Gabriel, Ben White, Kiwior and William Saliba all capable in the air - and no side has scored more set-piece goals than the Gunners' 19 this term.\nNewcastle struggle to stem tide\nIllness meant Martin Dubravka was absent in goal for Newcastle but there was very little Karius could do, almost 12 months on from his last appearance for the Magpies in their Carabao Cup final defeat by Manchester United.\nThe German goalkeeper made several saves as those in front of him struggled badly to stem the tide of Arsenal attacks.\nBasic mistakes saw them concede possession in dangerous areas and the likes of Bruno Guimaraes, Sean Longstaff and Lewis Miley fought to make an impact in midfield.\nSuch was Arsenal's control, the visitors failed to record a single shot during the first period of a top-flight game since March 2014.\nWhile the introductions of Willock, Harvey Barnes and Jacob Murphy in particular appeared to inject energy into a laboured performance, on this evidence there is a significant gulf in class which Howe's side needs to bridge to be on a level with the sides competing for the title."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Man City 3-1 Man Utd: Phil Foden scores twice as home side come back to win Manchester derby\nPep Guardiola hailed Phil Foden as the \"best player in the Premier League right now\" after his second-half double ensured Manchester City came from behind to beat Manchester United at Etihad Stadium.\nIn a game packed with international stars, it was two local boys who provided the key moments.\nThe visitors had led through Marcus Rashford's sensational eighth-minute strike from 30 yards.\nHowever, in a contest City dominated, Foden took centre stage.\nThere was an element of controversy over his second-half equaliser. United boss Erik ten Hag was booked for arguing his side should have had a free-kick in the City half when Rashford went down under Kyle Walker's challenge.\nContact was minimal and within seconds Foden had curled a superb shot past Andre Onana.\nFoden then burst away from a static Casemiro to score City's second from Julian Alvarez's return pass before Erling Haaland rounded off the scoring in stoppage time, after the Norwegian earlier missed an open goal from barely three yards.\n\"It is the amount of games he is playing,\" Guardiola told Match of the Day about Foden.\n\"He was always a talented player but now he is more mature and understands more the game, especially defensively. He can play middle, right, make moments and cut inside, play in the left, scoring from the left.\n\"What can I say? He is the best player in the Premier League right now for the amount of things he does. Unbelievable.\"\nHow Foden became Guardiola's 'go-to man'\nIt was City's sixth win in seven meetings against United, who suffered their 11th Premier League defeat of the season.\nMore importantly, the result means Pep Guardiola's side move to within a point of leaders Liverpool before next week's trip to Anfield.\nUnited remain in sixth in the table but are now 11 points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa and six behind Tottenham, in what could turn out to be a fifth Champions League spot, having played a game more.\nMan Utd still fighting for Champions League - Ten Hag\nPremier League title race run-in: Will Liverpool, Manchester City or Arsenal come out on top?\nFoden's class stands out\nThere was something fitting about Stockport-born Foden becoming the match winner.\nIt seems a long time ago now that Guardiola was having to defend his treatment of a player he was accused of be holding back while contemporary Jadon Sancho was excelling at Borussia Dortmund having decided he would not wait to develop at City.\nThe contrast in current fortunes for the two players could not be more marked, with United outcast Sancho back on loan at Dortmund.\nFoden's equaliser was City's 600th goal in this stadium under Guardiola and was a sublime effort, curled into the top corner out of Onana's reach after he had run across Victor Lindelof on the right edge of the United box.\nHis second saw him burst into the area from the other side, collect a pass from Julian Alvarez and drill a low shot home, almost through the United keeper, who might have done better.\nFoden is now picking his moments to get involved in attacks and watching England boss Gareth Southgate must surely find a way of getting the 23-year-old, who has scored 18 goals this season, into his starting line-up at Euro 2024 alongside the likes of Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham.\nHaaland will have been pleased to get his name on the scoresheet given his incredible first-half miss when he somehow put Foden's knock-back over an open goal from three yards.\n\"He was disappointed, I was disappointed. I want him to score four or five goals every game like he did against Luton [in the FA Cup],\" said Guardiola.\n\"But I don't care. He can miss this one, it is the reaction. He is sad for 10 seconds and he can miss five more and is sad for 10 seconds in his mind but after that erase it and on to the next one.\n\"The great, great players I met, and I've been fortunate as a player and especially a manager, they have this incredible ability to forget in an instant.\n\"Tennis players, golf players, basketball players, when they miss, and everyone misses, they say 'OK', smile, be positive and go for the next. That defines the great players and he did it.\"\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester United's display? Send us your views here\nRashford on target but United well beaten\nIn the build-up to the game, Rashford spoke extensively to Players' Tribune, detailing his journey through poverty to United's first team and underlining how much the club means to him.\nIt was thought-provoking stuff and very personal.\nYet, for a sizeable number of fans who have viewed Rashford's efforts this season through the prism of underperformance, a lack of goal threat and a body language of indifference, the words meant nothing. For them the general reaction was 'save it for the pitch'.\nTo that end, it is quite possible Rashford will never score a better goal than his eighth-minute opener.\nBruno Fernandes did well to hold off Ruben Dias to control Onana's booming kick downfield. Then, as Scott McTominay sprinted into the area, Fernandes had the vision and intelligence to wait for Rashford coming behind.\nHe rolled a pass perfectly to the England striker, who did not have to break stride as he launched a shot into the City net off the underside of the bar.\nRashford could easily have had another but, in attempting to control a bouncing ball as Fernandes lifted a pass towards him beyond a static home defence, he succeeded only in heading it into the ground, which allowed Kyle Walker to get back and snuff out the danger.\nThat turned out to be United's last realistic opportunity as they attempted to repel wave after wave of City attacks.\nTen Hag simply did not have the personnel to complete the task, as hard as his players tried.\nNew co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to knock City off their perch. On this evidence, he is going to need a pretty long ladder to attempt that.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Everton 1-3 West Ham: Tomas Soucek and Edson Alvarez secure dramatic late victory\nTomas Soucek struck a stylish half-volley as West Ham scored twice in injury time to clinch a dramatic win at Everton.\nThe Blues had taken the lead when Beto - who had seen a first-half penalty saved - headed in at the back post shortly after half-time.\nKurt Zouma equalised for the Hammers with a header from a corner.\nThe game looked set to end in a draw but Soucek scored a stunning goal with his instep in added time before Edson Alvarez struck right at the end.\nIt gave David Moyes, who managed Everton from 2002 to 2013, a hat-trick of Goodison Park victories over his old club as Hammers boss.\nEverton xG 'through the roof' but Dyche frustrated\nMoyes' side move up to seventh in the the Premier League table while Everton are 16th - five points above the relegation zone.\nThe Toffees are also winless in 10 games, stretching back to a 2-0 victory over Burnley on 16 December.\nWith five draws and two defeats in 2024, this is their joint-longest winless run from the start of a calendar year in their league history.\nBeto miss costly as Blues pay for lack of cutting edge\nThis was Everton's first game since their 10-point deduction for breaching Premier League financial rules was reduced to six on appeal.\nHowever, there remains a degree of anxiety around a separate charge - along with Nottingham Forest - for alleged breaches in their accounts for 2022-23.\nThat case must be heard by 8 April - but any appeal could take that process to 24 May, the week after the season has concluded.\nIf Everton are to render the impact of another potential deduction irrelevant, in terms of maintaining their top-flight status, they simply need to become more clinical in front of goal as the business end of the season looms.\nFor all their defensive improvements under Sean Dyche, their lack of cutting edge up front was again apparent.\nDyche dropped the misfiring Dominic Calvert-Lewin after a run of 20 games without a goal in favour of Beto.\nThe Portuguese striker, signed for \u00a330m from Udinese last August, offered a willingness but lacked finesse and composure at the crucial moments.\nThat was most apparent when Everton were awarded a penalty - having been the only Premier League club not to be given one in the 2023-24 season up to this game - after an intervention by the video assistant referee.\nA poor spot-kick from Beto was saved by West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, who dived low to his left.\nBeto partially made amends with an unmarked headed goal from James Garner's deep cross which, in truth, would have been harder to miss.\nBut given their collective failure to take chances across the pitch there is a strong sense that unless either Beto or Calvert-Levin are able to find the net regularly, Everton will not be able to relax during the run in.\nJoy for Moyes as Hammers head home happy\nRumblings of discontent continue to hang in the clouds over Moyes' future as Hammers boss, but the manner of this victory on his old stomping ground will have pleased him.\nThere was a goal from a set-piece to equalise from Zouma, a piece of individual brilliance from Soucek to take the lead and a clinical finish on the counter attack to seal the result.\nSoucek's goal, in particular, was a moment to savour and was akin to something Hammers legend Paolo di Canio might have produced at his peak.\nThe Czech deftly controlled a high cross-field pass in the corner of the box before striking a swerving shot with his instep, which flew into the corner of the net beyond Jordan Pickford.\nIn the manner of Italian Di Canio, Soucek peeled off his shirt in joyous celebration before Alvarez put the gloss on the result when he finished after Jarrod Bowen's run from his own half as Everton were punished on the break.\nWhatever negativity there may be around Moyes does not appear to be shared by his players who showed their fortitude, and work ethic, to earn this win on Merseyside.\nThe Hammers head to Freiburg for the first leg of a Europa League last-16 tie during the week.\nThey do so with a spring in their step."

It was his fifth goal of the season, with all of those strikes coming in the past five games.\n\"He is improving, improving and improving,\" Silva said.\n\"We are working on many things and he's getting better. It was a great goal from him. We know he is strong if we provide in those areas.\n\"The way he linked the game was great too.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Sheffield United 0-6 Arsenal: Abysmal Blades crushed by ruthless Gunners\nArsenal cruised to a seventh successive Premier League win as they put six past a dreadful Sheffield United side at Bramall Lane.\nThe Gunners were 3-0 up inside 13 minutes and led 5-0 at half-time against the league's bottom side.\nMartin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Kai Havertz, Declan Rice and Ben White scored - with an own goal from Jayden Bogle - for Mikel Arteta's team.\nThe win ensures Arsenal move two points behind leaders Liverpool.\nIt keeps the Gunners in the thick of the title race, while in contrast Sheffield United are 11 points from safety with just 11 games remaining.\nArsenal scored after five minutes, with the only surprise being that it took them so long. They carved United open down the left, before the ball was cut back for Odegaard - unmarked 10 yards out - to slot home.\nThe lead was doubled in the 13th minute - Bukayo Saka's low cross was deflected into his own net by Bogle, who got his legs in a tangle with the ball deflecting off his ankle - and was quickly extended when Martinelli fired in via a deflection after Jakob Kiwior's cut back.\nAs fans once again streamed out of Bramall Lane during the first half, Havertz made it 4-0 by tucking into the bottom corner following a Martinelli through ball.\nArsenal cut through United at will, and another slick move of short passes on 39 minutes ended in Rice finishing low past the beleaguered home keeper Ivo Grbic.\nThe visitors did not ease up after the break, as another well-worked move ended in right-back White firing powerfully past Grbic with his left foot.\nThe Gunners have become the first English league side to win three consecutive away games by a margin of five or more goals, while United - seemingly doomed to relegation - are the first English league side to lose four consecutive home games in all competitions while conceding five or more goals.\nRuthless Gunners keep title race pace\nAfter Liverpool's last-gasp win at Nottingham Forest on Saturday and Manchester City's derby victory on Sunday, Arsenal needed to respond here to keep up with the title pace.\nThey certainly did by taking no pity on limited and passive opponents, demolishing them with ruthless efficiency.\nThe tone was set inside the opening two minutes when Arsenal hit the bar and had a shot cleared off the line inside. Saka - whose mauling of Auston Trusty down the left for the opening 15 minutes will long haunt the American - cut in from the right, got the ball back via a deflection and cracked a shot off the woodwork, before Martinelli's follow-up was deflected away.\nArsenal then had the ball in the net a few minutes later, and were away. By 22 minutes, they had reached the 10-shot mark. In the first half, they had 80% possession.\nWhile Sheffield United's lack of quality will be rightly noted, Arsenal's attack is firing on double cylinders in 2024. They have scored 31 goals in just seven Premier League games this calendar year, winning them all.\nThe one downside for Arsenal was Martinelli having to be helped from the pitch in the second half with an injury to his right leg.\nBlades bedraggled and broken\nIn an attempt to get some kind of coherent tune from his beleaguered side, Blades manager Chris Wilder lined up with an unfamiliar back four here, including former Arsenal defender Trusty at left back.\nAfter the third goal, Wilder was hurredly reverting to a back five with the unfortunate Ollie Norwood yanked off, but it had the feeling of rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic - too little, too late.\nWhat will be more worrying for Wilder and United is the response of fans. While many were streaming out of Bramall Lane inside the opening quarter-hour, those who remained could barely be roused to boo their team.\nThere is a feeling of resignation in the stands, while the anger seems to be more present on the pitch.\nIn the build up to the fourth goal, Blades captain Anel Ahmedhodzic brutally threw Martinelli to the floor as the Brazilian played a through ball for the German. Advantage was played and Havertz scored.\nIt was a dreadful piece of play from Ahmedhodzic, and indicates where his team's heads are right now."

They were supportive. It helps me and the whole team.\"\nWerner tapped in Brennan Johnson's cross in the 77th minute, after which Cristian Romero headed in James Maddison's cross and captain Son Heung-min swept home to steal three points to inflict a first loss on Palace manager Oliver Glasner.\n\"To miss two of these chances in one game would be terrible so at the end I am very happy I could score the goal,\" said Werner, whose goal was his 11th in 62 Premier League games after an underwhelming spell at Chelsea between 2020 and 2022.\nThe victory moved Tottenham within two points of fourth-placed Aston Villa, although Unai Emery's side regained their five-point cushion with a dramatic 3-2 win at Luton later on Saturday.\nLive coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Spurs' performance?

They left Maddison free to lift a cross to the back post, where Romero climbed highest to nod in.\nAs the visitors pushed for a late equaliser, the ball broke for Son, who had hit the post shortly before Eze's opener, and he converted supremely where his team-mate Werner had earlier failed.\nSpurs have now scored in 38 league games in succession - run stretching back to the times of former manager Antonio Conte. It is this which will give them hope in their Champions League pursuit.\nPalace can take heart from their start under Glasner and the goalscoring return of Eze, who on his first appearance since January because of a hamstring injury, curled in superbly from the edge of the box, having been hauled down on a dangerous drive towards goal.\n\"It's a disappointing result but a performance that gives us confidence and hope for the next weeks,\" Glasner said.\n\"We gave the goals too easy to Tottenham. You must play perfect to win here. We did well for a long time but should have done it over 95 or 100 minutes.\"",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Aston Villa's display? Send us your views here\nWatkins' fine form continues\nWatkins may well be the most influential player in the Premier League this season. The 28-year-old is the only player to be in double figures for goals and assists in England's top flight.\nHis double at Kenilworth Road takes him up to 16 Premier League goals, the best seasonal tally of his career, and only behind Manchester City phenomenon Erling Haaland.\nVilla had already squandered several chances when Watkins somehow found space in the box to nod in Bailey's corner.\nThe pair have combined for seven Premier League goals this season, more than any other duo.\nWatkins' second came from another set-piece. Luiz took a quick free-kick from the halfway line over the top which Watkins controlled expertly before slotting in via the inside of the post.\nA decision of offside was initially given but a VAR review found Chiedozie Ogbene had kept Watkins onside - so his seventh league goal of 2024 stood.\nHe now becomes only the fourth player to score 16 goals in a Premier League season for Villa after Christian Benteke, Dwight Yorke and Juan Pablo Angel.\nWatkins only had one clear chance for a third in the second half when set up by Morgan Rogers, but his weak shot saved.\nAt that stage Villa were looking comfortable - but they almost squandered the three points before Diaby and Digne, who both came on in a quadruple change after 79 minutes, teamed up to boost their Champions League hopes.\nLuton are still battling\nLuton, in their maiden season in the Premier League since the 1992 rebrand, have had a hugely impressive campaign to still have hopes of survival. Burnley and Sheffield United, who were promoted alongside them last season, are as good as relegated.\nWith Everton and Nottingham Forest - the two teams directly above them - still facing the potential of points deductions for breaching spending rules, Luton could have an extra edge too.\nThey looked out of this game after 45 minutes with injuries affecting them - not for the first time this season.\nAn early injury to Amari'i Bell left them playing people out of position at the back but they improved when they brought on Japan defender Daiki Hashioka for his Premier League debut.\nChong gave them hope moments after Reece Burke's effort had been cleared off the line by Matty Cash - and seven minutes later they were level through Morris.\nAfter Digne nodded home, they had one more big chance but Teden Mengi headed over five minutes into stoppage time."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Sheffield United 0-6 Arsenal: Abysmal Blades crushed by ruthless Gunners\nArsenal cruised to a seventh successive Premier League win as they put six past a dreadful Sheffield United side at Bramall Lane.\nThe Gunners were 3-0 up inside 13 minutes and led 5-0 at half-time against the league's bottom side.\nMartin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Kai Havertz, Declan Rice and Ben White scored - with an own goal from Jayden Bogle - for Mikel Arteta's team.\nThe win ensures Arsenal move two points behind leaders Liverpool.\nIt keeps the Gunners in the thick of the title race, while in contrast Sheffield United are 11 points from safety with just 11 games remaining.\nArsenal scored after five minutes, with the only surprise being that it took them so long. They carved United open down the left, before the ball was cut back for Odegaard - unmarked 10 yards out - to slot home.\nThe lead was doubled in the 13th minute - Bukayo Saka's low cross was deflected into his own net by Bogle, who got his legs in a tangle with the ball deflecting off his ankle - and was quickly extended when Martinelli fired in via a deflection after Jakob Kiwior's cut back.\nAs fans once again streamed out of Bramall Lane during the first half, Havertz made it 4-0 by tucking into the bottom corner following a Martinelli through ball.\nArsenal cut through United at will, and another slick move of short passes on 39 minutes ended in Rice finishing low past the beleaguered home keeper Ivo Grbic.\nThe visitors did not ease up after the break, as another well-worked move ended in right-back White firing powerfully past Grbic with his left foot.\nThe Gunners have become the first English league side to win three consecutive away games by a margin of five or more goals, while United - seemingly doomed to relegation - are the first English league side to lose four consecutive home games in all competitions while conceding five or more goals.\nRuthless Gunners keep title race pace\nAfter Liverpool's last-gasp win at Nottingham Forest on Saturday and Manchester City's derby victory on Sunday, Arsenal needed to respond here to keep up with the title pace.\nThey certainly did by taking no pity on limited and passive opponents, demolishing them with ruthless efficiency.\nThe tone was set inside the opening two minutes when Arsenal hit the bar and had a shot cleared off the line inside. Saka - whose mauling of Auston Trusty down the left for the opening 15 minutes will long haunt the American - cut in from the right, got the ball back via a deflection and cracked a shot off the woodwork, before Martinelli's follow-up was deflected away.\nArsenal then had the ball in the net a few minutes later, and were away. By 22 minutes, they had reached the 10-shot mark. In the first half, they had 80% possession.\nWhile Sheffield United's lack of quality will be rightly noted, Arsenal's attack is firing on double cylinders in 2024. They have scored 31 goals in just seven Premier League games this calendar year, winning them all.\nThe one downside for Arsenal was Martinelli having to be helped from the pitch in the second half with an injury to his right leg.\nBlades bedraggled and broken\nIn an attempt to get some kind of coherent tune from his beleaguered side, Blades manager Chris Wilder lined up with an unfamiliar back four here, including former Arsenal defender Trusty at left back.\nAfter the third goal, Wilder was hurredly reverting to a back five with the unfortunate Ollie Norwood yanked off, but it had the feeling of rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic - too little, too late.\nWhat will be more worrying for Wilder and United is the response of fans. While many were streaming out of Bramall Lane inside the opening quarter-hour, those who remained could barely be roused to boo their team.\nThere is a feeling of resignation in the stands, while the anger seems to be more present on the pitch.\nIn the build up to the fourth goal, Blades captain Anel Ahmedhodzic brutally threw Martinelli to the floor as the Brazilian played a through ball for the German. Advantage was played and Havertz scored.\nIt was a dreadful piece of play from Ahmedhodzic, and indicates where his team's heads are right now.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Chelsea's display? Send us your comments here\nChelsea dominated the opening 45 minutes, with Jackson heavily involved.\nThe Senegalese forward was denied a tap-in thanks to Roerslev's interception of Enzo Fernandez's pass.\nJackson then went round Flekken after latching on to Fernandez's through ball, but his weak shot was cleared with ease by Mathias Jorgensen.\nHe eventually found the net five minutes later, rising highest to bury a header from Malo Gusto's pinpoint cross for his first league goal since mid December.\nBirthday blues for Pochettino\nOn his 52nd birthday, Mauricio Pochettino was left disappointed by his inefficient Chelsea side.\nThe Blues came from behind to beat Leeds in the FA Cup and reach the quarter-finals in midweek.\nFollowing that morale-boosting win, they made it three unbeaten matches on the road in the Premier League with this result but could have come away with three points.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, manager Pochettino said: \"It was tough for us, we had the chances to score and lead the game and then when we conceded the second, I think we showed character.\n\"Three games in six days was tough and not too many changes. The team deserved more but unluckily we did not get the three points.\n\"Disappointed that we didn't get the three points but in some points pleased because after the sixth day and the third game, I think the effort was massive. Overall we deserved the three points.\"\nChelsea had 73.3% of possession over the opening 15 minutes as they controlled proceeding but failed to make it count, with shots off target from Fernandez and Disasi.\nEleven of their 17 shots in the match failed to find the target, with Cole Palmer guilty of missing a promising opportunity when he sent a first-time finish wide of the goal.\nA Chelsea fan was seen holding up a damning sign at full-time which read: \"I don't want your shirt!! I want you to fight for ours.\"\nThe Blues remain in the bottom half of the table, two points behind 10th-placed Wolves.\nPorous Brentford punished again\nThis was another frustrating afternoon for Thomas Frank's home side who came from behind to lead but conceded late to miss out on what would have been a valuable win.\nThe Bees have conceded 50 goals in their 27 league games so far this season, already four more than they shipped in 38 matches during the 2022-23 campaign.\nBrentford have lost 28 points from winning positions in the league this season, more than any other team.\nFrank will be dismayed by the way Brentford failed to close this out. They were in control after Wissa's superb finish, but the needless concession of a corner from Flekken gifted Chelsea a route back into the game.\n\"We would have loved three points and I think we performed to get three points. If we don't concede on that corner then I'm convinced we would have won the game,\" Frank told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"This was a Brentford performance, an identity I'm very proud of and I'm very proud when we play like this. With initiative, intensity, aggressive, we pressed high, we go after it; I was very, very pleased.\"\nAfter a sub-par first 45 minutes, the Bees were much improved in the second half with Roerslev darting in front of Disasi to finish from close range after Reguilon's shot was blocked.\nWissa struck in the 69th minute but Brentford were then punished for a lapse in concentration, meaning they have now failed to win in their last four league games.\nThe Bees sit 15th in the table, just six points above the relegation zone, and face a daunting trip to free-scoring Arsenal next Saturday (17:30 KO)."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Aston Villa's display? Send us your views here\nWatkins' fine form continues\nWatkins may well be the most influential player in the Premier League this season. The 28-year-old is the only player to be in double figures for goals and assists in England's top flight.\nHis double at Kenilworth Road takes him up to 16 Premier League goals, the best seasonal tally of his career, and only behind Manchester City phenomenon Erling Haaland.\nVilla had already squandered several chances when Watkins somehow found space in the box to nod in Bailey's corner.\nThe pair have combined for seven Premier League goals this season, more than any other duo.\nWatkins' second came from another set-piece. Luiz took a quick free-kick from the halfway line over the top which Watkins controlled expertly before slotting in via the inside of the post.\nA decision of offside was initially given but a VAR review found Chiedozie Ogbene had kept Watkins onside - so his seventh league goal of 2024 stood.\nHe now becomes only the fourth player to score 16 goals in a Premier League season for Villa after Christian Benteke, Dwight Yorke and Juan Pablo Angel.\nWatkins only had one clear chance for a third in the second half when set up by Morgan Rogers, but his weak shot saved.\nAt that stage Villa were looking comfortable - but they almost squandered the three points before Diaby and Digne, who both came on in a quadruple change after 79 minutes, teamed up to boost their Champions League hopes.\nLuton are still battling\nLuton, in their maiden season in the Premier League since the 1992 rebrand, have had a hugely impressive campaign to still have hopes of survival. Burnley and Sheffield United, who were promoted alongside them last season, are as good as relegated.\nWith Everton and Nottingham Forest - the two teams directly above them - still facing the potential of points deductions for breaching spending rules, Luton could have an extra edge too.\nThey looked out of this game after 45 minutes with injuries affecting them - not for the first time this season.\nAn early injury to Amari'i Bell left them playing people out of position at the back but they improved when they brought on Japan defender Daiki Hashioka for his Premier League debut.\nChong gave them hope moments after Reece Burke's effort had been cleared off the line by Matty Cash - and seven minutes later they were level through Morris.\nAfter Digne nodded home, they had one more big chance but Teden Mengi headed over five minutes into stoppage time.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Crystal Palace: Timo Werner and Cristian Romero score\nTimo Werner praised the support of his team-mates after his first Tottenham goal sparked his side's comeback win over Crystal Palace.\nWerner, who was making his sixth appearance since joining on loan from RB Leipzig in January, scored Spurs' equaliser as the hosts scored three times in the final 13 minutes to win and boost their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.\nWerner had failed to convert a when played clean through in a forgettable first half and Spurs' woes deepened when Eberechi Eze opened the scoring with a 59th minute free-kick.\n\"They [his team-mates] stood behind me at half-time and said I should keep going,\" Werner said.\n\"It always feels good that you have a group that says nothing about it. They were supportive. It helps me and the whole team.\"\nWerner tapped in Brennan Johnson's cross in the 77th minute, after which Cristian Romero headed in James Maddison's cross and captain Son Heung-min swept home to steal three points to inflict a first loss on Palace manager Oliver Glasner.\n\"To miss two of these chances in one game would be terrible so at the end I am very happy I could score the goal,\" said Werner, whose goal was his 11th in 62 Premier League games after an underwhelming spell at Chelsea between 2020 and 2022.\nThe victory moved Tottenham within two points of fourth-placed Aston Villa, although Unai Emery's side regained their five-point cushion with a dramatic 3-2 win at Luton later on Saturday.\nLive coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Spurs' performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nSpurs leave it late\nHad Spurs been beaten here, their season under manager Ange Postecoglou would have been in danger of petering out, given they are already out of all cup competitions.\nInstead, they remain within touching distance of Aston Villa with a game in hand as they hunt a top-four finish which will guarantee Champions League football next season, even if fifth could yet secure the deal.\nWerner was handed a fifth league start since joining Spurs with Brazilian forward Richarlison out injured but his lack of confidence showed when opted to round goalkeeper Sam Johnstone when one-on-one in a frustrating first half for the hosts.\nThe German, though, could not miss when substitute Johnson, who proved the catalyst for the hosts, beat Joachim Andersen and Jefferson Lerma on the right and squared to the back post to leave the goal gaping.\nIt was Werner's first goal since scoring for Leipzig on 28 October.\n\"He missed the chance in the first half but he was a constant threat to them and was in the right area for the goal,\" Postecoglou said.\n\"I understand that with attacking players, goals make them feel better and make them more confident.\n\"I guess it relieves the pressure on them a little bit but just in general I thought he was really aggressive with his running.\n\"He kept taking on the full-back and I thought apart from the missed chance his general play was really good.\"\nGlasner takes the positives\nPalace, 3-0 victors against Burnley last week in Glasner's first game in charge, had defended solidly to that point but switched off at a throw-in soon after. They left Maddison free to lift a cross to the back post, where Romero climbed highest to nod in.\nAs the visitors pushed for a late equaliser, the ball broke for Son, who had hit the post shortly before Eze's opener, and he converted supremely where his team-mate Werner had earlier failed.\nSpurs have now scored in 38 league games in succession - run stretching back to the times of former manager Antonio Conte. It is this which will give them hope in their Champions League pursuit.\nPalace can take heart from their start under Glasner and the goalscoring return of Eze, who on his first appearance since January because of a hamstring injury, curled in superbly from the edge of the box, having been hauled down on a dangerous drive towards goal.\n\"It's a disappointing result but a performance that gives us confidence and hope for the next weeks,\" Glasner said.\n\"We gave the goals too easy to Tottenham. You must play perfect to win here. We did well for a long time but should have done it over 95 or 100 minutes.\""

Send us your views here\nFulham build on Old Trafford success\nAfter last weekend's dramatic late win at Manchester United, Fulham ensured that hard work was not going to waste as they recorded back-to-back wins in the league for only the second time this season.\nSilva deployed an unchanged starting XI for the visit of Brighton and that decision was rewarded as the Cottagers claimed another three points, ensuring they maintain their record of never losing to the Seagulls in the Premier League - winning four and drawing four.\nMuniz once again demonstrated his importance to the side as he deputises for injured striker Raul Jimenez, scoring and assisting before leaving the field late in the game to a warm reception from the Fulham fans.\nJimenez was replaced by Muniz at half-time in the goalless draw against Everton on 31 January after suffering a hamstring injury, and reclaiming his spot in Fulham's starting line-up might prove difficult.\nMuniz is in a rich vein of form and has helped Fulham enjoy their most consistent run of the campaign - they have lost only one of their past six league games, with three wins.\nThe Brazilian scored his first league goal of the season on 3 February in a 2-2 draw at Burnley, but has since chipped in with two in a win against Bournemouth, one in a loss to Aston Villa and another in the triumph over Brighton.\nNot only did Muniz get on the scoresheet but his hard work and endeavour helped Wilson to score the opener.\nMuniz showed strength and bravery as he stooped to head the ball away from Adam Webster and into the path of Wilson, who caressed the ball beyond Jason Steele with his left foot for his third league goal of the season.\nWith a two-goal cushion, Fulham knew that Brighton would have to attack more aggressively in the second half, but they stood firm and played some lovely counter-attacking football, eventually grabbing their third in that fashion as Traore calmly rolled the ball beyond Steele.\nBrighton fall well short\nBrighton manager Roberto de Zerbi said some of his players were struggling with fatigue after they lost 1-0 against Wolves in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday.\nThe Italian made seven changes to his starting XI against Fulham, with Pascal Gross, who suffered with cramp at Molineux, one of those dropping to bench.\nWith a last-16 first-leg tie at Roma to come, De Zerbi appears to lack the depth in his squad to rotate and this week's news that Japan winger Kaoru Mitoma is out for the season has not helped matters.\nIt was a typical Brighton performance for the most part, with the ball almost glued to the feet of their players for large periods, but they did not have the creative spark required to cause problems in the final third during the first half and were made to pay on the counter.\nThey did threaten to get on the scoresheet after the break, with Ferguson having two sights at goal, but the Republic of Ireland striker's barren run in front of goal continued - he has not scored in 19 games in all competitions.\nThis is the second game in a five-match run during the space of 16 days for Brighton.\nTwo of those fixtures are against Roma, and De Zerbi will need his players to brush this result quickly to one side as they look to avoid slipping into a rut.",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Man City 3-1 Man Utd: Phil Foden scores twice as home side come back to win Manchester derby\nPep Guardiola hailed Phil Foden as the \"best player in the Premier League right now\" after his second-half double ensured Manchester City came from behind to beat Manchester United at Etihad Stadium.\nIn a game packed with international stars, it was two local boys who provided the key moments.\nThe visitors had led through Marcus Rashford's sensational eighth-minute strike from 30 yards.\nHowever, in a contest City dominated, Foden took centre stage.\nThere was an element of controversy over his second-half equaliser. United boss Erik ten Hag was booked for arguing his side should have had a free-kick in the City half when Rashford went down under Kyle Walker's challenge.\nContact was minimal and within seconds Foden had curled a superb shot past Andre Onana.\nFoden then burst away from a static Casemiro to score City's second from Julian Alvarez's return pass before Erling Haaland rounded off the scoring in stoppage time, after the Norwegian earlier missed an open goal from barely three yards.\n\"It is the amount of games he is playing,\" Guardiola told Match of the Day about Foden.\n\"He was always a talented player but now he is more mature and understands more the game, especially defensively. He can play middle, right, make moments and cut inside, play in the left, scoring from the left.\n\"What can I say? He is the best player in the Premier League right now for the amount of things he does. Unbelievable.\"\nHow Foden became Guardiola's 'go-to man'\nIt was City's sixth win in seven meetings against United, who suffered their 11th Premier League defeat of the season.\nMore importantly, the result means Pep Guardiola's side move to within a point of leaders Liverpool before next week's trip to Anfield.\nUnited remain in sixth in the table but are now 11 points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa and six behind Tottenham, in what could turn out to be a fifth Champions League spot, having played a game more.\nMan Utd still fighting for Champions League - Ten Hag\nPremier League title race run-in: Will Liverpool, Manchester City or Arsenal come out on top?\nFoden's class stands out\nThere was something fitting about Stockport-born Foden becoming the match winner.\nIt seems a long time ago now that Guardiola was having to defend his treatment of a player he was accused of be holding back while contemporary Jadon Sancho was excelling at Borussia Dortmund having decided he would not wait to develop at City.\nThe contrast in current fortunes for the two players could not be more marked, with United outcast Sancho back on loan at Dortmund.\nFoden's equaliser was City's 600th goal in this stadium under Guardiola and was a sublime effort, curled into the top corner out of Onana's reach after he had run across Victor Lindelof on the right edge of the United box.\nHis second saw him burst into the area from the other side, collect a pass from Julian Alvarez and drill a low shot home, almost through the United keeper, who might have done better.\nFoden is now picking his moments to get involved in attacks and watching England boss Gareth Southgate must surely find a way of getting the 23-year-old, who has scored 18 goals this season, into his starting line-up at Euro 2024 alongside the likes of Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham.\nHaaland will have been pleased to get his name on the scoresheet given his incredible first-half miss when he somehow put Foden's knock-back over an open goal from three yards.\n\"He was disappointed, I was disappointed. I want him to score four or five goals every game like he did against Luton [in the FA Cup],\" said Guardiola.\n\"But I don't care. He can miss this one, it is the reaction. He is sad for 10 seconds and he can miss five more and is sad for 10 seconds in his mind but after that erase it and on to the next one.\n\"The great, great players I met, and I've been fortunate as a player and especially a manager, they have this incredible ability to forget in an instant.\n\"Tennis players, golf players, basketball players, when they miss, and everyone misses, they say 'OK', smile, be positive and go for the next. That defines the great players and he did it.\"\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester United's display? Send us your views here\nRashford on target but United well beaten\nIn the build-up to the game, Rashford spoke extensively to Players' Tribune, detailing his journey through poverty to United's first team and underlining how much the club means to him.\nIt was thought-provoking stuff and very personal.\nYet, for a sizeable number of fans who have viewed Rashford's efforts this season through the prism of underperformance, a lack of goal threat and a body language of indifference, the words meant nothing. For them the general reaction was 'save it for the pitch'.\nTo that end, it is quite possible Rashford will never score a better goal than his eighth-minute opener.\nBruno Fernandes did well to hold off Ruben Dias to control Onana's booming kick downfield. Then, as Scott McTominay sprinted into the area, Fernandes had the vision and intelligence to wait for Rashford coming behind.\nHe rolled a pass perfectly to the England striker, who did not have to break stride as he launched a shot into the City net off the underside of the bar.\nRashford could easily have had another but, in attempting to control a bouncing ball as Fernandes lifted a pass towards him beyond a static home defence, he succeeded only in heading it into the ground, which allowed Kyle Walker to get back and snuff out the danger.\nThat turned out to be United's last realistic opportunity as they attempted to repel wave after wave of City attacks.\nTen Hag simply did not have the personnel to complete the task, as hard as his players tried.\nNew co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to knock City off their perch. On this evidence, he is going to need a pretty long ladder to attempt that."

The team deserved more but unluckily we did not get the three points.\n\"Disappointed that we didn't get the three points but in some points pleased because after the sixth day and the third game, I think the effort was massive. Overall we deserved the three points.\"\nChelsea had 73.3% of possession over the opening 15 minutes as they controlled proceeding but failed to make it count, with shots off target from Fernandez and Disasi.\nEleven of their 17 shots in the match failed to find the target, with Cole Palmer guilty of missing a promising opportunity when he sent a first-time finish wide of the goal.\nA Chelsea fan was seen holding up a damning sign at full-time which read: \"I don't want your shirt!! I want you to fight for ours.\"\nThe Blues remain in the bottom half of the table, two points behind 10th-placed Wolves.\nPorous Brentford punished again\nThis was another frustrating afternoon for Thomas Frank's home side who came from behind to lead but conceded late to miss out on what would have been a valuable win.\nThe Bees have conceded 50 goals in their 27 league games so far this season, already four more than they shipped in 38 matches during the 2022-23 campaign.\nBrentford have lost 28 points from winning positions in the league this season, more than any other team.\nFrank will be dismayed by the way Brentford failed to close this out. They were in control after Wissa's superb finish, but the needless concession of a corner from Flekken gifted Chelsea a route back into the game.\n\"We would have loved three points and I think we performed to get three points. If we don't concede on that corner then I'm convinced we would have won the game,\" Frank told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"This was a Brentford performance, an identity I'm very proud of and I'm very proud when we play like this. With initiative, intensity, aggressive, we pressed high, we go after it; I was very, very pleased.\"\nAfter a sub-par first 45 minutes, the Bees were much improved in the second half with Roerslev darting in front of Disasi to finish from close range after Reguilon's shot was blocked.\nWissa struck in the 69th minute but Brentford were then punished for a lapse in concentration, meaning they have now failed to win in their last four league games.\nThe Bees sit 15th in the table, just six points above the relegation zone, and face a daunting trip to free-scoring Arsenal next Saturday (17:30 KO).",

Send us your views here\nEventful afternoon for Bournemouth and Solanke\nSolanke has enjoyed an outstanding campaign in front of goal this season, but it had looked like being a day to forget for the striker and his team until Unal's last-gasp equaliser.\nThe former Chelsea and Liverpool frontman came into the game looking to match Joshua King's Bournemouth record of 16 Premier League goals in a single campaign, but after earning his side an early penalty the striker lost his footing at the crucial moment.\nSolanke thought he had pulled a goal back for the Cherries after the visitors had failed to clear Ouattara's hopeful shot from the edge of the box, but the video assistant referee ruled that the striker had handled the ball in the build-up and disallowed his close-range finish.\nBournemouth fans, who had seen Antoine Semenyo, Ryan Christie and Milos Kerkez go close in the first half, could have been forgiven for abandoning all hope at that stage - but Andoni Iraola's team had other ideas.\nHalf-time substitute Ouattara rose highest to head home at the near post and set up a frantic finale, before Unal opened his account for the club at the end of a period of sustained Cherries pressure.\nLuis Sinisterra went close to snatching all three points for Bournemouth - who registered 32 shots over the course of the 90 minutes - but his left-footed effort trickled wide of the far post.\nPositives for Blades despite late leveller\nWilder had said before the game there was \"still some life left\" in his beleaguered side despite their perilous position at the bottom of the Premier League - and the Blades certainly delivered a spirited performance on the south coast.\nUnsurprisingly perhaps, given the manner of Monday's 6-0 humiliation at home by Arsenal, the visitors looked short of confidence in the early stages as Bournemouth started on the front foot.\nHowever, Solanke's penalty miss appeared to breathe new life into Wilder's men, who were rewarded for their efforts when Hamer beat Neto for his third Premier League goal.\nSheffield United had conceded 18 goals in their previous five top-flight matches but defended resolutely in the first half, with goalkeeper Ivo Grbic pulling off smart saves from Semenyo and Kerkez.\nThey appeared on course for three valuable points after Robinson capitalised on Neto's lapse in concentration to double their advantage, but it was one-way traffic after Ouattara halved the deficit with just over a quarter of an hour of normal time remaining.\nThe visitors' defence was breached a second time by Unal, but Wilder will be heartened by his team's display as he prepares to meet club owner Prince Abdullah in Riyadh next week.",

Send us your views here\nMoyes grateful to Ings but won't escape scrutiny\nThe relationship between a section of the West Ham fanbase and their manager always feels fractious, meaning a home defeat by Burnley would have further fuelled Moyes' detractors.\nWhile the Scot will not escape criticism after a draw against one of the worst sides in the league, the fightback meant he did not feel the full brunt of the home support's frustrations at the final whistle.\nHowever, the loud boos after Burnley's second goal, and at half-time, illustrated how quickly Hammers fans could voice their displeasure.\nWith his deal running out in the summer, Moyes' future has come under increasing scrutiny and some fans waved a 'Moyes Out' banner during a defeat at Nottingham Forest last month.\nA poor start to 2024 saw the Hammers go eight matches without a win, but back-to-back victories against Brentford and Everton lifted Moyes' side to seventh in the league.\nThey were expected to build on that with another win against Burnley, but in the end they had to be content with a point thanks to a player who has struggled to make an impact.\nMoyes threw on Ings after 82 minutes and the former England international, who has struggled for game time since a \u00a312m move from Aston Villa in January 2023, spared his side's blushes with a wonderfully-timed first goal of the season.\nIronically it came against the club where he made his name in the Premier League.\n\"It's hard to feel the emotions after scoring, because you just need to keep going, but everyone knows how difficult for me on personal level to get started here,\" said Ings.\n\"It was nice to get a goal and they were unlucky at the end.\n\"But for us we look at the home games as ones to win and overall we will be disappointed.\"\nBurnley 'get done' again in key moments\nBurnley started bottom of the league after Sheffield United's draw at Bournemouth on Saturday and looked well placed to go back above the Blades with what would have been a much-needed win.\nThe first half was the perfect away performance. The Clarets played with energy, were organised when they needed to defend and were rewarded for their sharp attacking play.\nBut the Hammers reacted after the break as one suspected they would and the failings which have cost Burnley dearly this season reappeared.\nKompany's team dropped more points from a winning position - taking the total to 20 points this season - while being unable to take their chances to score a third in a frenetic second half.\nBerge placed a shot over the bar in stoppage time before Josh Brownhill saw a goalbound shot blocked in virtually the last action of the game.\nAsked if not keeping West Ham out or Burnley not being more clinical was his biggest regret, Kompany said: \"Both. But mainly the timing of goals conceded.\n\"If you had to write as bad a scenario as you could, those two goals fall in those two moments.\n\"We are where we are because not been perfect all the time, but that can't be the centre of attention.\n\"We show fight, we show desire and we are dangerous ourselves, but we get done in some key moments.\"",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brentford's display? Send us your views here\nDifferent performance but same result for Arsenal\nWhat has been so impressive about Arsenal's sparkling run to the summit is the way they have torn their opponents apart.\nThirty-one goals in seven league wins at the start of 2024 was indicative of their attacking quality, while their refusal to show any mercy once in command demonstrated a ruthless mindset.\nBut their eighth win in a row required a different type of mentality.\nBefore the visit of struggling Brentford, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta talked about his side playing with the \"same energy, determination and character\" as they had in blowing away the likes of West Ham, Burnley, Newcastle and Sheffield United.\nArteta stressed how they needed to earn the right to win the game - and that is eventually what they did.\nIt was a completely different performance to the type Arsenal have produced in recent weeks - needing to dig in, stay patient and take the big opportunity when it arrived.\nThe wisdom in signing Chelsea's deep-lying forward Havertz instead of a more recognised striker has been regularly questioned, but the German proved his worth once again.\nHavertz, who also scored a late winner in Arsenal's 1-0 victory at Brentford, continued to answer any lingering critics with another goal which could prove vital when the champions are decided in May.\nWhat had been a tense atmosphere inside the Emirates instantly became celebratory, with the home fans eventually feeling confident enough to sing \"We are top of the league\" in the eighth minute of stoppage time.\nNo-one more relieved than Ramsdale\nThe sight of Ramsdale cupping his ears towards the Brentford fans after Havertz's winner was a clear indication of his relief.\nThe 25-year-old has been considered unfortunate by many to have lost his place as Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper following Raya's arrival last summer.\nWith the on-loan Spaniard unavailable against his parent club, Ramsdale had the opportunity to demonstrate why he should not have been discarded by Arteta.\nHowever, the monumental error which led to Brentford's equaliser only serves to further justify his manager's stance.\nArsenal were in utter control when Ramsdale allowed Brentford back into the game, dawdling on a backpass under little pressure and taking an extra touch which allowed a sliding Wissa to block the attempted clearance.\nRamsdale could only watch aghast as the ball looped back into his goal, leaving him looking distraught and stunning the 60,000 home fans into silence.\nSympathetic team-mates comforted Ramsdale when he returned to the dressing room at the half-time whistle, and he showed after the break what he can bring to the team.\nRamsdale had to be alert to push over an audacious long-range effort from Ivan Toney, and reacted quickly to deny Nathan Collins with a free header, to stop Arsenal falling 2-1 behind.\nThose saves laid the foundations for Arsenal to go on and nick a late winner, with Ramsdale eventually able to smile after the final whistle.\nBrentford looking nervously over shoulder\nWith Arsenal's attacking capability, and Brentford's defensive issues, the game had the potential to be problematic for the visitors.\nBrentford have been hampered by a series of injuries to their key defenders, heavily contributing to a poor run which has seen Thomas Frank's side win just three Premier League games since early November.\nConceding headed goals has been a particular problem and it will be a source of frustration to the Bees that both Arsenal goals came this way.\nRice was able to nip ahead of Mads Roerslev to meet Ben White's cross from the right, and Havertz found space between defenders to meet another accurate ball from White.\nBrentford have conceded 17 headers this season, more than any other team in the division.\nAfter Luton's dramatic late draw at Crystal Palace earlier on Saturday, Frank's side are now five points clear of the relegation zone and face a battle to stay in the Premier League for a fourth successive season."

The forward trapped Chris Mepham's looping header, deftly turned Daiki Hashioka and finished with a clip over Thomas Kaminski.\nBy the 65th minute the hosts were level, with their second goal coming through Ukrainian centre-back Zabarnyi heading home from close range amid a crowd of bodies following a corner.\nJust three minutes later it was 3-3, Semenyo cutting inside from the right before powering a low left-footed drive inside Kaminski's near post.\nAnd the winger capped one of the most remarkable Premier League games of the season with six minutes remaining as he blasted home the winner after Luton lost possession in their own half.\nBournemouth blast back as Luton wilt\nOn a night when emotions could have overwhelmed Luton, Rob Edwards' side at first appeared to rise to the task with a flowing first half.\nLuton have now netted in a club-record 16 consecutive top-flight matches, and have scored more goals than Manchester United in the Premier League this season.\nYet for all their impressive attacking play and neutral goodwill, this instead goes down as another hard-luck story and points dropped as they failed to deal with a revitalised Bournemouth after the break.\nThe hosts were sent out early for the second half, no doubt with manager Andoni Iraiola's wrath ringing in their ears.\nLuis Sinisterra was particularly dangerous for the hosts, and was denied twice in the first half by Kaminski before Solanke's moment of magic early in the second and Semenyo on the opposite wing took charge.\nLuton, instead of celebrating a huge three points, must reflect on moments such as the chance to make it 3-4 when Barkley turned a shot over from close range.\nBoth clubs honour Lockyer\nSaturday, 16 December is a date etched into the memories of those who witnessed Lockyer's cardiac arrest at Vitality Stadium. This game was a chance to celebrate the life and health of the Luton captain.\nArriving with his team-mates on the Luton coach, Lockyer was given the biggest cheer by both sets of fans. On the pitch before kick-off, he met and thanked the medics who saved his life. There was applause from all four stands in the 59th minute, the point at which Lockyer collapsed in the original fixture.\nBournemouth took the unprecedented step of putting Lockyer, an opposition player, on their home programme cover, as they made admirable efforts to turn the dreadful events of last December into a positive.\nAdvice was offered to fans at the stadium about cardiac health, while Bournemouth supporters' groups had raised money to help with travel costs for Luton fans for this rearranged fixture.\nBut while the night at first belonged to Lockyer, it was ultimately about his team-mates' inability to see out what would have been a massive three points.\nAll eyes now turn to that weekend meeting with Forest, a game which could prove decisive in the Premier League relegation fight.",

To lose two attackers again today, we just needed to find a way.\n\"The players were flat out at the end of it. An incredible effort from a group that just keep going.\"\nThere was the odd scare as Fulham pushed to get back into the game but Wolves largely defended solidly as they claimed a victory that was fully deserved on the back of their second-half showing.\nO'Neil and his side have an FA Cup quarter-final at home to Coventry next weekend and will be hoping their injury issues have cleared up before they are next in league action, against Aston Villa on 30 March.\n\"European football from where we were at the start of the season, and the injuries we've had, would be the most ridiculous achievement,\" O'Neil added.\n\"Lets see what we can do and keep surprising people.\"\nMissed opportunity for Fulham\nAfter back-to-back Premier League wins against Manchester United and Brighton, Fulham had a glorious opportunity to make it three in row for the first time this season.\nThey looked the form side in the first 45 minutes, restricting Wolves to just one shot while creating a number of good chances.\nBut a sloppy first five minutes of the second half changed the momentum of the game completely.\nWolves were able to win possession back in the Fulham half a number of times in quick succession and that is what led to the first goal.\nThe visitors did respond well to going 2-0 down and had they pulled one back sooner, they might have been able to get something from the game.\nHowever, they lacked ruthlessness in front of goal - they created four clear-cut chances but by the time they took one, it was too late.\n\"Some great saves from Jose Sa, but with the chances we had, you expect the ball to be in the net,\" Marco Silva told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We have to be clinical and ruthless at this level, we weren't and we were punished by those mistakes.\"\nWhile many others are in cup action next weekend, Fulham can look to make progress in the league against Tottenham at Craven Cottage.\nReaction to Wolves v Fulham and all of Saturday's Premier League action",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Burnley's display? Send us your views here\nMoyes grateful to Ings but won't escape scrutiny\nThe relationship between a section of the West Ham fanbase and their manager always feels fractious, meaning a home defeat by Burnley would have further fuelled Moyes' detractors.\nWhile the Scot will not escape criticism after a draw against one of the worst sides in the league, the fightback meant he did not feel the full brunt of the home support's frustrations at the final whistle.\nHowever, the loud boos after Burnley's second goal, and at half-time, illustrated how quickly Hammers fans could voice their displeasure.\nWith his deal running out in the summer, Moyes' future has come under increasing scrutiny and some fans waved a 'Moyes Out' banner during a defeat at Nottingham Forest last month.\nA poor start to 2024 saw the Hammers go eight matches without a win, but back-to-back victories against Brentford and Everton lifted Moyes' side to seventh in the league.\nThey were expected to build on that with another win against Burnley, but in the end they had to be content with a point thanks to a player who has struggled to make an impact.\nMoyes threw on Ings after 82 minutes and the former England international, who has struggled for game time since a \u00a312m move from Aston Villa in January 2023, spared his side's blushes with a wonderfully-timed first goal of the season.\nIronically it came against the club where he made his name in the Premier League.\n\"It's hard to feel the emotions after scoring, because you just need to keep going, but everyone knows how difficult for me on personal level to get started here,\" said Ings.\n\"It was nice to get a goal and they were unlucky at the end.\n\"But for us we look at the home games as ones to win and overall we will be disappointed.\"\nBurnley 'get done' again in key moments\nBurnley started bottom of the league after Sheffield United's draw at Bournemouth on Saturday and looked well placed to go back above the Blades with what would have been a much-needed win.\nThe first half was the perfect away performance. The Clarets played with energy, were organised when they needed to defend and were rewarded for their sharp attacking play.\nBut the Hammers reacted after the break as one suspected they would and the failings which have cost Burnley dearly this season reappeared.\nKompany's team dropped more points from a winning position - taking the total to 20 points this season - while being unable to take their chances to score a third in a frenetic second half.\nBerge placed a shot over the bar in stoppage time before Josh Brownhill saw a goalbound shot blocked in virtually the last action of the game.\nAsked if not keeping West Ham out or Burnley not being more clinical was his biggest regret, Kompany said: \"Both. But mainly the timing of goals conceded.\n\"If you had to write as bad a scenario as you could, those two goals fall in those two moments.\n\"We are where we are because not been perfect all the time, but that can't be the centre of attention.\n\"We show fight, we show desire and we are dangerous ourselves, but we get done in some key moments.\"",

He provided the assist for Jackson's goal before producing a superb finish himself, meaning he now has 19 Premier League goal involvements this season - 11 goals and eight assists.\nPalmer has both scored and assisted in five different league games this season, more than any other player, as his debut Premier League campaign for the Blues continues to go from strength to strength.\nHe was withdrawn after 87 minutes to rapturous applause from the home fans after yet another man-of-the-match performance where he played a pivotal role in his side's victory.\nPalmer has been a rare light of consistency and brought much-needed calm to an often chaotic Chelsea side. His latest impressive performance was watched by England manager Gareth Southgate who names his squad this Thursday for friendlies against Brazil and Belgium.\nThe former Manchester City midfielder made his senior England debut in November, and after more brilliant performances since then he will hope to add to his two caps this month.\nMore injures on disappointing night for Newcastle\nNewcastle were looking to complete a league double over the Blues for the first time since 1986-87 but failed to in a below-par performance.\nEddie Howe's side took a while to grow into the game after going behind early on.\nGordon, who would have hoped to impress Southgate, came off after 34 minutes in a huge blow for the injury-hit Magpies.\nIn the second half, Dan Burn landed awkwardly and was substituted. Newcastle are already without Kieran Trippier who has a calf problem, while Callum Wilson, Joelinton and Nick Pope remain long-term absentees.\nMurphy's goal was a moment of superb quality as he unleashed a sensational strike from just inside the penalty area, rolling Cucurella and leaving Petrovic no chance of saving it.\nNewcastle will have to dust themselves down quickly before a huge FA Cup quarter-final against holders Manchester City on Saturday (17:30 GMT).",

The forward trapped Chris Mepham's looping header, deftly turned Daiki Hashioka and finished with a clip over Thomas Kaminski.\nBy the 65th minute the hosts were level, with their second goal coming through Ukrainian centre-back Zabarnyi heading home from close range amid a crowd of bodies following a corner.\nJust three minutes later it was 3-3, Semenyo cutting inside from the right before powering a low left-footed drive inside Kaminski's near post.\nAnd the winger capped one of the most remarkable Premier League games of the season with six minutes remaining as he blasted home the winner after Luton lost possession in their own half.\nBournemouth blast back as Luton wilt\nOn a night when emotions could have overwhelmed Luton, Rob Edwards' side at first appeared to rise to the task with a flowing first half.\nLuton have now netted in a club-record 16 consecutive top-flight matches, and have scored more goals than Manchester United in the Premier League this season.\nYet for all their impressive attacking play and neutral goodwill, this instead goes down as another hard-luck story and points dropped as they failed to deal with a revitalised Bournemouth after the break.\nThe hosts were sent out early for the second half, no doubt with manager Andoni Iraiola's wrath ringing in their ears.\nLuis Sinisterra was particularly dangerous for the hosts, and was denied twice in the first half by Kaminski before Solanke's moment of magic early in the second and Semenyo on the opposite wing took charge.\nLuton, instead of celebrating a huge three points, must reflect on moments such as the chance to make it 3-4 when Barkley turned a shot over from close range.\nBoth clubs honour Lockyer\nSaturday, 16 December is a date etched into the memories of those who witnessed Lockyer's cardiac arrest at Vitality Stadium. This game was a chance to celebrate the life and health of the Luton captain.\nArriving with his team-mates on the Luton coach, Lockyer was given the biggest cheer by both sets of fans. On the pitch before kick-off, he met and thanked the medics who saved his life. There was applause from all four stands in the 59th minute, the point at which Lockyer collapsed in the original fixture.\nBournemouth took the unprecedented step of putting Lockyer, an opposition player, on their home programme cover, as they made admirable efforts to turn the dreadful events of last December into a positive.\nAdvice was offered to fans at the stadium about cardiac health, while Bournemouth supporters' groups had raised money to help with travel costs for Luton fans for this rearranged fixture.\nBut while the night at first belonged to Lockyer, it was ultimately about his team-mates' inability to see out what would have been a massive three points.\nAll eyes now turn to that weekend meeting with Forest, a game which could prove decisive in the Premier League relegation fight.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 2-0 Everton: Two first-half penalties earn Erik ten Hag's side victory\nManchester United ended their two-match losing streak as first-half penalties from Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford were enough to defeat Everton at Old Trafford.\nIn a strange game, in which Everton became the fifth side in six Premier League games to have at least 20 shots against Erik ten Hag's side, the visitors were made to pay for their profligacy and reckless defending.\nSkipper James Tarkowski and fellow defender Ben Godfrey both caught Alejandro Garnacho with rash challenges.\nFernandes took the first spot-kick and beat Jordan Pickford with a precise low shot to the England keeper's left corner.\nHowever, the United skipper passed on responsibility to Rashford on the second occasion. It seemed a needless risk but Rashford kept his nerve to send Pickford the wrong way for his seventh goal of the season.\nNo city would come close to Manchester with redevelopment - Burnham\nAfter defeats by Fulham and Manchester City, the result pushed United to within three points of fifth-placed Tottenham, although Ange Postecoglou's men do have two matches in hand.\nAnd, after Thursday's European results, fifth is not as sure of securing Champions League qualification next term as it previously appeared to be.\nThe loss continued an awful run for Everton, who have now picked up just five points from 11 games and with next week's Merseyside derby called off because of Liverpool's FA Cup commitments, Sean Dyche's men could find themselves in the relegation zone during the international break.\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here\nReaction to Manchester United's win over Everton at Old Trafford\nGarnarcho shines\nNo matter how this season turns out for Manchester United, it will be notable as the one where Garnacho started to turn promise into effective performances.\nThe Argentine is still only 19 but he is fast becoming United's most potent offensive threat.\nThere are times when he fails to make the right decision as when he somehow failed to fashion a shooting chance from a Scott McTominay through ball in the final minute of the opening period despite initially running clean through.\nBut his pace and balance unsettles defenders and in luring Tarkowski and Godfrey into rash first-half challenges, Garnacho ensured the home side went into the interval with a healthy lead, rather than finding themselves behind as could easily have been the case.\nUnited were guilty of wasting further chances after the break, with Garnacho one of the culprits as he blazed over after sprinting clear into the penalty area.\nJordan Pickford had produced a superb early one-handed save to turn away a Fernandes free-kick and he needed to be alert to prevent Victor Lindelof stabbing home a third after a melee in the six-yard box.\nEverton's strife\nHaving suffered a six-point deduction for financial breaches already this season, the time is drawing near when Everton will have to defend themselves in a second hearing.\nThey can only hope some leniency is applied for the fact two of the periods in question were assessed in the first case as on this evidence, they will struggle to get out of trouble if they suffer a similar-sized sanction.\nThe fight they showed to drag themselves out of the bottom three when the initial 10-point punishment was handed down has diluted.\nFive points from 11 games in the middle of the season is form that would land any team in bother and Everton lack the quality to create a belief substantive change can be achieved.\nIn the opening period at least, they had better chances than their hosts.\nBut Dwight McNeil, Jack Harrison and Amadou Onana both lacked composure when they had the goal at their mercy, meaning Onana's only save was to deny United old-boy James Garner, whose shot was heading for the far corner.\nEverton's fortunes didn't improve. At one point substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin rose to meet a header on the edge of the six-yard box, only to send it straight back across goal. Lewis Dobbin reacted and also tried to score, only to send the ball back across where it had come from, with Onana not called upon on either occasion.\nIt was comic book stuff but it is no laughing matter for Everton, who are in big trouble on the pitch, let alone off it."

They would have gone behind early on if not for blocks by Radu Dragusin and Cristian Romero to deny Andreas Pereira, while Guglielmo Vicario also saved well from Lukic.\nJames Maddison shot narrowly wide in the first half and Timo Werner failed to convert with the goal gaping in the second as Ange Postecoglou's side failed to back up impressive wins over Crystal Palace and Villa in the previous two games.\nVilla will regain their five-point cushion on Sunday if they win at West Ham.\nFulham, meanwhile, remain 12th but are themselves only five points adrift of the Hammers in seventh.\n'Unacceptable' Spurs 'didn't put the effort in' - Son\nReaction from Craven Cottage\nHow did you rate Fulham's performance?

Send us your views here\nSorry Spurs disappoint\nThe rampant 4-0 win at Villa Park seemed to give Spurs all of the momentum in the race for the top four and a guaranteed place in the Champions League next season.\nFor all of the good in that win, this performance was equally bad - Spurs failing to apply more pressure to Villa when given the luxury of playing a day earlier.\nThe visitors started slowly and conceded a sloppy goal three minutes before half-time. Then, rather than grabbing the initiative after the break, they emerged in similarly timid fashion and Lukic converted within four minutes.\nCrucially, Postecoglou was missing centre-back Micky van de Ven because of injury. The last time he was ruled out Spurs embarked on a four-game winless run.\nIn the Dutchman's absence, January signing Dragusin was given a first start but the Romanian allowed Muniz to drift into too much space for the opener and was beaten to the bouncing ball for the third.\nPostecoglou made a triple change in the second half and his side briefly improved, only for Werner's finishing touch to desert him after goals in his previous two games.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Newcastle's display? Send us your views here\nNewcastle started slowly and Fabian Schar sent a shot off target as home goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic was relatively untroubled for most of the match.\nThe visitors struggled to create many opportunities in the first half with Isak's goal their first shot on target after 43 minutes.\nBy this stage, Eddie Howe had lost another player to injury as Anthony Gordon came off following a challenge by Marc Cucurella.\nMurphy replaced Gordon and his sublime finish late on made the scoreline closer than it seemed in reality.\nPalmer impresses in front of watching Southgate\nThere is no doubt that Palmer has been Chelsea's most impactful signing since joining the club from Manchester City on the final day of last summer's transfer window.\nOnce again, Palmer was influential for the Blues when they needed him most. He provided the assist for Jackson's goal before producing a superb finish himself, meaning he now has 19 Premier League goal involvements this season - 11 goals and eight assists.\nPalmer has both scored and assisted in five different league games this season, more than any other player, as his debut Premier League campaign for the Blues continues to go from strength to strength.\nHe was withdrawn after 87 minutes to rapturous applause from the home fans after yet another man-of-the-match performance where he played a pivotal role in his side's victory.\nPalmer has been a rare light of consistency and brought much-needed calm to an often chaotic Chelsea side. His latest impressive performance was watched by England manager Gareth Southgate who names his squad this Thursday for friendlies against Brazil and Belgium.\nThe former Manchester City midfielder made his senior England debut in November, and after more brilliant performances since then he will hope to add to his two caps this month.\nMore injures on disappointing night for Newcastle\nNewcastle were looking to complete a league double over the Blues for the first time since 1986-87 but failed to in a below-par performance.\nEddie Howe's side took a while to grow into the game after going behind early on.\nGordon, who would have hoped to impress Southgate, came off after 34 minutes in a huge blow for the injury-hit Magpies.\nIn the second half, Dan Burn landed awkwardly and was substituted. Newcastle are already without Kieran Trippier who has a calf problem, while Callum Wilson, Joelinton and Nick Pope remain long-term absentees.\nMurphy's goal was a moment of superb quality as he unleashed a sensational strike from just inside the penalty area, rolling Cucurella and leaving Petrovic no chance of saving it.\nNewcastle will have to dust themselves down quickly before a huge FA Cup quarter-final against holders Manchester City on Saturday (17:30 GMT).",

We have Ivan [Toney] and it would have been 1-1.\"\nFrank's team deserve credit for pushing Burnley to the wire after going 2-0 down, Ajer's goal coming moments after Brentford's penalty appeals for Muric's challenge on Toney were waved away by referee Darren Bond.\nThe Bees had the ball in the net again when Baptiste's cross-shot looped into the far corner, but their celebrations were cut short by Bond.\nBrentford have now lost five of their past six league games and face a tricky run of fixtures, with back-to-back home games against Manchester United and Brighton followed by a trip to Aston Villa.\nFrank will hope his team can pick up enough points from those games to still be above the drop zone when they host Sheffield United on 13 April."

This has been one of the hardest weeks we've had in football after what happened on Monday night.\n\"We're off the bottom.

Send us your views here\nEventful afternoon for Bournemouth and Solanke\nSolanke has enjoyed an outstanding campaign in front of goal this season, but it had looked like being a day to forget for the striker and his team until Unal's last-gasp equaliser.\nThe former Chelsea and Liverpool frontman came into the game looking to match Joshua King's Bournemouth record of 16 Premier League goals in a single campaign, but after earning his side an early penalty the striker lost his footing at the crucial moment.\nSolanke thought he had pulled a goal back for the Cherries after the visitors had failed to clear Ouattara's hopeful shot from the edge of the box, but the video assistant referee ruled that the striker had handled the ball in the build-up and disallowed his close-range finish.\nBournemouth fans, who had seen Antoine Semenyo, Ryan Christie and Milos Kerkez go close in the first half, could have been forgiven for abandoning all hope at that stage - but Andoni Iraola's team had other ideas.\nHalf-time substitute Ouattara rose highest to head home at the near post and set up a frantic finale, before Unal opened his account for the club at the end of a period of sustained Cherries pressure.\nLuis Sinisterra went close to snatching all three points for Bournemouth - who registered 32 shots over the course of the 90 minutes - but his left-footed effort trickled wide of the far post.\nPositives for Blades despite late leveller\nWilder had said before the game there was \"still some life left\" in his beleaguered side despite their perilous position at the bottom of the Premier League - and the Blades certainly delivered a spirited performance on the south coast.\nUnsurprisingly perhaps, given the manner of Monday's 6-0 humiliation at home by Arsenal, the visitors looked short of confidence in the early stages as Bournemouth started on the front foot.\nHowever, Solanke's penalty miss appeared to breathe new life into Wilder's men, who were rewarded for their efforts when Hamer beat Neto for his third Premier League goal.\nSheffield United had conceded 18 goals in their previous five top-flight matches but defended resolutely in the first half, with goalkeeper Ivo Grbic pulling off smart saves from Semenyo and Kerkez.\nThey appeared on course for three valuable points after Robinson capitalised on Neto's lapse in concentration to double their advantage, but it was one-way traffic after Ouattara halved the deficit with just over a quarter of an hour of normal time remaining.\nThe visitors' defence was breached a second time by Unal, but Wilder will be heartened by his team's display as he prepares to meet club owner Prince Abdullah in Riyadh next week.",

Then, rather than grabbing the initiative after the break, they emerged in similarly timid fashion and Lukic converted within four minutes.\nCrucially, Postecoglou was missing centre-back Micky van de Ven because of injury. The last time he was ruled out Spurs embarked on a four-game winless run.\nIn the Dutchman's absence, January signing Dragusin was given a first start but the Romanian allowed Muniz to drift into too much space for the opener and was beaten to the bouncing ball for the third.\nPostecoglou made a triple change in the second half and his side briefly improved, only for Werner's finishing touch to desert him after goals in his previous two games.

We have Ivan [Toney] and it would have been 1-1.\"\nFrank's team deserve credit for pushing Burnley to the wire after going 2-0 down, Ajer's goal coming moments after Brentford's penalty appeals for Muric's challenge on Toney were waved away by referee Darren Bond.\nThe Bees had the ball in the net again when Baptiste's cross-shot looped into the far corner, but their celebrations were cut short by Bond.\nBrentford have now lost five of their past six league games and face a tricky run of fixtures, with back-to-back home games against Manchester United and Brighton followed by a trip to Aston Villa.\nFrank will hope his team can pick up enough points from those games to still be above the drop zone when they host Sheffield United on 13 April.",

It seemed a needless risk but Rashford kept his nerve to send Pickford the wrong way for his seventh goal of the season.\nNo city would come close to Manchester with redevelopment - Burnham\nAfter defeats by Fulham and Manchester City, the result pushed United to within three points of fifth-placed Tottenham, although Ange Postecoglou's men do have two matches in hand.\nAnd, after Thursday's European results, fifth is not as sure of securing Champions League qualification next term as it previously appeared to be.\nThe loss continued an awful run for Everton, who have now picked up just five points from 11 games and with next week's Merseyside derby called off because of Liverpool's FA Cup commitments, Sean Dyche's men could find themselves in the relegation zone during the international break.\nHow did you rate Manchester United's performance?

At one point substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin rose to meet a header on the edge of the six-yard box, only to send it straight back across goal. Lewis Dobbin reacted and also tried to score, only to send the ball back across where it had come from, with Onana not called upon on either occasion.\nIt was comic book stuff but it is no laughing matter for Everton, who are in big trouble on the pitch, let alone off it."

Not only did it offer Liverpool a way back into the game, it also led to the incident that forced Ederson off.\nCity still posed a huge threat even when Liverpool went through the gears in the second half, cursing their luck when Foden hit the bar with a rebound off Kelleher's punch, then Doku hit the post.\nThe immediate concern will be Ederson's injury but there was still much to admire in City's display, especially the outstanding Rodri, although De Bruyne was visibly unhappy when he was surprisingly replaced by Mateo Kovacic after 69 minutes.\nIn the end, City will take a point at Anfield and move on, although they may also feel they let three points escape their grasp because of Ake's self-inflicted wound.\nIt was honours even after a magnificent game - but Arsenal are the big winners this weekend.",

Kelleher also had a lucky escape when he punched Ake's cross on to Foden, the rebound crashing against the bar, while Jeremy Doku struck the post late on.\nLiverpool will also feel they had strong penalty claims when Doku's foot was high on Mac Allister in the dying seconds but nothing was given.\nThese two outstanding sides could not be separated on the day - which means, for now, it is advantage Arsenal in the title race.\n'Monumental' - how Nunez & Van Dijk make difference to Liverpool's title bid\nRelive Liverpool's thrilling draw with Manchester City\nLiverpool show huge character\nLiverpool initially struggled to impose themselves on Manchester City, and their first-half efforts were frantic in comparison with the visitors' more measured approach.\nThey were never out of contention, however, despite trailing to Stones' goal.\nAnd once they were thrown the lifeline of Mac Allister's equaliser following Ake's error, Liverpool showed that relentless urge to attack that almost brought them victory - although City had clear chances of their own too.\nDiaz will wonder how he missed their best chance when sent clear by a magnificent Salah pass, the Egyptian's first touch after coming on as substitute on the hour. Diaz was full of energy and pace throughout but wasteful in the vital moments.\nLiverpool will be disappointed to have conceded the Premier League leadership to Arsenal this weekend, but they are still in an outstanding position as the season enters its final stretch.\nAnd the fearless approach of Jurgen Klopp's side, which they demonstrated once they got themselves back in the game, means they can enter this defining period with confidence.\nHow did you rate Liverpool's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester City's display? Send us your views here\nSalah left out of Egypt squad for friendly tournament\nMixed feelings for Man City\nManchester City have had tough times at Anfield in recent years but this will rank among their most composed displays, despite a second-half Liverpool onslaught after Mac Allister's equaliser and the loss of Ederson to injury.\nAnd this is why there will be mixed feelings for manager Pep Guardiola because he will know his side were exerting a strong measure of control until Nathan Ake's dreadful back pass. Not only did it offer Liverpool a way back into the game, it also led to the incident that forced Ederson off.\nCity still posed a huge threat even when Liverpool went through the gears in the second half, cursing their luck when Foden hit the bar with a rebound off Kelleher's punch, then Doku hit the post.\nThe immediate concern will be Ederson's injury but there was still much to admire in City's display, especially the outstanding Rodri, although De Bruyne was visibly unhappy when he was surprisingly replaced by Mateo Kovacic after 69 minutes.\nIn the end, City will take a point at Anfield and move on, although they may also feel they let three points escape their grasp because of Ake's self-inflicted wound.\nIt was honours even after a magnificent game - but Arsenal are the big winners this weekend.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brentford's display? Send us your views here\nDifferent performance but same result for Arsenal\nWhat has been so impressive about Arsenal's sparkling run to the summit is the way they have torn their opponents apart.\nThirty-one goals in seven league wins at the start of 2024 was indicative of their attacking quality, while their refusal to show any mercy once in command demonstrated a ruthless mindset.\nBut their eighth win in a row required a different type of mentality.\nBefore the visit of struggling Brentford, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta talked about his side playing with the \"same energy, determination and character\" as they had in blowing away the likes of West Ham, Burnley, Newcastle and Sheffield United.\nArteta stressed how they needed to earn the right to win the game - and that is eventually what they did.\nIt was a completely different performance to the type Arsenal have produced in recent weeks - needing to dig in, stay patient and take the big opportunity when it arrived.\nThe wisdom in signing Chelsea's deep-lying forward Havertz instead of a more recognised striker has been regularly questioned, but the German proved his worth once again.\nHavertz, who also scored a late winner in Arsenal's 1-0 victory at Brentford, continued to answer any lingering critics with another goal which could prove vital when the champions are decided in May.\nWhat had been a tense atmosphere inside the Emirates instantly became celebratory, with the home fans eventually feeling confident enough to sing \"We are top of the league\" in the eighth minute of stoppage time.\nNo-one more relieved than Ramsdale\nThe sight of Ramsdale cupping his ears towards the Brentford fans after Havertz's winner was a clear indication of his relief.\nThe 25-year-old has been considered unfortunate by many to have lost his place as Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper following Raya's arrival last summer.\nWith the on-loan Spaniard unavailable against his parent club, Ramsdale had the opportunity to demonstrate why he should not have been discarded by Arteta.\nHowever, the monumental error which led to Brentford's equaliser only serves to further justify his manager's stance.\nArsenal were in utter control when Ramsdale allowed Brentford back into the game, dawdling on a backpass under little pressure and taking an extra touch which allowed a sliding Wissa to block the attempted clearance.\nRamsdale could only watch aghast as the ball looped back into his goal, leaving him looking distraught and stunning the 60,000 home fans into silence.\nSympathetic team-mates comforted Ramsdale when he returned to the dressing room at the half-time whistle, and he showed after the break what he can bring to the team.\nRamsdale had to be alert to push over an audacious long-range effort from Ivan Toney, and reacted quickly to deny Nathan Collins with a free header, to stop Arsenal falling 2-1 behind.\nThose saves laid the foundations for Arsenal to go on and nick a late winner, with Ramsdale eventually able to smile after the final whistle.\nBrentford looking nervously over shoulder\nWith Arsenal's attacking capability, and Brentford's defensive issues, the game had the potential to be problematic for the visitors.\nBrentford have been hampered by a series of injuries to their key defenders, heavily contributing to a poor run which has seen Thomas Frank's side win just three Premier League games since early November.\nConceding headed goals has been a particular problem and it will be a source of frustration to the Bees that both Arsenal goals came this way.\nRice was able to nip ahead of Mads Roerslev to meet Ben White's cross from the right, and Havertz found space between defenders to meet another accurate ball from White.\nBrentford have conceded 17 headers this season, more than any other team in the division.\nAfter Luton's dramatic late draw at Crystal Palace earlier on Saturday, Frank's side are now five points clear of the relegation zone and face a battle to stay in the Premier League for a fourth successive season."

He is a goalscorer and they are so valuable, and his two finishes today were of the highest quality. Of course, the last one was memorable and will always be remembered - and what a finish it was. That's the quality he has.\"\nNewcastle made the perfect start when Anthony Gordon won a penalty with just three minutes played and Isak converted from 12 yards.\nBut the game started to get away from the Magpies when West Ham scored three unanswered goals.\nMichail Antonio brought the Hammers on to level terms before Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen scored within minutes either side of half-time.\nIsak scored his second penalty of the afternoon after Gordon was again adjudged to have been fouled and Barnes grabbed the equaliser in the 83rd minute.\nWith momentum and a vociferous St James' Park firmly behind them, Newcastle pressed on and Barnes emphatically fired in a 90th-minute winner.\nThere was further drama to come in injury time as Newcastle were reduced to 10 men when Gordon received a second yellow card for kicking the ball away, but they managed to hold out for a victory that could prove vital in their pursuit of European football.\nNewcastle climb up to eighth, just a point behind West Ham in seventh.\nFollow live text coverage of Newcastle v West Ham in the Premier League\nHow did you rate Newcastle's performance?

Send us your views here\nBarnes boosts European hopes\nPrior to kick-off Eddie Howe stressed the importance of Newcastle making a positive start upon their return from the international break, with 10 games to try and salvage something from an underwhelming season.\nIt was an emotional rollercoaster for the Newcastle faithful but, ultimately, an afternoon that could prove to be a pivotal moment.\nThere was little doubt that top-scorer Isak would dispatch his penalty to get them up and running, but things started to fall apart soon after when Jamaal Lascelles went off with an injury.\nEmil Krafth came on in his place as Newcastle shuffled around their backline but they looked disjointed as Antonio found space to equalise.\nAfter Kudus and Bowen gave West Ham a two-goal cushion the atmosphere within St James' Park started to turn toxic, yet the players maintained their belief and fought to get back into the encounter.\nIsak reduced the deficit with his second penalty, taking his tally for the season in the Premier League to 14, although the decision to award the spot-kick seemed harsh with Kalvin Phillips penalised for catching Gordon as he attempted to clear the ball.\nReferee Rob Jones did not initially point to the spot but he changed his mind after being asked to review the incident on the pitchside monitor.\nNewcastle, who have been plagued by injury issues all season, lost a further two players during the second half with Krafth and Miguel Almiron forced off.\nBut Barnes turned the game on its head with two goals in the last 10 minutes of regulation time.\nBarnes, who joined from Leicester in a \u00a338m deal in July, has struggled with injuries during his debut campaign with Newcastle and was making just his 12th Premier League appearance.\n\"They are the moments I have missed so much,\" Barnes told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"For me, I miss that feeling of being out there, and when I am I want to make up for lost time, and today was a great step forward with that.\n\"You can't really describe those feelings sometimes, so late on in the game, and then after that it was just hoping we can hold on to the result and get the three points and we did that.\"\nGordon's injury-time red card for petulant behaviour made Newcastle's job of hanging on a little bit harder than they would have liked, and the winger will now miss a reunion with former club Everton on Tuesday.\nWith potentially the top eight places offering up European football in the Premier League, Newcastle have ensured they remain firmly in the mix.\nJoin BBC Sport's WhatsApp channels\nDefensive woes for West Ham\nAfter overcoming an early set-back of conceding inside three minutes, West Ham seemed to be on course to strengthen their grip on a European berth while denting the hopes of one of their rivals.\nAntonio's equaliser set them on their way, scoring his second goal in as many games, before Kudus and Bowen gave the visitors breathing space as they looked for a first win against the Magpies since August 2021.\nBut it was a familiar story for David Moyes' men as they were exposed defensively.\nWest Ham have now conceded 54 goals this season with just Luton (60), Burnley (63) and Sheffield United (74) conceding more.\nIt is now three games without victory for the Hammers following draws against Burnley and Aston Villa, while they have won just one away game in the league since the turn of the year - losing three and drawing one.",

Send us your views here\nAssignon's yellow cards came in the opening 40 minutes, with both fouls on Mudryk, and Kompany was then dismissed for his reaction to the dismissal.\nThe first half was a lively encounter, Jacob Bruun Larsen dragging a shot wide for the away side before Enzo Fernandez's strike hit the bar.\nEngland internationals Palmer and Conor Gallagher combined well in a fluid Chelsea move but Palmer shot wide of the target.\nWilson Odobert's shot from the edge of the box was then palmed behind by home goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic as the away side attempted to get on the scoresheet.\nBurnley show fighting spirit despite red cards\nIt was a much-improved performance for Burnley, who frustrated Chelsea and were well worth their point.\nAssignon is the sixth Burnley player to be sent off in the Premier League this season, more than any other team in the competition.\nDespite their clear frustration at events in the first half, Kompany's side came out fighting in the second period and were back on level terms within two minutes thanks to Cullen's brilliant finish.\nO'Shea's late header secured a vital point against tough opponents and Jay Rodriguez had a chance to win it late on when his header thumped against the bar and he was unable to turn the rebound home.\nThey will take great confidence from their determined performance before they host Wolves on Tuesday (19:45 BST).\nPalmer shines again as Blues draw\nBefore the game, Blues boss Mauricio Pochettino said: \"If you look at all the data, in the table we should be in fourth position.\"\nAnother inconsistent performance emphasised exactly why they remain in the bottom half of the table.\nThe Blues had more than enough chances, with 33 shots their most in a Premier League game in more than 10 years.\nThey conceded just three minutes after going in front, dropping more points against a struggling side after drawing at Brentford at the start of the month.\nMudryk, who scored the winner for Ukraine to send them to Euro 2024 this week, replaced Raheem Sterling in the starting line-up and was key to Chelsea's best chances in the first half.\nHis whipped ball into the box was put in the net by Axel Disasi but was ruled out for offside after a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) check.\nHe then won the penalty with Assignon unable to cope with his pace.\nOne constant bright light for Pochettino is Palmer. He kept his composure to score from the spot and produced a fine finish from Sterling's clever backheel.\nBoos rang out at the final whistle and there will be huge expectations for a better home display when Manchester United visit on Thursday (20:15 BST).",

It was a dream come true to make my England debut and it's something I've been working hard on. I want to continue working and learning so that's what I'm going to do.\"\nAs for whether he meant his goal, Konsa said: \"Yeah, I meant it! Nah, I saw Jhon [Duran] coming in at the back post so I was hoping to give him an assist.

The absence of key forward players Pedro Neto, Hwang Hee-chan and Matheus Cunha meant there was a lack of quality and creativity in the final third.\nDiaby's opener came almost out of the blue, stemming from a central free-kick chipped over to Alex Moreno on the left. His cross came off the outstretched leg of Doyle for Diaby to fire home first time.\nWolves manager Gary O'Neil may question his defenders, who were static and made no real attempt to block the shot.\nKonsa's goal was extremely fortuitous at the end of a free-flowing move, but come the season's end on 19 May he and Villa may well look back on this as a key day.\nWolves, who had just one shot on target in the second half, have now lost three of their past four games in all competitions with their squad depth again being exposed at the highest level."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Arsenal's display? Send us your views here\nMan City stifled and infuriated by visitors\nGuardiola's side were under greater pressure to win this match but their usual fluent passing game was rarely in evidence, stifled by the visitors' organisation and infuriated by referee Anthony Taylor's reluctance to punish the Gunners for a succession of infringements.\nIt led to a scrappy, disjointed game in which City were never allowed to gather their usual momentum and rhythm, with even the best efforts of master creators Kevin de Bruyne and Bernardo Silva unable to carve out meaningful opportunities for Erling Haaland, who was kept on the margins throughout.\nThe hosts held sway in possession for most of the second half but it was illustrative of the game that Raya barely had an anxious moment, his counterpart Stefan Ortega also idle for long periods.\nIndeed, it is the first time City have failed to score at home in the Premier League since October 2021, a run of 47 games.\nThe reigning champions, as usual, will remain confident of retaining their title but Guardiola will be bitterly disappointed at his side's failure to trouble Arsenal, with substitute Jack Grealish on the end of some lengthy post-match advice from his manager.\nCity are back here at Etihad Stadium to face in-form Aston Villa on Wednesday night knowing they cannot afford any more slip-ups in this tight Premier League title pursuit.\nJoin BBC Sport's WhatsApp channels\nArteta's Arsenal show steel in rivals' backyard\nArsenal arrived at Manchester City with a point to make and a chance to show their improvement at a ground where they have had a miserable record in the past.\nThe Gunners last won here in January 2015, drawing one and losing eight of their subsequent nine visits before this game.\nHere, Arteta set his side out to be fiercely drilled and well-organised to frustrate, a strategy seemingly designed to earn the point they secured rather than risk more for victory.\nIt was a conservative approach but what it did demonstrate was that Arsenal do have more resilience and character than on previous occasions, when they have sometimes capitulated under City's attacking assault.\nArteta's side were composed but also willing to throw bodies on the line when danger threatened, not that they were ever in serious peril of conceding - a tribute to their display in itself.\nThey have kept clean sheets in both games against Manchester City this season, making them only the fourth team to shut out a Guardiola side twice in the same season.\nWhether this is one point gained or two lost remains to be seen, but Arteta seemed satisfied enough at the final whistle.",

It was a dream come true to make my England debut and it's something I've been working hard on. I want to continue working and learning so that's what I'm going to do.\"\nAs for whether he meant his goal, Konsa said: \"Yeah, I meant it! Nah, I saw Jhon [Duran] coming in at the back post so I was hoping to give him an assist. I'm really pleased.\"\nThere was concern for Villa, though, with England striker Ollie Watkins withdrawn at half-time because of a hamstring injury and manager Emery said he would go for a scan on Sunday.\nTottenham have a game in hand on Villa and could yet take control of the race for fourth, but fifth spot may secure top-tier European football next season with the revamped tournament being introduced.\nReaction to Aston Villa's win over Wolves and updates from Brentford v Man Utd\nJoin the BBC Sport WhatsApp channels\nVilla find a way against exposed Wolves\nVilla, who have now won as many Premier League games as they managed in the entirety of last season, were nowhere near their peak form.\nHowever, results are key at this stage of the season and there may have to be more days like this.\nThey started slowly and missed the energy of the suspended John McGinn in midfield throughout.\nWatkins had an early goal ruled out for offside, before Wolves wing-back Rayan Ait-Nouri missed a gilt-edge chance.\nA cross from the right was flicked into the unmarked Algerian by a Villa defender, but his strike from six yards was turned over the bar by Emi Martinez.\nWolves continued to dominate possession but were hampered. The absence of key forward players Pedro Neto, Hwang Hee-chan and Matheus Cunha meant there was a lack of quality and creativity in the final third.\nDiaby's opener came almost out of the blue, stemming from a central free-kick chipped over to Alex Moreno on the left. His cross came off the outstretched leg of Doyle for Diaby to fire home first time.\nWolves manager Gary O'Neil may question his defenders, who were static and made no real attempt to block the shot.\nKonsa's goal was extremely fortuitous at the end of a free-flowing move, but come the season's end on 19 May he and Villa may well look back on this as a key day.\nWolves, who had just one shot on target in the second half, have now lost three of their past four games in all competitions with their squad depth again being exposed at the highest level."

It's good to be not so far from teams in the top 10.\"\nOn a dreadful night weather-wise on the south coast, Bournemouth had to wait until late in the game to get the winner.\nHenderson, deputising for injured first-choice keeper Sam Johnstone, had already produced a fine save to keep out Billing's header while Lloyd Kelly headed another great chance wide.\nThe closest Dominic Solanke came to adding to his 16 Premier League goals was when he fired into the side netting in the second half.\nBut Netherlands forward Kluivert sent fans home happy after great work by Semenyo.\nFive of Bournemouth's remaining eight games are away from home, including tough-looking matches at title-chasing Arsenal and Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa.\nThey are unlikely to hold much fear for Iraola's side, who are building confidence and momentum with an unbeaten Premier League run that stretches back to 24 February.\nFamiliar pattern for Palace\nFour months have passed since Crystal Palace supporters booed their own players off the pitch after a 2-0 home defeat by Bournemouth while an object was launched by a fan in the direction of then-manager Roy Hodgson.\nPalace have won just three Premier League matches since - losing seven - while they have replaced Hodgson with Oliver Glasner.\n\"If you don't score a goal you can't win,\" said the Austrian after his side's latest defeat. \"We had many good situations. You need to shoot. Maybe we have to improve, be more decisive in offensive positions.\"\nWith Joel Ward making his 300th top-flight appearance for the club, the Eagles were on their way to securing a hard-earned point when they conceded another late winner.\nIt has been a familiar pattern.

But it was Rodri who struck first for City after 11 minutes when he swept home Jeremy Doku's cross at the near post.\nVilla were dangerous on the break and drew level nine minutes later when Jhon Duran beat Stefan Ortega with a low finish after a neat exchange with Morgan Rogers.\nIt was then that Foden took charge, restoring City's lead with a low 20-yard free-kick on the stroke of half-time, although Villa's Nicolo Zaniolo played his part by turning his back in the wall.\nFoden extended City's lead after 62 minutes when he fired low past Villa's deputy keeper Robin Olsen after good work by Rodri, then claimed his treble in style seven minutes later with a fine drive into the top corner from the edge of the area.\nAnd City almost had a fifth in second-half stoppage time when Sergio Gomez side-footed Josko Gvardiol's cut-back against the outside of the post.\nThe win leaves City level on points with Liverpool, who play Sheffield United at Anfield on Thursday night, and a point behind Arsenal, who top the table after beating Luton Town.\n'Special Foden steals show in absence of Haaland & De Bruyne'\nAll our Man City content on one page\nVisit our Aston Villa page\nJoin BBC Sport's WhatsApp channels\nBrilliant Foden fills the gap\nPhil Foden's individual display hit such heights that Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola never had any cause to question or revise his decision to leave De Bruyne and Haaland to sit out a potentially dangerous clash with Aston Villa.\nIndeed, it ended up working out perfectly as City showed much of their own fluency, while De Bruyne and Haaland were able to relax and rest tired legs after recent exertions in readiness for Saturday's lunchtime visit to Crystal Palace.\nCity were subdued against Arsenal here on Sunday, but Villa were never able to exert similar control, mainly because Foden was simply too hot for them to handle.\nThis was a much more convincing City display, more cohesive, and this was mainly thanks to Foden and his deadly mixture of creation and cutting edge that did so much to fashion this victory.\nFoden's hat-trick showed all facets of his game, from the clever free-kick to put City back in front, then the composure to make it 3-1, before the final flourish of a powerful strike past a motionless Olsen into the top corner.\nHe now has 21 goals this season and if anyone needed further evidence that Foden is the complete package, this performance provided it.\nVilla's night of disappointment\nAston Villa and manager Unai Emery may have felt this was not going to be their night when talisman and World Cup-winning goalkeeper Martinez was forced to withdraw from the game through illness shortly before kick-off, having been named in the starting line-up.\nThis is not to denigrate his replacement Olsen, who had a faultless night, but it is simply a sign that the fates were against Villa, who were without their suspended captain John McGinn and had already lost main striker Ollie Watkins to injury alongside other key absentees.\nVilla did give City some anxious moments, especially when Duran scored a fine equaliser and when Douglas Luiz and Clement Lenglet forced fine saves from City keeper Ortega in swift succession with the score 2-1, but City were nearly always in control and the destiny of the points was sealed once Foden gave Guardiola's side a two-goal advantage.\nEmery's side remain in fourth place - two points ahead of Tottenham who drew at West Ham United on Tuesday - so no major damage was done, but this was a tired performance from a depleted side."

Have your say here\nWood's brilliant strike meant he has scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances, while Hudson-Odoi has racked up five goals in 22 Forest appearances - having needed 72 outings to yield the same return for Chelsea.\nForest could have scored more as Anthony Elanga's effort clipped the outside of the post, while Divock Origi - still looking for his first Premier League goal since joined the club - struck wide twice after coming off the bench.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side have taken a much-needed step towards safety with their first ever win over Fulham in the top flight, but they need to maintain this form to ensure it.\nEarly changes can't revive Fulham fortunes\nInconsistent results have summed up Fulham's season so far, with big wins against Tottenham, Manchester United and Arsenal offset by disappointing losses to Bournemouth and Burnley.\nA nightmare first half saw boss Marco Silva make a triple substitution in only the 33rd minute, bringing on Willian, Tom Cairney and Adama Traore in an attempt to turn the game around.\nFor a spell it worked, but the visitors were unable to capitalise on a dominant period and eventually conceded a third goal in added time to cap off a miserable opening half.\nHow did you rate Fulham's performance? Have your say here\nThey had to improve and did so as Willian's dipping effort was just off target and Rodrigo Muniz went close to extending his eight-goal tally.\nTraore cannoned a late strike off the bar too, but Fulham failed to replicate the heroics that saw them overturn a two-goal deficit against Sheffield United and earn a point last time out in a 3-3 draw.\nThe Cottagers have lost three of their last nine league matches and their away woes continue too with just one win in their last 15 on the road.",

We had set-pieces, we had chances, so overall hopefully it will give us good confidence.\"\nThings had looked positive when Mohammed Kudus pressed high to win the ball back near the Spurs area, before crossing from the left for Bowen to fire wide from a good position.\nSeconds later the Hammers switched off in defence and Spurs led, another example of the frailties which have frustrated fans in this campaign.\nMoyes' men have now conceded 55 league goals this season, the same number as they lost during the whole of 2022-23, and are without a clean sheet in 11 matches.\nBut there is clearly some fire in this West Ham side, sparked by the inspirational Bowen, who raised a taunting fist in defiance at the away fans after delivering the dead-ball routine for Zouma's equaliser.\nThe hosts went on to create the better chances, but could not find the winner."

I think in the last game I was definitely not right in the way I reacted, I don't want to do that. I react calmly now, but I still see the same pattern.\"\nBurnley have won just once in all competitions since 23 December and this match felt like an opportunity missed.\nThe Clarets started cautiously with full-back Vitinho testing Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa in the first half, before they took the lead through Bruun Larsen's tidy finish.\nEven after being pegged back, the hosts had spells of dominance after the restart and created chances to regain the advantage.\nGoalscorer Bruun Larsen should have doubled his tally in the 58th minute, but he fired Vitinho's cutback straight at Sa.\nThe Wolves keeper also did well to keep out a Wilson Odobert shot moments later that had deflected wickedly off a defender.\nSubstitute Jay Rodriguez managed to find the net late on but his strike was rightly ruled out for offside.\nBurnley are away to fellow strugglers Everton in their next match on Saturday (15:00 BST).\nCunha return will boost toothless Wolves\nWolves, who ended a two-match winless run, missed a handful of chances to open the scoring midway through the first half.\nJoao Gomes met Matt Doherty's header across goal but could only flick an effort over the bar when well-placed in the area, before Leon Chiwome dragged a shot wide under pressure when inside the box.\nAfter the restart, Burnley had most of the ball but Wolves continued to create on the counter-attack and had the best chances in the closing stages.\nAit-Nouri was denied by Burnley keeper Arijanet Muric when through on goal, while Mario Lemina's looping header from range glanced the outside of the post.\nThe visitors will be boosted by the return of Matheus Cunha, who came off the bench late on to make his first appearance since injuring his hamstring in February.\n\"It was a good effort from the lads,\" Wolves boss Gary O'Neil told Match of the Day. \"We're not at full strength at the moment, but we're working really hard and still fighting.\n\"Cunha's back and a point away from home takes us past last season's tally. Not a bad evening.\"\nThey host West Ham in their next match on Saturday (15:00).\nPart of stand evacuated over safety concerns\nDuring the first half, supporters were moved from a section of the Jimmy McIlroy Stand over safety concerns about the stadium's roof.\nA piece of metal could be seen hanging from the stand's roof above supporters.\nSome seating was cordoned off by stewards with the match continuing unaffected.\nThe area was then kept clear for the remainder of the game."

But it was Rodri who struck first for City after 11 minutes when he swept home Jeremy Doku's cross at the near post.\nVilla were dangerous on the break and drew level nine minutes later when Jhon Duran beat Stefan Ortega with a low finish after a neat exchange with Morgan Rogers.\nIt was then that Foden took charge, restoring City's lead with a low 20-yard free-kick on the stroke of half-time, although Villa's Nicolo Zaniolo played his part by turning his back in the wall.\nFoden extended City's lead after 62 minutes when he fired low past Villa's deputy keeper Robin Olsen after good work by Rodri, then claimed his treble in style seven minutes later with a fine drive into the top corner from the edge of the area.\nAnd City almost had a fifth in second-half stoppage time when Sergio Gomez side-footed Josko Gvardiol's cut-back against the outside of the post.\nThe win leaves City level on points with Liverpool, who play Sheffield United at Anfield on Thursday night, and a point behind Arsenal, who top the table after beating Luton Town.\n'Special Foden steals show in absence of Haaland & De Bruyne'\nAll our Man City content on one page\nVisit our Aston Villa page\nJoin BBC Sport's WhatsApp channels\nBrilliant Foden fills the gap\nPhil Foden's individual display hit such heights that Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola never had any cause to question or revise his decision to leave De Bruyne and Haaland to sit out a potentially dangerous clash with Aston Villa.\nIndeed, it ended up working out perfectly as City showed much of their own fluency, while De Bruyne and Haaland were able to relax and rest tired legs after recent exertions in readiness for Saturday's lunchtime visit to Crystal Palace.\nCity were subdued against Arsenal here on Sunday, but Villa were never able to exert similar control, mainly because Foden was simply too hot for them to handle.\nThis was a much more convincing City display, more cohesive, and this was mainly thanks to Foden and his deadly mixture of creation and cutting edge that did so much to fashion this victory.\nFoden's hat-trick showed all facets of his game, from the clever free-kick to put City back in front, then the composure to make it 3-1, before the final flourish of a powerful strike past a motionless Olsen into the top corner.\nHe now has 21 goals this season and if anyone needed further evidence that Foden is the complete package, this performance provided it.\nVilla's night of disappointment\nAston Villa and manager Unai Emery may have felt this was not going to be their night when talisman and World Cup-winning goalkeeper Martinez was forced to withdraw from the game through illness shortly before kick-off, having been named in the starting line-up.\nThis is not to denigrate his replacement Olsen, who had a faultless night, but it is simply a sign that the fates were against Villa, who were without their suspended captain John McGinn and had already lost main striker Ollie Watkins to injury alongside other key absentees.\nVilla did give City some anxious moments, especially when Duran scored a fine equaliser and when Douglas Luiz and Clement Lenglet forced fine saves from City keeper Ortega in swift succession with the score 2-1, but City were nearly always in control and the destiny of the points was sealed once Foden gave Guardiola's side a two-goal advantage.\nEmery's side remain in fourth place - two points ahead of Tottenham who drew at West Ham United on Tuesday - so no major damage was done, but this was a tired performance from a depleted side.",

The Cameroon forward has not started a match since suffering an ankle injury in the fixture at Brighton in December.\nJoin BBC Sport's WhatsApp channels\nPedro return can't spark Seagulls\nBrighton also lacked a goal threat, despite the return from injury of top scorer Joao Pedro.\nThat the Brazilian has missed the last six games yet remains their leading marksman with eight league goals, is an indicator of the absent cutting edge that has kept the Seagulls on the periphery of European qualification.\nMost of Brighton's best attacking moments came through Pedro, who forced home keeper Mark Flekken into a sharp near post save late in the first half.\nA draw does represent some improvement for Brighton, however, as they avoided losing five away matches in a row across all competitions for the first time since 2006."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Spurs' display? Send us your views here\nFootball Daily podcast: Reaction to Tuesday's games\n'We have more time than we think'\nWhen asked why they lacked that clarity, Postecoglou said: \"Because they're human beings, mate, it's just football.\n\"I'd like to have a joystick and put them where I want but it doesn't work that way. My role is to try to help them through that.\n\"At times, we have more time than we think. We scored a great goal but there are times the ball is flashed across when we should have been in those areas. It's things to work on.\"\nTottenham led when Johnson - brought in as one of three changes to the Spurs starting line-up from Saturday's win over Luton - turned in from close range after Timo Werner was allowed space to get in behind the left side of West Ham's defence to fire in a low cross.\nBut West Ham responded well, and their tactics of swinging in corners to put Spurs goalkeeper Gigi Vicario under pressure worked when Jarrod Bowen's 19th-minute set-piece was nodded in from five yards by Zouma.\nThe Hammers came closest to finding a winner after the break, but Michail Antonio shot straight at Vicario after the Jamaica international had overpowered Micky van de Ven to get one-on-one with the keeper.\nWest Ham stay seventh, in the Europa Conference League qualification place, as both Newcastle and Wolves failed to win.\nRelive West Ham v Spurs and the rest of Tuesday's Premier League action\nVicario impresses but set-piece struggles continue\nWith the promise of fourth place on offer, Spurs came out of the traps quicker than in recent games.\nTheir fifth-minute opener came after their previous 12 league goals were all scored in the second halves of matches, a run dating back to 3 February.\nBut an old weakness reared its head again as they conceded from a corner dropped on top of Vicario, who had twice punched unconvincingly at earlier set-pieces.\nThe Italian has largely impressed following his move from Empoli last June and made more crucial saves here - flying to his left for a two-handed stop from a James Ward-Prowse first-half free-kick and then denying Antonio twice after the break.\nBut corners remain a weakness which he and Spurs must address.\nJoin BBC Sport's WhatsApp channels\nBowen shines but defensive frailties hurt Hammers\nManager David Moyes will have wanted a response from West Ham after the galling 4-3 defeat at Newcastle, having been two goals ahead with 15 minutes remaining. Despite the early goal conceded, his team delivered.\n\"I genuinely thought we didn't deserve to go behind,\" Moyes told TNT Sports. \"But the players did a good job.\n\"We had a threat and so did they - they are a good side and that's why they are challenging for the Champions League. Maybe a draw was the right result in the end.\n\"I'm sure after the way we played on the weekend, to see the way the defence played [here], we looked much more organised. We had set-pieces, we had chances, so overall hopefully it will give us good confidence.\"\nThings had looked positive when Mohammed Kudus pressed high to win the ball back near the Spurs area, before crossing from the left for Bowen to fire wide from a good position.\nSeconds later the Hammers switched off in defence and Spurs led, another example of the frailties which have frustrated fans in this campaign.\nMoyes' men have now conceded 55 league goals this season, the same number as they lost during the whole of 2022-23, and are without a clean sheet in 11 matches.\nBut there is clearly some fire in this West Ham side, sparked by the inspirational Bowen, who raised a taunting fist in defiance at the away fans after delivering the dead-ball routine for Zouma's equaliser.\nThe hosts went on to create the better chances, but could not find the winner.",

Have your say here\nWood's brilliant strike meant he has scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances, while Hudson-Odoi has racked up five goals in 22 Forest appearances - having needed 72 outings to yield the same return for Chelsea.\nForest could have scored more as Anthony Elanga's effort clipped the outside of the post, while Divock Origi - still looking for his first Premier League goal since joined the club - struck wide twice after coming off the bench.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side have taken a much-needed step towards safety with their first ever win over Fulham in the top flight, but they need to maintain this form to ensure it.\nEarly changes can't revive Fulham fortunes\nInconsistent results have summed up Fulham's season so far, with big wins against Tottenham, Manchester United and Arsenal offset by disappointing losses to Bournemouth and Burnley.\nA nightmare first half saw boss Marco Silva make a triple substitution in only the 33rd minute, bringing on Willian, Tom Cairney and Adama Traore in an attempt to turn the game around.\nFor a spell it worked, but the visitors were unable to capitalise on a dominant period and eventually conceded a third goal in added time to cap off a miserable opening half.\nHow did you rate Fulham's performance? Have your say here\nThey had to improve and did so as Willian's dipping effort was just off target and Rodrigo Muniz went close to extending his eight-goal tally.\nTraore cannoned a late strike off the bar too, but Fulham failed to replicate the heroics that saw them overturn a two-goal deficit against Sheffield United and earn a point last time out in a 3-3 draw.\nThe Cottagers have lost three of their last nine league matches and their away woes continue too with just one win in their last 15 on the road."

A 3-3 draw with bottom side Sheffield United was followed by the 3-1 loss to relegation-battling Forest on Tuesday.\nSix points from those two games would have pushed Silva's side into the mix for a European place, but they are seemingly now out of that picture.\nWith summer additions and Silva having more time to work with his squad, Fulham may feel a more sustained push for Europe will be realistic, having discovered the hard way the damage a late-season dip can cause.",

His shot though dropped just wide.\nAnd there were further 'what if?' moments just after Wood's equaliser.\nVicario could only parry Ryan Yates' low shot straight to Wood, but the forward smashed the rebound against the post from four yards out.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison was then lucky to go unpunished after clashing with Ryan Yates, with Nuno claiming the player \"punched Yates in the stomach\".\nAfter Luton's win over Bournemouth on Saturday, Forest were unable to give themselves a cushion over their relegation rivals.\nThey face Wolves at home in their next match in six days' time."

I spoke to the players about finding that winning mentality.\n\"We worked very hard to see the game through.

Send us your views here\nNervy Toffees hold on for crucial win\nDespite setting an unwanted club record of 13 successive Premier League games without victory in Tuesday's game at Newcastle, Everton came into this game on the back of a hugely encouraging second-half display at St James' Park.\nDyche's team had the better of a first half that was low on quality and chances, but Burnley appeared to grow in confidence as the game approached the half-hour mark and the home fans became increasingly restless as a result.\nThe first half appeared to be petering out as it entered stoppage time, but Calvert-Lewin charged down Muric's attempted clearance to break the deadlock in unorthodox fashion.\nThe last time the 27-year-old found the net in back-to-back Premier League games was in September, when he scored in a win over Brentford and a defeat by Luton.\n\"I'm really pleased for him,\" Dyche said. \"Strikers sometimes need an ugly goal.\n\"He closed [the goalkeeper] down well, and a few minutes earlier he had a similar situation where he didn't quite get [to the ball]. It's two in two for him now - fair play to him.\"\nThe Toffees had opportunities to double their advantage after the interval, with Calvert-Lewin sending a right-footed drive straight at Muric before second-half substitute Beto failed to race clear of the Burnley back line after latching on to Andre Gomes' through ball.\nThe home fans had to endure a nervous end to the game, but aside from Brownhill's shot, which whistled narrowly wide of the angle between post and bar, Burnley rarely tested Jordan Pickford in the Everton goal.\nEverton are set to find out next week whether they will face another points deduction for a second alleged breach of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules, but this was a crucial win regardless.\nClarets running out of time\nBurnley were frustrated not to beat Wolves in midweek, but this defeat - which ended their four-game unbeaten run - could have more severe ramifications for their survival battle.\nVincent Kompany's side remain six points adrift of safety, and trail the Toffees by 10 points with just six games left to play.\nThe visitors grew into the game after a tentative start, with David Datro Fofana heading straight at Pickford prior to Calvert-Lewin's fortuitous opener.\nBut the young striker's header proved to be the Clarets' only effort on target despite enjoying 63% possession against a Toffees side who, while playing a large chunk of the second half with a man advantage, were relieved to see the game out.\n\"I don't think you need to overanalyse [the mistakes],\" Kompany told BBC Match of the Day when asked about Muric's error and O'Shea's red card. \"The main thing for us is that I think we played really well again. It's unfortunate.\n\"We knew we had to work hard to create chances, but in the moments when we got into the right areas we lacked that little bit of a spark to turn a game in which we played well into a win.\"\nBurnley have now failed to score in 12 of their 32 league games this season - the most of any team in the top flight.",

An eight-point advantage, which they held as late as 7 April, evaporated entirely.\nWith seven games to go this time, there remains no sign of Arteta's side falling away as they seek redemption in a fascinating three-team title race.\nWith last year's painful experience and another 12 months of progress behind them - as evidenced by the steely point achieved at champions Manchester City last week - the Gunners appear to be getting stronger as they chase the club's first league title since 2004.\nThey have now won 10 of their past 11 league games, taking 31 points out of a possible 33 in 2024, with an aggregate score of 38-4.\nThough his team-mates won without him in midweek, Saka displayed his vital importance to Arsenal's title ambitions, with the Gunners heavily favouring attacks down the right. The 22-year-old England international now has 30 goal involvements in 39 appearances this season.\nAfter Gabriel missed a chance to put the visitors ahead inside the opening two minutes when he headed Martin Odegaard's superb free-kick wide of the target, Saka looked poised to score after cutting inside onto his left foot but curled wide.\nBut he has now matched the 14 league goals he managed last season, and his confident spot-kick hinted at Arsenal's increased maturity.\nHavertz is also hitting form at the perfect time for the Gunners, with the former Chelsea player having nine goal involvements - including five goals - in the past seven league games.\nManager Arteta said: \"We are older. We went through a lot of moments together and you build the chemistry within the team.\n\"We signed some tremendous players as well, which helps. The squad is healthy and the momentum is good.\n\"My energy is the same [as this stage last season], the enthusiasm is the same. I'm just enjoying the moment and embracing it, and let's see how far we can go.\"\nArsenal appear to face a tougher run-in than City and Liverpool, with the likes of Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United to come. But, with strong momentum, attention now turns to the first leg of a Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich at Emirates Stadium on Tuesday.\nBrighton stuttering in bid to repeat European feat\nBrighton have won only three of their past 12 league games following this defeat, which ended a club record 12-match unbeaten top-flight home run.\nThey have also scored just three times in their past eight fixtures across all competitions. As in their frustrating midweek goalless draw at Brentford, shortcomings in the final third were evident once again here.\nBoss Roberto de Zerbi, whose impact since last season has seen him linked with jobs at Liverpool and Bayern Munich, watched encouraging build-up play and effective pressing fail to translate into meaningful attempts on goal as Brighton managed just one shot on target in each half.\nThey now face an uphill battle to qualify for European football for a second successive season. Their bid to achieve that resumes at struggling Burnley next Saturday."

It shows we are able to create chances - but of course when you concede four goals, you lose.\"\nCity were too strong in the end and, while Guardiola was able to rest Foden and Bernardo Silva, De Bruyne stepped up to show his quality and claim his landmark goal after an injury-plagued season.\nIn another boost, defender John Stones managed to play the full match upon his return after being injured on England duty.\nPalace have proved a tough opponent for City in the past - they came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at the Etihad in December - so this was a vital victory for Guardiola's side to keep up the pressure on their rivals.",

In these type of games when you lose the territorial advantage you are going to struggle.\"\nBournemouth's highest finish in the five seasons they have spent in the Premier League came in 2016-17 when they came ninth.\nSix points from their final seven matches would set a new top-flight club record, eclipsing the total they achieved in that season.\nHowever, this defeat was a setback to their hopes of playing in European competition for the first time and they are now seven points behind seventh-placed West Ham.\nIf Iraola's side miss out on a debut continental campaign by a narrow margin they will come to rue this result."

It's about being tough, more responsible and trying to play.\"\nMcBurnie delivers late joy for Blades\nAn immediate return to the Championship may be looming for Sheffield United but, as they did in defeat by title-chasing Liverpool in midweek, they displayed ample character and fight against Chelsea to offer Chris Wilder optimism.\nUnited failed to capitalise on a rare early chance when Ben Brereton Diaz had an attempt blocked by Moises Caicedo after McBurnie pounced on a loose pass by Silva.\nThe industrious Gustavo Hamer tested Petrovic from distance as the hosts gained a foothold in the contest and, after assisting Bogle, the former Coventry City midfielder unleashed a ferocious strike narrowly wide as United continued to put Chelsea under pressure.\nMcBurnie's late strike provided what will feel a deserved outcome for those urging the home side on at Bramall Lane, supporters who have endured their fair share of difficult days on the club's top-flight return.\nDefence will be an obvious area of concern for Wilder looking ahead, as demonstrated by the complete lack of awareness as Silva moved freely into space to score Chelsea's opener, and they have already set a Premier League record for most home goals conceded in a season (47).\n\"It was always going to be a challenge but I thought the team was outstanding,\" Wilder said.\n\"The boys went full-tilt against top players. A big effort from them. It didn't feel as if we are in the situation we are in. I do believe they [the fans] understand the situation we are in. The supporters were there when we needed it the most, which was towards the end of the game.\n\"You have to get that type of performance to have the opportunity to get a result. We have been inconsistent this season but now we are showing a decent level. Now I am understanding and accepting what type of performance I am going to get.\""

Spurs have won 13 and lost just two of the 20 Premier League matches he's played in.\nWith Tottenham pressing, the 22-year-old regularly found himself pushing into midfield. Picking the ball up on the edge of the box, he took his chance superbly for his goal, his second in the Premier League.\nTottenham captain Son Heung-min also had an effort tipped on to the post by Forest keeper Matz Sels in the closing stages.\nThe north London side continue their push for the top four when they visit Newcastle next Saturday.\nForest ponder what might have been\nNottingham Forest recorded a fine 3-1 win over Fulham last time out to end a six-match winless run, but were second best against Spurs.\nThat said, the visitors did have plenty of bright moments as their manager Nuno Espirito Santo faced his former employers for the first time.\nDefender Murillo almost netted a goal-of-the-season contender, spotting Tottenham keeper Guglielmo Vicario off his line and attempting to lob him from well inside his own half. His shot though dropped just wide.\nAnd there were further 'what if?' moments just after Wood's equaliser.\nVicario could only parry Ryan Yates' low shot straight to Wood, but the forward smashed the rebound against the post from four yards out.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison was then lucky to go unpunished after clashing with Ryan Yates, with Nuno claiming the player \"punched Yates in the stomach\".\nAfter Luton's win over Bournemouth on Saturday, Forest were unable to give themselves a cushion over their relegation rivals.\nThey face Wolves at home in their next match in six days' time.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-2 West Ham United: Ward-Prowse scores direct from corner in win\nJames Ward-Prowse scored direct from a corner to give West Ham a precious Premier League win at Wolves - but the victory was marred by an injury scare around Jarrod Bowen.\nWard-Prowse's 84th-minute effort swerved over Wolves keeper Jose Sa and dipped in at the far post to complete a second-half comeback after Lucas Paqueta cancelled out Pabio Sarabia's penalty with his own coolly-taken spot-kick.\nThe game ended in controversy though as Wolves were denied what they thought was an equaliser in the ninth minute of stoppage time for an offside against young substitute Tawanda Chirewa. He was deemed to have impeded Lukasz Fabianski, even though the Hammers goalkeeper was getting nowhere near Max Kilman's header.\nRelive Wolves v West Ham and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Wolves' performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of West Ham's display? Send us your views here\nHowever, David Moyes' joy at victory will be tempered significantly by the loss of Bowen.\nThe England forward appeared to hurt his hip as he fell awkwardly five minutes into the second period and although he tried to continue, it quickly became apparent he had to go off.\nBowen made his way straight to the dressing room but was moving very slowly as he went.\n\"It was a knee into his hip or back,\" said Moyes. \"The good thing is it isn't a twist. But he is really stiff. I asked him how he was and he said 'sore'.\n\"I have had one or two of those myself and they don't go away too quickly. We have to hope it doesn't linger.\"\nWith 19 goals, Bowen is by far West Ham's biggest attacking threat and would have been a key man in his club's Europa League quarter-final first-leg tie in Germany on Thursday against a Bayer Leverkusen side yet to lose a game under Xabi Alonso this season.\n\"I am hoping it won't be too bad - in this week of all weeks, we need all our big players to be ready,\" Moyes added.\nOnly their third Premier League triumph of 2024, the victory keeps alive West Ham's hopes of securing European qualification for an unprecedented fourth consecutive season through their Premier League position.\nFor Wolves, a fourth game without a win in all competitions matches their longest run of the season as injuries continue to hamper Gary O'Neil's hopes of a top-half finish.\nO'Neil fury but delight for Moyes\nAfter the game, O'Neil marched straight to referee Tony Harrington, who made the decision to rule out what would have been Wolves' late equaliser after being asked to look at the pitchside monitor.\nWolves feel they have been on the wrong end of too many crucial calls this term and this was another that will frustrate them hugely.\nNot that Moyes will be concerned about that as West Ham went level on points with his former club Manchester United.\nIt was intriguing to see former Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper in the stands for one of those games that irritates West Ham fans about Moyes, whose future beyond the end of the season remains open to question with the Scot yet to indicate whether he will sign the contract extension he says he has been offered.\nMoyes opted to leave Michail Antonio on the bench and pick Paqueta as his wide left attacking option.\nAside from an inexplicable miss from Tomas Soucek, who trod on the ball with the goal at his mercy after Bowen had robbed Nelson Semedo by the goalline and delivered the perfect cutback into the Czech's path, West Ham were non-existent as an attacking force in the opening period.\nAntonio replaced Soucek at the break, which transformed the flow of the contest.\nWest Ham made light of Bowen's early exit and with Antonio pushing Wolves' defence back, the home side were unable to relieve growing pressure around their penalty area.\nAfter Kilman had handled Emerson's cross, Paqueta kept his nerve to beat Jose Sa's despairing dive by millimetres.\nThen, after Matt Doherty had denied Mohammed Kudus a shooting chance, Ward-Prowse delivered the precision from the corner flag that Wolves could not repel.\nAit-Nouri shines in Wolves defeat\nHad Julen Lopetegui remained as Wolves manager this season rather than quitting days before it began, it is hard to imagine Rayan Ait-Nouri making the impact he has.\nThe Algerian started two Premier League games for Lopetegui. One was in a fabulous victory at Liverpool, but it is clear Lopetegui didn't fancy him.\nGiven an extended opportunity by O'Neil, Ait-Nouri has proved the folly of Lopetegui's decision-making.\nThe issue, it appears, was down to Ait-Nouri's attitude. O'Neil has worked both on that and the defender's fitness.\nThe result is a far more decisive player, capable at the back but, as has been seen during Wolves' injury-riddled second half of the season, a real danger when he runs at defences.\nAit-Nouri had already won a corner with a length-of-the-field burst that ended with a blocked shot, when he surged into the box to win Wolves' first-half penalty.\nEvidently, Moyes did not think much of the decision but Sarabia's finish was well deserved on the balance of play.\nAs for Ait-Nouri, it was another valuable contribution, which will focus minds around his complicated contractual situation.\nWolves are currently committed to a 50% sell-on clause as part of the \u00a39.5m deal that saw him signed from French club Angers in 2020, but the contract be bought out at any point.\nOn this evidence, Wolves will surely want to do that given the player's current value far exceeds his purchase price and Ait-Nouri is bound to attract attention from bigger and richer clubs this summer."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here\nReaction to all Saturday's Premier League matches\nThird-bottom Luton had spent most of the first half chasing shadows as Bournemouth's players weaved a neat tapestry of passes.\nAfter Tavernier had struck the woodwork for the Cherries with an exquisite curling free-kick, Justin Kluivert's low effort shaved a coat of paint off the base of the post.\nLuton failed to register an attempt on target before the break, but manufactured three opportunities in the space of a few minutes after the restart.\nThe best of them saw visiting goalkeeper Neto dive full length to his right to keep out a rasping drive from the lively Morris, but it was 12th-placed Bournemouth who struck first in the 52nd minute.\nAfter some neat interplay down the right flank, Tavernier opened up his body to Kluivert's lay-off and struck a low swerving shot into the corner of the net.\nMorris hit the outside of the post at the other end with a low effort and Alfie Doughty side-footed the ball at Neto from a tight angle, before their pressure paid off.\nCherries defender Lloyd Kelly lost a 50-50 with Luke Berry on the edge of the box and Clark pounced on the loose ball and hooked in a finish from near the penalty spot to net his first Premier League goal.\nLuton showed the greater desire to win the game in a tense finale and their diligence was rewarded when Morris outmuscled lllia Zabarnyi to meet Woodrow's fine delivery into the box.\nVital victory gives spirited Hatters hope\nLuton visit defending champions Manchester City next, but of the teams battling relegation they arguably have the most desirable run in.\nEdwards' side - depleted by injuries with 10 players absent for this encounter - have shown admirable esprit des corps this season.\nSo, inevitably, this victory against a stylish Bournemouth side was underpinned by that indefatigable spirit instigated by the Hatters boss.\nIt was epitomised by captain Morris. Without a goal in five league appearances, he never let his head drop and worked tirelessly to sniff out chances.\nThe forward kept his composure as the clocked ticked towards the end and steered home a priceless ninth goal of the campaign.\nEdwards was ebullient at the final whistle, clenching his fists and roaring to the home fans who chanted \"the Town are staying up\".\nA result such as this has the possibility to generate the kind of momentum which could now prove crucial in their remaining six games.\nMidfielder Clark, whose goal was his first in the Premier League, told BBC Match of the Day: \"A massive win. We knew after the two defeats to Tottenham and Arsenal this was a key game.\n\"Obviously every game is important but we knew this was the start of our mini-season.\"\nBournemouth's European hopes dented\nFor Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola, surprisingly linked with Barcelona job earlier this week, this was a reminder of the ruthless nature of English football.\nThe Cherries were in control, but unable to convert their first-half dominance into goals against an opposition who refused to lie down.\n\"We should have been more ruthless in the first half because the wind today was key,\" said Iraola.\n\"It was in our favour in the first half, but we didn't damage them. In these type of games when you lose the territorial advantage you are going to struggle.\"\nBournemouth's highest finish in the five seasons they have spent in the Premier League came in 2016-17 when they came ninth.\nSix points from their final seven matches would set a new top-flight club record, eclipsing the total they achieved in that season.\nHowever, this defeat was a setback to their hopes of playing in European competition for the first time and they are now seven points behind seventh-placed West Ham.\nIf Iraola's side miss out on a debut continental campaign by a narrow margin they will come to rue this result.",

It shows we are able to create chances - but of course when you concede four goals, you lose.\"\nCity were too strong in the end and, while Guardiola was able to rest Foden and Bernardo Silva, De Bruyne stepped up to show his quality and claim his landmark goal after an injury-plagued season.\nIn another boost, defender John Stones managed to play the full match upon his return after being injured on England duty.\nPalace have proved a tough opponent for City in the past - they came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at the Etihad in December - so this was a vital victory for Guardiola's side to keep up the pressure on their rivals."

Send us your views here\nHowever, David Moyes' joy at victory will be tempered significantly by the loss of Bowen.\nThe England forward appeared to hurt his hip as he fell awkwardly five minutes into the second period and although he tried to continue, it quickly became apparent he had to go off.\nBowen made his way straight to the dressing room but was moving very slowly as he went.\n\"It was a knee into his hip or back,\" said Moyes. \"The good thing is it isn't a twist. But he is really stiff. I asked him how he was and he said 'sore'.\n\"I have had one or two of those myself and they don't go away too quickly. We have to hope it doesn't linger.\"\nWith 19 goals, Bowen is by far West Ham's biggest attacking threat and would have been a key man in his club's Europa League quarter-final first-leg tie in Germany on Thursday against a Bayer Leverkusen side yet to lose a game under Xabi Alonso this season.\n\"I am hoping it won't be too bad - in this week of all weeks, we need all our big players to be ready,\" Moyes added.\nOnly their third Premier League triumph of 2024, the victory keeps alive West Ham's hopes of securing European qualification for an unprecedented fourth consecutive season through their Premier League position.\nFor Wolves, a fourth game without a win in all competitions matches their longest run of the season as injuries continue to hamper Gary O'Neil's hopes of a top-half finish.\nO'Neil fury but delight for Moyes\nAfter the game, O'Neil marched straight to referee Tony Harrington, who made the decision to rule out what would have been Wolves' late equaliser after being asked to look at the pitchside monitor.\nWolves feel they have been on the wrong end of too many crucial calls this term and this was another that will frustrate them hugely.\nNot that Moyes will be concerned about that as West Ham went level on points with his former club Manchester United.\nIt was intriguing to see former Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper in the stands for one of those games that irritates West Ham fans about Moyes, whose future beyond the end of the season remains open to question with the Scot yet to indicate whether he will sign the contract extension he says he has been offered.\nMoyes opted to leave Michail Antonio on the bench and pick Paqueta as his wide left attacking option.\nAside from an inexplicable miss from Tomas Soucek, who trod on the ball with the goal at his mercy after Bowen had robbed Nelson Semedo by the goalline and delivered the perfect cutback into the Czech's path, West Ham were non-existent as an attacking force in the opening period.\nAntonio replaced Soucek at the break, which transformed the flow of the contest.\nWest Ham made light of Bowen's early exit and with Antonio pushing Wolves' defence back, the home side were unable to relieve growing pressure around their penalty area.\nAfter Kilman had handled Emerson's cross, Paqueta kept his nerve to beat Jose Sa's despairing dive by millimetres.\nThen, after Matt Doherty had denied Mohammed Kudus a shooting chance, Ward-Prowse delivered the precision from the corner flag that Wolves could not repel.\nAit-Nouri shines in Wolves defeat\nHad Julen Lopetegui remained as Wolves manager this season rather than quitting days before it began, it is hard to imagine Rayan Ait-Nouri making the impact he has.\nThe Algerian started two Premier League games for Lopetegui. One was in a fabulous victory at Liverpool, but it is clear Lopetegui didn't fancy him.\nGiven an extended opportunity by O'Neil, Ait-Nouri has proved the folly of Lopetegui's decision-making.\nThe issue, it appears, was down to Ait-Nouri's attitude. O'Neil has worked both on that and the defender's fitness.\nThe result is a far more decisive player, capable at the back but, as has been seen during Wolves' injury-riddled second half of the season, a real danger when he runs at defences.\nAit-Nouri had already won a corner with a length-of-the-field burst that ended with a blocked shot, when he surged into the box to win Wolves' first-half penalty.\nEvidently, Moyes did not think much of the decision but Sarabia's finish was well deserved on the balance of play.\nAs for Ait-Nouri, it was another valuable contribution, which will focus minds around his complicated contractual situation.\nWolves are currently committed to a 50% sell-on clause as part of the \u00a39.5m deal that saw him signed from French club Angers in 2020, but the contract be bought out at any point.\nOn this evidence, Wolves will surely want to do that given the player's current value far exceeds his purchase price and Ait-Nouri is bound to attract attention from bigger and richer clubs this summer.",

An eight-point advantage, which they held as late as 7 April, evaporated entirely.\nWith seven games to go this time, there remains no sign of Arteta's side falling away as they seek redemption in a fascinating three-team title race.\nWith last year's painful experience and another 12 months of progress behind them - as evidenced by the steely point achieved at champions Manchester City last week - the Gunners appear to be getting stronger as they chase the club's first league title since 2004.\nThey have now won 10 of their past 11 league games, taking 31 points out of a possible 33 in 2024, with an aggregate score of 38-4.\nThough his team-mates won without him in midweek, Saka displayed his vital importance to Arsenal's title ambitions, with the Gunners heavily favouring attacks down the right. The 22-year-old England international now has 30 goal involvements in 39 appearances this season.\nAfter Gabriel missed a chance to put the visitors ahead inside the opening two minutes when he headed Martin Odegaard's superb free-kick wide of the target, Saka looked poised to score after cutting inside onto his left foot but curled wide.\nBut he has now matched the 14 league goals he managed last season, and his confident spot-kick hinted at Arsenal's increased maturity.\nHavertz is also hitting form at the perfect time for the Gunners, with the former Chelsea player having nine goal involvements - including five goals - in the past seven league games.\nManager Arteta said: \"We are older. We went through a lot of moments together and you build the chemistry within the team.\n\"We signed some tremendous players as well, which helps. The squad is healthy and the momentum is good.\n\"My energy is the same [as this stage last season], the enthusiasm is the same. I'm just enjoying the moment and embracing it, and let's see how far we can go.\"\nArsenal appear to face a tougher run-in than City and Liverpool, with the likes of Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United to come. But, with strong momentum, attention now turns to the first leg of a Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich at Emirates Stadium on Tuesday.\nBrighton stuttering in bid to repeat European feat\nBrighton have won only three of their past 12 league games following this defeat, which ended a club record 12-match unbeaten top-flight home run.\nThey have also scored just three times in their past eight fixtures across all competitions. As in their frustrating midweek goalless draw at Brentford, shortcomings in the final third were evident once again here.\nBoss Roberto de Zerbi, whose impact since last season has seen him linked with jobs at Liverpool and Bayern Munich, watched encouraging build-up play and effective pressing fail to translate into meaningful attempts on goal as Brighton managed just one shot on target in each half.\nThey now face an uphill battle to qualify for European football for a second successive season.

With the Blues' defence faltering, his importance in his side's pursuit of Europe cannot be overstated.\n\"The way we conceded in the last few minutes is frustrating and I am disappointed but if you analyse the game the draw is fair,\" manager Pochettino said.\n\"We are scoring and the problem is we are conceding a lot.

A big effort from them. It didn't feel as if we are in the situation we are in. I do believe they [the fans] understand the situation we are in. The supporters were there when we needed it the most, which was towards the end of the game.\n\"You have to get that type of performance to have the opportunity to get a result.

We expect the goalkeeper and demand that the goalkeeper is able to play with his feet.\n\"On this occasion it didn't go for us but we don't look at it as the goalkeeper's mistake.\"\nBellamy was standing in for manager Vincent Kompany, who was absent from the dugout after receiving a one-match ban for a red card at Chelsea last month.\nJosh Brownhill had given Burnley's chances of Premier League survival a glimmer of hope on 74 minutes when he nipped in to take advantage of a short backpass from Carlos Baleba and the ball cannoned in off the side of keeper Bart Verbruggen to give the home side the lead.\nBut just five minutes later Muric's error levelled proceedings and Burnley could not restore their advantage to take all three points.\nIt comes one week after the Kosovan made another mistake to hand Everton a 1-0 victory over Kompany's side with the 25-year-old favoured over usual number one keeper James Trafford in their past five games.\nTrafford was dropped for Burnley's win over Brentford last month after fans called for him to be replaced, and the England Under-21s shot-stopper has not played since.\nReaction to Burnley v Brighton plus Saturday's other Premier League action\nFight for Premier League survival - who will go down?\nIn a game of few chances, Burnley had the better of them in the opening 45 minutes as Jacob Bruun Larsen missed a tap-in at the back post from five yards before David Datro Fofana could not connect with a brilliant Wilson Odobert pass to slide home.\nThe home side were denied an early penalty after a clumsy foul by Pervis Estupinan on Odobert but were ultimately left to rue their missed chances.\nThe result leaves Brighton 10th in the Premier League while Burnley are still firmly rooted in the relegation zone, six points from safety.\nBurnley losing hope as Brighton peter out\nKompany has often talked this season about his side playing better than their opponents, but those good performances mean nothing if not reflected in results.\nBurnley have lost a club-record 11 of their 17 Premier League home matches this season and failed to score in 12 of their 33 league games - the most of any team in the top flight.\nAfter two glorious chances in the first half Jay Rodriguez also went close in the second period and defensively Burnley were solid.\nBut, leading games before capitulating through needless errors has been the story of their season - 24 points dropped from leading positions evidence of that.\nThey will see this as two points lost rather than one gained with tough games against Manchester United and Tottenham on the horizon.\nAs things stand, a point is likely not enough to give Burnley any real hopes of survival and the crestfallen reaction of their players at full-time suggested they also thought that to be the case.\nWhat did you make of Burnley's display? Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Brighton's performance? Have your say here\nThe result will hurt more given Brighton were not at their best at Turf Moor and recent results suggest the Seagulls' season is at risk of petering out.\nThey did improve in the second half, pressing with more intensity as Pascal Gross saw an effort tipped over the bar and Joao Pedro headed just wide from a corner.\nBut, having qualified for Europe for the first time in their history last season, they have now secured just six victories in their past 26 league games and another season of playing on the continent is starting to look unlikely.\nManager Roberto de Zerbi was already without nine first-team players and his list of casualties could be extended to 10 after Estupinan had to be replaced early in the first half having sustained an apparent ankle injury off the ball.\nThe Italian's side have picked up just two points from their past four games and it seems the addition of European football to their schedule has proved a step too far this campaign."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Luton's display? Send us your views here\nCity win without Rodri\nCity have done something they have not managed yet this season, winning a league game without Rodri.\nThe influential midfielder has missed three league games this season through suspension, the only three defeats City have experienced in the league.\nHe said he needed a rest after Tuesday's 3-3 Champions League quarter-final thriller with Real Madrid and manager Pep Guardiola obliged. Rodri was on the bench but City did not need him.\nEderson was back in goal after a month out and he had a comfortable afternoon to ease back into the action.\nIt was a comfortable afternoon for everyone in a light blue shirt.\nHaaland should have scored in the first minute when he was sent one-on-one by Kevin de Bruyne. His shot was saved by Thomas Kaminski and his follow-up was going wide before being deflected in by Hashioka, who was almost knocked out by the effort.\nIt was non-stop pressure and dominance from City, who lived in Luton's defensive third, but it took them until their 27th shot to double their lead through Kovacic's half-volley from Julian Alvarez's cross.\nHaaland looked set for another frustrating afternoon in front of goal until Doku was chopped down by Onyedinma, and the Norwegian converted a penalty for his 20th Premier League goal of the season.\nAfter Luton pulled one back, Doku again took on Onyedinma - who this time dared not lunge in - before finding the bottom corner.\nGvardiol netted a fine goal in Madrid on Tuesday and got another in stoppage time from Doku's pass.\nHow long defending champions City remain top depends on Liverpool and Arsenal. Guardiola's side need the pair to slip up at least once in the closing weeks.\nNot the game for Luton to target\nLuton are now a point behind Nottingham Forest in the battle to stay up after Forest's 2-2 draw with Wolves.\nBut this was never a game manager Rob Edwards would have expected something from.\nThe Luton fans who made the trip enjoyed themselves and made plenty of noise - these are the kind of games they would have been looking forward to, and perhaps fearful of, after last season's promotion.\nLuton managed four shots, although they were good ones with Cauley Woodrow hitting the crossbar and Barkley finishing following a stepover after a City defensive mistake.\nLuton's next game - at home to Brentford on 20 April - is huge.\nFight for Premier League survival - who will go down?",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Sheff Utd's display? Send us your views here\nThe visitors started brightly with Ben Brereton Diaz breaking free down the left but he scuffed the shot with just Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken to beat.\nBrentford soon took charge but despite dominating possession, they struggled to create many chances with Neal Maupay stabbing wide their best opportunity of the first half after United defender Anel Ahmedhodzic gave the ball away inside his own half.\nIt was a similar story after the break with Mathias Jorgensen seeing a goal ruled out for offside minutes before Brentford's fortuitous opener.\nDamsgaard thought he had doubled the lead soon after but the VAR intervened to rule out his crisp volley from Bryan Mbeumo's free-kick for a foul on Oli McBurnie in the build-up.\nThe Blades pushed for an equaliser but Cameron Archer's wayward shot from a tight angle was as close as they came before Onyeka latched on to the fit-again Kevin Schade's flick-on to fire in the clincher for Brentford.\nBrentford close in on top-flight survival\nBrentford's third season in the Premier League has surely been their toughest but with five games to go, they can begin to plan for a fourth year in the top flight with that bit more confidence.\nThe celebrations that followed a first home win since 20 January certainly suggested as much with Frank and his players soaking up the applause of a satisfied home support at the Gtech.\n\"This has definitely been the most challenging season,\" Frank told BBC Match of the Day. \"Injuries, actually performing quite good, Ivan's been banned... all of that.\n\"It's been tough but it just reminds you why it is the best league in the world. It's so difficult.\"\nThis was not a game to elicit much excitement from the neutrals but it wasn't for them. With both sides battling to stay up, the result was all that mattered - and Brentford got it.\nThat it came after a match that could only generously be said to have provided sporadic glimpses of quality will not bother anyone of a Brentford persuasion.\n\"It was not a final but this is so important. Today was not through the roof but I think it was a good performance,\" Frank added.\nAs was the case for the entirety of the first half of the season, it was achieved without Ivan Toney as the England striker started on the bench again - and remained there - as he continues to manage a muscle injury.\nWhile he has struggled for goals in recent games, Toney's ability to occupy defenders, hold up the ball and bring others into play would have been useful for Brentford as they tried to break Sheffield United down in the first hour.\nBut they got there eventually and one more win, possibly alongside another draw, should make absolutely sure of the Bees' safety.\nBlades fight hard but relegation looms\nDespite some encouraging signs for Wilder's team in recent weeks, it is now eight games without a win and just one win in 16 league matches.\n\"This was a tight, cagey affair. We just didn't find that quality when we needed to,\" Wilder told Match of the Day.\n\"I'm a little bit disappointed from a quality point of view. We didn't show enough quality and enough big moments that settle these type of games.\"\nRelegation has felt like a matter of when rather than if and, should results go against them, confirmation could come as soon as next Wednesday (24 April) at Manchester United.\nAs in recent draws with Bournemouth, Fulham and Chelsea - and even defeat at Liverpool - the Blades did not lack for grit and determination, though defensively this was a much better showing as they restricted Brentford for long spells.\nAlthough, ultimately, it was not enough, the fact the team is competing again - having failed to do so at times earlier in the campaign - is something for Wilder to cling to.\nIt may not be much and, barring a minor miracle, it will not be enough to keep them up, but the Blades do appear to have turned a corner.\nRelive Brentford v Sheffield United and all of Saturday's Premier League action"

This entire performance was an illustration of Emery's expertise in galvanising Villa.\nIt may have taken a stunning save from Martinez to keep them level in the first half but no-one should suggest this was any sort of 'smash and grab'.\nThis was a hard-earned victory and totally worthy of how Villa played."

This entire performance was an illustration of Emery's expertise in galvanising Villa.\nIt may have taken a stunning save from Martinez to keep them level in the first half but no-one should suggest this was any sort of 'smash and grab'.\nThis was a hard-earned victory and totally worthy of how Villa played.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 2-2 Man Utd: Bruno Fernandes double earns point against Cherries\nErik ten Hag says it is \"up to the fans\" whether they remain patient after Manchester United's winless Premier League run extended to four games with their draw at Bournemouth.\nCaptain Bruno Fernandes scored both goals as United twice came from behind to deny the hosts, who led through Dominic Solanke's opener before Justin Kluivert gave them a deserved half-time lead.\nUnited, whose hopes of securing European football were further dented, dropped one place to seventh following Newcastle United's 4-0 win over Tottenham earlier on Saturday.\nOn the need for patience from supporters as Ten Hag attempts to turn United's fortunes around, the manager told Sky Sports: \"It is up to them but it is the truth.\n\"At this moment with all the problems we have, we play to our levels. We can play very good when everyone is on top form but we have to do it for the whole 90 minutes.\"\nWhen later asked about the potential for United to record their worst Premier League finish should they drop below seventh, Ten Hag said the question was \"not important for this moment\" before walking out of his media conference.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Bournemouth's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester United's display? Send us your views here\nSolanke ensured Bournemouth took reward for their positive start with an assured finish low into the corner after getting the better of Willy Kambwala in the 16th minute - and that breakthrough only served to further motivate the home side.\nThe Cherries were punished for their wastefulness when Fernandes levelled from Alejandro Garnacho's cut-back but Kluivert restored the hosts' advantage five minutes later, as a simple ball from Marcos Senesi exposed the generous amount of space between Diogo Dalot and Kambwala.\nBournemouth should have been out of sight before the interval but, instead, Fernandes equalised again midway through the second half - this time stepping up to convert a penalty awarded for handball after Kobbie Mainoo's shot deflected on to the unfortunate Adam Smith.\nAndoni Iraola's side, who remain 12th, thought they had been awarded a late penalty but, following a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) review, Kambwala's foul on Christie was determined to have taken place outside the box.\nFernandes earns point for faltering United\nIt is a damning indictment of Manchester United's second season under Ten Hag that still, 32 games into the campaign, onlookers remain unsure what to expect from the Dutchman's side from game to game, and from half to half.\nUnited have not won in the Premier League since 9 March - that home victory over Everton representing their only win in seven games in the competition. Their last away league win came against Luton Town, on 18 February.\nThe Red Devils failed to hold on to leads against Brentford, Chelsea and Liverpool in the space of nine days last week - taking their total number of points dropped to a club record 15 in the Premier League this season and seemingly ending their hopes of Champions League qualification.\nBut they never appeared capable of establishing a lead in the late-afternoon sun on the south coast, with Fernandes' two equalisers representing United's only attempts on target.\nThe under-pressure Ten Hag named the same 11 whose second-half revival earned a point against title-chasing Liverpool - but there was no sense of momentum here and the usually lively Garnacho was substituted at half-time.\nFernandes, who struck the bar with a superb attempt before the interval, was a rare source of inspiration for United. The Portuguese skipper was seen voicing his frustration when no team-mates were alert to his desire to play a quick free-kick as they trailed, before he delivered with typical composure from the penalty spot.\nOn United's captain, Ten Hag told BBC Sport: \"Scoring twice, very creative, it's true he gives a lot of energy to the team. He is acting as a captain, bringing the energy and we are very pleased with this.\"\nHe added: \"We are all disappointed but he expresses that feeling. We have to win our games and we have dropped too many unnecessary points in the last few games.\"\nFortunate to escape with a point here, United's attention now turns to keeping their last hope of silverware alive when they face Championship side Coventry City in their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley next Sunday.\nBournemouth's progress clear\nIn sharp contrast to the disarray on display from the visitors, the progress achieved by Premier League manager of the month Iraola at Bournemouth is evident.\nThe Cherries are on course to record their best Premier League season, now just five points away from beating the 46 achieved in 2016-17.\nThat is despite not earning their first league win under Spaniard Iraola until their 10th game at the end of October - and the club is certainly reaping the rewards for remaining patient with the former Rayo Vallecano manager.\nBournemouth started on the front foot and rarely relented - and should have made more of a series of high-quality chances as they carved their opponents open at will.\nAndre Onana was required to deny Milos Kerkez at his near post shortly after Solanke's opener, Luis Sinisterra shot narrowly wide and Ryan Christie twice also went close in a dominant first-half display.\nThere were also chances for energetic wing-back Kerkez, who saw a header hit the crossbar, while Kluivert failed to beat Onana at close range.\nBut, despite 20 attempts to the visitors' eight, Smith's misfortune and the VAR's decision to overrule referee Tony Harrington's on-field penalty call in the seventh minute of stoppage time saw them fall short of a first league double over United following their 3-0 win at Old Trafford in December.\nManager Iraola said: \"We didn't take our chances - we had chances to finish with a better result. All the refereeing decisions were against us today.\n\"It's not bad luck - I complain about consistency. I can't understand the decisions. I did not think it was a penalty from Adam Smith. I disagree.\""

They want to win, they want to compete at their best and their effort is unquestionable. The results are something but I'm really happy for the approach and the mentality of the team.\"\nTired Wolves' winless run continues\nWolves' efforts were recognised positively by fans who stayed behind their team throughout - but when the season draws to a close, how much will they regret allowing Championship Coventry to overturn their injury-time lead in their FA Cup quarter-final at Molineux last month?\nA Wembley semi-final this weekend would have lifted a season that has turned into a grind for O'Neil's squad, who were superb for the first two-thirds of the campaign but now seem affected by a lack of energy and bodies.\nJoao Gomes forced David Raya to push his angled first-half effort on to a post and substitute Mario Lemina tested the Arsenal keeper with a second-half shot.\nBut they were sporadic moments of attacking invention, with Wolves' best performers being defenders, particularly captain Max Kilman and Toti, who were outstanding at the heart of the home side's rearguard action.\nOn-loan Tommy Doyle was industrious for Wolves.\nHowever, they have now gone six games without a win in all competitions, their longest run since the end of the 2021-22 season.\nChairman Jeff Shi has repeatedly stated the club did not bring in reinforcements during the January window because he was not prepared to risk breaking the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. However, the feeling will linger that the decision cost Wolves and O'Neil a realistic shot at a top half finish.\n'Magician' Trossard strikes the crucial blow\nTrossard has been in and out as an Arsenal player since joining from Brighton in a \u00a321m deal in January 2023.\nThe Belgian has still made more substitute appearances than starts in the Premier League for the Gunners - and when things are not going well, he is an obvious candidate to be replaced.\nYet he scores key goals. Since the beginning of last month alone, he has provided a winner against Porto in the Champions League, an equaliser in the home leg of the quarter-final with Bayern Munich, and now his latest effort - which takes him to 14 for the season in all competitions. Only Bukayo Saka has scored more for the Gunners.\nIt was a scruffy effort, leaning back and on the stretch to get to Gabriel Jesus' prodded pass. But it floated right into the top corner, out of goalkeeper Jose Sa's reach. It changed the complexion of an evening that was starting to get a bit nervy for the visitors, who before that had allowed Wolves back into a game they had initially dominated.\n\"He's a little magician,\" said Arteta. \"He can score with any service. He's a big threat. So composed, so cool, he can play in different positions. It's just a joy to have him in the team.\"\nAt the end of a tough week, it was understandable Arsenal were not at their free-flowing best.\nStill, they had chances. Kai Havertz swivelled neatly inside the area in both halves. However, on each occasion, the German sent his shot straight at Jose Sa.\nDeclan Rice had four opportunities, including a first-half shot he sent fizzing just wide and an injury-time effort that forced Sa into a decent save. Yet, for all his obvious qualities, the England midfielder is yet to improve his goals output, something he is certainly capable of.\nIt took Odegaard to finally finish Wolves off with a close-range effort in stoppage time.\nHow did you rate Wolves' performance?

Incredibly, before his move to Chelsea from Manchester City this summer Palmer had never scored a league goal.\nNow the 21-year-old is a lynchpin for Mauricio Pochettino's side. He has scored the most league goals in a season for the Blues since Diego Costa also hit 20 in 2016-17.\nHe took his first three goals superbly, with his left foot, his head and his right foot, to score the fastest Premier League 'perfect' hat-trick since Gracenote started recording that data in 2008-09.\nHe also won Chelsea's penalty in the second half after being fouled by Abdoulaye Doucoure and despatched the spot-kick despite arguments with team-mates Jackson and Noni Madueke\n, external\nover who would take the penalty.\nPalmer was simply sensational and had two further chances to score either side of the break but overran a Madueke cross and was later denied by the legs of Pickford.\nHaving scored 11 goals across his past six games in all competitions, Palmer will be after more in Chelsea's next match against his former club Manchester City in their FA Cup semi-final on Saturday.\nStruggling Everton 'embarrassed' after humbling loss\nEverton defender James Tarkowski said it was \"the most embarrassed I have felt as an individual\" after the game.\nThe Blues, who were really poor defensively, allowed Chelsea to take the lead with their first attack and never recovered thereafter.\n\"It shows where we are at today, we can only apologise to the fans who supported us,\" said Tarkowski. \"It is on the players. It is not on the manager and the staff.\n\"No excuses on our behalf - we need to brush ourselves down as we have a big few weeks coming up. We conceded six goals and you should feel embarrassed.\"\nThe Toffees had gone close themselves when it was still goalless but Beto, in for the injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin, could not divert Seamus Coleman's low cross on target when just a few yards out.\nBeto also had a headed goal disallowed for offside with his side 3-0 down in the first half.\nEverton's loss will sting fans even more when coupled with their latest two-point deduction which was announced on Monday, 8 April.\nHours before kick-off the Premier League said the club's appeal will be heard \"urgently\".\nDefeat leaves Sean Dyche's side in a precarious position especially with games against Liverpool and Arsenal to come before the end of the season.\nThey host Nottingham Forest in their next league match on Sunday."

They want to win, they want to compete at their best and their effort is unquestionable. The results are something but I'm really happy for the approach and the mentality of the team.\"\nTired Wolves' winless run continues\nWolves' efforts were recognised positively by fans who stayed behind their team throughout - but when the season draws to a close, how much will they regret allowing Championship Coventry to overturn their injury-time lead in their FA Cup quarter-final at Molineux last month?\nA Wembley semi-final this weekend would have lifted a season that has turned into a grind for O'Neil's squad, who were superb for the first two-thirds of the campaign but now seem affected by a lack of energy and bodies.\nJoao Gomes forced David Raya to push his angled first-half effort on to a post and substitute Mario Lemina tested the Arsenal keeper with a second-half shot.\nBut they were sporadic moments of attacking invention, with Wolves' best performers being defenders, particularly captain Max Kilman and Toti, who were outstanding at the heart of the home side's rearguard action.\nOn-loan Tommy Doyle was industrious for Wolves.\nHowever, they have now gone six games without a win in all competitions, their longest run since the end of the 2021-22 season.\nChairman Jeff Shi has repeatedly stated the club did not bring in reinforcements during the January window because he was not prepared to risk breaking the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. However, the feeling will linger that the decision cost Wolves and O'Neil a realistic shot at a top half finish.\n'Magician' Trossard strikes the crucial blow\nTrossard has been in and out as an Arsenal player since joining from Brighton in a \u00a321m deal in January 2023.\nThe Belgian has still made more substitute appearances than starts in the Premier League for the Gunners - and when things are not going well, he is an obvious candidate to be replaced.\nYet he scores key goals. Since the beginning of last month alone, he has provided a winner against Porto in the Champions League, an equaliser in the home leg of the quarter-final with Bayern Munich, and now his latest effort - which takes him to 14 for the season in all competitions. Only Bukayo Saka has scored more for the Gunners.\nIt was a scruffy effort, leaning back and on the stretch to get to Gabriel Jesus' prodded pass. But it floated right into the top corner, out of goalkeeper Jose Sa's reach. It changed the complexion of an evening that was starting to get a bit nervy for the visitors, who before that had allowed Wolves back into a game they had initially dominated.\n\"He's a little magician,\" said Arteta. \"He can score with any service. He's a big threat. So composed, so cool, he can play in different positions. It's just a joy to have him in the team.\"\nAt the end of a tough week, it was understandable Arsenal were not at their free-flowing best.\nStill, they had chances. Kai Havertz swivelled neatly inside the area in both halves. However, on each occasion, the German sent his shot straight at Jose Sa.\nDeclan Rice had four opportunities, including a first-half shot he sent fizzing just wide and an injury-time effort that forced Sa into a decent save. Yet, for all his obvious qualities, the England midfielder is yet to improve his goals output, something he is certainly capable of.\nIt took Odegaard to finally finish Wolves off with a close-range effort in stoppage time.\nHow did you rate Wolves' performance?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here\nRelive Aston Villa v Bournemouth, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nWhat a difference a week makes\nIt has been a celebratory seven days for Aston Villa, after the month started with just one point from two league outings.\nLast Sunday they beat Premier League title hopefuls Arsenal, on Thursday they saw off Lille on penalties to reach a first major European semi-final since 1982 and it was another routine performance at Villa Park to stay in the driving seat for a top-four berth.\nVilla were calm and composed from the outset, controlling possession and making steady progress up the field, although they struggled to create any meaningful openings.\nIt was not until Rogers' equaliser as the first half ticked into injury-time that Villa registered a shot on target.\nRogers has settled well at Villa Park since signing for \u00a38m from Middlesbrough in January and he grabbed his second league goal for the club in very mature fashion, coolly evading the challenge of Adam Smith before carefully picking his spot high above the head of goalkeeper Neto.\nVilla settled into their groove as the second half began, with Ollie Watkins attempting two shots at goal but he was the provider, teeing up Diaby, to get the hosts in front.\nUnai Emery's side continued to press for a third and their endeavour paid off in the 78th minute when Watkins, who leads the way for assists in the Premier League with 12, broke into the area, squared the ball and Bailey had a simple finish.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day after the game, Emery said: \"Big effort because fifth place is not Champions League, because English teams lost it. We have to get fourth. We have to be demanding and prepare as well as perform.\n\"We have to be focused more than before because we thought fifth was Champions League, but now it is not. Tottenham have two games in hand and then of course we have to be in Conference League [semi-finals].\"\nEmery was referring to the fact that England's hopes of securing a fifth Champions League spot are all but over - with exits for four of the five remaining English clubs in European competitions this week leaving them trailing Italy and Germany in Uefa's coefficient rankings.\nBad day at the office for Bournemouth\nDespite being without the ball for long periods in the first half, Bournemouth were efficient when they did get possession.\nJustin Kluivert tested Emiliano Martinez with a stinging effort from the edge of the box, before Dango Ouattara threatened the Argentina international's goal when he met a cross at the far post - but the angle was too acute and he could only find the side-netting.\nBournemouth's penalty was as clear-cut as it comes, with Cash wrong-footed by a turning Kerkez, and Solanke fired beyond Martinez with the confidence of a man who now has 18 league goals to his name.\nShortly after Villa had taken the lead Ouattara was denied from point-blank range by Martinez, in a moment that could have turned the game back in Bournemouth's favour.\nSubstitute Enes Unal had the ball in the back of the net for the visitors, after Bailey had given Villa a two-goal cushion, but that was swiftly ruled out for offside.\nIt may not have been an enjoyable trip to the Midlands for the south coast club but their season, which has five games left to run, could still end on a positive note.\nBournemouth are just five points shy of achieving a club record tally in the Premier League, despite failing to win any of their opening nine games under Andoni Iraola.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day about Bournemouth's desire to set a new club record for points in the Premier League, Iraola said: \"That's what we are trying to do. We have a really difficult schedule to end the season. We have to be at our best. Have to keep focus, intensity. You cannot make mistakes against these types of teams.\""

We can play very good when everyone is on top form but we have to do it for the whole 90 minutes.\"\nWhen later asked about the potential for United to record their worst Premier League finish should they drop below seventh, Ten Hag said the question was \"not important for this moment\" before walking out of his media conference.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Bournemouth's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Manchester United's display? Send us your views here\nSolanke ensured Bournemouth took reward for their positive start with an assured finish low into the corner after getting the better of Willy Kambwala in the 16th minute - and that breakthrough only served to further motivate the home side.\nThe Cherries were punished for their wastefulness when Fernandes levelled from Alejandro Garnacho's cut-back but Kluivert restored the hosts' advantage five minutes later, as a simple ball from Marcos Senesi exposed the generous amount of space between Diogo Dalot and Kambwala.\nBournemouth should have been out of sight before the interval but, instead, Fernandes equalised again midway through the second half - this time stepping up to convert a penalty awarded for handball after Kobbie Mainoo's shot deflected on to the unfortunate Adam Smith.\nAndoni Iraola's side, who remain 12th, thought they had been awarded a late penalty but, following a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) review, Kambwala's foul on Christie was determined to have taken place outside the box.\nFernandes earns point for faltering United\nIt is a damning indictment of Manchester United's second season under Ten Hag that still, 32 games into the campaign, onlookers remain unsure what to expect from the Dutchman's side from game to game, and from half to half.\nUnited have not won in the Premier League since 9 March - that home victory over Everton representing their only win in seven games in the competition. Their last away league win came against Luton Town, on 18 February.\nThe Red Devils failed to hold on to leads against Brentford, Chelsea and Liverpool in the space of nine days last week - taking their total number of points dropped to a club record 15 in the Premier League this season and seemingly ending their hopes of Champions League qualification.\nBut they never appeared capable of establishing a lead in the late-afternoon sun on the south coast, with Fernandes' two equalisers representing United's only attempts on target.\nThe under-pressure Ten Hag named the same 11 whose second-half revival earned a point against title-chasing Liverpool - but there was no sense of momentum here and the usually lively Garnacho was substituted at half-time.\nFernandes, who struck the bar with a superb attempt before the interval, was a rare source of inspiration for United. The Portuguese skipper was seen voicing his frustration when no team-mates were alert to his desire to play a quick free-kick as they trailed, before he delivered with typical composure from the penalty spot.\nOn United's captain, Ten Hag told BBC Sport: \"Scoring twice, very creative, it's true he gives a lot of energy to the team. He is acting as a captain, bringing the energy and we are very pleased with this.\"\nHe added: \"We are all disappointed but he expresses that feeling. We have to win our games and we have dropped too many unnecessary points in the last few games.\"\nFortunate to escape with a point here, United's attention now turns to keeping their last hope of silverware alive when they face Championship side Coventry City in their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley next Sunday.\nBournemouth's progress clear\nIn sharp contrast to the disarray on display from the visitors, the progress achieved by Premier League manager of the month Iraola at Bournemouth is evident.\nThe Cherries are on course to record their best Premier League season, now just five points away from beating the 46 achieved in 2016-17.\nThat is despite not earning their first league win under Spaniard Iraola until their 10th game at the end of October - and the club is certainly reaping the rewards for remaining patient with the former Rayo Vallecano manager.\nBournemouth started on the front foot and rarely relented - and should have made more of a series of high-quality chances as they carved their opponents open at will.\nAndre Onana was required to deny Milos Kerkez at his near post shortly after Solanke's opener, Luis Sinisterra shot narrowly wide and Ryan Christie twice also went close in a dominant first-half display.\nThere were also chances for energetic wing-back Kerkez, who saw a header hit the crossbar, while Kluivert failed to beat Onana at close range.\nBut, despite 20 attempts to the visitors' eight, Smith's misfortune and the VAR's decision to overrule referee Tony Harrington's on-field penalty call in the seventh minute of stoppage time saw them fall short of a first league double over United following their 3-0 win at Old Trafford in December.\nManager Iraola said: \"We didn't take our chances - we had chances to finish with a better result. All the refereeing decisions were against us today.\n\"It's not bad luck - I complain about consistency. I can't understand the decisions. I did not think it was a penalty from Adam Smith. I disagree.\"",

He did, however, appear to gesture to the Everton supporters as he was leaving the pitch.\nEverton bounce back from embarrassment\nEverton needed an instant response after the humiliation of Monday's 6-0 loss at Chelsea and while, apart from the two goals, it was not a performance to earn points for artistic merit, it earned points of a far more significant kind as the Toffees once again find themselves embroiled in a fight against relegation.\nThey were thankful for an outstanding save by England keeper Jordan Pickford from Forest striker Chris Wood with the score 1-0 and those controversial moments when Young escaped conceding penalties.\nEverton, however, showed the battling qualities that were absent at Stamford Bridge, took the chances they had and cashed in on the moments of good fortune afforded to them.\nIt was not a game of any serious quality, which was hardly to be expected between two struggling teams in a tense situation, but this is immaterial at this stage of the season.\nJarrad Branthwaite demonstrated once again why he is so highly regarded as Everton kept Forest at bay, enabling Sean Dyche's side to make a winning start to a week that could yet define their season, with a Merseyside derby to come against Liverpool at Goodison Park on Wednesday and another home game against Brentford next Saturday evening.\nForest deep in trouble\nNottingham Forest will feel deeply aggrieved about decisions that went against them at crucial stages of a tight game, but the bottom line is that they are now even deeper in the relegation fight after a defeat that allowed Everton to move four points clear of Nuno Espirito Santo's side.\nForest had neat possession on occasions and Wood will feel he should have drawn Forest level, with Gibbs-White also sending a finish carelessly wide when he should have equalised in the second half.\nIn the end, they were undone by those strikes from Gueye and McNeil to leave Forest and manager Nuno looking anxiously ahead to their closing games while still hoping to get some respite from their appeal against the deduction of four points for breaching profit and sustainability rules.\nForest face reigning Premier League champions Manchester City next at the City Ground and will need to find more cutting edge from somewhere to ensure their battle to stay in the top flight is successful.",

It happens. It's not his fault, it's our fault. We take full responsibility for that,\" Bellamy said.\n\"That's [Muric error] our doing as coaches. This is what we expect, this is how we play.

Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Brighton's performance? Have your say here\nThe result will hurt more given Brighton were not at their best at Turf Moor and recent results suggest the Seagulls' season is at risk of petering out.\nThey did improve in the second half, pressing with more intensity as Pascal Gross saw an effort tipped over the bar and Joao Pedro headed just wide from a corner.\nBut, having qualified for Europe for the first time in their history last season, they have now secured just six victories in their past 26 league games and another season of playing on the continent is starting to look unlikely.\nManager Roberto de Zerbi was already without nine first-team players and his list of casualties could be extended to 10 after Estupinan had to be replaced early in the first half having sustained an apparent ankle injury off the ball.\nThe Italian's side have picked up just two points from their past four games and it seems the addition of European football to their schedule has proved a step too far this campaign.",

Rodri was on the bench but City did not need him.\nEderson was back in goal after a month out and he had a comfortable afternoon to ease back into the action.\nIt was a comfortable afternoon for everyone in a light blue shirt.\nHaaland should have scored in the first minute when he was sent one-on-one by Kevin de Bruyne. His shot was saved by Thomas Kaminski and his follow-up was going wide before being deflected in by Hashioka, who was almost knocked out by the effort.\nIt was non-stop pressure and dominance from City, who lived in Luton's defensive third, but it took them until their 27th shot to double their lead through Kovacic's half-volley from Julian Alvarez's cross.\nHaaland looked set for another frustrating afternoon in front of goal until Doku was chopped down by Onyedinma, and the Norwegian converted a penalty for his 20th Premier League goal of the season.\nAfter Luton pulled one back, Doku again took on Onyedinma - who this time dared not lunge in - before finding the bottom corner.\nGvardiol netted a fine goal in Madrid on Tuesday and got another in stoppage time from Doku's pass.\nHow long defending champions City remain top depends on Liverpool and Arsenal. Guardiola's side need the pair to slip up at least once in the closing weeks.\nNot the game for Luton to target\nLuton are now a point behind Nottingham Forest in the battle to stay up after Forest's 2-2 draw with Wolves.\nBut this was never a game manager Rob Edwards would have expected something from.\nThe Luton fans who made the trip enjoyed themselves and made plenty of noise - these are the kind of games they would have been looking forward to, and perhaps fearful of, after last season's promotion.\nLuton managed four shots, although they were good ones with Cauley Woodrow hitting the crossbar and Barkley finishing following a stepover after a City defensive mistake.\nLuton's next game - at home to Brentford on 20 April - is huge.\nFight for Premier League survival - who will go down?"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "'Everton apply final blow to Liverpool title challenge'\nThe cycle of misery that has held Everton in its icy grip for so long was released on a night of passion and fury at Goodison Park that may have applied the final blow to Liverpool\u2019s Premier League title challenge.\nIf a first Merseyside derby home win since October 2010 was not cause enough for celebration for Everton, their 2-0 triumph came with what they will regard as the glorious bonus of inflicting potentially irreparable damage to Liverpool.\nThis much was clear as the famous old stadium echoed to the taunts of \u201cYou Lost The League At Goodison Park\u201d as a leggy, lacklustre Liverpool banged their heads on the brick wall that was Everton\u2019s defence and outstanding goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\nIt was 39 years to the night since what is widely regarded as the most famous evening in Goodison Park\u2019s history when Bayern Munich were overpowered in the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup semi-final.\nThis win, of course, does not even touch that significance but this will be a night Everton fans will remember for a long time and Liverpool will want to forget \u2013 and if they do forget they will find plenty of a royal blue persuasion happy to remind them.\nEverton flew at Liverpool from the first whistle, roared on in an atmosphere that might just be impossible to replicate when they leave this stadium.\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s side had chances after Jarrad Branthwaite\u2019s 27th-minute opener and following Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s headerto make it 2-0 just before the hour, especially when Luis Diaz struck an upright. But there was no coming back.\nKlopp\u2019s downbeat demeanour in his post-match media briefing told the story after his first derby defeat at Goodison Park. He was certainly not throwing the towel in, and rightly so, but he wore the look of someone who knew the game may well be up.\nLiverpool are still only three points behind leaders Arsenal but their form is going into reverse and the Gunners\u2019 goal difference is so superior it is effectively worth another point.\nAmid the joyous scenes at the final whistle, there is every chance Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola may also have been allowing themselves a smile.\nAnd it was a game that also left two big questions.\nWhere has this Everton been for large portions of another season of struggle? And what has happened to Liverpool, especially those tasked with scoring goals, with even Mohamed Salah misfiring miserably once again?\nDarwin Nunez must be trying the patience of the Liverpool supporters who have stood by him so long. The chaos that sustained him despite his habit of missing chances is now narrowed down and being replaced by just the missed chances.\nEven Virgil van Dijk was unsettled, throwing his arms out in disgust as Calvert-Lewin soared behind him for Everton\u2019s second goal.\nLiverpool pressed on but not with conviction or urgency, almost resigned to their fate \u2013 something which could not be said often in Klopp\u2019s reign.\nEven the manager himself raised eyebrows with his substitutions, taking off Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson and replacing them with Joe Gomez and Kostas Tsimikas when Liverpool needed goals.\nKlopp must lift his players for the weekend visit to West Ham United but they must also find something they have lost in recent weeks if they are to have even the slightest chance of regrouping to challenge Arsenal and Manchester City.\nLiverpool looked like a side who have gone to the well too often, with two losses and a draw in their past four league games, minds scrambled by the way Everton set about them, with Calvert-Lewin showing what manager Sean Dyche has missed when the striker is at his best.\nAnd what of Everton? Barely a week after a 6-0 humbling at Chelsea they were a team transformed, the sight of Liverpool like a red rag to a bull.\nThe goals Liverpool conceded where hardly the result of surprises being sprung on them. Everton\u2019s trademark is set-piece power plays and both goals resulted from them. The second goal, a Dwight McNeil corner met by Calvert-Lewin, was as routine as it gets but Liverpool could not cope.\nEverton and their followers have been very short on reasons to let it all hang out in celebration apart from in late escapes from relegation as the club lurched towards the footballing and financial precipice, with eight points being deducted this season.\nSo it was no surprise to see some of their supporters dancing down Goodison Road in the direction of the famous Evertonian pub across from Goodison Park, The Winslow.\nDyche, whose style of play has been something of an acquired taste to some Everton fans, got it spot on here and deserved to fully enjoy the finest night since his appointment.\nHe did not have to look hard for heroes in the shape of goalscorers Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin, the faultless Idrissa Gueye in midfield and keeper Pickford, who delivered several crucial saves and even indulged in some Klopp-style fist pumps towards Everton\u2019s fans after one final save from Salah in the dying seconds.\nKlopp apologised to Liverpool\u2019s fans, many of whom left before the final whistle, for the bitter taste left by his final Merseyside derby.\nHe will know how much this will hurt, not just because they were beaten by Everton, because they may have taken a blow from which their Premier League title challenge will not recover.\nFor Everton, this was the sort of night they waited a long time for \u2013 more than 13 years in this fixture at Goodison Park \u2013 and the outpouring of joy matched this thunderous occasion."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Man Utd 4-2 Sheff Utd: Hosts fight back from behind twice to win\nManchester United captain Bruno Fernandes led from the front to ensure another chaotic performance eventually ended in victory against relegation-threatened Sheffield United at Old Trafford.\nWith the visitors taking the lead twice, Erik ten Hag's side were staring at a humiliating loss to a side who have won just three times this season.\nBut Fernandes levelled from the penalty spot before driving Manchester United in front from 25 yards nine minutes from time.\nThe Portuguese created a first goal since February for striker Rasmus Hojlund four minutes later to move his side up to sixth spot and earn praise from his manager.\n\"He showed his leadership,\" said Ten Hag.\n\"He tried to encourage the team and he is also in good form. We put him in the right position and when he is there, he makes the right decisions.\n\"He can create a lot, score, assist and make key actions. We are very happy with his performance and his attitude.\"\nFernandes has now scored seven goals and collected two assists in Manchester United's past five games.\nIn total, there have been 27 goals in that period. Manchester United have conceded and scored at least two in all of those games.\nIn entertainment terms, it is sensational. However, there is zero sense of structure and it can only be wondered what new technical director Jason Wilcox made of it as he watched from the Old Trafford directors' box for the first time since his appointment was confirmed last week.\nTen Hag had railed against the media the day before the game, labelling critical coverage of his side's FA Cup semi-final victory on penalties over Coventry \"embarrassing\" and \"a disgrace\" - but his team failed to follow up by convincing on the pitch.\nWithout a win since February, Sheffield United led twice, through Jayden Bogle in the first-half and Ben Brereton Diaz in the second.\nHarry Maguire's deft header pulled the home side level on the first occasion, before Fernandes took control.\nTune in to all the reaction from Wednesday's Premier League matches\nFernandes the saviour after Onana error\nTen Hag has faced problems of injury and form among his squad in recent weeks. Goalkeeper Andre Onana, during the turbulence, had been a reliable figure.\nThe Cameroon goalkeeper seemed to have put his poor early-season form behind him. His recent performances had deserved credit, given he has been standing behind one of the Premier League's leakiest-ever defences in terms of shots allowed to the opposition. A defence that cannot push high has not allowed him the exhibit his full passing range, but he had generally done well.\nAgainst Sheffield United, though, Onana had a moment to forget. In passing the ball towards Diogo Dalot from inside his own six-yard area, the goalkeeper allowed Jayden Bogle to charge on to it. The 23-year-old's forceful burst took him to within shooting range and he expertly drove his effort into the far corner.\nOn the touchline, Ten Hag looked a lonely figure.\nThe Sheffield United fans had some fun at the Dutchman's expense, as they reminded him they rarely win away from home. To be completely accurate, they have rarely won anywhere this season. The last of their previous three triumphs came at Luton in February.\nIt is this kind of damage Manchester United cannot stop inflicting on themselves - and it makes winning matches so much harder than necessary.\nEven after Maguire had turned home Alejandro Garnacho's cross to bring them level before the break, they still fell asleep in their own penalty area to gift Sheffield United the lead for a second time.\nFernandes, with two goals and an assist, stepped in to save them. His second, a brilliant 25-yard drive, was the highlight - but the industry that created Hojlund's goal was worthy of praise as well.\nThe overall display is not a recipe for sustained success, although after the past few weeks, Ten Hag is probably just grateful to get the win.\nA positive night for Blades but still a defeat\nIn a season of almost unrelenting gloom at Bramall Lane, this represents one of the undoubted high points.\nBack in September, the Blades led at Tottenham heading into injury time, but lost. In December, they drew at Aston Villa.\nWhile they almost certainly won't be back at Old Trafford in the Premier League next season, their supporters will have the memory of a spirited display, tinged with regret that their team could not hold their lead for more than a combined total of 16 minutes and eventually succumbed to Fernandes' brilliance.\nNot that is should come as any surprise. They have now conceded 92 goals, overtaking Derby's previous record of 89 in a 38-game top flight season. The Premier League record of 100 - set by Swindon in a 42-game season in 1993-94, might yet be passed. They have now conceded 26 goals in their past eight games - and they do not have the class that would allow them to somehow overcome the weakness.\nChris Wilder's side will be relegated if they lose at Newcastle on Saturday. A draw, and they would effectively still be down because of their vastly inferior goal difference.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Man Utd 4-2 Sheff Utd: Hosts fight back from behind twice to win\nManchester United captain Bruno Fernandes led from the front to ensure another chaotic performance eventually ended in victory against relegation-threatened Sheffield United at Old Trafford.\nWith the visitors taking the lead twice, Erik ten Hag's side were staring at a humiliating loss to a side who have won just three times this season.\nBut Fernandes levelled from the penalty spot before driving Manchester United in front from 25 yards nine minutes from time.\nThe Portuguese created a first goal since February for striker Rasmus Hojlund four minutes later to move his side up to sixth spot and earn praise from his manager.\n\"He showed his leadership,\" said Ten Hag.\n\"He tried to encourage the team and he is also in good form. We put him in the right position and when he is there, he makes the right decisions.\n\"He can create a lot, score, assist and make key actions. We are very happy with his performance and his attitude.\"\nFernandes has now scored seven goals and collected two assists in Manchester United's past five games.\nIn total, there have been 27 goals in that period. Manchester United have conceded and scored at least two in all of those games.\nIn entertainment terms, it is sensational. However, there is zero sense of structure and it can only be wondered what new technical director Jason Wilcox made of it as he watched from the Old Trafford directors' box for the first time since his appointment was confirmed last week.\nTen Hag had railed against the media the day before the game, labelling critical coverage of his side's FA Cup semi-final victory on penalties over Coventry \"embarrassing\" and \"a disgrace\" - but his team failed to follow up by convincing on the pitch.\nWithout a win since February, Sheffield United led twice, through Jayden Bogle in the first-half and Ben Brereton Diaz in the second.\nHarry Maguire's deft header pulled the home side level on the first occasion, before Fernandes took control.\nTune in to all the reaction from Wednesday's Premier League matches\nFernandes the saviour after Onana error\nTen Hag has faced problems of injury and form among his squad in recent weeks. Goalkeeper Andre Onana, during the turbulence, had been a reliable figure.\nThe Cameroon goalkeeper seemed to have put his poor early-season form behind him. His recent performances had deserved credit, given he has been standing behind one of the Premier League's leakiest-ever defences in terms of shots allowed to the opposition. A defence that cannot push high has not allowed him the exhibit his full passing range, but he had generally done well.\nAgainst Sheffield United, though, Onana had a moment to forget. In passing the ball towards Diogo Dalot from inside his own six-yard area, the goalkeeper allowed Jayden Bogle to charge on to it. The 23-year-old's forceful burst took him to within shooting range and he expertly drove his effort into the far corner.\nOn the touchline, Ten Hag looked a lonely figure.\nThe Sheffield United fans had some fun at the Dutchman's expense, as they reminded him they rarely win away from home. To be completely accurate, they have rarely won anywhere this season. The last of their previous three triumphs came at Luton in February.\nIt is this kind of damage Manchester United cannot stop inflicting on themselves - and it makes winning matches so much harder than necessary.\nEven after Maguire had turned home Alejandro Garnacho's cross to bring them level before the break, they still fell asleep in their own penalty area to gift Sheffield United the lead for a second time.\nFernandes, with two goals and an assist, stepped in to save them. His second, a brilliant 25-yard drive, was the highlight - but the industry that created Hojlund's goal was worthy of praise as well.\nThe overall display is not a recipe for sustained success, although after the past few weeks, Ten Hag is probably just grateful to get the win.\nA positive night for Blades but still a defeat\nIn a season of almost unrelenting gloom at Bramall Lane, this represents one of the undoubted high points.\nBack in September, the Blades led at Tottenham heading into injury time, but lost. In December, they drew at Aston Villa.\nWhile they almost certainly won't be back at Old Trafford in the Premier League next season, their supporters will have the memory of a spirited display, tinged with regret that their team could not hold their lead for more than a combined total of 16 minutes and eventually succumbed to Fernandes' brilliance.\nNot that is should come as any surprise. They have now conceded 92 goals, overtaking Derby's previous record of 89 in a 38-game top flight season. The Premier League record of 100 - set by Swindon in a 42-game season in 1993-94, might yet be passed. They have now conceded 26 goals in their past eight games - and they do not have the class that would allow them to somehow overcome the weakness.\nChris Wilder's side will be relegated if they lose at Newcastle on Saturday. A draw, and they would effectively still be down because of their vastly inferior goal difference. But whatever the result, the drop is inevitable anyway.\nThere were positives, chiefly a series of first-half saves from Wes Foderingham and a mature performance from young midfielder Oliver Arblaster, remarkably Sheffield United's seventh captain of the season.\nBut their return to the Championship will soon be official. And they don't really deserve any better."

But that's all right because I loved the second half.\n\"We want to stay in that race, that's clear. Arsenal won yesterday, Manchester City will win their game in hand, so we have to win games and that's what we'll try [to do].\"\nReds pass tricky test on Thames\nKlopp's trademark post-match fist-pumping celebration with the travelling supporters seemed to have even more oomph than usual after his side navigated a tricky test they simply could not afford to fail.\nFulham have claimed a string of notable scalps at the Cottage this season, upsetting Arsenal there in December, while European hopefuls Tottenham, Brighton and West Ham have all been soundly beaten too.\nLiverpool were fully aware of their credentials, having been taken to the limit by Marco Silva's side in a thrilling 4-3 win earlier this season as well as edging their Carabao Cup semi-final over two legs.\nThis was far more routine than those prior meetings but it needed Alexander-Arnold - who hit Liverpool's dramatic late winner to down Fulham at Anfield in December - to light the touch paper.\nHe had already whipped in a fine cross for Luis Diaz to glance a header wide before netting his sixth direct free-kick Premier League for Liverpool with an unstoppable strike that left Leno grasping at thin air.\nGakpo would have located the very same top corner soon after if not for Leno's fingertips but Fulham's best spell of the game resulted in them drawing level in first-half stoppage time.\nNot long after Andreas Pereira's attempt to emulate Alexander-Arnold's set-piece magic skimmed the bar, Castagne guided a loose ball in the box into the bottom corner for his first goal since joining Fulham from Leicester last summer.\nBut the hosts were profligate in possession after the break and Liverpool punished them, first with Gravenberch's exquisite curler and then Jota's composure to wrap up the points.\nFulham, safely ensconced in 12th place in the table, had little by way of response as Liverpool eased off the gas in the closing stages, perhaps with Wednesday night's Merseyside derby at Everton in mind.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here\nRelive Bournemouth's win against Wolves\nToothless Wolves falter again\nWolves' season seems to be fizzling out as they slumped to a fourth successive home defeat in all competitions, for the first time since February 2017 when they were playing in the Championship.\nIt is six games without victory in the league, losing four during that sequence, and a threadbare squad is making life difficult for boss Gary O'Neil.\nThe hosts simply never managed to build any momentum with chances few and far between as they allowed Bournemouth to control the tempo and take ownership of territory high up the field.\nPablo Sarabia had Wolves' best sight at the target in the opening 45 minutes, curling a shot from the edge of the box but Mark Travers, making his first league start of the season for Bournemouth, pulled off a fine save.\nWolves emerged early for the second half with O'Neil's words still ringing in their ears but it did not have much impact as his old side Bournemouth continued to call the shots.\nVAR played a big role in denying Wolves two goals, with the first more controversial than the second.\nHwang's header was put away cleanly but an incident earlier in the move ultimately meant the goal was chalked off, while Max Kilman fired into the bottom corner deep into additional time, only to be deemed offside after VAR took a look.\nO'Neil told BBC Match of the Day: \"Probably our worst performance, really poor.\n\"Individually, too many were below the level that we've reached in the league this year. Collectively, we need to make sure this is not our level. We need to go home and look at what we produced and get back to the level we've been at before.\n\"We were flat with loads of unforced errors, losing every duel. I thought the subs had a good impact and we improved to give it a go in the second half, that was a small positive.\"\nCherries firmly on top\nBournemouth set their stall out from the first whistle, breaking up the field with the opening attack of the game and chances flowed freely throughout a largely one-sided encounter.\nSemenyo was the first to test the Wolves goalkeeper when his shot took a wicked deflection but Sa reacted swiftly to turn it behind for a corner.\nThe Cherries must have felt it was not going to be their night when Sa was equal to everything they threw in his direction.\nHowever, the pressure finally told in the 37th minute when Kilman's clearance landed straight at the feet of Ghana forward Semenyo, who gleefully accepted the gift and converted from close range.\nKluivert thought he had doubled Bournemouth's lead when he diverted Marcos Senesi's wayward shot on target but a fine reaction save from Sa denied the Dutchman.\nIt was wave after wave of attack from the visitors as the second period unfolded to the backdrop of a frustrated home crowd at Molineux until Kerkez's dismissal.\nThe 20-year-old was given his marching orders after brining down Doherty, and VAR decided to uphold Attwell's on-field decision.\nThat sending off, Bournemouth's third of the season and second against Wolves this campaign, changed the structure of the game for the closing stages.\nBut Iraola will be proud of the manner in which his side defended to hold out for a win which puts them only two points shy of achieving a new club record top-flight points tally.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day about trying to break that record, the Spaniard said: \"I'm very happy with the performance. The three points are very welcome.\n\"We are looking forward and want to get the record but we know we have difficult games. Two points doesn't seem much, but it is.\n\"We have to be very good to beat Brighton [on Sunday] and I hope we arrive well.\"",

They deserved to win the game. In spells in the first half, it looked a very even game. We had moments. It's all ifs buts and maybes. We didn't show enough, certainly in the second half.\n\"We're fighting for our lives to stay in the Premier League. It shouldn't be hard [to be motivated]. It's a tough day.\n\"Our supporters are incredible, I'm sorry they had to go through that. We owe them a performance now.\"\nSurvival in sight for Brentford\nThomas Frank's side have become accustomed to playing without Ivan Toney, who was banned during the first half of the season for breaking FA betting rules, and they did not skip a beat without the injured England striker at Kenilworth Road.\nWissa and Mbeumo formed an almost telepathic partnership in attack, with Lewis-Potter showing that he also has plenty to offer.\nIn between Wissa's two well-taken goals, which saw him hit double figures in a league season for the first time since 2020-21 when he was in France with Lorient, Mbeumo crashed a shot off the crossbar.\nLewis-Potter also caused problems in the first half, forcing goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski to claw the ball off the line before another goalbound effort was deflected behind by the head of defender Teden Mengi.\nThe game was ended as a contest just after the hour mark when Pinnock and Lewis-Potter scored in the space of two minutes, while Schade's late strike demonstrated the strength Brentford have in reserve.\nIt is the first time that the Bees have scored five goals in a league game since beating Leeds 5-2 in September 2022.\nWith just 12 points left to play for, Brentford, who are 10 clear of the bottom three, can start to plan confidently for another season of Premier League football, having extended their unbeaten run to five games.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, Frank said: \"We've finally got a bit of momentum. We had some very good performances recently, especially against Manchester United and Aston Villa.\n\"I respect Rob Edwards and his staff and they make it difficult for every team that comes here. We were very dominant and on top throughout the game.\""

But there was no coming back.\nKlopp\u2019s downbeat demeanour in his post-match media briefing told the story after his first derby defeat at Goodison Park. He was certainly not throwing the towel in, and rightly so, but he wore the look of someone who knew the game may well be up.\nLiverpool are still only three points behind leaders Arsenal but their form is going into reverse and the Gunners\u2019 goal difference is so superior it is effectively worth another point.\nAmid the joyous scenes at the final whistle, there is every chance Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola may also have been allowing themselves a smile.\nAnd it was a game that also left two big questions.\nWhere has this Everton been for large portions of another season of struggle? And what has happened to Liverpool, especially those tasked with scoring goals, with even Mohamed Salah misfiring miserably once again?\nDarwin Nunez must be trying the patience of the Liverpool supporters who have stood by him so long. The chaos that sustained him despite his habit of missing chances is now narrowed down and being replaced by just the missed chances.\nEven Virgil van Dijk was unsettled, throwing his arms out in disgust as Calvert-Lewin soared behind him for Everton\u2019s second goal.\nLiverpool pressed on but not with conviction or urgency, almost resigned to their fate \u2013 something which could not be said often in Klopp\u2019s reign.\nEven the manager himself raised eyebrows with his substitutions, taking off Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson and replacing them with Joe Gomez and Kostas Tsimikas when Liverpool needed goals.\nKlopp must lift his players for the weekend visit to West Ham United but they must also find something they have lost in recent weeks if they are to have even the slightest chance of regrouping to challenge Arsenal and Manchester City.\nLiverpool looked like a side who have gone to the well too often, with two losses and a draw in their past four league games, minds scrambled by the way Everton set about them, with Calvert-Lewin showing what manager Sean Dyche has missed when the striker is at his best.\nAnd what of Everton? Barely a week after a 6-0 humbling at Chelsea they were a team transformed, the sight of Liverpool like a red rag to a bull.\nThe goals Liverpool conceded where hardly the result of surprises being sprung on them. Everton\u2019s trademark is set-piece power plays and both goals resulted from them. The second goal, a Dwight McNeil corner met by Calvert-Lewin, was as routine as it gets but Liverpool could not cope.\nEverton and their followers have been very short on reasons to let it all hang out in celebration apart from in late escapes from relegation as the club lurched towards the footballing and financial precipice, with eight points being deducted this season.\nSo it was no surprise to see some of their supporters dancing down Goodison Road in the direction of the famous Evertonian pub across from Goodison Park, The Winslow.\nDyche, whose style of play has been something of an acquired taste to some Everton fans, got it spot on here and deserved to fully enjoy the finest night since his appointment.\nHe did not have to look hard for heroes in the shape of goalscorers Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin, the faultless Idrissa Gueye in midfield and keeper Pickford, who delivered several crucial saves and even indulged in some Klopp-style fist pumps towards Everton\u2019s fans after one final save from Salah in the dying seconds.\nKlopp apologised to Liverpool\u2019s fans, many of whom left before the final whistle, for the bitter taste left by his final Merseyside derby.\nHe will know how much this will hurt, not just because they were beaten by Everton, because they may have taken a blow from which their Premier League title challenge will not recover.\nFor Everton, this was the sort of night they waited a long time for \u2013 more than 13 years in this fixture at Goodison Park \u2013 and the outpouring of joy matched this thunderous occasion.",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brentford's display? Send us your views here\nRelive Brentford's win against Luton, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nAnother heavy loss for Hatters\nChances were few and far between for Rob Edwards' side, who looked disjointed, and belief that they can secure a second successive season in the Premier League might be just starting to drain away.\nThey have four games left to pull themselves out of the relegation zone but have won just one of their past 13 in the league, losing nine during that sequence, and have conceded 10 goals in their past two games.\nA lengthy injury list has to be taken into account, with nine senior players in the treatment room, but Luton have often put up a fight on home soil, something they failed to do against Brentford.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, Edwards said: \"Brentford were very good and we were poor. They deserved to win the game. In spells in the first half, it looked a very even game. We had moments. It's all ifs buts and maybes. We didn't show enough, certainly in the second half.\n\"We're fighting for our lives to stay in the Premier League. It shouldn't be hard [to be motivated]. It's a tough day.\n\"Our supporters are incredible, I'm sorry they had to go through that. We owe them a performance now.\"\nSurvival in sight for Brentford\nThomas Frank's side have become accustomed to playing without Ivan Toney, who was banned during the first half of the season for breaking FA betting rules, and they did not skip a beat without the injured England striker at Kenilworth Road.\nWissa and Mbeumo formed an almost telepathic partnership in attack, with Lewis-Potter showing that he also has plenty to offer.\nIn between Wissa's two well-taken goals, which saw him hit double figures in a league season for the first time since 2020-21 when he was in France with Lorient, Mbeumo crashed a shot off the crossbar.\nLewis-Potter also caused problems in the first half, forcing goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski to claw the ball off the line before another goalbound effort was deflected behind by the head of defender Teden Mengi.\nThe game was ended as a contest just after the hour mark when Pinnock and Lewis-Potter scored in the space of two minutes, while Schade's late strike demonstrated the strength Brentford have in reserve.\nIt is the first time that the Bees have scored five goals in a league game since beating Leeds 5-2 in September 2022.\nWith just 12 points left to play for, Brentford, who are 10 clear of the bottom three, can start to plan confidently for another season of Premier League football, having extended their unbeaten run to five games.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, Frank said: \"We've finally got a bit of momentum. We had some very good performances recently, especially against Manchester United and Aston Villa.\n\"I respect Rob Edwards and his staff and they make it difficult for every team that comes here. We were very dominant and on top throughout the game.\""

Send us your views here\nRelive Aston Villa v Bournemouth, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nWhat a difference a week makes\nIt has been a celebratory seven days for Aston Villa, after the month started with just one point from two league outings.\nLast Sunday they beat Premier League title hopefuls Arsenal, on Thursday they saw off Lille on penalties to reach a first major European semi-final since 1982 and it was another routine performance at Villa Park to stay in the driving seat for a top-four berth.\nVilla were calm and composed from the outset, controlling possession and making steady progress up the field, although they struggled to create any meaningful openings.\nIt was not until Rogers' equaliser as the first half ticked into injury-time that Villa registered a shot on target.\nRogers has settled well at Villa Park since signing for \u00a38m from Middlesbrough in January and he grabbed his second league goal for the club in very mature fashion, coolly evading the challenge of Adam Smith before carefully picking his spot high above the head of goalkeeper Neto.\nVilla settled into their groove as the second half began, with Ollie Watkins attempting two shots at goal but he was the provider, teeing up Diaby, to get the hosts in front.\nUnai Emery's side continued to press for a third and their endeavour paid off in the 78th minute when Watkins, who leads the way for assists in the Premier League with 12, broke into the area, squared the ball and Bailey had a simple finish.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day after the game, Emery said: \"Big effort because fifth place is not Champions League, because English teams lost it. We have to get fourth. We have to be demanding and prepare as well as perform.\n\"We have to be focused more than before because we thought fifth was Champions League, but now it is not. Tottenham have two games in hand and then of course we have to be in Conference League [semi-finals].\"\nEmery was referring to the fact that England's hopes of securing a fifth Champions League spot are all but over - with exits for four of the five remaining English clubs in European competitions this week leaving them trailing Italy and Germany in Uefa's coefficient rankings.\nBad day at the office for Bournemouth\nDespite being without the ball for long periods in the first half, Bournemouth were efficient when they did get possession.\nJustin Kluivert tested Emiliano Martinez with a stinging effort from the edge of the box, before Dango Ouattara threatened the Argentina international's goal when he met a cross at the far post - but the angle was too acute and he could only find the side-netting.\nBournemouth's penalty was as clear-cut as it comes, with Cash wrong-footed by a turning Kerkez, and Solanke fired beyond Martinez with the confidence of a man who now has 18 league goals to his name.\nShortly after Villa had taken the lead Ouattara was denied from point-blank range by Martinez, in a moment that could have turned the game back in Bournemouth's favour.\nSubstitute Enes Unal had the ball in the back of the net for the visitors, after Bailey had given Villa a two-goal cushion, but that was swiftly ruled out for offside.\nIt may not have been an enjoyable trip to the Midlands for the south coast club but their season, which has five games left to run, could still end on a positive note.\nBournemouth are just five points shy of achieving a club record tally in the Premier League, despite failing to win any of their opening nine games under Andoni Iraola.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day about Bournemouth's desire to set a new club record for points in the Premier League, Iraola said: \"That's what we are trying to do. We have a really difficult schedule to end the season. We have to be at our best. Have to keep focus, intensity. You cannot make mistakes against these types of teams.\"",

Send us your views here\nRelive Bournemouth's win against Wolves\nToothless Wolves falter again\nWolves' season seems to be fizzling out as they slumped to a fourth successive home defeat in all competitions, for the first time since February 2017 when they were playing in the Championship.\nIt is six games without victory in the league, losing four during that sequence, and a threadbare squad is making life difficult for boss Gary O'Neil.\nThe hosts simply never managed to build any momentum with chances few and far between as they allowed Bournemouth to control the tempo and take ownership of territory high up the field.\nPablo Sarabia had Wolves' best sight at the target in the opening 45 minutes, curling a shot from the edge of the box but Mark Travers, making his first league start of the season for Bournemouth, pulled off a fine save.\nWolves emerged early for the second half with O'Neil's words still ringing in their ears but it did not have much impact as his old side Bournemouth continued to call the shots.\nVAR played a big role in denying Wolves two goals, with the first more controversial than the second.\nHwang's header was put away cleanly but an incident earlier in the move ultimately meant the goal was chalked off, while Max Kilman fired into the bottom corner deep into additional time, only to be deemed offside after VAR took a look.\nO'Neil told BBC Match of the Day: \"Probably our worst performance, really poor.\n\"Individually, too many were below the level that we've reached in the league this year. Collectively, we need to make sure this is not our level. We need to go home and look at what we produced and get back to the level we've been at before.\n\"We were flat with loads of unforced errors, losing every duel. I thought the subs had a good impact and we improved to give it a go in the second half, that was a small positive.\"\nCherries firmly on top\nBournemouth set their stall out from the first whistle, breaking up the field with the opening attack of the game and chances flowed freely throughout a largely one-sided encounter.\nSemenyo was the first to test the Wolves goalkeeper when his shot took a wicked deflection but Sa reacted swiftly to turn it behind for a corner.\nThe Cherries must have felt it was not going to be their night when Sa was equal to everything they threw in his direction.\nHowever, the pressure finally told in the 37th minute when Kilman's clearance landed straight at the feet of Ghana forward Semenyo, who gleefully accepted the gift and converted from close range.\nKluivert thought he had doubled Bournemouth's lead when he diverted Marcos Senesi's wayward shot on target but a fine reaction save from Sa denied the Dutchman.\nIt was wave after wave of attack from the visitors as the second period unfolded to the backdrop of a frustrated home crowd at Molineux until Kerkez's dismissal.\nThe 20-year-old was given his marching orders after brining down Doherty, and VAR decided to uphold Attwell's on-field decision.\nThat sending off, Bournemouth's third of the season and second against Wolves this campaign, changed the structure of the game for the closing stages.\nBut Iraola will be proud of the manner in which his side defended to hold out for a win which puts them only two points shy of achieving a new club record top-flight points tally.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day about trying to break that record, the Spaniard said: \"I'm very happy with the performance. The three points are very welcome.\n\"We are looking forward and want to get the record but we know we have difficult games. Two points doesn't seem much, but it is.\n\"We have to be very good to beat Brighton [on Sunday] and I hope we arrive well.\"",

Send us your views here\nMan City looking ominous\nManchester City are at it again, reaching peak form just when it matters to turn up the pressure on pace-setters Arsenal as the title race reaches the final few fences.\nLiverpool's recent decline continued as they were beaten by Everton in the Merseyside derby but Arsenal are not going away, with a win at Wolverhampton Wanderers followed by the 5-0 thrashing of Chelsea at Emirates Stadium.\nThis did not have any impact on City, who have been through this tension before, as what was pitched as a tricky trip to the south coast turned into a formality.\nIt had all the hallmarks of a City performance close to the Premier League finishing line - calm and ruthless with flashes of brilliance from those who can change any game for manager Pep Guardiola.\nDe Bruyne is renowned for just about anything apart from his heading ability but he scored an athletic effort to open the scoring. It was then Foden's turn to add further flourishes.\nSuch was their comfort that Guardiola was even able to give De Bruyne and Foden a breather by substituting them before the end with the game won, conserving energy for the weekend visit to struggling Nottingham Forest.\nBrighton running out of steam\nBrighton were chasing European football in thrilling style at this stage last season under De Zerbi - a mission they accomplished successfully.\nHere, depleted by injuries, they were jaded and lacking inspiration as their campaign continues to look like it will end in anti-climax.\nBrighton's supporters felt they did not get the rub of the green with decisions, especially with the free-kick award that led to City's second goal, the mood inside the Amex worsening when second-half penalty appeals were turned down.\nIn reality, however, they looked a shadow of the side that made life so difficult for the top teams last season, being outclassed and overwhelmed by their visitors.\nBrighton lost key midfield duo Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister last summer and De Zerbi's hopes of another European challenge have been further undermined by injuries, despite some sparkling performances this term.\nThere has also been speculation around De Zerbi's own future, which will hopefully be cleared up so this progressive club can regroup and move forward once more.\nThis was a chastening experience for the Seagulls but they were unfortunate to meet Manchester City at just the wrong time, with their energy starting to run low."

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Forest's display? Send us your views here\nThere were worrying scenes in stoppage time when Everton striker Beto went down after an aerial challenge with Morgan Gibbs-White.\nHe lay motionless and the game was stopped for eight minutes while he received treatment before he was taken away on a stretcher. He did, however, appear to gesture to the Everton supporters as he was leaving the pitch.\nEverton bounce back from embarrassment\nEverton needed an instant response after the humiliation of Monday's 6-0 loss at Chelsea and while, apart from the two goals, it was not a performance to earn points for artistic merit, it earned points of a far more significant kind as the Toffees once again find themselves embroiled in a fight against relegation.\nThey were thankful for an outstanding save by England keeper Jordan Pickford from Forest striker Chris Wood with the score 1-0 and those controversial moments when Young escaped conceding penalties.\nEverton, however, showed the battling qualities that were absent at Stamford Bridge, took the chances they had and cashed in on the moments of good fortune afforded to them.\nIt was not a game of any serious quality, which was hardly to be expected between two struggling teams in a tense situation, but this is immaterial at this stage of the season.\nJarrad Branthwaite demonstrated once again why he is so highly regarded as Everton kept Forest at bay, enabling Sean Dyche's side to make a winning start to a week that could yet define their season, with a Merseyside derby to come against Liverpool at Goodison Park on Wednesday and another home game against Brentford next Saturday evening.\nForest deep in trouble\nNottingham Forest will feel deeply aggrieved about decisions that went against them at crucial stages of a tight game, but the bottom line is that they are now even deeper in the relegation fight after a defeat that allowed Everton to move four points clear of Nuno Espirito Santo's side.\nForest had neat possession on occasions and Wood will feel he should have drawn Forest level, with Gibbs-White also sending a finish carelessly wide when he should have equalised in the second half.\nIn the end, they were undone by those strikes from Gueye and McNeil to leave Forest and manager Nuno looking anxiously ahead to their closing games while still hoping to get some respite from their appeal against the deduction of four points for breaching profit and sustainability rules.\nForest face reigning Premier League champions Manchester City next at the City Ground and will need to find more cutting edge from somewhere to ensure their battle to stay in the top flight is successful.",

Send us your views here\nMan City looking ominous\nManchester City are at it again, reaching peak form just when it matters to turn up the pressure on pace-setters Arsenal as the title race reaches the final few fences.\nLiverpool's recent decline continued as they were beaten by Everton in the Merseyside derby but Arsenal are not going away, with a win at Wolverhampton Wanderers followed by the 5-0 thrashing of Chelsea at Emirates Stadium.\nThis did not have any impact on City, who have been through this tension before, as what was pitched as a tricky trip to the south coast turned into a formality.\nIt had all the hallmarks of a City performance close to the Premier League finishing line - calm and ruthless with flashes of brilliance from those who can change any game for manager Pep Guardiola.\nDe Bruyne is renowned for just about anything apart from his heading ability but he scored an athletic effort to open the scoring. It was then Foden's turn to add further flourishes.\nSuch was their comfort that Guardiola was even able to give De Bruyne and Foden a breather by substituting them before the end with the game won, conserving energy for the weekend visit to struggling Nottingham Forest.\nBrighton running out of steam\nBrighton were chasing European football in thrilling style at this stage last season under De Zerbi - a mission they accomplished successfully.\nHere, depleted by injuries, they were jaded and lacking inspiration as their campaign continues to look like it will end in anti-climax.\nBrighton's supporters felt they did not get the rub of the green with decisions, especially with the free-kick award that led to City's second goal, the mood inside the Amex worsening when second-half penalty appeals were turned down.\nIn reality, however, they looked a shadow of the side that made life so difficult for the top teams last season, being outclassed and overwhelmed by their visitors.\nBrighton lost key midfield duo Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister last summer and De Zerbi's hopes of another European challenge have been further undermined by injuries, despite some sparkling performances this term.\nThere has also been speculation around De Zerbi's own future, which will hopefully be cleared up so this progressive club can regroup and move forward once more.\nThis was a chastening experience for the Seagulls but they were unfortunate to meet Manchester City at just the wrong time, with their energy starting to run low."

The decision was there and that's it.\n\"For me it damaged a little bit the Premier League and English [football]. If we want to be the best league in the world it should be protecting the spectacle and the decision.\n\"It damaged myself, damaged my team, my players, my fans.\"\nVilla, whose top-four hopes are now not in their hands as a result of the dropped points, had taken an early lead after John McGinn's miscued effort deflected off Chelsea left-back Marc Cucurella and into the bottom corner.\nThe visitors responded well with Nicolas Jackson having an effort disallowed by the video assistant referee for offside, before the Senegal international planted a header against the base of the post.\nMorgan Rogers doubled the home side's lead after finding space on the left and tucking the ball into the near post through the legs of Trevoh Chalobah.\nChelsea found a route back into the game after catching Villa in possession high up the pitch, with Noni Madueke sliding a clever finish into the far corner.\nThe visitors pressed for an equaliser without creating too many opportunities, until Gallagher worked a shooting opportunity on his left foot and curled into the top corner from the edge of the area.\nBoth sides had chances to win the game before the disallowed goal, with Ollie Watkins slicing a cutback over the bar and Cole Palmer having a shot saved when dribbling through one-on-one.\nUnai Emery's side are seven points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham, but Ange Postecoglu's side have three games in hand, starting with Sunday's north London derby against Arsenal.\nThere was further concern for Villa too, with goalkeeper Emi Martinez withdrawn at half-time after appearing to struggle with a thigh injury in the first period, and any period of absence could damage them with their Europa Conference League semi-final this week.\nReaction to Aston Villa v Chelsea\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Chelsea's display? Send us your comments here\nChelsea show resolve but problems remain\nThis was a positive result for Chelsea, especially after going two goals down, and they showed an abundance of character and resolve in the second half.\nIt was a vast improvement from being called \"so soft\" by Pochettino after their 5-0 defeat by Arsenal on Tuesday.\nThere were familiar issues in the first half though as Villa scored two soft goals, and Chelsea have now gone 14 games on their travels without a clean sheet.\nJackson should have scored the header that hit the woodwork, and while the finish was taken beautifully, he should have timed his run better with the speed he possesses.\nThey had more than 70% possession in the second half and had 13 efforts to Villa's four.\nMadueke is continuing to grow as a player and has scored three goals in the past six away games, while Gallagher has been one of Chelsea's more impressive players this season.\nThey were furious with the disallowed goal but should gain belief that they were able to fight back at a side that occupy a Champions League spot and have the fifth-best home record in the league.\nVilla collapse but Rogers impresses again\nIt is hard to know how this result will affect Villa's top-four hopes, but with a home game against Liverpool sandwiched between trips to Brighton and Crystal Palace it may be damaging.\nThey were unusually soft in the second half, and failed to really lay a glove on Chelsea, apart from Watkins' late effort.\nThe loss of Martinez was a blow, with his presence huge for Villa.\nEmery will look at positives though, and Rogers is undoubtedly one of those.\nThey had to be patient to get his signature in January but were persistent, with Emery a huge fan of the 21-year-old.\nThe former Manchester City man has now scored in his past three games at Villa Park, and has an assist in the past five games too, having failed to register any goal involvements in his first five appearances.\nHis finish was superb, taken quickly and placed brilliantly in the bottom corner, out of reach of a fully-stretched Djordje Petrovic.\n\"I am very happy,\" said Emery to Match of the Day.\n\"We were winning 2-0 but today we achieved one very great objective we had during the season - to get Europa League, and to still be a contender with Tottenham trying to get fourth position.\"",

Send us your views here\nWolves back to winning ways\nO'Neil described the 1-0 defeat against Bournemouth on Wednesday as Wolves' \"worst performance\" of the season as they struggled to create openings and lacked energy.\nIt looked like this could be a long afternoon at Molineux as Wolves failed to register a shot until the 21st minute when Hwang beat the offside trap before firing straight at Thomas Kaminski.\nHwang went on to break the deadlock when his deflected shot left Kaminski unable to react quickly enough, the forward taking his tally for the season in the league to 11 goals.\nGomes put Wolves in the driving seat with a stooping header at the back post as he met Mario Lemina's cross following a short corner.\nAit-Nouri should have put the game to bed with just under 20 minutes to play when he failed to make a clean connection with Hwang's cross, despite being completely unmarked and just six yards from goal.\nMorris' strike was the only real negative of the afternoon for Wolves, who could not achieve their first clean sheet in the league since 25 February.\nO'Neil told BBC Sport: \"It's amazing the difference having a couple of attackers makes to us. It is the first time since 30 December that we have been able to name Hwang and (Matheus) Cunha in the same team.\n\"There are so many positives from this season. We've improved on the points tally of last year, stabilised the club financially and I think it's 13 academy players involved in matchday squads.\"\nTime running out for Luton\nManager Rob Edwards will want to see a lot more from Luton in the final three games of the season if they are to earn a second successive season of Premier League football.\nHard work and endeavour have been staples of Luton's game over the majority of the season, but the rigours of top-flight football might just be taking their toll. This was a 10th defeat from their last 13 league outings, with the Hatters winning just once during that stretch.\nMorris was Luton's only real threat, making runs off the shoulder of defenders and trying to work the channels, but a lack of service left him isolated.\nAfter his header was saved in the 38th minute, prior to Hwang scoring the opener at the other end, Luton did not attempt another shot until Morris scored.\nAfter chastening back-to-back 5-1 losses against Manchester City and Brentford coming into this fixture, Luton's goal difference has taken a major dent and that could prove to be the difference in their bid to stay in the Premier League.\nLuton are only one place and one point behind Forest, who hold down the last safe position, but their goal difference is 11 worse than that of Nuno Espirito Santo's team, who are due to play City on Sunday.\nEdwards told BBC Sport: \"Points-wise, we are on a difficult run but we're still in this. We still fully believe.\n\"You could see that today. If they didn't believe, it could have been a lot worse today - you would have seen it on the pitch - and I didn't see that at all.\"",

Send us your views here\nTwo sides continue on opposite trajectories\nWhen Bournemouth started the Premier League season without a win in their opening nine games, the decision to part ways with Gary O'Neil and appoint Iraola - who had no experience in England - was questioned.\nThose questions have been well and truly answered as the season has gone on.\nThey were excellent again on Sunday, playing with pace and creativity, and arguably should have won by a greater margin in the end.\nUnal's first-half miss was a huge chance and Kluivert hit the side netting when he should have squared early in the second.\nIraola's side have taken 45 points from their past 26 games and if they could achieve that ratio over a full campaign then they would be challenging for the European places.\nFor all of Bournemouth's brilliance, Brighton were poor.\nThere is plenty of noise around Roberto de Zerbi's future at the club and the Italian cut a disconsolate figure on the touchline at times.\nHe was slouched in his seat after Bournemouth's opener and looked miserable and frustrated as the game wore on.\nBrighton made seven changes from their 4-0 thrashing by Manchester City in midweek, with the experienced Danny Welbeck and Adam Lallana dropping to the bench, including first Premier League starts for 21-year-old defender Odel Offiah and 19-year-old striker Mark O'Mahony.\nDe Zerbi's side had 13 shots across the game but just one on target and while they are hampered by injuries, their run since September has seen only Burnley, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United win fewer matches.\nThey have issues to resolve over the coming weeks ahead of next season - the biggest is whether De Zerbi will remain in the dugout.\nDe Zerbi told BBC Match of the Day: \"We have to play much better than we are playing. We would like to give more and more but maybe in this moment it is tough for us.\n\"We prepared the game well but our best at the moment is not enough.\n\"I have big confidence in my players. I know how they feel when we lose a game. We lose together and we have keep going together.\""

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Man Utd 1-1 Burnley: Zeki Amdouni scores late penalty in draw\nManchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana cost his side victory as Zeki Amdouni converted a late penalty to grab a priceless point for relegation-threatened Burnley in the Premier League at Old Trafford.\nDespite another unconvincing display from Erik ten Hag's men, they did look set for victory thanks to Antony's well-taken 79th-minute effort.\nBut, just as he did on the opening day against Wolves, Onana recklessly charged from his line in an attempt to punch the ball clear but hit an opposition player instead.\nAlthough referee John Brooks missed the incident in real time, unlike against Wolves the video assistant referee, Peter Bankes, stepped in. Substitute Amdouni recovered from being on the wrong end of Onana's fist to send the keeper the wrong way.\nThe result moved Burnley to within two points of fourth-bottom Nottingham Forest, whom they play at Turf Moor on the final day of the season.\n\"We've earned the right to believe and hope,\" Burnley manager Vincent Kompany told Match of the Day.\nKompany said \"the task is to do something special\" against Newcastle next Saturday, before Burnley travel to Tottenham the following week.\n\"We have an opportunity on that one day against Forest,\" he said.\nUnited, meanwhile, are still to win successive league games since February and, with new technical director Jason Wilcox watching on, boos from the home fans greeted the final whistle, although they were not as loud as the ones triggered by Ten Hag's decision to take off teenage midfielder Kobbie Mainoo after 65 minutes.\nMan Utd 'one of most entertaining' teams - Ten Hag\nA rare good day for Antony\nThis result - and the overall performance - was not a powerful argument in the debate raging outside Old Trafford about Ten Hag's future.\nThat conversation includes the Dutchman's transfer dealings.\nIt was the Ten Hag who pushed for Antony in the last days of the 2022 summer transfer window.\nUnited eventually paid Ajax \u00a382m for the 24-year-old, making him the second most expensive player in the club's history behind Paul Pogba. The return of five league goals and three assists does not reflect well on anyone who sanctioned the move.\nThere was a feeling in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's time that the winger was worth pursuing but only if the transfer fee was around \u00a330m.\nTen Hag defended Antony for his cupped-ears celebration in the FA Cup semi-final win against Coventry, claiming his player had been provoked. Nevertheless, given it was 3-0 when he made his introduction, Antony might have been wise to keep his counsel.\nHe had plenty of chances to increase his tally in this game.\nAn early shot from the edge of the area went straight to Arijanet Muric. Another beat the Burnley keeper and the far post. In between that and another long-range effort, Antony laid a pass of to Aaron Wan-Bissaka with his shoulder as he decided that was the most efficient way of deal with a 70-yard pass dropping into his path.\nUnder the circumstances, you have to admire that self-belief.\nNevertheless, assessment of the player should be reserved for tangible output. After Alejandro Garnacho's forceful run had taken him to the goal-line, from six yards, Antony should have done more than prod the ball to Muric.\nHis goal was worthy of positive assessment, though. He reacted fastest to Sander Berge's errant pass and, although the Burnley man looked like he was shoving Antony over in his desperation to make amends, the Brazilian kept his balance long enough to find the net.\nOnana pays the price\nIt was Onana's attack on Wolves striker Sasa Kalajdzic that sparked the scores of controversial VAR incidents this season.\nReferees' chief Howard Webb can at least be thankful that, at the same end of the same ground, this time the technology worked as it should.\nBurnley manager Vincent Kompany will also be happy about it.\nHis side have now lost only once in eight games. The galling thing for the Lancashire outfit must be that there have been far too many draws in that run and the one game they lost was their most important, at Everton.\nBurnley could have got more from this one. Onana denied Lyle Foster with a brilliant reaction save in the first half and the Burnley striker was denied again by the United keeper when he ran past Harry Maguire and straight on the home goal.\nGiven they have not kept a clean sheet in 17 games now, Kompany's side knew a goalless draw was unlikely. The fact they had the spirit to recover says a lot about the positivity within the Clarets camp.\nYet, however they manage it, they will need to rely on the failings of Forest and Luton over the next three weeks to get them to that final-day encounter with Nuno Espirito Santo's men with a chance of staying up.",

Home midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure should have done better with a volley which he screwed wide from 10 yards.\nThe contest improved in the second period and Everton's England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford made an excellent stop to deny the returning Ivan Toney.\nAt the other end, Everton were inches away from breaking the deadlock when Dwight McNeil's thunderous drive from long range rattled the crossbar, before Gueye's goal ensured the Blues maintained their proud top-flight status.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Everton's performance?

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Luton's display? Send us your views here\nWolves back to winning ways\nO'Neil described the 1-0 defeat against Bournemouth on Wednesday as Wolves' \"worst performance\" of the season as they struggled to create openings and lacked energy.\nIt looked like this could be a long afternoon at Molineux as Wolves failed to register a shot until the 21st minute when Hwang beat the offside trap before firing straight at Thomas Kaminski.\nHwang went on to break the deadlock when his deflected shot left Kaminski unable to react quickly enough, the forward taking his tally for the season in the league to 11 goals.\nGomes put Wolves in the driving seat with a stooping header at the back post as he met Mario Lemina's cross following a short corner.\nAit-Nouri should have put the game to bed with just under 20 minutes to play when he failed to make a clean connection with Hwang's cross, despite being completely unmarked and just six yards from goal.\nMorris' strike was the only real negative of the afternoon for Wolves, who could not achieve their first clean sheet in the league since 25 February.\nO'Neil told BBC Sport: \"It's amazing the difference having a couple of attackers makes to us. It is the first time since 30 December that we have been able to name Hwang and (Matheus) Cunha in the same team.\n\"There are so many positives from this season. We've improved on the points tally of last year, stabilised the club financially and I think it's 13 academy players involved in matchday squads.\"\nTime running out for Luton\nManager Rob Edwards will want to see a lot more from Luton in the final three games of the season if they are to earn a second successive season of Premier League football.\nHard work and endeavour have been staples of Luton's game over the majority of the season, but the rigours of top-flight football might just be taking their toll. This was a 10th defeat from their last 13 league outings, with the Hatters winning just once during that stretch.\nMorris was Luton's only real threat, making runs off the shoulder of defenders and trying to work the channels, but a lack of service left him isolated.\nAfter his header was saved in the 38th minute, prior to Hwang scoring the opener at the other end, Luton did not attempt another shot until Morris scored.\nAfter chastening back-to-back 5-1 losses against Manchester City and Brentford coming into this fixture, Luton's goal difference has taken a major dent and that could prove to be the difference in their bid to stay in the Premier League.\nLuton are only one place and one point behind Forest, who hold down the last safe position, but their goal difference is 11 worse than that of Nuno Espirito Santo's team, who are due to play City on Sunday.\nEdwards told BBC Sport: \"Points-wise, we are on a difficult run but we're still in this. We still fully believe.\n\"You could see that today. If they didn't believe, it could have been a lot worse today - you would have seen it on the pitch - and I didn't see that at all.\""

The players deserve these points. They have performed really well.\n\"Even when we weren't getting points at the start of the season they were pushing and playing well.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brighton's display? Send us your views here\nTwo sides continue on opposite trajectories\nWhen Bournemouth started the Premier League season without a win in their opening nine games, the decision to part ways with Gary O'Neil and appoint Iraola - who had no experience in England - was questioned.\nThose questions have been well and truly answered as the season has gone on.\nThey were excellent again on Sunday, playing with pace and creativity, and arguably should have won by a greater margin in the end.\nUnal's first-half miss was a huge chance and Kluivert hit the side netting when he should have squared early in the second.\nIraola's side have taken 45 points from their past 26 games and if they could achieve that ratio over a full campaign then they would be challenging for the European places.\nFor all of Bournemouth's brilliance, Brighton were poor.\nThere is plenty of noise around Roberto de Zerbi's future at the club and the Italian cut a disconsolate figure on the touchline at times.\nHe was slouched in his seat after Bournemouth's opener and looked miserable and frustrated as the game wore on.\nBrighton made seven changes from their 4-0 thrashing by Manchester City in midweek, with the experienced Danny Welbeck and Adam Lallana dropping to the bench, including first Premier League starts for 21-year-old defender Odel Offiah and 19-year-old striker Mark O'Mahony.\nDe Zerbi's side had 13 shots across the game but just one on target and while they are hampered by injuries, their run since September has seen only Burnley, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United win fewer matches.\nThey have issues to resolve over the coming weeks ahead of next season - the biggest is whether De Zerbi will remain in the dugout.\nDe Zerbi told BBC Match of the Day: \"We have to play much better than we are playing. We would like to give more and more but maybe in this moment it is tough for us.\n\"We prepared the game well but our best at the moment is not enough.\n\"I have big confidence in my players.

The decision was there and that's it.\n\"For me it damaged a little bit the Premier League and English [football]. If we want to be the best league in the world it should be protecting the spectacle and the decision.\n\"It damaged myself, damaged my team, my players, my fans.\"\nVilla, whose top-four hopes are now not in their hands as a result of the dropped points, had taken an early lead after John McGinn's miscued effort deflected off Chelsea left-back Marc Cucurella and into the bottom corner.\nThe visitors responded well with Nicolas Jackson having an effort disallowed by the video assistant referee for offside, before the Senegal international planted a header against the base of the post.\nMorgan Rogers doubled the home side's lead after finding space on the left and tucking the ball into the near post through the legs of Trevoh Chalobah.\nChelsea found a route back into the game after catching Villa in possession high up the pitch, with Noni Madueke sliding a clever finish into the far corner.\nThe visitors pressed for an equaliser without creating too many opportunities, until Gallagher worked a shooting opportunity on his left foot and curled into the top corner from the edge of the area.\nBoth sides had chances to win the game before the disallowed goal, with Ollie Watkins slicing a cutback over the bar and Cole Palmer having a shot saved when dribbling through one-on-one.\nUnai Emery's side are seven points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham, but Ange Postecoglu's side have three games in hand, starting with Sunday's north London derby against Arsenal.\nThere was further concern for Villa too, with goalkeeper Emi Martinez withdrawn at half-time after appearing to struggle with a thigh injury in the first period, and any period of absence could damage them with their Europa Conference League semi-final this week.\nReaction to Aston Villa v Chelsea\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Chelsea's display? Send us your comments here\nChelsea show resolve but problems remain\nThis was a positive result for Chelsea, especially after going two goals down, and they showed an abundance of character and resolve in the second half.\nIt was a vast improvement from being called \"so soft\" by Pochettino after their 5-0 defeat by Arsenal on Tuesday.\nThere were familiar issues in the first half though as Villa scored two soft goals, and Chelsea have now gone 14 games on their travels without a clean sheet.\nJackson should have scored the header that hit the woodwork, and while the finish was taken beautifully, he should have timed his run better with the speed he possesses.\nThey had more than 70% possession in the second half and had 13 efforts to Villa's four.\nMadueke is continuing to grow as a player and has scored three goals in the past six away games, while Gallagher has been one of Chelsea's more impressive players this season.\nThey were furious with the disallowed goal but should gain belief that they were able to fight back at a side that occupy a Champions League spot and have the fifth-best home record in the league.\nVilla collapse but Rogers impresses again\nIt is hard to know how this result will affect Villa's top-four hopes, but with a home game against Liverpool sandwiched between trips to Brighton and Crystal Palace it may be damaging.\nThey were unusually soft in the second half, and failed to really lay a glove on Chelsea, apart from Watkins' late effort.\nThe loss of Martinez was a blow, with his presence huge for Villa.\nEmery will look at positives though, and Rogers is undoubtedly one of those.\nThey had to be patient to get his signature in January but were persistent, with Emery a huge fan of the 21-year-old.\nThe former Manchester City man has now scored in his past three games at Villa Park, and has an assist in the past five games too, having failed to register any goal involvements in his first five appearances.\nHis finish was superb, taken quickly and placed brilliantly in the bottom corner, out of reach of a fully-stretched Djordje Petrovic.\n\"I am very happy,\" said Emery to Match of the Day.\n\"We were winning 2-0 but today we achieved one very great objective we had during the season - to get Europa League, and to still be a contender with Tottenham trying to get fourth position.\""

Substitute Amdouni recovered from being on the wrong end of Onana's fist to send the keeper the wrong way.\nThe result moved Burnley to within two points of fourth-bottom Nottingham Forest, whom they play at Turf Moor on the final day of the season.\n\"We've earned the right to believe and hope,\" Burnley manager Vincent Kompany told Match of the Day.\nKompany said \"the task is to do something special\" against Newcastle next Saturday, before Burnley travel to Tottenham the following week.\n\"We have an opportunity on that one day against Forest,\" he said.\nUnited, meanwhile, are still to win successive league games since February and, with new technical director Jason Wilcox watching on, boos from the home fans greeted the final whistle, although they were not as loud as the ones triggered by Ten Hag's decision to take off teenage midfielder Kobbie Mainoo after 65 minutes.\nMan Utd 'one of most entertaining' teams - Ten Hag\nA rare good day for Antony\nThis result - and the overall performance - was not a powerful argument in the debate raging outside Old Trafford about Ten Hag's future.\nThat conversation includes the Dutchman's transfer dealings.\nIt was the Ten Hag who pushed for Antony in the last days of the 2022 summer transfer window.\nUnited eventually paid Ajax \u00a382m for the 24-year-old, making him the second most expensive player in the club's history behind Paul Pogba. The return of five league goals and three assists does not reflect well on anyone who sanctioned the move.\nThere was a feeling in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's time that the winger was worth pursuing but only if the transfer fee was around \u00a330m.\nTen Hag defended Antony for his cupped-ears celebration in the FA Cup semi-final win against Coventry, claiming his player had been provoked. Nevertheless, given it was 3-0 when he made his introduction, Antony might have been wise to keep his counsel.\nHe had plenty of chances to increase his tally in this game.\nAn early shot from the edge of the area went straight to Arijanet Muric. Another beat the Burnley keeper and the far post. In between that and another long-range effort, Antony laid a pass of to Aaron Wan-Bissaka with his shoulder as he decided that was the most efficient way of deal with a 70-yard pass dropping into his path.\nUnder the circumstances, you have to admire that self-belief.\nNevertheless, assessment of the player should be reserved for tangible output. After Alejandro Garnacho's forceful run had taken him to the goal-line, from six yards, Antony should have done more than prod the ball to Muric.\nHis goal was worthy of positive assessment, though. He reacted fastest to Sander Berge's errant pass and, although the Burnley man looked like he was shoving Antony over in his desperation to make amends, the Brazilian kept his balance long enough to find the net.\nOnana pays the price\nIt was Onana's attack on Wolves striker Sasa Kalajdzic that sparked the scores of controversial VAR incidents this season.\nReferees' chief Howard Webb can at least be thankful that, at the same end of the same ground, this time the technology worked as it should.\nBurnley manager Vincent Kompany will also be happy about it.\nHis side have now lost only once in eight games. The galling thing for the Lancashire outfit must be that there have been far too many draws in that run and the one game they lost was their most important, at Everton.\nBurnley could have got more from this one. Onana denied Lyle Foster with a brilliant reaction save in the first half and the Burnley striker was denied again by the United keeper when he ran past Harry Maguire and straight on the home goal.\nGiven they have not kept a clean sheet in 17 games now, Kompany's side knew a goalless draw was unlikely. The fact they had the spirit to recover says a lot about the positivity within the Clarets camp.\nYet, however they manage it, they will need to rely on the failings of Forest and Luton over the next three weeks to get them to that final-day encounter with Nuno Espirito Santo's men with a chance of staying up."

Especially for someone at such a tender age. He has the ability to know exactly where to be on the pitch and when it is best to release the ball for a team-mate.\nThe former Blackburn man has been a huge addition to a Palace side who have won four of their past five.\nA fantastic cross for Joachim Andersen to set up Mitchell's goal was just a small sample of the quality Wharton brings.\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate was in attendance in London with a preliminary squad for Euro 2024 set to be announced on Tuesday, 21 May and with the Three Lions short of players in the mould of Wharton, could a shock inclusion be on the cards?"

It took some good fortune and while the job is not done yet, Forest have kept their fate in their own hands.\nFour points from their last two games will make absolutely sure but, if results go their way, safety could be achieved next weekend when they host Chelsea.\nUnwanted ton up for Blades\nEven after a first-half performance that should provide Sheffield United with encouragement heading into the summer, the afternoon ended with an unwanted record - or at least a share of it.\nIt has been that kind of season for the Blades.\nWith two games left, it would be a shock if they didn't take the record for goals conceded from Swindon outright.\nMoreover, even if they do manage two clean sheets, their 100 goals conceded will have come in four fewer games given Swindon leaked their century over a 42-game season.\nHaving a defence that has now conceded at least two goals in 10 straight league matches did not help, but it was their profligacy at the other end that was arguably more costly against Forest.\nIn the 15 minutes between Forest equalising and Wood hitting the bar, Chris Wilder's side had three very good chances to go back in front but a combination of poor finishing and bad decision-making saw them all go begging.\nThey might have been out of sight but instead, a lack of quality in both boxes leaves them to ponder a 26th league defeat of the campaign.\nRelive Sheffield United v Nottingham Forest and all of Saturday's Premier League action",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of West Ham's display? Send us your views here\nFollow live text coverage of Sunday's Premier League action\nChelsea ooze confidence\nAfter a rocky first season under the tutelage of Mauricio Pochettino, Chelsea are starting to click and European football could still be on the agenda for next season if they keep up this momentum.\nThe Blues have won nine of their past 11 home Premier League outings and they are now on a four-game winning streak at Stamford Bridge, having beaten Manchester United, Everton, Tottenham and now West Ham.\nThey seem to be playing with greater confidence and it bodes well for the next term.\nAn assured finish into the the bottom right corner from Palmer set Chelsea on their way, taking his tally in the league to 21.\nCaptain Gallagher's strike was equally as impressive as he volleyed emphatically across the target to leave Alphonse Areola rooted to the spot.\nThe game was pretty much over as a contest by the 36th-minute when Madueke found space in the six-yard box to turn in Thiago Silva's knockdown.\nJackson further tightened Chelsea's grip on all three points shortly after half-time and he showed great composure when rolling in the fifth after beating the offside trap late on.\nChelsea were not asked too many questions defensively but Pochettino will also be pleased to see his side record back-to-back clean sheets in the league for the first time since February 2023.\nAnother heavy loss for hopeless Hammers\nWest Ham's confidence looks shot as their season draws to an unsatisfactory conclusion.\nThe Hammers have won just one of their past 10 games across all competitions, losing five, and are on course to miss out on a fourth successive season in Europe.\nThey have conceded 70 goals this season, including shipping five goals on four separate occasions, with only bottom three clubs Burnley (74), Luton (78) and Sheffield United (100) with a worse defensive record.\nFormer Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui held talks with West Ham about replacing David Moyes this week and a second successive heavy defeat on the road, having lost 5-2 at Crystal Palace on 21 April, leaves the Scot in an even more precarious position.\nBowen was the only positive for West Ham on a miserable day for the visitors, hitting the crossbar on three occasions.\nDespite conceding early in the second period, West Ham did pose slightly more threat after the restart with Emerson firing over the bar and half-time substitute James Ward-Prowse forcing a save out of Djordje Petrovic.\nThe result extends Moyes' terrible record when visiting Chelsea as a manager, failing to win any of his 19 trips - losing 12 and drawing seven."

Especially for someone at such a tender age. He has the ability to know exactly where to be on the pitch and when it is best to release the ball for a team-mate.\nThe former Blackburn man has been a huge addition to a Palace side who have won four of their past five.\nA fantastic cross for Joachim Andersen to set up Mitchell's goal was just a small sample of the quality Wharton brings.\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate was in attendance in London with a preliminary squad for Euro 2024 set to be announced on Tuesday, 21 May and with the Three Lions short of players in the mould of Wharton, could a shock inclusion be on the cards?",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Erling Haaland scored on his return to action as Manchester City held on for victory against Tottenham Hotspur to improve their hopes of a top-four finish.\nCity started strongly and went ahead in the 12th minute when Haaland met Jeremy Doku's low cross with a first-time side-footed finish into the bottom corner, having been left unmarked.\nSavinho should have doubled City's lead when the lively Doku found him unmarked at the back post, but the Brazilian's shot into the ground bounced over Guglielmo Vicario's goal.\nIt took the hosts 45 minutes to test City goalkeeper Ederson, who tipped a header from Kevin Danso over the crossbar.\nCity broke at speed from the resulting corner but Matheus Nunes could not find Omar Marmoush at the back post with the Egyptian left all alone.\nAfter controlling the first half, the visitors faded after the break, with Ederson called into action to prevent Wilson Odobert's deflected effort from looping over him.\nMathys Tel scuffed a finish with only the goalkeeper to beat as Spurs kept pushing, before substitute Pape Sarr sliced wide from a dangerous cut-back.\nDejan Kulusevski and Son Heung-min came off the bench - both were surprisingly left out of the starting XI by Ange Postecoglou - and their involvement further shifted momentum, with Son denied an equaliser by Ederson following a fast break.\n\"The game, it was open second half because we didn't close the first. In this stadium always they have 20 to 25 minutes and second half we suffered,\" Guardiola later explained.\n\"Never will [we be] the old City this season. Old City were too good, but we will be back.\"\nHaaland was back in the City side after missing the defeat by Real Madrid in Spain and the Premier League home loss to Liverpool.\nThe fit-again Norwegian thought he had scored a second City goal in stoppage time after bundling past two Tottenham defenders, but referee Jarred Gillett judged that he handled the ball. A VAR check determined there was inconclusive evidence that the on-field decision should be overturned.\nSpurs immediately went up the other end and Sarr headed over from the hosts' last chance to equalise.\nVictory moves City up to fourth in the table, while Spurs sit 13th.\nHave your say on Tottenham's performance\nWhat did you make of City's display?\nCity improvement continues\nManchester City's performances have improved in recent weeks, and for the first time in months they looked something like their usual selves in the opening 45 minutes.\nGuardiola's players exacted control and appeared to have a better understanding of when to attack at pace and when to keep possession and slow play down.\nFebruary signing Nico Gonzalez played in a more advanced midfield role alongside Mateo Kovacic, with Nunes tucking in from right-back when City had the ball. This was arguably the most successful solution to Rodri's absence that Guardiola has found this season.\nCity found plenty of joy down the left as Doku, Gonzalez and Josko Gvardiol combined to great effect to create chances, though the finishing touch was more often than not missing.\nEven when City flagged in the second half and Tottenham piled on pressure, City avoided the kind of collapse that has become common this season.\nRuben Dias and Abdukodir Khusanov were excellent at the heart of City's defence, while Ederson made key saves to keep the hosts at bay.\nThe clinical end product from City was lacking for much of the game, however. On another night Tottenham might have punished City late on for their wastefulness in front of goal.\nTottenham left to rue missed chances\nTottenham's improvement in the second half would have been worthy of a goal.\nDanso saw a couple of headers saved by Ederson, while Son was unfortunate that Ederson reacted so sharply to his low effort late on.\n\"In the second half we dominated in all the areas but missed a goal to get something out of the game,\" Postecoglou told TNT Sports after the game.\n\"We always knew we would finish strong, we always do, but in the first half we turned the ball over too many times. If you do that against City you allow them to get into a rhythm.\"\nThat his side improved before he brought on Son, Kulusevski and Djed Spence will have pleased Postecoglou, who explained the trio were benched because of the team's heavy workload.\nWith the likes of Micky van de Ven, Dominic Solanke and Cristian Romero soon to return from injury, Spurs may still be in a good place to finish the season strongly.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Luton are on the brink of relegation from the Premier League after West Ham came from behind to mark David Moyes' final home game with a win at London Stadium.\nAlbert Sambi Lokonga's first-half opener threatened to turn the penultimate game of Moyes' tenure into a damp squib while breathing new life into the Hatters' survival fight.\nBut Moyes rallied his troops at half-time and Luton were unable to repel the hosts after the break.\nJames Ward-Prowse drove home the 54th-minute equaliser after Thomas Kaminski had turned Jarrod Bowen's cross-shot into his path.\nTomas Soucek fired the Hammers in front with a brilliant first-time volley from 25 yards when Luton cleared a corner straight to him 11 minutes later.\nMohammed Kudus should have added a third as the hosts dominated the second period, but the midfielder only managed to hit the post from 10 yards out when unmarked.\nBut that miss did not matter as 19-year-old George Earthy, on as a substitute for his second league appearance, turned in Kudus' cut-back from close range.\nThe result leaves Luton three points behind fourth-bottom Nottingham Forest with only one game left to play and a significantly worse goal difference.\nAs it happened - Saturday's Premier League action\nHave your say on West Ham's performance\n, external\nWhat did you make of Luton's display?\n, external\nYoung gun Earthy makes his mark\nOne of the major criticisms of Moyes from West Ham fans - who have been demanding a change of manager since before he ended their 43-year trophy drought in the Europa Conference League last June - was his seeming refusal to give younger players a chance.\nGiven that, it is ironic a youth-team product scored the last home goal under the Scot.\nEarthy's first top-flight appearance, at Fulham last month, only lasted seven minutes as he sustained a horrible head injury that required hospital treatment.\nLittle wonder there was so much joy on the teenager's face after he darted across the Luton defence to steer Kudus' pass into the net with his first touch after replacing Michail Antonio.\nIt was the kind of moment that can make a career and, while Moyes will not be the beneficiary, Earthy looks capable of having a significant impact under Julen Lopetegui - when the former Spain and Real Madrid manager's appointment is eventually confirmed.\nBy that point, West Ham had made a clear edge in class tell.\nAfter a disappointing opening, Kudus and Lucas Paqueta's invention was too much for Luton, who found themselves chasing shadows as the home side exploited growing gaps in the visitors' midfield.\nBowen had opportunities to get the goal he needs to take the outright lead for most goals in a single Premier League season for West Ham.\nHe will have another opportunity at Manchester City on the final day but for now he remains level with Paolo di Canio on 16 after Kaminski kept out his best effort with his legs in stoppage time.\nWeaknesses exposed as time runs out for Moyes and Luton\nWith the sun beating down from a perfect blue sky, it was the ideal backdrop for what should have been a fond farewell for Moyes.\nHowever, the brutal reality of top-flight football soon ruined it.\nWest Ham's porous defence had conceded 12 goals in the past three league games before this one. In 10 out of the past 14, it had leaked at least two.\nTheir defensive failings have led to an unwanted Premier League club record for goals conceded (71) - undermining Moyes' philosophy of building a successful team by being tight at the back.\nAnd when Luton took a sixth-minute lead, their fans would have been dreaming that another top-flight season was possible.\nSadly for the Hatters, another key statistic ahead of the game was that they had both scored and conceded in 29 of their previous 36 league matches this season - a joint competition record. They are now out on their own in that metric.\nRob Edwards' side bravely scrambled to defend their advantage until half-time, but there was an air of inevitability about what was likely to come after the break.\nMoyes spoke to Edwards at the final whistle, doubtlessly trying to raise his spirits.\nHowever, the applause from Luton fans to their players at the final whistle was done with the knowledge their defiant contribution to this Premier League season is almost at an end."

There was simply no excuse for a player as experienced as Trippier, looking straight down the line to be so far back to allow Mainoo to score.\nAnd then, having equalised, Newcastle pressurised Aaron Wan-Bissaka into an error, found themselves with three men up against a desperate Amrabat, who was alone in chasing back, and somehow failed to get themselves in front as Isak\u2019s effort was blocked.\nGordon certainly did not deserve to be on the losing side and must have impressed watching England coach Steve Holland with his direct running and invention.\nHis low cross for Almiron should have brought Newcastle a goal but the Paraguayan could not apply the final touch at the far post.\nHe was inches away, as was Dan Burn\u2019s first-half header that Casemiro headed off the goal-line just in time.\nNewcastle have now won once in 29 visits to this stadium and European qualification now relies on the failings of others.\nCasemiro bounces back\nAfter all the grief he received for his positioning on Sunday against Arsenal, Casemiro was a surprise starter in central defence given Lisandro Martinez was available and had demanded to play against the Gunners.\nMartinez\u2019s conversation with Ten Hag before this game could only be guessed at and when the Brazilian wandered into midfield in the opening minutes and then gave the ball away to set up a dangerous Newcastle counter attack, the selection was under even greater scrutiny.\nYet rather than drifting out of the game, Casemiro delved into his vast experience to play a starring role for the remainder of the first-half.\nPerfectly positioned to head Dan Burn\u2019s header off the line barely a couple of inches before it became a goal, Casemiro then produced a brilliant tackle on Anthony Gordon that denied Newcastle a shooting chance with only Andre Onana to beat.\nHowe was convinced his side should have had a penalty as part of that move and presumably shared the sentiments of Wolves in questioning the validity of VAR as Jarred Gillett opted against overruling Rob Jones\u2019 on-pitch decision that Sofyan Amrabat had not illegally impeded Gordon.\nCasemiro also went close with an overhead kick and when he sees the replays may wonder if Trippier will be subjected the same vilification as he has received over the past three days.\nThe overall outcome means Manchester United have something to play for on the final day, which did not always look like being the case.\nAnd, as Ten Hag pointed out at the start of his side\u2019s lap of appreciation, his side finish their season at Wembley in the FA Cup final against Manchester City, when he promised his side \"will give everything\"."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Rasmus Hojlund scored his 15th goal of the season to seal victory for Manchester United in a thrilling Old Trafford encounter with Newcastle.\nAnything other than a win for Erik ten Hag\u2019s side would have condemned them to their lowest league finish in 34 years.\nInstead, they go into the final day needing to better Newcastle\u2019s result to claim a place in next season\u2019s Uefa Conference League, although they will qualify for the Europa League if they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley on 25 May.\nKobbie Mainoo put the home side in front after 31 minutes when he applied a cool finish from 10 yards after being played onside by Kieran Trippier.\nAnthony Gordon levelled four minutes after the restart and Manchester United needed a brilliant tackle from Sofyan Amrabat to stop them from going behind as Alexander Isak failed to finish a three-on-one counter.\nAmad Diallo drove home his first Premier League goal just before the hour mark as Newcastle failed to clear a corner to put Manchester United back in front, although Eddie Howe\u2019s visitors were inches away from an equaliser as Miguel Almiron just failed to turn home a low cross from the excellent Gordon at the far post.\nIt was left to Hojlund to settle home nerves, stepping to his right before sending a low finish into the bottom corner to end a run of one goal in 10 games.\nHowever those nerves still jangled a bit, as Newcastle left-back Lewis Hall fired home from the edge of the box in the second minute of stoppage time but the home side held on.\nNewcastle need a final-day win at Brentford to be certain of a top-seven finish.\nNewcastle endure more Old Trafford pain\nNewcastle\u2019s appalling Old Trafford record gets no better and on the journey back to the North East they will reflect on a chance missed to get the draw they craved.\nEven Manchester United, a team who have made an art form of tossing away winning positions late in games, could not be pegged back, despite Hall\u2019s excellent injury-time effort.\nMuch of the damage was self-inflicted. There was simply no excuse for a player as experienced as Trippier, looking straight down the line to be so far back to allow Mainoo to score.\nAnd then, having equalised, Newcastle pressurised Aaron Wan-Bissaka into an error, found themselves with three men up against a desperate Amrabat, who was alone in chasing back, and somehow failed to get themselves in front as Isak\u2019s effort was blocked.\nGordon certainly did not deserve to be on the losing side and must have impressed watching England coach Steve Holland with his direct running and invention.\nHis low cross for Almiron should have brought Newcastle a goal but the Paraguayan could not apply the final touch at the far post.\nHe was inches away, as was Dan Burn\u2019s first-half header that Casemiro headed off the goal-line just in time.\nNewcastle have now won once in 29 visits to this stadium and European qualification now relies on the failings of others.\nCasemiro bounces back\nAfter all the grief he received for his positioning on Sunday against Arsenal, Casemiro was a surprise starter in central defence given Lisandro Martinez was available and had demanded to play against the Gunners.\nMartinez\u2019s conversation with Ten Hag before this game could only be guessed at and when the Brazilian wandered into midfield in the opening minutes and then gave the ball away to set up a dangerous Newcastle counter attack, the selection was under even greater scrutiny.\nYet rather than drifting out of the game, Casemiro delved into his vast experience to play a starring role for the remainder of the first-half.\nPerfectly positioned to head Dan Burn\u2019s header off the line barely a couple of inches before it became a goal, Casemiro then produced a brilliant tackle on Anthony Gordon that denied Newcastle a shooting chance with only Andre Onana to beat.\nHowe was convinced his side should have had a penalty as part of that move and presumably shared the sentiments of Wolves in questioning the validity of VAR as Jarred Gillett opted against overruling Rob Jones\u2019 on-pitch decision that Sofyan Amrabat had not illegally impeded Gordon.\nCasemiro also went close with an overhead kick and when he sees the replays may wonder if Trippier will be subjected the same vilification as he has received over the past three days.\nThe overall outcome means Manchester United have something to play for on the final day, which did not always look like being the case.\nAnd, as Ten Hag pointed out at the start of his side\u2019s lap of appreciation, his side finish their season at Wembley in the FA Cup final against Manchester City, when he promised his side \"will give everything\"."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Erling Haaland scored on his return to action as Manchester City held on for victory against Tottenham Hotspur to improve their hopes of a top-four finish.\nCity started strongly and went ahead in the 12th minute when Haaland met Jeremy Doku's low cross with a first-time side-footed finish into the bottom corner, having been left unmarked.\nSavinho should have doubled City's lead when the lively Doku found him unmarked at the back post, but the Brazilian's shot into the ground bounced over Guglielmo Vicario's goal.\nIt took the hosts 45 minutes to test City goalkeeper Ederson, who tipped a header from Kevin Danso over the crossbar.\nCity broke at speed from the resulting corner but Matheus Nunes could not find Omar Marmoush at the back post with the Egyptian left all alone.\nAfter controlling the first half, the visitors faded after the break, with Ederson called into action to prevent Wilson Odobert's deflected effort from looping over him.\nMathys Tel scuffed a finish with only the goalkeeper to beat as Spurs kept pushing, before substitute Pape Sarr sliced wide from a dangerous cut-back.\nDejan Kulusevski and Son Heung-min came off the bench - both were surprisingly left out of the starting XI by Ange Postecoglou - and their involvement further shifted momentum, with Son denied an equaliser by Ederson following a fast break.\n\"The game, it was open second half because we didn't close the first. In this stadium always they have 20 to 25 minutes and second half we suffered,\" Guardiola later explained.\n\"Never will [we be] the old City this season. Old City were too good, but we will be back.\"\nHaaland was back in the City side after missing the defeat by Real Madrid in Spain and the Premier League home loss to Liverpool.\nThe fit-again Norwegian thought he had scored a second City goal in stoppage time after bundling past two Tottenham defenders, but referee Jarred Gillett judged that he handled the ball. A VAR check determined there was inconclusive evidence that the on-field decision should be overturned.\nSpurs immediately went up the other end and Sarr headed over from the hosts' last chance to equalise.\nVictory moves City up to fourth in the table, while Spurs sit 13th.\nHave your say on Tottenham's performance\nWhat did you make of City's display?\nCity improvement continues\nManchester City's performances have improved in recent weeks, and for the first time in months they looked something like their usual selves in the opening 45 minutes.\nGuardiola's players exacted control and appeared to have a better understanding of when to attack at pace and when to keep possession and slow play down.\nFebruary signing Nico Gonzalez played in a more advanced midfield role alongside Mateo Kovacic, with Nunes tucking in from right-back when City had the ball. This was arguably the most successful solution to Rodri's absence that Guardiola has found this season.\nCity found plenty of joy down the left as Doku, Gonzalez and Josko Gvardiol combined to great effect to create chances, though the finishing touch was more often than not missing.\nEven when City flagged in the second half and Tottenham piled on pressure, City avoided the kind of collapse that has become common this season.\nRuben Dias and Abdukodir Khusanov were excellent at the heart of City's defence, while Ederson made key saves to keep the hosts at bay.\nThe clinical end product from City was lacking for much of the game, however. On another night Tottenham might have punished City late on for their wastefulness in front of goal.\nTottenham left to rue missed chances\nTottenham's improvement in the second half would have been worthy of a goal.\nDanso saw a couple of headers saved by Ederson, while Son was unfortunate that Ederson reacted so sharply to his low effort late on.\n\"In the second half we dominated in all the areas but missed a goal to get something out of the game,\" Postecoglou told TNT Sports after the game.\n\"We always knew we would finish strong, we always do, but in the first half we turned the ball over too many times. If you do that against City you allow them to get into a rhythm.\"\nThat his side improved before he brought on Son, Kulusevski and Djed Spence will have pleased Postecoglou, who explained the trio were benched because of the team's heavy workload.\nWith the likes of Micky van de Ven, Dominic Solanke and Cristian Romero soon to return from injury, Spurs may still be in a good place to finish the season strongly."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Luton are on the brink of relegation from the Premier League after West Ham came from behind to mark David Moyes' final home game with a win at London Stadium.\nAlbert Sambi Lokonga's first-half opener threatened to turn the penultimate game of Moyes' tenure into a damp squib while breathing new life into the Hatters' survival fight.\nBut Moyes rallied his troops at half-time and Luton were unable to repel the hosts after the break.\nJames Ward-Prowse drove home the 54th-minute equaliser after Thomas Kaminski had turned Jarrod Bowen's cross-shot into his path.\nTomas Soucek fired the Hammers in front with a brilliant first-time volley from 25 yards when Luton cleared a corner straight to him 11 minutes later.\nMohammed Kudus should have added a third as the hosts dominated the second period, but the midfielder only managed to hit the post from 10 yards out when unmarked.\nBut that miss did not matter as 19-year-old George Earthy, on as a substitute for his second league appearance, turned in Kudus' cut-back from close range.\nThe result leaves Luton three points behind fourth-bottom Nottingham Forest with only one game left to play and a significantly worse goal difference.\nAs it happened - Saturday's Premier League action\nHave your say on West Ham's performance\n, external\nWhat did you make of Luton's display?\n, external\nYoung gun Earthy makes his mark\nOne of the major criticisms of Moyes from West Ham fans - who have been demanding a change of manager since before he ended their 43-year trophy drought in the Europa Conference League last June - was his seeming refusal to give younger players a chance.\nGiven that, it is ironic a youth-team product scored the last home goal under the Scot.\nEarthy's first top-flight appearance, at Fulham last month, only lasted seven minutes as he sustained a horrible head injury that required hospital treatment.\nLittle wonder there was so much joy on the teenager's face after he darted across the Luton defence to steer Kudus' pass into the net with his first touch after replacing Michail Antonio.\nIt was the kind of moment that can make a career and, while Moyes will not be the beneficiary, Earthy looks capable of having a significant impact under Julen Lopetegui - when the former Spain and Real Madrid manager's appointment is eventually confirmed.\nBy that point, West Ham had made a clear edge in class tell.\nAfter a disappointing opening, Kudus and Lucas Paqueta's invention was too much for Luton, who found themselves chasing shadows as the home side exploited growing gaps in the visitors' midfield.\nBowen had opportunities to get the goal he needs to take the outright lead for most goals in a single Premier League season for West Ham.\nHe will have another opportunity at Manchester City on the final day but for now he remains level with Paolo di Canio on 16 after Kaminski kept out his best effort with his legs in stoppage time.\nWeaknesses exposed as time runs out for Moyes and Luton\nWith the sun beating down from a perfect blue sky, it was the ideal backdrop for what should have been a fond farewell for Moyes.\nHowever, the brutal reality of top-flight football soon ruined it.\nWest Ham's porous defence had conceded 12 goals in the past three league games before this one. In 10 out of the past 14, it had leaked at least two.\nTheir defensive failings have led to an unwanted Premier League club record for goals conceded (71) - undermining Moyes' philosophy of building a successful team by being tight at the back.\nAnd when Luton took a sixth-minute lead, their fans would have been dreaming that another top-flight season was possible.\nSadly for the Hatters, another key statistic ahead of the game was that they had both scored and conceded in 29 of their previous 36 league matches this season - a joint competition record. They are now out on their own in that metric.\nRob Edwards' side bravely scrambled to defend their advantage until half-time, but there was an air of inevitability about what was likely to come after the break.\nMoyes spoke to Edwards at the final whistle, doubtlessly trying to raise his spirits.\nHowever, the applause from Luton fans to their players at the final whistle was done with the knowledge their defiant contribution to this Premier League season is almost at an end.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Josko Gvardiol scored twice as Manchester City put the pressure on Arsenal in the title race by beating Fulham to move two points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nIn a game they dominated from start to finish, the visitors opened the scoring early on when defender Gvardiol produced a clinical finish after a good move opened up the Fulham defence.\nPhil Foden then continued his excellent form this season with a second after the break, sending a first-time finish past Bernd Leno.\nErling Haaland should have added a third midway through the second half but the Premier League\u2019s top scorer somehow drove high over when through on goal.\nBut Manchester City did not have to wait long for another goal as Gvardiol stabbed in at the far post to put the result beyond Fulham.\nIssa Diop was shown a second yellow card in stoppage time as he brought down Julain Alvarez inside the box, and the Manchester City substitute then duly converted the penalty.\nThe result means the Gunners head to Manchester United on Sunday needing to win to be certain of taking the title race to the final day of the season.\nManchester City are at Tottenham on Tuesday and if Arsenal fail to get a positive result at Old Trafford then victory will seal a fourth consecutive Premier League title for Guardiola's side.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action here\nHave your say on Fulham\u2019s performance\n, external\nWhat did you make of Man City\u2019s display\n, external\nCity showing no sign of nerves at crucial time\nArsenal\u2019s capitulation in the crucial stages of last season\u2019s title race meant it was ultimately a pretty comfortable win for Manchester City.\nBut this time they have been pushed harder by Mikel Arteta\u2019s men, and Guardiola stressed earlier this week that there could be no margin for error in their pursuit of another league trophy.\nAgainst a Fulham side with nothing to play for, coupled with an impressive run of 15 straight wins against the Cottagers, a slip-up always looked unlikely at Craven Cottage.\nAnd so it proved as they dominated throughout to make it seven successive wins in the Premier League, scoring four goals or more in six of those victories.\nArsenal are still very much in the title race, and a win against Manchester United on Sunday would put the pressure back on City, but the manner of this comfortable win indicates that Guardiola\u2019s side are showing very little sign of nerves when it matters.\nFulham winding down the season\nFulham needed to win to keep alive hopes of matching last season\u2019s top-10 finish, but that was always going to be difficult against a Manchester City side going for the title.\nThe hosts did make an energetic start, with City struggling to get a touch of the ball for the first couple of minutes, but with Gvardiol\u2019s goal the visitors were firmly in control.\nFulham had one moment in the second half when they caused some alarm for the City defence, Rodrigo Muniz\u2019s flicked effort deflecting towards the far corner before Ederson was able to scramble across, but they were otherwise largely toothless.\nWhile relegation has never been a concern it has been a disappointing end to the season for Marco Silva\u2019s side, having won just one of their last eight Premier League games."

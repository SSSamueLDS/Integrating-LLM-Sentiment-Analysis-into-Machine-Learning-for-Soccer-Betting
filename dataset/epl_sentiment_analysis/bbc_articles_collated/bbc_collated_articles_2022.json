Debutant Marcus Tavernier's corner was headed down by Lloyd Kelly for Jefferson Lerma to fire home.\nThey should have taken a two-goal lead into the interval but Kieffer Moore was unable to meet a low ball into the box from Adam Smith, who had been played through by the excellent Dominic Solanke.\nWales international Moore, who at the age of 29 was making his debut in the top flight, eventually doubled the home side's lead with a commanding header on 80 minutes after Kelly played a dangerous cross back into Villa's area.\nPrior to that, Danny Ings had a shot saved by Cherries keeper Mark Travers and new Villa captain John McGinn saw a long-range drive go high and wide, but it was debutant Boubacar Kamara who had gone closest to an equaliser for the visitors.\nThe French midfielder - a free transfer from Marseille - found himself in space and unleashed a right-footed effort from 30 yards that just went wide.\nChampionship runners-up Bournemouth visit defending Premier League champions Manchester City next, while Villa welcome Everton.\nCherries delight, Villa disappointed\nBournemouth are likely to face a tough task to avoid relegation in their first season back in the Premier League but for now, at least, boss Scott Parker can be pleased with the spirit shown by his team in front of their home supporters.\nAfter signing a four-year extension to stay until the summer of 2026, Solanke offered the same physical presence up front that saw him contribute 29 goals to the Cherries' promotion campaign last season.\nA promising debut by new recruit Tavernier should also satisfy Parker. He had described the former Middlesbrough midfielder as \"a big signing\" after recruiting him for a fee reported to be about \u00a310m, and Tavernier was an attacking threat in support of Solanke and former non-league striker Moore.\nConversely, there was little to impress Villa manager Steven Gerrard.\nThey were sluggish from the off and playmaker Philippe Coutinho, who made his loan move from Barcelona permanent in May, was among those who were largely anonymous.\nThe chances for Kamara and Ings gave the travelling supporters minor moments of excitement, but Gerrard will be hoping this is just a bump in the road and not a continuation of their poor run at the end of last season, which finished with only two wins from 11 games.\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League matches\nVisit our Bournemouth page\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

'I Predict A Riot' has never felt a more appropriate soundtrack.\nThe Kaiser Chiefs song, with its growling depiction of menace and confrontation on the streets of the band's hometown, is now an anthem at Elland Road following home victories - and could well be a template for how Marsch wants his team to front up.\nIn this soft reboot of the determined but ragged side that salvaged safety on the final day of last season, there was energy, endeavour and more than a little appetite for a fight as they battled their way back from Daniel Podence's early goal to seal victory.\nRodrigo fired them level with an angled drive in the first half and Ryan Ait-Nouri found his own net for the winner. In between there was a lot of harrying, high pressing and hearty tackles.\nThere was also a wobble, when Wolves came on strong and perilously close to exposing the weaknesses in Marsch's side for 25 minutes after half-time.\nHad the visitors a more ruthless centre-forward - such as the injured Raul Jimenez - to fire the ammunition provided by Podence and Pedro Neto, they would likely have three points themselves.\nInstead, though, Leeds had the final word on the pitch, leaving Marsch and Lage to argue over who would claim it on the touchline.\nReaction and analysis from Saturday's Premier League games, including Leeds v Wolves\n'The three points validate our work'\nAfter the game, Marsch played down the argument, describing it as \"nothing, really\" and \"normal in a lot of ways\".\nThis left the Portuguese boss to provide greater clarity on something that had been brewing throughout the match.\n\"In the first half, there were things that we cannot say, especially in these days, and I heard that. So if someone wants to apologise to me, it should be in that moment, not in the end when you've won the game,\" he said.\n\"There were plenty of moments between the first half and the end of the game when we could have shaken hands and apologised - it didn't happen and in the end it's more difficult to accept because there was a long time to do that.\n\"There's nothing wrong between the managers. Life goes on.\"\nWhat is clear from the end of last season and the early stages of this is that Marsch is not a man to take a backward step, nor does he expect his teams to do so.\nThere is a famous image from his playing days with Chivas USA of the then midfielder nose-to-nose with LA Galaxy's David Beckham after having booted the ex-England player in the stomach. Undaunted by his rival's reputation, Marsch stands his ground.\nOne thing he will not be is cowed by the managerial microscope under which he now sits, stripped of the shielding set of dire circumstances which surrounded the club when he was appointed.\nMarsch deserves huge credit for his role in driving Leeds to the points they needed to survive relegation in 2021-22 - often seemingly through determination rather than design - but now he needs to be a man with a plan.\nWith four debutants on the field and a fit-again Patrick Bamford to lead the attack, there were certainly clearer signs of one.\nSome parts worked better than others. Tyler Adams and Marc Roca showed signs they can complement each other in midfield as successors to Kalvin Phillips, the former tasked with the winning the ball, the latter to distribute pinpoint forward passes.\nRasmus Kristensen was all-action at full-back, but may need greater help in such a narrow formation against sides like Wolves with wide players eager to double up in attack.\nMost impressive of all was Brenden Aaronson, who was a constant source of energy and endeavour, some of which he used to dart into the box and force Ait-Nouri to score the winner into his own net from Bamford's cross.\nHe lacks the outright flair of Raphinha - the man he was brought in to help replace - but in his own industrious way could prove as effective.\nAs Marsch pointed out before the game, the team may have lost two stars, but in general it has become stronger, helped by the recent arrival of three players who have operated under the American before in Aaronson, Adams and Rasmussen.\nIt wasn't perfect and at times threatened to topple over as Wolves came on strong after the break, but there was enough there for Leeds to believe they can avoid the trauma of last season's relegation fight.\n\"I am really pleased that we look like a team that understands what the tactics and ideas are with the ball much better than we did last season,\" said Marsch. \"It was a big struggle to implement tactically what we want to achieve.\n\"We still have a lot of work to do but the three points validates the pre-season we have had and the work we have done.\"\n'The club are talking with players'\nWolves' deficiencies are clear to see. So are their qualities.\nNathan Collins remains their only significant signing of the summer, with the ex-Burnley man making an efficient debut at Elland Road in the middle of a back four that did not include stalwart Conor Coady.\nWith Jimenez sidelined for a few more weeks and Fabio Silva out on loan, they desperately need some firepower to complement the creative powers of their wide forwards.\nThey finished 10th last season after having scored the fewest goals of any club to remain in the division, but to gamble on a repeat would be foolhardy.\nLage was pleased with his side's performance - one that would have yielded greater reward but for key misses by Hwang Hee-chan and Leander Dendoncker - but is aware of the need for reinforcements.\n\"I think we did a good game,\" Lage said. \"I think we were the better team, we created a lot of chances, and we didn't score. I'm happy with the performance, but not happy with the result.\n\"I said before the game that we came here with big confidence, and we'll score goals because the pre-season was good and we have confidence to play in this system. I was right to feel that confidence, and we continued to play.\"\nHe added: \"It's time to be patient because we are talking with players. I know the club are talking with players and those players can come and increase the level of the team and the squad.\n\"They will give solutions that we didn't have today.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He did an unbelievable job for us without the ball.\"\nThiago injury adds to Klopp's worries\nThis is the fourth straight season the Reds have opened a Premier League campaign against a promoted side, but it was anything but a straightforward start for Klopp's side.\nWith Curtis Jones, Diogo Jota, Konstantinos Tsimikas, Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ibrahima Konate either ill or injured, Liverpool's bench included a 20-year-old, one 19-year-old and 17-year-old Stefan Bajcetic.\nFortunately, it also included Nunez.\nFor the second successive weekend he came off the bench to make a valuable contribution as he followed up his performance in the Community Shield win over Manchester City with another goal.\nHe produced a clever flick to make it 1-1 before the Uruguay forward was heavily involved in Salah's equaliser to make it 2-2.\nA concern for Klopp will be a mounting injury list with the season barely under way.\nThe loss of Thiago Alcantara to a suspected hamstring injury early in the second half will add to Liverpool's worries, and it remains to be seen whether they will turn to the transfer market to ease their problems before the 1 September deadline.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

'I Predict A Riot' has never felt a more appropriate soundtrack.\nThe Kaiser Chiefs song, with its growling depiction of menace and confrontation on the streets of the band's hometown, is now an anthem at Elland Road following home victories - and could well be a template for how Marsch wants his team to front up.\nIn this soft reboot of the determined but ragged side that salvaged safety on the final day of last season, there was energy, endeavour and more than a little appetite for a fight as they battled their way back from Daniel Podence's early goal to seal victory.\nRodrigo fired them level with an angled drive in the first half and Ryan Ait-Nouri found his own net for the winner. In between there was a lot of harrying, high pressing and hearty tackles.\nThere was also a wobble, when Wolves came on strong and perilously close to exposing the weaknesses in Marsch's side for 25 minutes after half-time.\nHad the visitors a more ruthless centre-forward - such as the injured Raul Jimenez - to fire the ammunition provided by Podence and Pedro Neto, they would likely have three points themselves.\nInstead, though, Leeds had the final word on the pitch, leaving Marsch and Lage to argue over who would claim it on the touchline.\nReaction and analysis from Saturday's Premier League games, including Leeds v Wolves\n'The three points validate our work'\nAfter the game, Marsch played down the argument, describing it as \"nothing, really\" and \"normal in a lot of ways\".\nThis left the Portuguese boss to provide greater clarity on something that had been brewing throughout the match.\n\"In the first half, there were things that we cannot say, especially in these days, and I heard that. So if someone wants to apologise to me, it should be in that moment, not in the end when you've won the game,\" he said.\n\"There were plenty of moments between the first half and the end of the game when we could have shaken hands and apologised - it didn't happen and in the end it's more difficult to accept because there was a long time to do that.\n\"There's nothing wrong between the managers. Life goes on.\"\nWhat is clear from the end of last season and the early stages of this is that Marsch is not a man to take a backward step, nor does he expect his teams to do so.\nThere is a famous image from his playing days with Chivas USA of the then midfielder nose-to-nose with LA Galaxy's David Beckham after having booted the ex-England player in the stomach. Undaunted by his rival's reputation, Marsch stands his ground.\nOne thing he will not be is cowed by the managerial microscope under which he now sits, stripped of the shielding set of dire circumstances which surrounded the club when he was appointed.\nMarsch deserves huge credit for his role in driving Leeds to the points they needed to survive relegation in 2021-22 - often seemingly through determination rather than design - but now he needs to be a man with a plan.\nWith four debutants on the field and a fit-again Patrick Bamford to lead the attack, there were certainly clearer signs of one.\nSome parts worked better than others. Tyler Adams and Marc Roca showed signs they can complement each other in midfield as successors to Kalvin Phillips, the former tasked with the winning the ball, the latter to distribute pinpoint forward passes.\nRasmus Kristensen was all-action at full-back, but may need greater help in such a narrow formation against sides like Wolves with wide players eager to double up in attack.\nMost impressive of all was Brenden Aaronson, who was a constant source of energy and endeavour, some of which he used to dart into the box and force Ait-Nouri to score the winner into his own net from Bamford's cross.\nHe lacks the outright flair of Raphinha - the man he was brought in to help replace - but in his own industrious way could prove as effective.\nAs Marsch pointed out before the game, the team may have lost two stars, but in general it has become stronger, helped by the recent arrival of three players who have operated under the American before in Aaronson, Adams and Rasmussen.\nIt wasn't perfect and at times threatened to topple over as Wolves came on strong after the break, but there was enough there for Leeds to believe they can avoid the trauma of last season's relegation fight.\n\"I am really pleased that we look like a team that understands what the tactics and ideas are with the ball much better than we did last season,\" said Marsch. \"It was a big struggle to implement tactically what we want to achieve.\n\"We still have a lot of work to do but the three points validates the pre-season we have had and the work we have done.\"\n'The club are talking with players'\nWolves' deficiencies are clear to see. So are their qualities.\nNathan Collins remains their only significant signing of the summer, with the ex-Burnley man making an efficient debut at Elland Road in the middle of a back four that did not include stalwart Conor Coady.\nWith Jimenez sidelined for a few more weeks and Fabio Silva out on loan, they desperately need some firepower to complement the creative powers of their wide forwards.\nThey finished 10th last season after having scored the fewest goals of any club to remain in the division, but to gamble on a repeat would be foolhardy.\nLage was pleased with his side's performance - one that would have yielded greater reward but for key misses by Hwang Hee-chan and Leander Dendoncker - but is aware of the need for reinforcements.\n\"I think we did a good game,\" Lage said. \"I think we were the better team, we created a lot of chances, and we didn't score. I'm happy with the performance, but not happy with the result.\n\"I said before the game that we came here with big confidence, and we'll score goals because the pre-season was good and we have confidence to play in this system. I was right to feel that confidence, and we continued to play.\"\nHe added: \"It's time to be patient because we are talking with players. I know the club are talking with players and those players can come and increase the level of the team and the squad.\n\"They will give solutions that we didn't have today.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They are ready, they look hungry, with that mentality that they really want to win,\" Arteta told Match of the Day.\n\"The team came here to play the way we wanted to play - we were dominant, we were a threat, we were really lively and sharp from the beginning.

Debutant Marcus Tavernier's corner was headed down by Lloyd Kelly for Jefferson Lerma to fire home.\nThey should have taken a two-goal lead into the interval but Kieffer Moore was unable to meet a low ball into the box from Adam Smith, who had been played through by the excellent Dominic Solanke.\nWales international Moore, who at the age of 29 was making his debut in the top flight, eventually doubled the home side's lead with a commanding header on 80 minutes after Kelly played a dangerous cross back into Villa's area.\nPrior to that, Danny Ings had a shot saved by Cherries keeper Mark Travers and new Villa captain John McGinn saw a long-range drive go high and wide, but it was debutant Boubacar Kamara who had gone closest to an equaliser for the visitors.\nThe French midfielder - a free transfer from Marseille - found himself in space and unleashed a right-footed effort from 30 yards that just went wide.\nChampionship runners-up Bournemouth visit defending Premier League champions Manchester City next, while Villa welcome Everton.\nCherries delight, Villa disappointed\nBournemouth are likely to face a tough task to avoid relegation in their first season back in the Premier League but for now, at least, boss Scott Parker can be pleased with the spirit shown by his team in front of their home supporters.\nAfter signing a four-year extension to stay until the summer of 2026, Solanke offered the same physical presence up front that saw him contribute 29 goals to the Cherries' promotion campaign last season.\nA promising debut by new recruit Tavernier should also satisfy Parker.

Protests against the United owners before kick-off meant the club shop had to be shut.\nCo-chairman Avie Glazer was paying a rare visit and would have heard the songs to his left calling for his family to get out of the club.\nOn the pitch, there was no cohesion despite decent debuts from Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez.\nBrighton, well drilled and fluid, took advantage. Leandro Trossard volleyed into the side-netting within 15 seconds of the start and United failed to impose themselves on the game until it was far too late.\nFor the opener, Welbeck's run split Maguire and Martinez. The latter came across from the left to cover the cross, leaving a huge hole in the six-yard box and, as United's defence scrambled to plug the gaps, Gross was on his own to tap home at the far post.\nHe was in a similar position but on the other post when Solly March cut inside and unleashed a low shot, which keeper David de Gea turned into his path.\nThe boos that accompanied the half-time whistle were predictable and deserved. Within eight minutes of the resumption, Ronaldo had been introduced to try and lead a rescue mission.\nThe 37-year-old had a negligible impact. It was another Portuguese, Diogo Dalot, who created the confusion that led to United's goal. But by the end it was Brighton who looked more likely to score again.\nPotter's fabulous job\nAmid the inevitable soul-searching for United at this dreadful result, Potter's influence at Brighton should not be underestimated.\nHe has lost Yves Bissouma and Marc Cucurella for a combined \u00a388m from the side that beat United in May. Director of football Dan Ashworth has also gone. None of Brighton's summer signings started this match.\nBut they moved the ball with a purpose absent from United, while Welbeck was a particular threat against his old club.\nGross and Trossard were both superb and, even without Bissouma, Brighton controlled midfield to ensure United were not able to turn their industry into something more tangible.\nLittle wonder the jubilant visiting fans chanted \"can we play you every week?\".\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Protests against the United owners before kick-off meant the club shop had to be shut.\nCo-chairman Avie Glazer was paying a rare visit and would have heard the songs to his left calling for his family to get out of the club.\nOn the pitch, there was no cohesion despite decent debuts from Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez.\nBrighton, well drilled and fluid, took advantage. Leandro Trossard volleyed into the side-netting within 15 seconds of the start and United failed to impose themselves on the game until it was far too late.\nFor the opener, Welbeck's run split Maguire and Martinez. The latter came across from the left to cover the cross, leaving a huge hole in the six-yard box and, as United's defence scrambled to plug the gaps, Gross was on his own to tap home at the far post.\nHe was in a similar position but on the other post when Solly March cut inside and unleashed a low shot, which keeper David de Gea turned into his path.\nThe boos that accompanied the half-time whistle were predictable and deserved. Within eight minutes of the resumption, Ronaldo had been introduced to try and lead a rescue mission.\nThe 37-year-old had a negligible impact. It was another Portuguese, Diogo Dalot, who created the confusion that led to United's goal. But by the end it was Brighton who looked more likely to score again.\nPotter's fabulous job\nAmid the inevitable soul-searching for United at this dreadful result, Potter's influence at Brighton should not be underestimated.\nHe has lost Yves Bissouma and Marc Cucurella for a combined \u00a388m from the side that beat United in May. Director of football Dan Ashworth has also gone. None of Brighton's summer signings started this match.\nBut they moved the ball with a purpose absent from United, while Welbeck was a particular threat against his old club.\nGross and Trossard were both superb and, even without Bissouma, Brighton controlled midfield to ensure United were not able to turn their industry into something more tangible.\nLittle wonder the jubilant visiting fans chanted \"can we play you every week?\".\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

With Lisandro Martinez - subbed at half-time - slow to close off the space, Dasilva sent a low shot towards the goal that escaped De Gea's grasp.\nThat set the tone for the first half as Brentford ran riot. The impressive Jensen anticipated De Gea's risky pass to Eriksen and punished both players, before Toney used his height advantage to beat Martinez in the air and tee up Mee, who marked his home debut with a goal.\nThe fourth goal summed up the difference between the sides. After Jadon Sancho was muscled off the ball inside the Brentford box, the hosts pumped the ball long to Toney.\nWith United slow to react to the developing counter-attack, Toney slipped in Mbeumo, who shook off Luke Shaw and swept the ball home to spark delirious scenes among the home fans.\nTen Hag's response was to introduce Raphael Varane, Scott McTominay and Tyrell Malacia at the break, but with his players apparently in shock, United were unable to mount the miraculous comeback required to salvage something from the game as Brentford strolled to a victory that will live long in the memory.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Moussa Niakhate and Awoniyi both threatened with headers, while Neco Williams drew a decent save from Lukasz Fabianski, who also had to palm away a goal-bound header from team-mate Soucek.\nThe backing kept Forest going on a blisteringly hot day - and the reward came in first-half stoppage time.\nAwoniyi spent six years as a Liverpool player without making a single first-team appearance, before moving to Union Berlin in 2021 and then, a year later, to Forest.\nAs with a number of the club's summer recruits, Awoniyi has a point to prove. His finish was reactive, but he needed to be in the right place at the right time - and his name will now go into Forest folklore along with all the other great names associated with the two-time European Cup winners.\nHenderson is another who wants to show how good he is.

But Palace had a golden chance of their own when Zaha struck the far post when he should have scored, as Liverpool remain without a win from their first two games.\nNo excuse for Nunez madness\nDarwin Nunez has made an excellent impression in his early days at Liverpool following his move from Benfica, scoring in the Community Shield win against Manchester City and also getting on target in the opening weekend draw at Fulham.\nHere, he left Anfield with his head bowed after a totally inexcusable moment of ill-discipline that reduced Liverpool to 10 men and weakened their attacking impetus.\nNunez may have been wound up by Andersen but what followed was idiotic and expensive as he thrust his head straight into the Palace defender, leaving Tierney with no option but to send him off.\nThe brilliant Diaz stepped into the breach with a moment of magic for the equaliser while Harvey Elliott was also outstanding before he was substituted.\nLiverpool had moments towards the end but were uncomfortable when Palace pressed, so had to settle for a draw that already leaves them four points behind expected title rivals Manchester City.\nPalace show resilience and threat\nPatrick Vieira's Crystal Palace demonstrated in their opening game against Arsenal, even in defeat, that they have the capability to build on the development they showed in the manager's first campaign.\nAnd they will take huge self-confidence and belief after a point at Anfield which, with better finishing, could even have been three.\nPalace spent much of the game defending, with Andersen and Marc Guehi solid, but Zaha's goal on the counter-attack showed what they are all about, with Eze another fine contributor.\nZaha was a danger all night but held his head in anguish when he could only turn that opportunity at the far post against the upright with the goal at his mercy.\nPalace held firm in the closing stages despite having to contend with a wall of noise from the Kop to earn a draw that will delight them, as will their performance.\nFollow all the match analysis and reaction\nVisit our Liverpool page\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

And we will find many of these situations, but it is just a little bit of question of time.\n\"With the right movement and the right tempo, and with the quality of the players that we have behind him to assist him, we will find him - I don't have any doubts about that.\"\nDe Bruyne dazzles again\nCity had dominated since kick-off, and it did not take long for more goals to follow Gundogan's opener.\nThe impressive Kevin de Bruyne made it 2-0 with a dazzling solo strike, gliding to the corner of the area before bending the ball into the bottom corner with the outside of his boot.\nAnd Phil Foden made sure of the points before half-time, running on to a De Bruyne pass and letting fly with a shot that Cherries keeper Mark Travers got his body behind, but could not keep out.\nBournemouth spent most of their time defending in a compact 5-4-1 formation, and only forced home keeper Ederson into action once, through a Ben Pearson snap-shot from the edge of the area.\nThey never looked remotely capable of staging a comeback in the second half, which had turned into a stroll in the Manchester sunshine for the home side long before Jefferson Lerma's own goal made it 4-0.\nLerma was trying to stop Joao Cancelo's low cross from reaching substitute Bernardo Silva, but only succeeded in sending the ball spinning past Travers to complete an afternoon to forget for his team.\nReaction to Man City v Bournemouth and the rest of Saturday's action\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nVisit our AFC Bournemouth page\nNo Haaland goal - but no problems for City\nIt already seems somewhat surprising to see City score four times without Haaland getting any of them, but this victory was a reminder of the goal threat that runs right through this team, not just from their new striker.\nBournemouth were under threat from the first minute, when Nathan Ake headed wide from a corner, with Rodri nodding over from the same source soon afterwards.\nRiyad Mahrez and Foden also forced saves from Travers in the opening 10 minutes, although Haaland may feel Foden should have squared the ball to find him unmarked in front of goal instead of shooting.\nIf Haaland was getting frustrated at his lack of involvement, he did not let it show - instead using his power to hold off his marker and set up Gundogan for a cool finish that sent City on their way.\nDe Bruyne's brilliance created their second and third goals, but Haaland's chances of getting on the scoresheet remained limited.\nAfter the Norwegian's heavy touch from a Ruben Dias pass into the area - when Travers collected the ball before Haaland could control it - the Cherries keeper tipped over his lob when he did get a shot away.\nHaaland's last chance came and went when he screwed wide from a Jack Grealish pull-back with 20 minutes to go, and he was replaced by Julian Alvarez moments later.\nThe former Borussia Dortmund man's eight touches - his only other pass apart from his assist was when he kicked off the second half - were the fewest of any player who started the game, but he was still given a standing ovation from the home fans. On this evidence, City remain hard to stop even when he is not at his very best.\nBournemouth happy with damage limitation\nBournemouth had began the season in impressive style themselves, with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa, but they never came close to repeating that result here.\nScott Parker's side struggled to get out of their own half with the score at 0-0 and paid the price for trying to get further up the pitch after falling behind.\nThey only succeeded in leaving City space to break into for the first time, and De Bruyne punished them with his brilliant finish after reaching the edge of the Cherries area without being challenged.\nWhen Bournemouth did finally get the ball up to Kieffer Moore at the other end, he created a shooting opportunity for Pearson, but any sights of goal were few and far between for the visitors.\nDamage limitation seemed a more sensible approach for Parker's side than chasing a way back into the game - especially given the soaring temperatures at Etihad Stadium, and the quality of the opposition.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Moussa Niakhate and Awoniyi both threatened with headers, while Neco Williams drew a decent save from Lukasz Fabianski, who also had to palm away a goal-bound header from team-mate Soucek.\nThe backing kept Forest going on a blisteringly hot day - and the reward came in first-half stoppage time.\nAwoniyi spent six years as a Liverpool player without making a single first-team appearance, before moving to Union Berlin in 2021 and then, a year later, to Forest.\nAs with a number of the club's summer recruits, Awoniyi has a point to prove. His finish was reactive, but he needed to be in the right place at the right time - and his name will now go into Forest folklore along with all the other great names associated with the two-time European Cup winners.\nHenderson is another who wants to show how good he is. The on-loan Manchester United man produced a superb save at the start of the second half when Soucek was first to the loose ball after Pablo Fornals' strike bounced off the bar.\nFollow Forest v West Ham and the rest of Sunday's action\nVisit our Nottingham Forest page\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nHis best moment was still to come though. With England coach Gareth Southgate watching on from the directors' box and coming 24 hours after United keeper David de Gea's nightmare at Brentford, it could not have come on a better day as he went to his right to repel Rice's spot-kick after Scott McKenna's handball.\nForest thought they had a second through Brennan Johnson but it was ruled out for offside after a VAR intervention.\nIt didn't matter in the end, although there was one negative in the injury centre-back Niakhate picked up before the end.\nWest Ham fail awkward test\nThis would have been an awkward assignment for West Ham anyway given the atmosphere they were bound to encounter.\nBut they hardly helped themselves.\nWith penalty expert Mark Noble retiring, Rice has taken that responsibility as well as the captain's armband.\nHowever, his spot-kick was poor and lacked the accuracy to take it beyond Henderson's reach.\nRice had earlier set Said Benrahma up with a superb defence-splitting pass, only for the goal to be ruled out because Michail Antonio - given a standing ovation from the home fans when he was substituted in recognition of the season he spent as a Forest player - had barged over Orel Mangala in the build-up.\nBenrahma also hit the bar with another superb effort, while Soucek was denied as Harry Toffolo made a dramatic clearance off the line.\nWith \u00a330.5m striker Gianluca Scamacca unable to make an impact after replacing Antonio, West Ham find themselves without a point after two games and plenty of work ahead of them if they are to match the last two seasons' top-seven finishes.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

And we will find many of these situations, but it is just a little bit of question of time.\n\"With the right movement and the right tempo, and with the quality of the players that we have behind him to assist him, we will find him - I don't have any doubts about that.\"\nDe Bruyne dazzles again\nCity had dominated since kick-off, and it did not take long for more goals to follow Gundogan's opener.\nThe impressive Kevin de Bruyne made it 2-0 with a dazzling solo strike, gliding to the corner of the area before bending the ball into the bottom corner with the outside of his boot.\nAnd Phil Foden made sure of the points before half-time, running on to a De Bruyne pass and letting fly with a shot that Cherries keeper Mark Travers got his body behind, but could not keep out.\nBournemouth spent most of their time defending in a compact 5-4-1 formation, and only forced home keeper Ederson into action once, through a Ben Pearson snap-shot from the edge of the area.\nThey never looked remotely capable of staging a comeback in the second half, which had turned into a stroll in the Manchester sunshine for the home side long before Jefferson Lerma's own goal made it 4-0.\nLerma was trying to stop Joao Cancelo's low cross from reaching substitute Bernardo Silva, but only succeeded in sending the ball spinning past Travers to complete an afternoon to forget for his team.\nReaction to Man City v Bournemouth and the rest of Saturday's action\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nVisit our AFC Bournemouth page\nNo Haaland goal - but no problems for City\nIt already seems somewhat surprising to see City score four times without Haaland getting any of them, but this victory was a reminder of the goal threat that runs right through this team, not just from their new striker.\nBournemouth were under threat from the first minute, when Nathan Ake headed wide from a corner, with Rodri nodding over from the same source soon afterwards.\nRiyad Mahrez and Foden also forced saves from Travers in the opening 10 minutes, although Haaland may feel Foden should have squared the ball to find him unmarked in front of goal instead of shooting.\nIf Haaland was getting frustrated at his lack of involvement, he did not let it show - instead using his power to hold off his marker and set up Gundogan for a cool finish that sent City on their way.\nDe Bruyne's brilliance created their second and third goals, but Haaland's chances of getting on the scoresheet remained limited.\nAfter the Norwegian's heavy touch from a Ruben Dias pass into the area - when Travers collected the ball before Haaland could control it - the Cherries keeper tipped over his lob when he did get a shot away.\nHaaland's last chance came and went when he screwed wide from a Jack Grealish pull-back with 20 minutes to go, and he was replaced by Julian Alvarez moments later.\nThe former Borussia Dortmund man's eight touches - his only other pass apart from his assist was when he kicked off the second half - were the fewest of any player who started the game, but he was still given a standing ovation from the home fans. On this evidence, City remain hard to stop even when he is not at his very best.\nBournemouth happy with damage limitation\nBournemouth had began the season in impressive style themselves, with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa, but they never came close to repeating that result here.\nScott Parker's side struggled to get out of their own half with the score at 0-0 and paid the price for trying to get further up the pitch after falling behind.\nThey only succeeded in leaving City space to break into for the first time, and De Bruyne punished them with his brilliant finish after reaching the edge of the Cherries area without being challenged.\nWhen Bournemouth did finally get the ball up to Kieffer Moore at the other end, he created a shooting opportunity for Pearson, but any sights of goal were few and far between for the visitors.\nDamage limitation seemed a more sensible approach for Parker's side than chasing a way back into the game - especially given the soaring temperatures at Etihad Stadium, and the quality of the opposition.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

With Lisandro Martinez - subbed at half-time - slow to close off the space, Dasilva sent a low shot towards the goal that escaped De Gea's grasp.\nThat set the tone for the first half as Brentford ran riot. The impressive Jensen anticipated De Gea's risky pass to Eriksen and punished both players, before Toney used his height advantage to beat Martinez in the air and tee up Mee, who marked his home debut with a goal.\nThe fourth goal summed up the difference between the sides. After Jadon Sancho was muscled off the ball inside the Brentford box, the hosts pumped the ball long to Toney.\nWith United slow to react to the developing counter-attack, Toney slipped in Mbeumo, who shook off Luke Shaw and swept the ball home to spark delirious scenes among the home fans.\nTen Hag's response was to introduce Raphael Varane, Scott McTominay and Tyrell Malacia at the break, but with his players apparently in shock, United were unable to mount the miraculous comeback required to salvage something from the game as Brentford strolled to a victory that will live long in the memory.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

One of the other goals in that run came in Leicester's last win, which was against the Saints on the final day of last season.\nLeicester could have done with imposing centre-back Fofana when Southampton equalised, as they failed to deal with a throw-in before Adams slotted in. James Justin desperately tried to stop the shot on the line but helped it on its way in instead.\nThe Saints were in the ascendancy then and briefly thought they had a penalty when Joe Aribo went round goalkeeper Ward and went to ground, but he was booked for diving.\nIt was Adams who would be the match winner with a beautiful flying volley after Kyle Walker-Peters had fed Ward-Prowse on the right win to cross in. Adams went close to a hat-trick late on when he struck the post.\nVictory eased the pressure on Hasenhuttl, but increased it on Rodgers, whose Leicester side have now lost five points from winning positions in their three Premier League games this season.

One of the other goals in that run came in Leicester's last win, which was against the Saints on the final day of last season.\nLeicester could have done with imposing centre-back Fofana when Southampton equalised, as they failed to deal with a throw-in before Adams slotted in. James Justin desperately tried to stop the shot on the line but helped it on its way in instead.\nThe Saints were in the ascendancy then and briefly thought they had a penalty when Joe Aribo went round goalkeeper Ward and went to ground, but he was booked for diving.\nIt was Adams who would be the match winner with a beautiful flying volley after Kyle Walker-Peters had fed Ward-Prowse on the right win to cross in. Adams went close to a hat-trick late on when he struck the post.\nVictory eased the pressure on Hasenhuttl, but increased it on Rodgers, whose Leicester side have now lost five points from winning positions in their three Premier League games this season. The last time they failed to win in their opening three games was 2014-15.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Pope saved with his legs to deny Haaland and Phil Foden and kept out an effort from De Bruyne as the visitors piled on the pressure.\nNewcastle started to get back in the game and Saint-Maximin had an effort parried by Ederson with Wilson also unable to convert a chance as he lost his balance.\nBut it became 1-1 in the 28th minute as Saint-Maximin crossed from the left and Almiron, who had earlier wasted an opportunity by firing over, flung himself at the ball, which bounced off his thigh and into the net.\nIt had originally been ruled out for offside but a VAR check showed Joao Cancelo and Kyle Walker had played him onside - to the delight of Almiron, who celebrated his first goal of the season.\nIt would have been a satisfying moment for him as he had been recently mocked by City's Jack Grealish, absent at St James' Park after picking up a knock in the 4-0 win over Bournemouth eight days ago.\nDuring City's title celebrations in May, the England forward joked Riyad Mahrez had played 'like Almiron' in their final-day victory over Aston Villa, but the Paraguayan silenced his critic in the best way possible.\nNewcastle scored again just before half time when Saint-Maximin played a ball into Wilson, who produced an excellent first touch to evade both Ruben Dias and John Stones before putting his side ahead.\nCity, facing their first away league defeat since 15 August 2021 when they lost 1-0 at Tottenham, fell further behind with Trippier's excellent free-kick.\nNewcastle unable to hold on to two-goal lead\nBut with the home fans ecstatic at their side's advantage, City showed why they have been English champions in four of the past five seasons, producing an excellent recovery.\nHaaland had faced criticism after only having eight touches in the 4-0 win over Bournemouth, although he did register an assist.\nBut the Norway striker grabbed his third league goal since his \u00a351.2m move from Borussia Dortmund in June with a predator's finish from close range, reacting quickest to convert Rodri's pullback.\nSilva then calmly finished from De Bruyne's pass to leave it at 3-3 with 26 minutes to go and set up a thrilling finale - in which Trippier feared he had been dismissed, only to be reprieved.\nNeither side could find a winner as a frantic afternoon ended in a draw with both teams maintaining their unbeaten league starts, with City second on seven points, two more than sixth-placed Newcastle.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Changes at the break brought a brief improvement, only for Saliba's strike to squash them again.\nThe Cherries are in need of reinforcements, with defenders and forwards both surely on Scott Parker's wishlist after new signing Marcos Senesi was given a torrid time by Jesus on his full Bournemouth debut.\nThey will have more mobility upfront when Dominic Solanke is fully fit, but against this class of opposition, the squad looks short of Premier League quality.\nWith a daunting trip to Anfield up next, it may get worse before it gets better for Parker's side.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

You need someone with a bit of composure in that moment to be clinical.\"\nForest make impressive return\nBack in the top flight after a 23-year absence, it is going to be a season of notable moments for Nottingham Forest and they were on the verge of a first Premier League away win since 1999 until it was clinically snatched away on Merseyside.\nSteve Cooper still harboured aspirations of making it as a player with Wrexham the last time these sides met in the Premier League at Goodison, when Ron Atkinson picked up his first win as Forest manager that same year.\nCooper spent the majority of his playing days at Bangor City but, after switching to coaching aged 27, has instead shown his managerial ability and, backed by \u00a3140m of signings, will expect to stay in the top division.\nNeco Williams is one of those to have come in and he looked dangerous on the right, while Taiwo Awoniyi - also once of Liverpool - failed to capitalise on a James Tarkowski mistake in the first half.\nYet it was one of Forest's homegrown youngsters who stole the limelight as Wales winger Johnson found the bottom corner with nine minutes to play. \nThe visitors could not hang on, but four points from their opening three games is a solid start for Cooper's side.\n\"We should have won, we were the better team,\" said Cooper. \"It was a poor goal to concede and we shouldn't be conceding it at this level, but let's not lose sight of all the good things we did.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

There's pressure on him and I thought he handled it brilliantly.\"\nBrentford v Everton as it happened & rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nVisit our Brentford page\nGo straight to all the best Everton content\nHaving signed Neal Maupay from Brighton, much of the transfer speculation surrounding Everton in the final week of the transfer window is expected to focus on Gordon's immediate future.\nWith Gordon regarded as one of Everton's brightest prospects and a popular figure among fans having come through the club's academy structure, the Toffees are understandably reluctant to let him go.\nBut if he does leave before Thursday's deadline, he will do so having offered an exciting glimpse of his potential as he controlled a long Conor Coady pass before firing an inch-perfect left-footed strike past David Raya.\n\"He's a level of player at 21 years of age, with what he showed last year, everyone is talking about and clubs are interested in him, and have had a nibble at him,\" added Lampard.\n\"But he's our player so I don't come away from today thinking 'oh dear that's made someone keen to pay more millions for him'. I come away thinking 'he's an Everton player and I want him to stay'. Simple.\"\nEverton defender James Tarkowski echoed Lampard's comments by saying Gordon has remained unfazed by talk about his future while admitting he can see why the England Under-21 international is in demand.\n\"He has been different class,\" Tarkowski, who joined Everton in the summer, told Sky Sports.\n\"All the paper talk and all the speculation, to be fair he just cracks on. Whatever comes will happen, but I love having him on my team. There is a reason why teams are after him.\"\nHowever, Gordon's first goal of the season was not enough to earn Everton their first Premier League win of the season as Brentford struck late to deny Lampard's side.\nAnd Janelt's goal came after the Bees had squandered a series of gilt-edged chances.\nBryan Mbeumo missed two of those, while Mathias Jensen, Ivan Toney and Christian Norgaard all saw efforts come back off the woodwork, with Yoane Wissa sending his rebound over the bar after Toney's first-half header struck the frame.\nPickford got down quickly to beat substitute Janelt's header away and the hosts' penalty appeal for a handball against Alex Iwobi was waved away before Janelt poked Keane Lewis-Potter's flick-on home to rescue a point for the home side.\n\"How did we not win? That will be an unknown mystery forever,\" said Brentford manager Thomas Frank.\n\"What a performance. In many ways it was better than the Manchester United game.\n\"It's a game we should win nine out of 10 times, we created seven big chances and hit the woodwork three times.\n\"There were so many positives. If we had those chances again we win that 3-0 or 4-0.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Left-back Andrew Robertson also headed over from in front of goal.\nThe emphatic win maintained Liverpool's dominant run over sides promoted from the Championship, and they have now lost just one of 34 meetings against newly promoted teams.\nCherries both goal-shy and leaky\nBournemouth had enjoyed a pleasant initial return to the Premier League when they beat Aston Villa on the opening weekend, but it has proved to be a false dawn and the remainder of August has been miserable.\nThe south coast side were hammered 4-0 by champions Manchester City, lost 3-0 at home to Arsenal and totally capitulated after conceding twice in the opening five minutes at Anfield.\nParker's men have conceded the most goals in the top flight this season (16) and at the other end have netted just twice.\nTheir total of 21 shots from their opening four games is the second fewest since Sunderland had 20 in 2012-13.\nHome goalkeeper Alisson had a comfortable afternoon in the Merseyside sun, plucking a weak Kieffer Moore header out of the air being the most that he was stretched all game.\nReaction from all of Saturday's action\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

First Saint-Maximin brought a fine save from Sa with a powerful shot, then substitute Elliot Anderson hit the bar with a far-post header after Raul Jimenez flicked a cross into the youngster's path.\nThe result was a massive blow for Wolves, who thought they had made it 2-0 nine minutes from time, only for Jimenez's close-range finish to be ruled out after a VAR intervention for a foul in the build-up.\nWolves were also angry Newcastle defender Fabian Schar was only shown a yellow card instead of red, following a VAR check, for a studs-up challenge on Pedro Neto early in the second half.\nLage says Boly failed to report for Newcastle draw\nSensational Saint-Maximin\nThis was not a point won by Newcastle in the same thrilling manner as last week against Manchester City. But it said so much about the character Eddie Howe has instilled in his squad.\nEven without new signing Alexander Isak - whose work permit is still to be processed, Callum Wilson and Bruno Guimaraes - both influential figures in last week's six-goal thriller against the champions - Newcastle still found a way to get something out of a game they struggled to influence for the first hour.\nJoe Willock was too slow to close down Neves for the Wolves opener and the visitors were passive in midfield.\nYet they never let their heads drop and did not allow themselves to be overwhelmed in the way Newcastle teams of the past might have been.\nAnd, in Saint-Maximin, they have a player capable of moments of genius.\nWolves boss Bruno Lage will lament Hwang's poor clearance, but the home defence had thrown their bodies in front of so many half-chances, there seemed little likelihood of the Korean being punished when the ball fell to the French forward.\nSa barely moved before the ball whistled past him into the corner - Saint-Maximin's first goal of the season being well worth the wait.\nThe result means Newcastle are unbeaten in their first four games for the first time since 2012.\nNeves leads by example\nThis was another example of Wolves failing to make the most of their overall performance.\nAt least they managed to score, after a wait of 302 minutes since their only other league goal of the season, by Daniel Podence on the opening day at Leeds.\nAnd they were led superbly by Neves.\nThe Portugal midfielder was the automatic choice to replace Conor Coady as captain given he skippered Porto in the Champions League when he was just 18 and is one of the few remaining members of Nuno Espirito Santo's Championship-winning squad.\nNeves is not as vocal as Coady - hardly anyone is in fairness - but still has a massive influence on the squad.\nThe 60-yard cross-field pass from inside his own half that allowed Goncalo Guedes the chance to create a decent early opportunity for the lively Neto was sensational, given it was delivered as Neves was moving pretty quickly himself.\nAnd if Newcastle were not ready for Neves' 38th-minute goal, they should have been.\nExactly half of Neves' 16 Premier League goals have come from outside the penalty area, including four of his past five.\nThe sight of him scrapping for possession inside the Newcastle half, when the game remained in the balance, epitomised the midfielder's industrious approach.\nSadly for him, and his team, Saint-Maximin's brilliance ensured it did not bring the victory that, for so long, looked likely.\nFollow live updates and radio from Premier League\nVisit our Wolves page\nGo straight to all the best Newcastle content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Left-back Andrew Robertson also headed over from in front of goal.\nThe emphatic win maintained Liverpool's dominant run over sides promoted from the Championship, and they have now lost just one of 34 meetings against newly promoted teams.\nCherries both goal-shy and leaky\nBournemouth had enjoyed a pleasant initial return to the Premier League when they beat Aston Villa on the opening weekend, but it has proved to be a false dawn and the remainder of August has been miserable.\nThe south coast side were hammered 4-0 by champions Manchester City, lost 3-0 at home to Arsenal and totally capitulated after conceding twice in the opening five minutes at Anfield.\nParker's men have conceded the most goals in the top flight this season (16) and at the other end have netted just twice.\nTheir total of 21 shots from their opening four games is the second fewest since Sunderland had 20 in 2012-13.\nHome goalkeeper Alisson had a comfortable afternoon in the Merseyside sun, plucking a weak Kieffer Moore header out of the air being the most that he was stretched all game.\nReaction from all of Saturday's action\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

First Saint-Maximin brought a fine save from Sa with a powerful shot, then substitute Elliot Anderson hit the bar with a far-post header after Raul Jimenez flicked a cross into the youngster's path.\nThe result was a massive blow for Wolves, who thought they had made it 2-0 nine minutes from time, only for Jimenez's close-range finish to be ruled out after a VAR intervention for a foul in the build-up.\nWolves were also angry Newcastle defender Fabian Schar was only shown a yellow card instead of red, following a VAR check, for a studs-up challenge on Pedro Neto early in the second half.\nLage says Boly failed to report for Newcastle draw\nSensational Saint-Maximin\nThis was not a point won by Newcastle in the same thrilling manner as last week against Manchester City. But it said so much about the character Eddie Howe has instilled in his squad.\nEven without new signing Alexander Isak - whose work permit is still to be processed, Callum Wilson and Bruno Guimaraes - both influential figures in last week's six-goal thriller against the champions - Newcastle still found a way to get something out of a game they struggled to influence for the first hour.\nJoe Willock was too slow to close down Neves for the Wolves opener and the visitors were passive in midfield.\nYet they never let their heads drop and did not allow themselves to be overwhelmed in the way Newcastle teams of the past might have been.\nAnd, in Saint-Maximin, they have a player capable of moments of genius.\nWolves boss Bruno Lage will lament Hwang's poor clearance, but the home defence had thrown their bodies in front of so many half-chances, there seemed little likelihood of the Korean being punished when the ball fell to the French forward.\nSa barely moved before the ball whistled past him into the corner - Saint-Maximin's first goal of the season being well worth the wait.\nThe result means Newcastle are unbeaten in their first four games for the first time since 2012.\nNeves leads by example\nThis was another example of Wolves failing to make the most of their overall performance.\nAt least they managed to score, after a wait of 302 minutes since their only other league goal of the season, by Daniel Podence on the opening day at Leeds.\nAnd they were led superbly by Neves.\nThe Portugal midfielder was the automatic choice to replace Conor Coady as captain given he skippered Porto in the Champions League when he was just 18 and is one of the few remaining members of Nuno Espirito Santo's Championship-winning squad.\nNeves is not as vocal as Coady - hardly anyone is in fairness - but still has a massive influence on the squad.\nThe 60-yard cross-field pass from inside his own half that allowed Goncalo Guedes the chance to create a decent early opportunity for the lively Neto was sensational, given it was delivered as Neves was moving pretty quickly himself.\nAnd if Newcastle were not ready for Neves' 38th-minute goal, they should have been.\nExactly half of Neves' 16 Premier League goals have come from outside the penalty area, including four of his past five.\nThe sight of him scrapping for possession inside the Newcastle half, when the game remained in the balance, epitomised the midfielder's industrious approach.\nSadly for him, and his team, Saint-Maximin's brilliance ensured it did not bring the victory that, for so long, looked likely.\nFollow live updates and radio from Premier League\nVisit our Wolves page\nGo straight to all the best Newcastle content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We need him to score, it's what he does and he will score. I could feel he wasn't happy - he wants to score more and have more chances.\n\"We played in a more aggressive shape in the first half for 25 minutes and then we are a man down, so we needed him to step up - he did, and he did what he always does. He will score, I'm convinced, and he will create chances.\"\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content\nVisit our Leicester City page\nSterling inspires Chelsea win\nTuchel had to watch this match from the stands after his sending-off in the tussle that followed the draw with Tottenham, but said before this fixture he is \"enjoying the challenge\" of building a new side.\nHe will have definitely enjoyed seeing one of his new arrivals earn Chelsea their first win at Stamford Bridge this season.\nSterling was influential and put the hosts in front with a curling effort that took a deflection off Amartey to beat a despairing Danny Ward in the Leicester goal.\nThe former Manchester City winger struck a post moments later from a Marc Cucurella pass - another summer purchase - but the 27-year-old did not have to wait long for his second Blues goal, arriving to tap in a delicious low cross from the right from James, who earlier struck the outside of a post with a thumping half volley.\nSterling also teed up Ruben Loftus-Cheek early on but the midfielder was denied by Ward when he really should have put the hosts in front.\nYouri Tielemans then hauled Loftus-Cheek down in the box and Sterling was waiting to take the spot-kick only for VAR to rule Kai Havertz offside by the narrowest of margins.\nAll this came amid a chaotic few moments for Gallagher, who, having been booked in the 22nd minute, needlessly dived in on Harvey Barnes to stop a Foxes break and was shown a red card - Chelsea's third in as many games.\nThe Blues were without boss Tuchel and defender Kalidou Koulibaly following his red card against Leeds, and believe the answer to any defensive issues is a talented young centre-back currently training with their opponents' under-23s.\nReports suggesting a deal of about \u00a370m for Wesley Fofana has been agreed dominated the build-up to this game, and the 21-year-old Frenchman was not named in the Leicester squad because of personal reasons, with Rodgers saying he trained elsewhere this week.\nHowever, neither boss would be drawn on the potential transfer after the game.\nAnd while Fofana may be the future of the Blues' defence, Thiago Silva showed they can still rely on their experienced campaigners as the 37-year-old helped the 10 men survive wave after wave of late pressure.\nWorrying times for Leicester\nRodgers has insisted he is not feeling the pressure despite Leicester's poor start but he has now lost three successive games for the first time in eight years and the Foxes are without a top-flight win in their opening four for the first time since 2003.\nThe Leicester boss may have felt hard done by when Amartey's effort was ruled out for a foul by Barnes on Mendy with the game goalless, but the visitors then found themselves 2-0 down despite their numerical advantage.\nFofana's impending exit may mean Leicester belatedly spend some money this window - goalkeeper Alex Smithies on a free transfer the only arrival so far - with Rodgers' outfit looking in need of reinforcements.\nThey could be bottom of the league by the end of the weekend with the close of the transfer window fast approaching.\n\"We were unlucky not to draw, but to lose is disappointing,\" said Rodgers. \"We knocked on the door a lot.

Marsch added: \"They popped it back in and seems to be ok. He will have a scan.\"\nThe Leeds striker had their best chance of the first half when he was inches away from connecting with a Harrison cross early on, but it was only after the break that the hosts began to test Pickford.\nFirst, Aaronson drew a fine stop from the Everton goalkeeper before Harrison had another effort saved.\nBut the England number one could do little about Sinisterra's effort from the edge of the box.\nElland Road erupted at that point, and it threatened to spill over as Gordon and Rasmus Kristensen put their heads together shortly afterwards, leading to a yellow card each, and the two benches clashed too.\nAt times, it felt like a throwback to another era, but the football was thrilling even if Patrick Bamford's return from injury could not conjure a winner.\nDespite the feeling of disappointment at the end, Leeds recovered from their first defeat of the season at Brighton on Saturday to show they mean business under Marsch with the point keeping them fifth in the table.\nEverton lack punch up front as Maupay misses out\nAlthough Lampard will be disappointed his side could not take advantage of their own chances late on, with Patterson clean through on goal but denied by Meslier, his side showed enough defensive prowess to merit a point.\nGordon, who has been the subject of at least one rejected \u00a345m bid from Chelsea during the transfer window, showed his composure and why Lampard is keen to hold onto the England under-21 international.\nBut a third draw of the season was also credit to a new-look defence who were well marshalled by the new centre-back pairing of Conor Coady and James Tarkowski. They were also protected well by summer signing Onana, who looked impressive at the base of midfield.\nThat part of Lampard's side was much improved on last season, but where they struggled again was in scoring goals, even if Demarai Gray had the ball in the net only to be denied by a marginal offside decision, which was confirmed by the video assistant referee.\nWith Dominic Calvert-Lewin still injured, the arrival of Neal Maupay from Brighton on Friday was supposed to help that cause, but he frustratingly sat on the bench because Everton had missed the midday deadline in order for him to play.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I'm not 100% sure they all believed until the end but from now on we have to as we showed again it is possible.\"\nLiverpool fighting spirit wins through\nLiverpool have a long history of late Anfield winners and this was another one to add to the list as victory was snatched from a disappointing draw.\nKlopp's side struggled to mount any momentum in the face of Newcastle's stubborn resistance, as well as what the Liverpool bench and Anfield regarded as blatant time-wasting tactics.\nThat made it even more ironic that the winner came so late.\nIt was Carvalho, who celebrated his 20th birthday on Tuesday, who scored the headline-grabbing winner but it was another Liverpool youngster, Harvey Elliott, who took the fight to Newcastle as Anfield's anxiety mounted.\nThe 19-year-old was always probing, demanding the ball, driving Liverpool forward when his more experienced and illustrious colleagues could not make an impact.\n\"Harvey Elliott was the best player on the pitch, without a shadow of a doubt,\" added Klopp. \"It was nice to see he picks up from where he was before the bad injury.\"\nEven Virgil van Dijk was not safe from Anfield's ire when he played a couple of lazy long passes in the second half but all was well that ended well as Carvalho emerged from a scramble to fire home the winner.\nIt may only be five games into the season but it was enough for Klopp to bring out his trademark fist pumps in front of the Kop.\nHowever, it was not all perfect for Klopp as captain Jordan Henderson went off with a hamstring injury.\nNewcastle show growing maturity\nNewcastle's attempts to halt Liverpool's rhythm and momentum may have provoked fury from the Anfield crowd and Klopp - leading to some angry exchanges at the final whistle - but there was much in this performance to satisfy manager Howe.\nHe will rightly state it is not his job to send out a team to play in a manner that will please the opposing manager and supporters, and if this game had ended a few seconds earlier the satisfaction would have been all his.\nInstead Howe, along with his backroom staff and players, were the picture of despair as Carvalho fired in the injury-time decider.\nWhen the dust settles, however, Howe will be pleased with the manner in which his Newcastle team defended with such organisation and maturity in front of their excellent goalkeeper Pope.\nAnd on first sight, Newcastle have added real quality up front in new striker Isak.\nThe 22-year-old Swede showed pace, a tireless work-rate and serious threat, scoring one goal and showing real composure for what he thought was a second until the offside flag was raised.\nNewcastle's performance was even more creditable as it was delivered without talisman Allan Saint-Maximin, main creator Bruno Guimaraes and last season's top scorer Callum Wilson.\nThe result was a disappointment for Howe but the performance will not be.\n\"That's the pain of football,\" said Howe. \"That's the horrible side of it when your team has given everything. It is a sickener for us but it is part of the game. We just didn't deal with the corner.\n\"I thought we played well in the first half. Naturally when you are 1-0 up here you are not going to be the dominant team and you are going to have to withstand pressure.

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Liverpool 2-1 Newcastle: Last-gasp Fabio Carvalho winner will be remembered for years and years, says Jurgen Klopp\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp believes Fabio Carvalho's last-gasp winner against Newcastle at Anfield will be \"remembered for years and years\".\nThe visitors' new \u00a360m striker Alexander Isak crowned an impressive debut with a goal to give Eddie Howe's side the lead seven minutes before the break.\nThe signing from Real Sociedad, who only received visa clearance to play hours before kick-off, had a second ruled out for offside before Liverpool mounted the comeback that ended with a familiar Anfield finale.\nLiverpool were never at their best after Saturday's 9-0 thrashing of Bournemouth but they maintained the pressure and were back on level terms just after the hour when Roberto Firmino sent a crisp finish beyond Newcastle keeper Nick Pope from Mohammed Salah's pass.\nAnd with only seconds left, substitute Carvalho pounced at the far post after Newcastle failed to clear a corner to give Jurgen Klopp's side victory.\n\"It's massive,\" said Klopp.\n\"We will remember it for years and years. I'm not 100% sure they all believed until the end but from now on we have to as we showed again it is possible.\"\nLiverpool fighting spirit wins through\nLiverpool have a long history of late Anfield winners and this was another one to add to the list as victory was snatched from a disappointing draw.\nKlopp's side struggled to mount any momentum in the face of Newcastle's stubborn resistance, as well as what the Liverpool bench and Anfield regarded as blatant time-wasting tactics.\nThat made it even more ironic that the winner came so late.\nIt was Carvalho, who celebrated his 20th birthday on Tuesday, who scored the headline-grabbing winner but it was another Liverpool youngster, Harvey Elliott, who took the fight to Newcastle as Anfield's anxiety mounted.\nThe 19-year-old was always probing, demanding the ball, driving Liverpool forward when his more experienced and illustrious colleagues could not make an impact.\n\"Harvey Elliott was the best player on the pitch, without a shadow of a doubt,\" added Klopp. \"It was nice to see he picks up from where he was before the bad injury.\"\nEven Virgil van Dijk was not safe from Anfield's ire when he played a couple of lazy long passes in the second half but all was well that ended well as Carvalho emerged from a scramble to fire home the winner.\nIt may only be five games into the season but it was enough for Klopp to bring out his trademark fist pumps in front of the Kop.\nHowever, it was not all perfect for Klopp as captain Jordan Henderson went off with a hamstring injury.\nNewcastle show growing maturity\nNewcastle's attempts to halt Liverpool's rhythm and momentum may have provoked fury from the Anfield crowd and Klopp - leading to some angry exchanges at the final whistle - but there was much in this performance to satisfy manager Howe.\nHe will rightly state it is not his job to send out a team to play in a manner that will please the opposing manager and supporters, and if this game had ended a few seconds earlier the satisfaction would have been all his.\nInstead Howe, along with his backroom staff and players, were the picture of despair as Carvalho fired in the injury-time decider.\nWhen the dust settles, however, Howe will be pleased with the manner in which his Newcastle team defended with such organisation and maturity in front of their excellent goalkeeper Pope.\nAnd on first sight, Newcastle have added real quality up front in new striker Isak.\nThe 22-year-old Swede showed pace, a tireless work-rate and serious threat, scoring one goal and showing real composure for what he thought was a second until the offside flag was raised.\nNewcastle's performance was even more creditable as it was delivered without talisman Allan Saint-Maximin, main creator Bruno Guimaraes and last season's top scorer Callum Wilson.\nThe result was a disappointment for Howe but the performance will not be.\n\"That's the pain of football,\" said Howe. \"That's the horrible side of it when your team has given everything. It is a sickener for us but it is part of the game. We just didn't deal with the corner.\n\"I thought we played well in the first half. Naturally when you are 1-0 up here you are not going to be the dominant team and you are going to have to withstand pressure.

As soon as we went into the lead, we just started to defend. I don't see why we do that.\n\"If we'd just continued to press on, I feel like we could have got a second and ended the game.

Once Zaha had opened the scoring with his fourth goal of the season - and sixth in seven home league games - they appeared to be heading towards a second league win of the campaign.\nOlise was unfortunate to see his effort hit the frame of the goal, while Brentford's first strike on target - a Josh Dasilva shot easily held by Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita - came with just 20 minutes remaining.\nBut the Bees kept pushing and snatched an equaliser when Wissa - left completely unmarked in the Palace box - beat Guaita with a firm, well-placed header from Janelt's fine delivery.\nThomas Frank's side then very nearly claimed an unlikely victory as Rico Henry was thwarted by Guaita, before Mee's header thudded against the woodwork.\nPalace brought in four players - Doucoure, Sam Johnstone, Malcolm Ebiowei, and Chris Richards - this summer but Vieira, who took charge of Palace for the 50th time on Tuesday night, says they need more signings before the transfer window closes on Thursday.\nThe Frenchman, though, has refused to comment on rumours Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is set to re-join the club following his successful loan spell at Selhurst Park last term.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

I said to the boys, 'what a chance to show resilience and togetherness at a difficult time.'\"\nBournemouth never seriously threatened to score during the opening 45 minutes and their revitalised play after re-emerging, when Solanke went close and Marcus Tavernier had an attempt blocked, was clearly the result of O'Neil urging them to show more ambition.\nThe 39-year-old owed much of his relief to Wolves' familiar wastefulness.\nJimenez, whose run of 11 games without a goal is the longest of his top-flight career, took a heavy touch after evading his markers in the best opportunity of the game, rolling his effort wide to leave his manager visibly frustrated.\nKelly's quick reaction to thwart Podence came during a period of more than 30 minutes in which Bournemouth did not have an attempt on goal.\nParker's exit was a shock and the squad he left behind delivered a commendably spirited display but it will have done little to ease supporters' concerns about their prospects of avoiding relegation.\nWolves are in the bottom three and Lage looked bemused after another performance matching slick passing with bluntness in front of goal.\nThe result means Bournemouth are the only side to have failed to find the net in four out of five Premier League games so far - and Wolves, who have scored just twice all season, must share their worries about where the next goal might come from.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It is difficult not only for me but every coach.\"\nSpurs were unable to push on after taking the lead and the form of front man Son Heung-min will be a worry. The South Korean is yet to score this season and saw a shot deflect wide in the second period.\nSummer signing Richarlison came on with 15 minutes remaining, but the Brazilian struggled to make an impact in his limited time on the pitch.\nWest Ham pegged their opponents back through Soucek's well-taken goal after a crafty pass from Antonio, making his 200th league appearance for the Hammers.\nJarrod Bowen, yet to net in the league this term, could have won it in injury time but his volley on the stretch went agonisingly wide of the far post.\nWest Ham move up to 14th but have made an inconsistent start, with three consecutive defeats followed the weekend victory over Aston Villa.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Once Zaha had opened the scoring with his fourth goal of the season - and sixth in seven home league games - they appeared to be heading towards a second league win of the campaign.\nOlise was unfortunate to see his effort hit the frame of the goal, while Brentford's first strike on target - a Josh Dasilva shot easily held by Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita - came with just 20 minutes remaining.\nBut the Bees kept pushing and snatched an equaliser when Wissa - left completely unmarked in the Palace box - beat Guaita with a firm, well-placed header from Janelt's fine delivery.\nThomas Frank's side then very nearly claimed an unlikely victory as Rico Henry was thwarted by Guaita, before Mee's header thudded against the woodwork.\nPalace brought in four players - Doucoure, Sam Johnstone, Malcolm Ebiowei, and Chris Richards - this summer but Vieira, who took charge of Palace for the 50th time on Tuesday night, says they need more signings before the transfer window closes on Thursday.\nThe Frenchman, though, has refused to comment on rumours Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is set to re-join the club following his successful loan spell at Selhurst Park last term.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Marsch added: \"They popped it back in and seems to be ok. He will have a scan.\"\nThe Leeds striker had their best chance of the first half when he was inches away from connecting with a Harrison cross early on, but it was only after the break that the hosts began to test Pickford.\nFirst, Aaronson drew a fine stop from the Everton goalkeeper before Harrison had another effort saved.\nBut the England number one could do little about Sinisterra's effort from the edge of the box.\nElland Road erupted at that point, and it threatened to spill over as Gordon and Rasmus Kristensen put their heads together shortly afterwards, leading to a yellow card each, and the two benches clashed too.\nAt times, it felt like a throwback to another era, but the football was thrilling even if Patrick Bamford's return from injury could not conjure a winner.\nDespite the feeling of disappointment at the end, Leeds recovered from their first defeat of the season at Brighton on Saturday to show they mean business under Marsch with the point keeping them fifth in the table.\nEverton lack punch up front as Maupay misses out\nAlthough Lampard will be disappointed his side could not take advantage of their own chances late on, with Patterson clean through on goal but denied by Meslier, his side showed enough defensive prowess to merit a point.\nGordon, who has been the subject of at least one rejected \u00a345m bid from Chelsea during the transfer window, showed his composure and why Lampard is keen to hold onto the England under-21 international.\nBut a third draw of the season was also credit to a new-look defence who were well marshalled by the new centre-back pairing of Conor Coady and James Tarkowski. They were also protected well by summer signing Onana, who looked impressive at the base of midfield.\nThat part of Lampard's side was much improved on last season, but where they struggled again was in scoring goals, even if Demarai Gray had the ball in the net only to be denied by a marginal offside decision, which was confirmed by the video assistant referee.\nWith Dominic Calvert-Lewin still injured, the arrival of Neal Maupay from Brighton on Friday was supposed to help that cause, but he frustratingly sat on the bench because Everton had missed the midday deadline in order for him to play.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He did it in a different league but this is the Premier League. He has to adapt mentally and physically, but he has the skills.\"\nAfter Sancho's strike, United were able to do a containing job on a toothless Leicester side lacking in confidence and urgency and occasionally suffering the discontent of the increasingly impatient Foxes fans.\nUnited were happy to play on the counter and might have added another late on but there was always the feeling one goal was enough to claim the three points.

He did it in a different league but this is the Premier League. He has to adapt mentally and physically, but he has the skills.\"\nAfter Sancho's strike, United were able to do a containing job on a toothless Leicester side lacking in confidence and urgency and occasionally suffering the discontent of the increasingly impatient Foxes fans.\nUnited were happy to play on the counter and might have added another late on but there was always the feeling one goal was enough to claim the three points. And when there were moments of anxiety, the experienced \u00a370m new boy Casemiro came on to steady the ship.\n\"It is another step forward so I am happy with that,\" United boss Ten Hag told BT Sport.\n\"We showed good team spirit.

As far as I know that is still the situation.\n\"I honestly haven't considered whether I want it permanently. I feel like my job at the minute is to get Bournemouth as many points as I can in this period that I am here. I am fully focused on that.\n\"The minute we came off the pitch, I just thought that we need to get ready for Brighton. Whether that is me or someone else, we just need to get some rest into them and go again.\"\nA tactical change at the break against Forest, from a 4-2-3-1 formation to 5-2-3, did the trick for Bournemouth as Billing's thunderous 30-yard effort set them on the road to recovery, and Solanke's overhead kick was his 50th goal for the club in all competitions.\nThe ex-Liverpool man played a huge part in the winner too, nicking the ball off McKenna before feeding Anthony to coolly convert.\nForest, meanwhile, suffered back-to-back defeats under Steve Cooper for the first time, having been thrashed 6-0 by champions Manchester City on Wednesday.\nKouyate's first goal for the club and Johnson's penalty - given after a five-minute check by VAR and referee Michael Oliver on the pitchside monitor - gave them the perfect platform, but they crumbled thereafter.\nClub record signing Taiwo Awoniyi, one of 21 players signed by Forest in the summer transfer window, could have salvaged a point in injury time, but he screwed wide from eight yards out.\nCooper said: \"I didn't see the second half coming. I thought we were very good in the first half, and good for the two-goal lead.\n\"The first goal, we didn't defend well enough before the ball went in the net. That has then set the tone for the second half, and we've not managed that very well.\n\"The second goal was from a set-piece. We should do better. Then there was a mistake from Scott [McKenna] for the third goal. That's the first time he's put a foot wrong since I've been here.\n\"But let's not hide away from the fact that we've thrown away a win. We've not done it in a very good way. We've conceded three goals at home, and there's nothing good about that.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 0-0 Crystal Palace: Hosts denied as goal ruled out by VAR\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said he was \"very surprised\" by the video assistant referee's decision to rule out a goal in a stalemate with Crystal Palace.\nThe hosts were initially awarded a goal by referee Michael Salisbury when Tyrick Mitchell knocked the ball into his own net.\nBut after a VAR review, it was ruled that Joe Willock had fouled Vicente Guaita moments beforehand, although replays showed how Mitchell appeared to push the Newcastle man into the Palace goalkeeper.\nNewcastle had already been left frustrated after record signing Alexander Isak fluffed an attempt to dink the ball over Guaita when clean through, while Miguel Almiron also hit the post with a deflected shot.\nPalace - who, like Newcastle, have only won once this season - did not severely test home goalkeeper Nick Pope until a late improvement, when Odsonne Edouard's close-range shot forced him to save.\nBut, after Willock shinned wide from two yards late on, the point will be welcome for Patrick Vieira's side, who earned their third draw of the season.\nNewcastle are now winless in five games for the first time under Howe, but he said he disagreed with the decision to disallow the own goal.\nFormer Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said it was \"pathetic\" to rule it out.\nHowe added: \"I thought it was a push on Joe Willock in the build-up to the ball coming in. Without that push, there's no way Joe would have gone in with that force. So for me, it's not a foul, if anything, it's a penalty if it's not a goal.\"\nIsak fluffs chance as Newcastle wasteful\nNewcastle and their noisy supporters will have felt aggrieved by the result, especially as some of the crowd were able to watch a replay of the game's biggest talking point on the big screen.\nFrom one angle, it appeared as if Willock took Guaita out, but another view showed how Mitchell was the architect of the collision that left the Newcastle player needing treatment.\nNonetheless referee Salisbury overturning his initial decision led to a smattering of boos at full-time.\nIt was a disappointing return to St James' Park for Newcastle after pushing Liverpool so close in Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield and also sharing a 3-3 draw with Manchester City on their last home outing.\nThey paid for wasteful finishing, with record \u00a360m signing Isak failing to back up his thrilling debut in midweek, where he scored against Liverpool.\nHaving begun brightly at both ends of the pitch, the Swede could have made himself an instant hero in front of the Gallowgate End, as he dispossessed Joachim Andersen on the halfway line but chose to chip Guaita and got it all wrong.\nThe 22-year-old also had a good chance in the second half but his shot was tame, and it summed up a poor game in front of goal for Howe's side, who are missing Callum Wilson, Allan Saint-Maximin and Bruno Guimaraes through injury.\nHowe said of the Swedish international: \"He will be disappointed to miss that because I think he would back himself to score and I'd certainly back him to score but he's gone for a certain type of finish but he didn't quite execute it right.\n\"I thought we starved him of with the ball a little bit and I desperately wanted him to try and get on the ball more, especially in the attacking third.\n\"It's just that he's had no training time with us. So he's been thrust right into action and I think he's done very well but there's a lot of improvement for us as a team to try and serve him.\"\nIn fairness to Isak, there were more chances that fell to Willock and Almiron, but despite spending \u00a3117m in the transfer window, it shows an area of the pitch where Newcastle are perhaps still lacking depth.\nPalace frustrating but snatch point\nPalace have shown a threat this season by going ahead away from home against both Liverpool and Manchester City - although they ended up with a point at Anfield and a 4-2 defeat at Etihad Stadium.\nBut at St James' Park, they could not match Newcastle's energy, and although they carved out several decent first-half chances, none of them really tested Pope.\nWilfried Zaha, who has scored 13 goal in 20 Premier League appearances this calendar year, was frustrated in his attempts to beat Kieran Trippier or Pope. Eberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta also wasted good opportunities.\nThe fact the game was goalless going into the second half was down to Newcastle's wastefulness and some fine Palace defending. Guaita stopped efforts from Sean Longstaff and Sven Botman, while the Dutch defender was also denied by an amazing block by Marc Guehi.\nAfter the hosts started the second half on top once more, Patrick Vieira made a triple substitution to try to revive Palace, and it almost paid off immediately.\nEdouard finally made Pope stretch to make a fine save after twisting and turning in the box.\nAs the game opened up, there were further chances but Palace failed to find the final pass and somehow managed to hang on at the other end.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

As far as I know that is still the situation.\n\"I honestly haven't considered whether I want it permanently. I feel like my job at the minute is to get Bournemouth as many points as I can in this period that I am here. I am fully focused on that.\n\"The minute we came off the pitch, I just thought that we need to get ready for Brighton. Whether that is me or someone else, we just need to get some rest into them and go again.\"\nA tactical change at the break against Forest, from a 4-2-3-1 formation to 5-2-3, did the trick for Bournemouth as Billing's thunderous 30-yard effort set them on the road to recovery, and Solanke's overhead kick was his 50th goal for the club in all competitions.\nThe ex-Liverpool man played a huge part in the winner too, nicking the ball off McKenna before feeding Anthony to coolly convert.\nForest, meanwhile, suffered back-to-back defeats under Steve Cooper for the first time, having been thrashed 6-0 by champions Manchester City on Wednesday.\nKouyate's first goal for the club and Johnson's penalty - given after a five-minute check by VAR and referee Michael Oliver on the pitchside monitor - gave them the perfect platform, but they crumbled thereafter.\nClub record signing Taiwo Awoniyi, one of 21 players signed by Forest in the summer transfer window, could have salvaged a point in injury time, but he screwed wide from eight yards out.\nCooper said: \"I didn't see the second half coming. I thought we were very good in the first half, and good for the two-goal lead.\n\"The first goal, we didn't defend well enough before the ball went in the net. That has then set the tone for the second half, and we've not managed that very well.\n\"The second goal was from a set-piece. We should do better. Then there was a mistake from Scott [McKenna] for the third goal. That's the first time he's put a foot wrong since I've been here.\n\"But let's not hide away from the fact that we've thrown away a win. We've not done it in a very good way. We've conceded three goals at home, and there's nothing good about that.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Youri Tielemans, deep inside his own half, played a ball over the top of the Brighton defence, Daka held off Lewis Dunk's challenge and slotted the ball past Robert Sanchez for 2-2.\nAlexis Mac Allister thought he had restored the Seagulls' lead with a spectacular strike from 30 yards but, after a video assistant referee check that lasted more than four minutes, the goal was eventually ruled out for offside.\nIs Leicester's fairytale coming to an end?\nIt did not prove to be crucial as Leandro Trossard scored Brighton's third from Pascal Gross' pass, with Trossard then winning a penalty, which Mac Allister converted for the fourth.\nFittingly, the last say went to Argentina midfielder Mac Allister who curled in an excellent 25-yard free-kick in injury time for his second goal and Brighton's fifth.\nThe result maintains Brighton's excellent start to the season and they are fourth in the Premier League, while Leicester, with just one point from six matches, are three points adrift at the foot of the table.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion content\nVisit our Leicester City page\nVAR is involved again\nIt has been a weekend full of controversial VAR decisions, with Newcastle United and West Ham furious after being denied goals against Crystal Palace and Chelsea respectively on Saturday.\nWhile the match at the Amex was taking place, it was announced the Premier League is to review controversial decisions in those matches with referees' body PGMOL as a matter of priority.\nVAR was heavily involved at the Amex, with a lengthy delay to decide whether to allow Mac Allister's superb strike in the second half which, if given, would have been one of the goals of the season.\nBrighton's free-kick had been played into the penalty area with Mwepu trying an acrobatic overhead kick, although he failed to make contact with the ball and Leicester's James Justin partially headed clear before Mac Allister smashed the ball into the top corner.\nBut after the lengthy stoppage, referee Tony Harrington checked a pitchside monitor and judged that Mwepu, who was offside, had interfered with play.\nLuckily for Mac Allister, he still managed to get on the scoresheet twice. The first was a penalty down the middle after superb skill from Trossard had drawn a foul inside the penalty area from Wilfred Ndidi, before a stunning curling free-kick with the last action of the match.\nWorrying times for Leicester\nLeicester, Premier League champions in 2015-16, have finished in the top 10 in all of the past five seasons, narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification in 2019-20 and 2020-21.\nIn May, they played in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League, but Foxes fans will be deeply concerned that they will face a relegation battle this season.\nEarlier this week, manager Brendan Rodgers had expressed his frustration at the club's business during the summer transfer window, which saw them lose both goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and central defender Wesley Fofana.\nRodgers made two changes from the 11 that began the 1-0 loss against Manchester United on Thursday with Daka and Iheanacho replacing Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jamie Vardy.\nThe decision instantly paid off as the visitors went ahead with their first attack. Tielemans dispossessed March, Harvey Barnes played it wide to Daka and his cross was met by Iheanacho for the game's first goal.\nBut Rodgers will be furious at his side's defending throughout the match.\nAn unmarked March headed against the unsuspecting Thomas for Brighton's first goal, before Maddison's error led to the second.\nDaka scored to make it 2-2 and give Leicester hope of picking up their first win of the season. But the visitors were overwhelmed by an excellent Brighton performance in the second half and the three goals the Foxes conceded meant it was their heaviest defeat of the campaign."

Plus England have been in a few penalty shootouts and if they want to win one, they need to pick Ivan.\"\nSinisterra had made it 2-1 just before half-time, but then came Toney's hat-trick goal and a red card for Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who was sent off after urging referee Robert Jones to use the monitor to review a challenge by Aaron Hickey on Crysencio Summerville.\nMarc Roca gave the visitors hope again, but Bryan Mbeumo put Brentford 4-2 up before Yoane Wissa added a late fifth.\nThe win lifted Brentford to seventh in the table, while Leeds slipped to ninth after their second successive Premier League defeat, and are still seeking their first victory on the road this season.\nTalisman Toney too good for Leeds\nToney's landmark goal to open the scoring might not have had too many home fans anticipating a record-breaking afternoon for Brentford.\nLeeds had been a threat during an entertaining first half, but went behind when Toney brought up his half-century for the club in the 30th minute, placing a powerful spot-kick beyond Illan Meslier after Sinisterra was judged to have fouled the striker following a pitchside monitor check by Jones.\nAs with his penalty, Toney scarcely took a run-up on his way to sending the free-kick flying into the left-hand corner of Meslier's net, demonstrating his expert technique and amplifying arguments for his inclusion in the Three Lions' squad for their Nations League fixtures later this month.\nMarsch was baffled by the penalty award and infuriated when Leeds were denied one of their own after an appeal he felt was far stronger. \"I've got to figure out how to have discussions with the league or with referees to help understand how some decisions get made,\" he said.\n\"I was speaking with the fourth official, trying to be as respectful as I possibly could, even when a penalty was given that I probably didn't think was a penalty.\n\"And then you don't see it reciprocated, the respect. That's what I would call it. That lack of VAR visit, in the end to me, is a lack of respect.\"\nSummer signing Sinisterra atoned for his costly foul on Toney with a third goal in three starts for his new club shortly before the break, skipping past Rico Henry after collecting a Ben Mee flick and drilling a composed low finish beyond the advancing David Raya.\nToney punished Leeds to make it three before the hour mark, seizing on a defensive mix-up when Diego Llorente failed to clear with a perfectly weighted chip from outside the penalty area to beat the stranded Meslier and desperately backtracking captain Robin Koch.\nBrentford had not scored five times in a top-flight game since 1938, and Frank's side deserved the club's largest-ever haul in a Premier League match.\nThe head coach called Toney \"a nightmare to play against\".

However, after their excellent start to the season, manager Mikel Arteta will be concerned at how easily his side were opened up, although the Gunners did have a first-half Gabriel Martinelli goal ruled out by VAR.\n\"The game was there for the taking,\" Arteta said. \"We haven't won it because we lacked some discipline in some moments and we weren't ruthless enough in front of goal.\n\"If we play with more courage we win the game. It is a big lesson - if you want to win here you have to do everything so right.\"\nAntony the centre of attention\nHaving failed to prise Antony out of Ajax at the start of the summer and with the attempt to sign Ten Hag's first choice transfer window target Frenkie de Jong stalling, United went back for the Brazilian in the wake of those awful defeats to Brighton and Brentford at the start of the season.\nEvidently, United were not in a strong bargaining position and the eventual price - the fourth highest sum ever paid by a Premier League club - is accepted by most to be significantly inflated.\nYet it is impossible to quantify financially how a positive attitude transfers to supporters.\nIt was clear, with his tricks and flicks and teasing of defenders, the 24-year-old is not short on confidence.\nReferee Paul Tierney, who played an excellent advantage for the Brazilian's goal after Bruno Fernandes had been fouled in the build-up, had to warn him about his celebration in front of the Arsenal fans with the ball up his shirt.\nNot long after that, Antony was upended from behind by Granit Xhaka. Had he connected with his immediate response, trying to slice Xhaka down from behind, the response from Tierney would almost certainly have been more than a ticking off.\nThe United fans loved it all. And while he lasted less than an hour before being replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, Antony was afforded a standing ovation as he left the field.\nHowever Antony's time at Old Trafford works out, it isn't likely to be dull.\nDisappointing result but Arsenal need not despair\nAlthough they failed in their attempt to start the season with six wins in a row for the first time since 1947, it wasn't a completely disastrous day for Arsenal.\nIn the current climate, Martin Odegaard bundling Eriksen over to win possession and start the move that led to Martinelli finding the net was always going to see the goal ruled out.\nHowever, Arteta spent a long time debating with fourth official Simon Hooper about Lisandro Martinez's penalty box lunge on Saka, where he did touch the man and not the ball.\nArsenal should have equalised when Gabriel Jesus got the better of Martinez and set up Odegaard but neither the Norwegian, nor Saka as Arsenal continued to press could find the target when well placed to do much better.\nDavid de Gea acrobatically denied Martinelli as well, so Arsenal did have the opportunities to make more of their dominance of possession.\nOdegaard and Xhaka were excellent in midfield and it is clear they have a more consistent goal threat with Jesus in their side.\nHowever, immediately after this month's international break, the Gunners have a five-match sequence that includes home games against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City. After these, far more will be known about this Arsenal side.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

I'm amazed that VAR sent the referee to see it.\n\"It was a ridiculously bad decision. I'd question VAR as much as the referee, but the referee should have stuck to his own guns - there is no excuse for that not to be a goal, none whatsoever. The sad thing is this is the level of the weak refereeing at the moment.\n\"I think the worst thing is we're sitting and watching it. We've been told there would be more contact. But that sounds as if there's no contact with any goalies, and we didn't get told that.\"\nMoyes, who also accused Mendy of trying to \"fake an injury\" when West Ham scored the opening goal, said he was \"embarrassed\" for VAR official Jarred Gillett.\n\"Jarrod [Bowen] said he never touched the goalkeeper at all,\" he added. \"And if you look at it, he jumps him. There might have been a trailing foot if there was anything at all.\n\"I make loads of mistakes, referees can make loads of mistakes, but I would hope if the referee made a mistake that's why it's corrected by VAR.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

A Daka own goal was ruled out for a foul by Sanchez on Ward, who also tipped a header from the Spurs defender onto the bar later in the first half.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We go into the international break with confidence then we prepare for the next one.\n\"A lot of fights ahead of us.

A few games now we have taken the lead and not managed it well enough,\" said Forest boss Cooper.\n\"We are not handling conceding the first goal. It has cost us the last two games. You cannot do that at any level, particularly this one. It is something we need to improve on.\n\"There are times when I see good things and we look like a progressive team.

One for us to reflect on.\n\"I am desperate to win, it feels like a long time for us. We need to win and compete and be the best versions of us.\"\nA period of change may be forthcoming at Bournemouth too, with a Las Vegas consortium hoping to buy the club.\nIt has left uncertainty about the manager's role with O'Neil now in charge since Scott Parker was sacked on 30 August, but it has hard to argue with the results that the former Portsmouth and Middlesbrough midfielder has produced.\nBournemouth looked organised and were prepared to put their bodies on the line, while on another day they could have taken three points as Marcus Tavernier headed wide in the first period before driving wide in the second.\nWhether O'Neil will be in charge when Bournemouth host Brentford on 1 October - the next round of Premier League fixtures after the international break - remains to be seen.\n\"I will be finding out what's happening club-wise next week and will see what the plan is,\" O'Neil told BBC Sport.\n\"I have no idea what's happening - I knew I was taking today and I don't know about further, I guess I'll find out tomorrow.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Youri Tielemans, deep inside his own half, played a ball over the top of the Brighton defence, Daka held off Lewis Dunk's challenge and slotted the ball past Robert Sanchez for 2-2.\nAlexis Mac Allister thought he had restored the Seagulls' lead with a spectacular strike from 30 yards but, after a video assistant referee check that lasted more than four minutes, the goal was eventually ruled out for offside.\nIs Leicester's fairytale coming to an end?\nIt did not prove to be crucial as Leandro Trossard scored Brighton's third from Pascal Gross' pass, with Trossard then winning a penalty, which Mac Allister converted for the fourth.\nFittingly, the last say went to Argentina midfielder Mac Allister who curled in an excellent 25-yard free-kick in injury time for his second goal and Brighton's fifth.\nThe result maintains Brighton's excellent start to the season and they are fourth in the Premier League, while Leicester, with just one point from six matches, are three points adrift at the foot of the table.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion content\nVisit our Leicester City page\nVAR is involved again\nIt has been a weekend full of controversial VAR decisions, with Newcastle United and West Ham furious after being denied goals against Crystal Palace and Chelsea respectively on Saturday.\nWhile the match at the Amex was taking place, it was announced the Premier League is to review controversial decisions in those matches with referees' body PGMOL as a matter of priority.\nVAR was heavily involved at the Amex, with a lengthy delay to decide whether to allow Mac Allister's superb strike in the second half which, if given, would have been one of the goals of the season.\nBrighton's free-kick had been played into the penalty area with Mwepu trying an acrobatic overhead kick, although he failed to make contact with the ball and Leicester's James Justin partially headed clear before Mac Allister smashed the ball into the top corner.\nBut after the lengthy stoppage, referee Tony Harrington checked a pitchside monitor and judged that Mwepu, who was offside, had interfered with play.\nLuckily for Mac Allister, he still managed to get on the scoresheet twice. The first was a penalty down the middle after superb skill from Trossard had drawn a foul inside the penalty area from Wilfred Ndidi, before a stunning curling free-kick with the last action of the match.\nWorrying times for Leicester\nLeicester, Premier League champions in 2015-16, have finished in the top 10 in all of the past five seasons, narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification in 2019-20 and 2020-21.\nIn May, they played in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League, but Foxes fans will be deeply concerned that they will face a relegation battle this season.\nEarlier this week, manager Brendan Rodgers had expressed his frustration at the club's business during the summer transfer window, which saw them lose both goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and central defender Wesley Fofana.\nRodgers made two changes from the 11 that began the 1-0 loss against Manchester United on Thursday with Daka and Iheanacho replacing Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jamie Vardy.\nThe decision instantly paid off as the visitors went ahead with their first attack. Tielemans dispossessed March, Harvey Barnes played it wide to Daka and his cross was met by Iheanacho for the game's first goal.\nBut Rodgers will be furious at his side's defending throughout the match.\nAn unmarked March headed against the unsuspecting Thomas for Brighton's first goal, before Maddison's error led to the second.\nDaka scored to make it 2-2 and give Leicester hope of picking up their first win of the season. But the visitors were overwhelmed by an excellent Brighton performance in the second half and the three goals the Foxes conceded meant it was their heaviest defeat of the campaign."

We played better than we did last time. In football, you have to grind and fight and be committed and we worked hard today.\n\"We will get better in terms of style and possession and that will come but tonight was about the points.\"\nGerrard's side have made an indifferent start to the campaign but they were able to build on the battling draw against Manchester City with a deserved victory.\nHe added: \"We had to back up our performance against Manchester City and there were a lot of eyes on us from the TV but we did it.\n\"Maybe we tried to force it a bit tonight but as we move up the table, maybe that's when the pretty stuff will come. It has been a tough period but I've wanted to step forward and protect my players.\n\"I've tried to fight and move up this table.

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 0-0 Crystal Palace: Hosts denied as goal ruled out by VAR\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said he was \"very surprised\" by the video assistant referee's decision to rule out a goal in a stalemate with Crystal Palace.\nThe hosts were initially awarded a goal by referee Michael Salisbury when Tyrick Mitchell knocked the ball into his own net.\nBut after a VAR review, it was ruled that Joe Willock had fouled Vicente Guaita moments beforehand, although replays showed how Mitchell appeared to push the Newcastle man into the Palace goalkeeper.\nNewcastle had already been left frustrated after record signing Alexander Isak fluffed an attempt to dink the ball over Guaita when clean through, while Miguel Almiron also hit the post with a deflected shot.\nPalace - who, like Newcastle, have only won once this season - did not severely test home goalkeeper Nick Pope until a late improvement, when Odsonne Edouard's close-range shot forced him to save.\nBut, after Willock shinned wide from two yards late on, the point will be welcome for Patrick Vieira's side, who earned their third draw of the season.\nNewcastle are now winless in five games for the first time under Howe, but he said he disagreed with the decision to disallow the own goal.\nFormer Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said it was \"pathetic\" to rule it out.\nHowe added: \"I thought it was a push on Joe Willock in the build-up to the ball coming in. Without that push, there's no way Joe would have gone in with that force. So for me, it's not a foul, if anything, it's a penalty if it's not a goal.\"\nIsak fluffs chance as Newcastle wasteful\nNewcastle and their noisy supporters will have felt aggrieved by the result, especially as some of the crowd were able to watch a replay of the game's biggest talking point on the big screen.\nFrom one angle, it appeared as if Willock took Guaita out, but another view showed how Mitchell was the architect of the collision that left the Newcastle player needing treatment.\nNonetheless referee Salisbury overturning his initial decision led to a smattering of boos at full-time.\nIt was a disappointing return to St James' Park for Newcastle after pushing Liverpool so close in Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield and also sharing a 3-3 draw with Manchester City on their last home outing.\nThey paid for wasteful finishing, with record \u00a360m signing Isak failing to back up his thrilling debut in midweek, where he scored against Liverpool.\nHaving begun brightly at both ends of the pitch, the Swede could have made himself an instant hero in front of the Gallowgate End, as he dispossessed Joachim Andersen on the halfway line but chose to chip Guaita and got it all wrong.\nThe 22-year-old also had a good chance in the second half but his shot was tame, and it summed up a poor game in front of goal for Howe's side, who are missing Callum Wilson, Allan Saint-Maximin and Bruno Guimaraes through injury.\nHowe said of the Swedish international: \"He will be disappointed to miss that because I think he would back himself to score and I'd certainly back him to score but he's gone for a certain type of finish but he didn't quite execute it right.\n\"I thought we starved him of with the ball a little bit and I desperately wanted him to try and get on the ball more, especially in the attacking third.\n\"It's just that he's had no training time with us. So he's been thrust right into action and I think he's done very well but there's a lot of improvement for us as a team to try and serve him.\"\nIn fairness to Isak, there were more chances that fell to Willock and Almiron, but despite spending \u00a3117m in the transfer window, it shows an area of the pitch where Newcastle are perhaps still lacking depth.\nPalace frustrating but snatch point\nPalace have shown a threat this season by going ahead away from home against both Liverpool and Manchester City - although they ended up with a point at Anfield and a 4-2 defeat at Etihad Stadium.\nBut at St James' Park, they could not match Newcastle's energy, and although they carved out several decent first-half chances, none of them really tested Pope.\nWilfried Zaha, who has scored 13 goal in 20 Premier League appearances this calendar year, was frustrated in his attempts to beat Kieran Trippier or Pope. Eberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta also wasted good opportunities.\nThe fact the game was goalless going into the second half was down to Newcastle's wastefulness and some fine Palace defending. Guaita stopped efforts from Sean Longstaff and Sven Botman, while the Dutch defender was also denied by an amazing block by Marc Guehi.\nAfter the hosts started the second half on top once more, Patrick Vieira made a triple substitution to try to revive Palace, and it almost paid off immediately.\nEdouard finally made Pope stretch to make a fine save after twisting and turning in the box.\nAs the game opened up, there were further chances but Palace failed to find the final pass and somehow managed to hang on at the other end.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I'm amazed that VAR sent the referee to see it.\n\"It was a ridiculously bad decision. I'd question VAR as much as the referee, but the referee should have stuck to his own guns - there is no excuse for that not to be a goal, none whatsoever. The sad thing is this is the level of the weak refereeing at the moment.\n\"I think the worst thing is we're sitting and watching it. We've been told there would be more contact. But that sounds as if there's no contact with any goalies, and we didn't get told that.\"\nMoyes, who also accused Mendy of trying to \"fake an injury\" when West Ham scored the opening goal, said he was \"embarrassed\" for VAR official Jarred Gillett.\n\"Jarrod [Bowen] said he never touched the goalkeeper at all,\" he added. \"And if you look at it, he jumps him. There might have been a trailing foot if there was anything at all.\n\"I make loads of mistakes, referees can make loads of mistakes, but I would hope if the referee made a mistake that's why it's corrected by VAR.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

However, after their excellent start to the season, manager Mikel Arteta will be concerned at how easily his side were opened up, although the Gunners did have a first-half Gabriel Martinelli goal ruled out by VAR.\n\"The game was there for the taking,\" Arteta said. \"We haven't won it because we lacked some discipline in some moments and we weren't ruthless enough in front of goal.\n\"If we play with more courage we win the game. It is a big lesson - if you want to win here you have to do everything so right.\"\nAntony the centre of attention\nHaving failed to prise Antony out of Ajax at the start of the summer and with the attempt to sign Ten Hag's first choice transfer window target Frenkie de Jong stalling, United went back for the Brazilian in the wake of those awful defeats to Brighton and Brentford at the start of the season.\nEvidently, United were not in a strong bargaining position and the eventual price - the fourth highest sum ever paid by a Premier League club - is accepted by most to be significantly inflated.\nYet it is impossible to quantify financially how a positive attitude transfers to supporters.\nIt was clear, with his tricks and flicks and teasing of defenders, the 24-year-old is not short on confidence.\nReferee Paul Tierney, who played an excellent advantage for the Brazilian's goal after Bruno Fernandes had been fouled in the build-up, had to warn him about his celebration in front of the Arsenal fans with the ball up his shirt.\nNot long after that, Antony was upended from behind by Granit Xhaka. Had he connected with his immediate response, trying to slice Xhaka down from behind, the response from Tierney would almost certainly have been more than a ticking off.\nThe United fans loved it all. And while he lasted less than an hour before being replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, Antony was afforded a standing ovation as he left the field.\nHowever Antony's time at Old Trafford works out, it isn't likely to be dull.\nDisappointing result but Arsenal need not despair\nAlthough they failed in their attempt to start the season with six wins in a row for the first time since 1947, it wasn't a completely disastrous day for Arsenal.\nIn the current climate, Martin Odegaard bundling Eriksen over to win possession and start the move that led to Martinelli finding the net was always going to see the goal ruled out.\nHowever, Arteta spent a long time debating with fourth official Simon Hooper about Lisandro Martinez's penalty box lunge on Saka, where he did touch the man and not the ball.\nArsenal should have equalised when Gabriel Jesus got the better of Martinez and set up Odegaard but neither the Norwegian, nor Saka as Arsenal continued to press could find the target when well placed to do much better.\nDavid de Gea acrobatically denied Martinelli as well, so Arsenal did have the opportunities to make more of their dominance of possession.\nOdegaard and Xhaka were excellent in midfield and it is clear they have a more consistent goal threat with Jesus in their side.\nHowever, immediately after this month's international break, the Gunners have a five-match sequence that includes home games against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City. After these, far more will be known about this Arsenal side.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Plus England have been in a few penalty shootouts and if they want to win one, they need to pick Ivan.\"\nSinisterra had made it 2-1 just before half-time, but then came Toney's hat-trick goal and a red card for Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who was sent off after urging referee Robert Jones to use the monitor to review a challenge by Aaron Hickey on Crysencio Summerville.\nMarc Roca gave the visitors hope again, but Bryan Mbeumo put Brentford 4-2 up before Yoane Wissa added a late fifth.\nThe win lifted Brentford to seventh in the table, while Leeds slipped to ninth after their second successive Premier League defeat, and are still seeking their first victory on the road this season.\nTalisman Toney too good for Leeds\nToney's landmark goal to open the scoring might not have had too many home fans anticipating a record-breaking afternoon for Brentford.\nLeeds had been a threat during an entertaining first half, but went behind when Toney brought up his half-century for the club in the 30th minute, placing a powerful spot-kick beyond Illan Meslier after Sinisterra was judged to have fouled the striker following a pitchside monitor check by Jones.\nAs with his penalty, Toney scarcely took a run-up on his way to sending the free-kick flying into the left-hand corner of Meslier's net, demonstrating his expert technique and amplifying arguments for his inclusion in the Three Lions' squad for their Nations League fixtures later this month.\nMarsch was baffled by the penalty award and infuriated when Leeds were denied one of their own after an appeal he felt was far stronger. \"I've got to figure out how to have discussions with the league or with referees to help understand how some decisions get made,\" he said.\n\"I was speaking with the fourth official, trying to be as respectful as I possibly could, even when a penalty was given that I probably didn't think was a penalty.\n\"And then you don't see it reciprocated, the respect. That's what I would call it. That lack of VAR visit, in the end to me, is a lack of respect.\"\nSummer signing Sinisterra atoned for his costly foul on Toney with a third goal in three starts for his new club shortly before the break, skipping past Rico Henry after collecting a Ben Mee flick and drilling a composed low finish beyond the advancing David Raya.\nToney punished Leeds to make it three before the hour mark, seizing on a defensive mix-up when Diego Llorente failed to clear with a perfectly weighted chip from outside the penalty area to beat the stranded Meslier and desperately backtracking captain Robin Koch.\nBrentford had not scored five times in a top-flight game since 1938, and Frank's side deserved the club's largest-ever haul in a Premier League match.\nThe head coach called Toney \"a nightmare to play against\". The man leading their line is brimming with confidence - and Kane is the only Englishman to have matched his five league goals so far this season.\nVisit our Brentford page\nGo straight to all the best Leeds United content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We played better than we did last time. In football, you have to grind and fight and be committed and we worked hard today.\n\"We will get better in terms of style and possession and that will come but tonight was about the points.\"\nGerrard's side have made an indifferent start to the campaign but they were able to build on the battling draw against Manchester City with a deserved victory.\nHe added: \"We had to back up our performance against Manchester City and there were a lot of eyes on us from the TV but we did it.\n\"Maybe we tried to force it a bit tonight but as we move up the table, maybe that's when the pretty stuff will come. It has been a tough period but I've wanted to step forward and protect my players.\n\"I've tried to fight and move up this table. We have accepted a lot of criticism and it's about reacting and that is what we have done tonight.\"\nVilla made nearly all the running in a game desperately short on quality and Ramsey broke the deadlock four minutes before the break after Southampton keeper Gavin Bazunu turned Ollie Watkins' header on to the bar.\nSouthampton were far too timid and barely offered a threat all night, allowing Villa to close out an important triumph, their first since the second league game of the season against Everton, in comfort.\nFollow live text updates of Aston Villa v Southampton\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nVisit our Southampton page\nVilla grind out vital win\nAston Villa managerGerrard turned to his backroom staff with fists clenched at the final whistle. It was a signal of just how much he and his team needed this win.\nIt was, to be brutally honest, a dreadful game lacking in quality, but Gerrard will not care as Villa will take wins any way they can get them at the moment after a poor start to the season led to discontent among their supporters and scrutiny of the manager.\nVilla started to rebuild when they took a point off Premier League champions Manchester City in their last home game, making further progress here with a win essential.\nThe winning goal from Ramsey was scrappy, totally befitting such a poor game, and was more than enough to see off Southampton, who hardly gave Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez an anxious moment all night, with Tyrone Mings dealing easily with any rare aerial threat.\nIt was not pleasing on the eye but Villa fully merited the win which will put Gerrard, his players and the club in a much more optimistic frame of mind heading into the international break.\nTame Saints get what they deserve\nSouthampton's timid approach should mean they reflect on this defeat at Aston Villa as an opportunity missed.\nVilla's confidence would have still been fragile after their recent struggles, despite that good result against Manchester City, and an early goal - or even some early concerted pressure - could have played on nerves in the home crowd.\nInstead, Ralph Hasenhuttl's side allowed Villa to set the tempo as their captain John McGinn crunched into some early challenges and Philippe Coutinho offered up occasional moments of class while Saints struggled for any rhythm.\nChe Adams and Adam Armstrong hardly got a look in as Southampton barely created even half chances, the visitors' lack of attacking ambition and intent costing them dearly as the game was won by that one moment near the end of the first half.\nHasenhuttl's Southampton sides pride themselves on energy and intensity but there was precious little on show here on a night they will want to quickly forget.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

A Daka own goal was ruled out for a foul by Sanchez on Ward, who also tipped a header from the Spurs defender onto the bar later in the first half.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

As well some games in the beginning of the season we should have got more points because we deserved it,\" said Silva.\n\"But it is just seven games. It is the start of the season. We go into the international break with confidence then we prepare for the next one.\n\"A lot of fights ahead of us. We are happy with how we started but we have to keep going.\"\nForest had led early on when Taiwo Awoniyi headed in a corner but were stunned by a remarkable Fulham comeback in the second half.\nTosin Adarabioyo headed in the equaliser after 54 minutes, before Joao Palhinha's stunning strike made it 2-1.\nBefore Forest could catch their breath, Harrison Reed stroked in a third.\nFulham appeared to take control of the match as the second half wore on but a wonderful flick from Forest substitute Jesse Lingard set Brennan Johnson free and he teed up Lewis O'Brien.\nMomentum switched back to Steve Cooper's side but time ran out to score another as Fulham clung on for a victory which saw them move up to sixth place in the table.\n\"It was a fantastic feeling for us even if we suffered a little in the last few minutes and they had belief they could score again,\" added Silva.\n\"I have to congratulate the players because it is really tough to do something they have done. It's the way we work and prepare for the game to learn every single day.\n\"We are a group and a unit working hard to achieve. We believe in ourselves and always trust in ourselves.\"\nMeanwhile, it was the second Premier League match in a row Forest have thrown away a lead after their 2-0 advantage over Bournemouth ended in a 3-2 victory for the Cherries two weeks ago.\nFulham, who finished 10 points ahead of Forest in the Championship last season, had chances in both halves but were also heavily tested by the hosts.\nAwoniyi and Morgan Gibbs-White both came close for Forest, while goalkeeper Dean Henderson was forced into saves to deny Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic, Kenny Tete and Andreas Pereira.\nIn the end, a ruthless six minutes from Fulham did the damage as Forest were again humbled by the harsh realities of life back in the top flight.\nBoth teams had observed a minute's silence prior to kick-off, before supporters sang the national anthem and applauded on the 70th minute in tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II.\nReaction to Friday's Premier League\nForest concede more as Fulham continue progress\nThis was a match-up between two teams who spent last season battling in the Championship and it had the same physical edge to a game you would expect to see in the second tier of English football.\nBoth teams were full of energy and aggression which made for an intriguing spectacle at the City Ground.\nTackles flew in at both ends of the pitch - Steve Cook was perhaps fortunate to receive just a yellow card for a foul on Fulham's Willian when he was through on goal, while Issa Diop clattered into Forest's Johnson to concede a wasted free-kick on the edge of the box later in the first half.\nBut as the game developed the battles became less equal and momentum swung in favour of either team in large spells.\nFulham appeared to be in control when leading 3-1 before Lingard's superb flick helped set-up O'Brien's goal, making for a nervous ending in Nottingham.\nForest pushed and pushed for an equaliser - while Fulham still had chances of their own - before eventually the visitors could settle things down again and see out the win.\nCooper's side have already shown plenty of threat during their short time in the Premier League but they have now conceded 14 goals in their last four defeats, which will need to be addressed.\n\"It has happened again. A few games now we have taken the lead and not managed it well enough,\" said Forest boss Cooper.\n\"We are not handling conceding the first goal. It has cost us the last two games. You cannot do that at any level, particularly this one. It is something we need to improve on.\n\"There are times when I see good things and we look like a progressive team. That five minutes when we conceded three times we looked like a new team.\n\"It is something we need to address quickly.\""

His work sort of epitomises our play, so it was great to see,\" said Howe.\n\"He's capable of doing magical things, and for me [his first goal] was a magical goal.\"\nFulham's day started poorly when Nathaniel Chalobah was shown a straight red card for a high challenge on Sean Longstaff in the eighth minute.\n'Unbelievable', 'strange' and 'frustrating' - is VAR letting Premier League down?\nThree minutes later Callum Wilson, returning from injury, tapped in Joe Willock's header, before Almiron effectively killed off the game in the 33rd minute with his looping volley.\nLongstaff added a third for the visitors just before the break, striking home a rebound after Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno tipped Sven Botman's header on to the post.\nAnd in the second half Almiron turned in his second, pouncing on a Willock pass across goal, before the hosts scored a late consolation, with Bobby Decordova-Reid heading home Neeskens Kebano's cross.\nNewcastle dominate with electric attack\nWith striker Alexander Isak picking up a knock on international duty with Sweden, Almiron's slick display and Wilson's return to action after four games out with a hamstring injury could not have been more timely.\n\"It's been a very difficult two weeks,\" Howe added to BBC Sport. \"But it didn't show in our performance.\n\"Right from the start we had a good feeling, with good energy, and created chances early on.\n\"Obviously the red card made it easier, but I am very pleased with the players' response.\"\nAlmiron's first-half strike was special. The Paraguayan found the net with a first-time volley, latching on to a looping pass from Bruno Guimaraes.\nAnd the 28-year-old thought he had scored a first Premier League hat-trick midway through the second half, chipping in a third only to see his effort ruled out by the offside flag.\nAs for Wilson, the 30-year-old's opener means he has now scored four goals in four top-flight matches against the Cottagers.\nThe former Bournemouth star had hit the post in the opening exchanges and went close to scoring a second in the 28th minute with a curling effort.\nMidfielder Joe Willock was also lively for Howe's side, picking up two assists and forcing fine diving saves from Leno either side of half-time.\n\"We wanted more - we weren't happy with what we had, always trying to score,\" added Howe.\nInjuries hamper sorry Fulham\nReferee Darren England initially showed Chalobah a yellow card for his challenge on Longstaff but upgraded his decision to a red after VAR intervention.\nOnce Fulham went behind, there only seemed to be one winner.\nThings went from bad to worse for Marco Silva's side when star striker and former Magpie Aleksandar Mitrovic limped off in the 37th minute.\nHe was soon joined on the bench by debutant Layvin Kurzawa who also picked up a first-half knock.\nDecordova-Reid's goal came from Fulham's only shot on target as the hosts struggled to get the ball upfield.\nDefeat saw the hosts drop to eighth in the table.\nThe Cottagers visit West Ham away from home next Sunday, with Newcastle hosting Brentford on Saturday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They slipped off and he hung his head as the Leicester man ran away to celebrate.\nCooper knew Awoniyi should have given Forest the lead and also that Lingard, signed amid much fanfare after the ex-Manchester United man was courted by so many clubs, needs to have a different kind of impact than the one that set Maddison up for the opener, which deceived Dean Henderson as it struck McKenna and flew into the corner.\nBut his side are so obviously a work in progress. With so many new faces, the combinations required to be effective are absent. Cooper is trying to find answers in an unforgiving environment.\nAdd in the touch of quality that allowed Barnes and Maddison to give Henderson no chance of keeping out shots that found the corner of his goal and it is easy to understand how, of these two sides, Leicester are the ones who have the ingredients to get out of trouble.\nDaka's well-taken fourth meant Cooper was experiencing his biggest loss as Forest manager since his first, another four-goal defeat by Fulham. Only Leicester have conceded more than Forest's 21 goals so far this season.\nCooper largely found positive answers to the questions posed of him after that Fulham loss. Even if Marinakis stands by him, the problems facing the Welshman now appear far bigger.\nSign up for Forest news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out more\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Edouard pounced on a loose Wesley Fofana pass and found Ayew on the right. The Ghanaian's dipping cross found Edouard, who stretched to poke the ball past Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nWith their tails up, the home side - who lost Nathaniel Clyne to a serious-looking injury before half-time - immediately pressed for a second as Kepa turned Eberechi Eze's shot from distance around the post with the Palace attacker firing narrowly wide from the resultant corner.\nWilfried Zaha forced a sharp save from Kepa in the second half but Palace were unable to put the Chelsea defence under enough pressure, before Gallagher popped up to rub salt in the home side's wounds and get Potter off the mark as Blues boss.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We are not in good form so something needs to change. The people [fans] don't deserve to see what we are doing at the moment.\n\"It is not the manager's responsibility it is everyone. We are the ones that can get the results. It is about us, not anybody else. We struggled a bit in the beginning with a lot of new players, a lot of players going out, but no more excuses.\"\nIn contrast, West Ham forwards Gianluca Scamacca and Jarrod Bowen were the inspiration behind their comfortable victory.\nItaly international Scamacca, making only his second start in the English top flight following his \u00a330.5m arrival from Sassuolo, opened the scoring with a superb half-volley into the top-right corner.\nIt delivered the Hammers' first goal prior to half-time this term and laid the platform for a valuable win that lifted David Moyes' side up from 18th to 15th in the table.\nThe hosts had started the day as the joint-lowest scorers in the division along with Wolves, but always looked the more threatening and deservedly added to their lead when Bowen drove a low effort past Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.\nCosta had the visitor's best opportunity but he headed just wide from a teasing Adama Traore cross.\nHowever, encouragingly for Lage, the former Spain international appeared relatively sharp given his long period of inaction and looked to have supplied an assist for Daniel Podence's tap-in before being adjudged to have run marginally offside.\nFollow all Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nVisit our Wolves page\nHammers hit form as Wolves' woes continue\nWhile West Ham have won four times in European competition this season, that form has not been reproduced domestically.\nHowever, a fixture against a Wolves side who have now failed to win in their last eight matches on their travels served up a perfect opportunity for Moyes and his side to remedy some early-season problems.\nCraig Dawson's return in defence, alongside Kurt Zouma and the impressive Thilo Kehrer, provided some added steel to deliver a first clean sheet at home since beating Wolves 1-0 in February.\nFurther up the pitch, Bowen was the perfect foil to Scamacca's power and capped a fine performance, full of elusive running, with a clinical finish as he opened his account in the league this season.\nWith their Portuguese contingent, Wolves became the first Premier League side to start a match with eight players from the same non-English nationality.\nYet despite creating several promising openings Lage's side only found the target four times from their 15 efforts on goal and none seriously threatened to beat home goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\n'No decision has been made on Lage's future' - analysis\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone: After one win in 15 Premier League games going back to last season, travelling fans in mutinous mood and their club in the relegation zone - and potentially dropping to second bottom on Monday evening - minds are being focused within the Wolves hierarchy about the future of manager Lage.\nChairman Jeff Shi will be responsible for implementing any decision to sack Lage, with the Portuguese's fate to be decided by Shi and Fosun executives in China.\nSources are stressing no decision has been made yet. But Wolves must decide whether to back Lage to drag the club away from trouble or cut their losses on the 46-year-old former Benfica coach, who replaced Nuno Espirito Santo at the start of last season.\nAlthough it took them some time to bring in the number of players Lage wanted this summer, Wolves have spent heavily, more than \u00a3100m, to bring in five senior players.\nBut they had to move for the out-of-contract Costa after injuries to Jimenez and Kalajdzic, who ruptured his cruciate knee ligaments on his debut, left him without a senior striker.\nHowever, despite this - and the knowledge they will have to take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge next Saturday without defender Nathan Collins and skipper Neves due to suspension - the feeling is Lage should be getting far more out of his group.\nWolves have scored only three times this season, two less than Nottingham Forest and West Ham, the Premier League's next lowest scorers, and while their approach play is often eye-catching, the impact turns out to be harmless.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The effort was there, but the effort alone is not enough - you need to have the quality to score in the right moments,\" Hasenhuttl said to BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Premier League football is brutal when you don't score and you concede.

We are not in good form so something needs to change. The people [fans] don't deserve to see what we are doing at the moment.\n\"It is not the manager's responsibility it is everyone. We are the ones that can get the results. It is about us, not anybody else. We struggled a bit in the beginning with a lot of new players, a lot of players going out, but no more excuses.\"\nIn contrast, West Ham forwards Gianluca Scamacca and Jarrod Bowen were the inspiration behind their comfortable victory.\nItaly international Scamacca, making only his second start in the English top flight following his \u00a330.5m arrival from Sassuolo, opened the scoring with a superb half-volley into the top-right corner.\nIt delivered the Hammers' first goal prior to half-time this term and laid the platform for a valuable win that lifted David Moyes' side up from 18th to 15th in the table.\nThe hosts had started the day as the joint-lowest scorers in the division along with Wolves, but always looked the more threatening and deservedly added to their lead when Bowen drove a low effort past Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.\nCosta had the visitor's best opportunity but he headed just wide from a teasing Adama Traore cross.\nHowever, encouragingly for Lage, the former Spain international appeared relatively sharp given his long period of inaction and looked to have supplied an assist for Daniel Podence's tap-in before being adjudged to have run marginally offside.\nFollow all Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nVisit our Wolves page\nHammers hit form as Wolves' woes continue\nWhile West Ham have won four times in European competition this season, that form has not been reproduced domestically.\nHowever, a fixture against a Wolves side who have now failed to win in their last eight matches on their travels served up a perfect opportunity for Moyes and his side to remedy some early-season problems.\nCraig Dawson's return in defence, alongside Kurt Zouma and the impressive Thilo Kehrer, provided some added steel to deliver a first clean sheet at home since beating Wolves 1-0 in February.\nFurther up the pitch, Bowen was the perfect foil to Scamacca's power and capped a fine performance, full of elusive running, with a clinical finish as he opened his account in the league this season.\nWith their Portuguese contingent, Wolves became the first Premier League side to start a match with eight players from the same non-English nationality.\nYet despite creating several promising openings Lage's side only found the target four times from their 15 efforts on goal and none seriously threatened to beat home goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\n'No decision has been made on Lage's future' - analysis\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone: After one win in 15 Premier League games going back to last season, travelling fans in mutinous mood and their club in the relegation zone - and potentially dropping to second bottom on Monday evening - minds are being focused within the Wolves hierarchy about the future of manager Lage.\nChairman Jeff Shi will be responsible for implementing any decision to sack Lage, with the Portuguese's fate to be decided by Shi and Fosun executives in China.\nSources are stressing no decision has been made yet. But Wolves must decide whether to back Lage to drag the club away from trouble or cut their losses on the 46-year-old former Benfica coach, who replaced Nuno Espirito Santo at the start of last season.\nAlthough it took them some time to bring in the number of players Lage wanted this summer, Wolves have spent heavily, more than \u00a3100m, to bring in five senior players.\nBut they had to move for the out-of-contract Costa after injuries to Jimenez and Kalajdzic, who ruptured his cruciate knee ligaments on his debut, left him without a senior striker.\nHowever, despite this - and the knowledge they will have to take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge next Saturday without defender Nathan Collins and skipper Neves due to suspension - the feeling is Lage should be getting far more out of his group.\nWolves have scored only three times this season, two less than Nottingham Forest and West Ham, the Premier League's next lowest scorers, and while their approach play is often eye-catching, the impact turns out to be harmless.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The Paraguayan found the net with a first-time volley, latching on to a looping pass from Bruno Guimaraes.\nAnd the 28-year-old thought he had scored a first Premier League hat-trick midway through the second half, chipping in a third only to see his effort ruled out by the offside flag.\nAs for Wilson, the 30-year-old's opener means he has now scored four goals in four top-flight matches against the Cottagers.\nThe former Bournemouth star had hit the post in the opening exchanges and went close to scoring a second in the 28th minute with a curling effort.\nMidfielder Joe Willock was also lively for Howe's side, picking up two assists and forcing fine diving saves from Leno either side of half-time.\n\"We wanted more - we weren't happy with what we had, always trying to score,\" added Howe.\nInjuries hamper sorry Fulham\nReferee Darren England initially showed Chalobah a yellow card for his challenge on Longstaff but upgraded his decision to a red after VAR intervention.\nOnce Fulham went behind, there only seemed to be one winner.\nThings went from bad to worse for Marco Silva's side when star striker and former Magpie Aleksandar Mitrovic limped off in the 37th minute.\nHe was soon joined on the bench by debutant Layvin Kurzawa who also picked up a first-half knock.\nDecordova-Reid's goal came from Fulham's only shot on target as the hosts struggled to get the ball upfield.\nDefeat saw the hosts drop to eighth in the table.\nThe Cottagers visit West Ham away from home next Sunday, with Newcastle hosting Brentford on Saturday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Edouard pounced on a loose Wesley Fofana pass and found Ayew on the right. The Ghanaian's dipping cross found Edouard, who stretched to poke the ball past Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nWith their tails up, the home side - who lost Nathaniel Clyne to a serious-looking injury before half-time - immediately pressed for a second as Kepa turned Eberechi Eze's shot from distance around the post with the Palace attacker firing narrowly wide from the resultant corner.\nWilfried Zaha forced a sharp save from Kepa in the second half but Palace were unable to put the Chelsea defence under enough pressure, before Gallagher popped up to rub salt in the home side's wounds and get Potter off the mark as Blues boss.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The effort was there, but the effort alone is not enough - you need to have the quality to score in the right moments,\" Hasenhuttl said to BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Premier League football is brutal when you don't score and you concede.

They slipped off and he hung his head as the Leicester man ran away to celebrate.\nCooper knew Awoniyi should have given Forest the lead and also that Lingard, signed amid much fanfare after the ex-Manchester United man was courted by so many clubs, needs to have a different kind of impact than the one that set Maddison up for the opener, which deceived Dean Henderson as it struck McKenna and flew into the corner.\nBut his side are so obviously a work in progress. With so many new faces, the combinations required to be effective are absent. Cooper is trying to find answers in an unforgiving environment.\nAdd in the touch of quality that allowed Barnes and Maddison to give Henderson no chance of keeping out shots that found the corner of his goal and it is easy to understand how, of these two sides, Leicester are the ones who have the ingredients to get out of trouble.\nDaka's well-taken fourth meant Cooper was experiencing his biggest loss as Forest manager since his first, another four-goal defeat by Fulham. Only Leicester have conceded more than Forest's 21 goals so far this season.\nCooper largely found positive answers to the questions posed of him after that Fulham loss. Even if Marinakis stands by him, the problems facing the Welshman now appear far bigger.\nSign up for Forest news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out more\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Seconds later, Coutinho hit the post with a volley in a rare moment of skill in a frantic encounter high on passion and commitment.\nGerrard frustrated as Villa fail to get a winner\nVilla manager Steven Gerrard was left frustrated at the result as his side aimed to win back-to-back matches for the first time this season after a 1-0 win over Southampton last time out.\nThe ex-England midfielder showed his annoyance at his side's failure to break the hosts down late on when he booted a water bottle along the touchline after Ollie Watkins had been denied by Illan Meslier.\nThis was the 20th game Leeds had played since Jesse Marsch replaced the sacked Marcelo Bielsa in February, although the American had to watch from the stands as he served a one-game ban for being sent off in the 5-2 loss at Brentford.\nHe spent the match watching from the press seats at the back of the stand and saw a feisty encounter that ended with six different players receiving at least a caution.\nMeslier was the busier of the two goalkeepers, saving first-half efforts from Watkins and Coutinho, while Villa skipper John McGinn had a goalbound effort deflected wide.\nFollowing Sinisterra's dismissal, the visitors had the majority of the ball but could not beat Meslier, while Bamford, on as a substitute, was denied at the other end with both sides ultimately picking up a point apiece.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 5-1 Brentford: Bruno Guimaraes scores twice in thumping win\nEddie Howe praised \"outstanding\" Bruno Guimaraes as Newcastle marked a year since their takeover with a crushing win over Brentford.\nGuimaraes put Newcastle ahead with a flying header before Jacob Murphy doubled the advantage shortly after following an error from David Raya.\nIvan Toney scored against his old club via a penalty, but Guimaraes netted again less than two minutes after.\nMiguel Almiron and an Ethan Pinnock own goal completed the scoring.\nBrentford were first to have the ball in the back of the net, Bryan Mbeumo running on to a Shandon Baptiste flick and slamming through Nick Pope's legs. However Toney was ruled to be interfering with play as he moved out the way of the ball while offside, and the effort was ruled out by VAR.\nInstead Newcastle took the lead, Kieran Trippier brilliantly curling in a far-post cross from deep after a short corner with Guimaraes heading home.\nNewcastle boss Howe, speaking to Match of the Day, said of Guimaraes: \"He was outstanding. We really missed him when he was out [as he is] a quality player who helps us in every phase.\"\nUnited doubled their lead thanks to a howler from Raya, who passed straight to Callum Wilson. He played square for Murphy to strike past covering defender Ben Mee.\nToney made it 2-1 from the spot after Aaron Hickey headed against Dan Burn's raised arm, but one minute and 57 seconds later Guimaraes restored the two-goal advantage as he won the ball from Hickey near the halfway line, drove forward and struck to Raya's right from 25 yards.\nBrentford were their own worst enemies as they were caught playing out from the back again, Pinnock selling Raya short with an under-hit pass that Almiron burst on to and slammed home.\nPinnock was again at fault for number five, sticking a boot out right in front of Raya to deflect a low cross from the left past his own goalkeeper.\nLet's talk about Bruno - Newcastle's \u00a338m 'bargain'\nFive-star Toon on day of celebration\nOne year and a day since a Saudi-led consortium took over their club, Newcastle's fans were in celebratory mood at St James' Park. A tifo covered the Gallowgate End before kick-off, based on the takeover announcement and listing the signings made in the past 12 months.\nTwo of the players signed by the current owners are Trippier and Guimaraes, and both were in stellar form here. Trippier's crossing was a constant menace, as he left a timely reminder as to why he may go to the World Cup with England ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nGuimaraes was the driving force from midfield for Eddie Howe's side, his goals ending a run of three successive home draws for the Tynesiders.\nAlmiron was also excellent - signed during the Mike Ashley era and often maligned, he was an endlessly energetic attacking presence, forcing a great save from Raya after five minutes and carrying on in that form.\nHe only got one goal last season but is already on four this campaign, and after scoring was presented with a Paraguay flag from the crowd - a sign of the esteem in which he is held by fans.\nOf Almiron, Howe said: \"It is all about building consistency to his game but he has performed brilliantly off the ball and now he is adding goals to that.\"\nThe return of Allan Saint-Maximin as a late substitute capped a terrific day for Newcastle, the forward having not played since August because of a hamstring injury.\nUnhappy return for Toney\nBrentford last won at Newcastle 88 years ago, and aside from a VAR-crushed moment early on never looked likely to end that sequence here.\nThe goalless draw at Bournemouth last weekend marked their first clean sheet in 20 Premier League away fixtures. With five shipped here, clearly Thomas Frank has issues to solve in defence.\nFrank told Match of the Day: \"In general I never thought we would concede five goals, we did today. In life and football it is about how you respond to setbacks.\n\"If you want to win football matches it is relatively important you don't make one, two, three, or four mistakes leading to goals. To make four mistakes then you lose football games and basically that is it.\n\"We are of course fuming. I can feel my anger bursting around inside me. It is the same as the players and we will bounce back.\"\nIt was also a bad day for Toney, captaining Brentford at the stadium where he made two Premier League substitute appearances for Newcastle in 2015-16, the sum of his top-flight career for the north-east side.\nAfter inadvertently denying his side their opener, Toney did score with his 21st successive converted penalty, early in the second half.\nHe has been involved in eight of Brentford's 16 Premier League goals this season, scoring six - but it is at the other end of the field where their major problems lie.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The players were fantastic today but when one team played like that today it is a good message for the league for the future.\n\"In the first half after 15-20 minutes, we played a good 25 minutes.

That allowed us to go through those difficult periods. But now we have to build from that.\"\nSet-piece woes for Leeds again\nAfter avoiding relegation on the final day of last term, Leeds are hoping for a less stressful time in what is boss Jesse Marsch's first full season in charge.\nThe West Yorkshire side made an excellent start to the campaign with wins against Wolves and Chelsea in their first three games, but they are now without a win since late August.\nThey began this match in dominant form as Palace struggled to deal with them, with Aaronson looking lively and Bamford sharp on his return to the starting XI.\nBut set pieces have been a point of concern, and once again they were Leeds' undoing as they failed to pick up Edouard for Olise's free-kick.\nSince the start of last season, they have conceded 20 goals from set pieces, with only Southampton (21), Everton (23) and Leicester (25) letting in more.\nAfter conceding the equaliser, Leeds rarely looked like scoring again as their struggles on the road continued, and they have now taken just one point in four away games so far this season.\n\"Most of the teams I've coached, we score goals in bunches, and here we just aren't able to reward ourselves in big moments when we create advantages and are often on top of the game,\" said Marsch.\n\"In every game it's been a little like that. We've got to find a way to get leads and then add onto them.\n\"We like our group a lot. I like this team. I love this team, I really do. I believe in this team and I know that we're going to improve and keep getting better.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Bowen slotted the spot kick to Bernd Leno's right.\nScamacca missed another headed chance from six yards, however he finally found the net in superb fashion by chipping Leno, with the goal given after a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) check.\nHe was replaced by Antonio with 10 minutes to go, and the sub finished the game in comical fashion - after his initial shot was saved by Leno, the German keeper and Tim Ream got in each other's way trying to clear, inadvertently presenting the striker with an open goal to finish.\nScattergun Scamacca finds the target\nHaving had to bide his time following his \u00a332m move from Sassuolo in the summer, Scamacca now has six goals in 12 games for West Ham.\nAfter netting against Wolves last weekend and the winner against Anderlecht on Thursday, the Italian was the Hammers' main man once again.\nHe could - perhaps should - have scored several more. On 16 minutes he headed down a driven Paqueta cross from eight yards while unmarked which, while Leno brilliantly scooped it out from near his boot, he should have guided further away from the keeper.\nBefore the 25th minute Scamacca had missed two more chances, dragging a one on one narrowly wide of the far post before sending another header straight at Leno.\nFive minutes after the break he missed another free header, this time from only six yards - yet when the toughest chance came, after being put through by Paqueta with a lovely chipped through ball, he kept his nerve to scoop it over the goalie.\nScamacca did not immediately celebrate and was subjected to a VAR check of several minutes, which looked at whether he was offside or had handled the ball. With no clear evidence to disallow for either reason, the goal was given - and the Italian finally celebrated wildly with fans.\nIt encapsulated Scamacca's Premier League career so far - a slow start peppered with what-ifs, finally coming good. He is the first West Ham striker to score in his opening two home starts at London Stadium - fans will hope the club's recent poor run of forward signings is at an end.\nFor West Ham it continues their dominance over Fulham - they have won their last five Premier League games against the Cottagers, while David Moyes has now won 14 of his 15 games against them.\nIt also means they have won consecutive league matches for the first time since January, further raising hopes a difficult start is behind them.\nMitrovic missed as Fulham frustrated\nIt was a frustrating afternoon for Marco Silva, who was booked for his remonstrations with the officials after the Scamacca goal was given. Fulham started well but faded after West Ham equalised.\nThings could have been very different - Pereira was busy in the opening stages and took his goal brilliantly, his first Premier League strike in two years and 333 days since scoring for Manchester United against Brighton in November 2019.\nAnd had James' 20-yard dipper on 13 minutes been a few inches lower, the story of the game would surely have been different.\nInstead this game shows how much Fulham miss Aleksandar Mitrovic when the Serbian bruiser is unavailable. He was absent for this game after aggravating a foot injury last week against Newcastle, and replacement Carlos Vinicius was unremarkable.\nSilva also has problems to solve at the other end of the pitch. Fulham have kept just one clean sheet in the past 22 top-flight away meetings, conceding 52 goals.\nComedy mix-ups such as the one between Leno and Ream for West Ham's third aside, Fulham were picked apart regularly and had Scamacca had his sights aligned all game, they could have conceded several more.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

And Chelsea's second goal dispirited them.\nWolves have won just one of their past 16 Premier League games, failing to score in six of their past nine matches.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Under the circumstances, handing him his first league start was a fairly straightforward decision for Ten Hag.\nYet, even at 30, with so many honours to his name, Casemiro evidently still has some learning to do. In Spain, he might have got a free-kick when he was barged off the ball by Onana, leading to Everton's opener. Tonight, referee David Coote waved the game on.\nCasemiro didn't let the setback affect him.\nHe should have scored when he ran unmarked on to Rashford's cross, slapping the turf in frustration as his header bounced wide.

However Toney was ruled to be interfering with play as he moved out the way of the ball while offside, and the effort was ruled out by VAR.\nInstead Newcastle took the lead, Kieran Trippier brilliantly curling in a far-post cross from deep after a short corner with Guimaraes heading home.\nNewcastle boss Howe, speaking to Match of the Day, said of Guimaraes: \"He was outstanding. We really missed him when he was out [as he is] a quality player who helps us in every phase.\"\nUnited doubled their lead thanks to a howler from Raya, who passed straight to Callum Wilson. He played square for Murphy to strike past covering defender Ben Mee.\nToney made it 2-1 from the spot after Aaron Hickey headed against Dan Burn's raised arm, but one minute and 57 seconds later Guimaraes restored the two-goal advantage as he won the ball from Hickey near the halfway line, drove forward and struck to Raya's right from 25 yards.\nBrentford were their own worst enemies as they were caught playing out from the back again, Pinnock selling Raya short with an under-hit pass that Almiron burst on to and slammed home.\nPinnock was again at fault for number five, sticking a boot out right in front of Raya to deflect a low cross from the left past his own goalkeeper.\nLet's talk about Bruno - Newcastle's \u00a338m 'bargain'\nFive-star Toon on day of celebration\nOne year and a day since a Saudi-led consortium took over their club, Newcastle's fans were in celebratory mood at St James' Park. A tifo covered the Gallowgate End before kick-off, based on the takeover announcement and listing the signings made in the past 12 months.\nTwo of the players signed by the current owners are Trippier and Guimaraes, and both were in stellar form here. Trippier's crossing was a constant menace, as he left a timely reminder as to why he may go to the World Cup with England ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nGuimaraes was the driving force from midfield for Eddie Howe's side, his goals ending a run of three successive home draws for the Tynesiders.\nAlmiron was also excellent - signed during the Mike Ashley era and often maligned, he was an endlessly energetic attacking presence, forcing a great save from Raya after five minutes and carrying on in that form.\nHe only got one goal last season but is already on four this campaign, and after scoring was presented with a Paraguay flag from the crowd - a sign of the esteem in which he is held by fans.\nOf Almiron, Howe said: \"It is all about building consistency to his game but he has performed brilliantly off the ball and now he is adding goals to that.\"\nThe return of Allan Saint-Maximin as a late substitute capped a terrific day for Newcastle, the forward having not played since August because of a hamstring injury.\nUnhappy return for Toney\nBrentford last won at Newcastle 88 years ago, and aside from a VAR-crushed moment early on never looked likely to end that sequence here.\nThe goalless draw at Bournemouth last weekend marked their first clean sheet in 20 Premier League away fixtures. With five shipped here, clearly Thomas Frank has issues to solve in defence.\nFrank told Match of the Day: \"In general I never thought we would concede five goals, we did today. In life and football it is about how you respond to setbacks.\n\"If you want to win football matches it is relatively important you don't make one, two, three, or four mistakes leading to goals. To make four mistakes then you lose football games and basically that is it.\n\"We are of course fuming. I can feel my anger bursting around inside me. It is the same as the players and we will bounce back.\"\nIt was also a bad day for Toney, captaining Brentford at the stadium where he made two Premier League substitute appearances for Newcastle in 2015-16, the sum of his top-flight career for the north-east side.\nAfter inadvertently denying his side their opener, Toney did score with his 21st successive converted penalty, early in the second half.\nHe has been involved in eight of Brentford's 16 Premier League goals this season, scoring six - but it is at the other end of the field where their major problems lie.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Man City 4-0 Southampton: Erling Haaland scores again as defending champions move top\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola says Erling Haaland is helping to bring the best out of Kevin de Bruyne after seeing the pair help his side sweep Southampton aside to move top of the Premier League.\nHaaland scored his 20th goal for City against Saints, while De Bruyne's pass to set up Phil Foden means his stats are just as stellar, with nine assists in his first nine league games.\nDe Bruyne has already bettered the tally of eight league assists he made last season, and is well on his way towards breaking the record of 20 in a single campaign that he shares with Thierry Henry.\n\"Of course for a player like Kevin, and especially Kevin, having this threat, this guy [Haaland] who likes to run in behind with this pace, it helps him a lot,\" Guardiola said.\n\"Kevin again created three or four chances [against Southampton], but he can play better. Today was not the best Kevin that we know, because he can put his mate in front of the keeper most of the time - but having players like Erling, Julian [Alvarez] or Phil, making movements in behind, it is so important to him.\"\nHaaland called 'ridiculous' and 'sublime' as he sets more scoring records\nRelive all Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nVisit our Southampton page\nTwenty goals is usually the benchmark of a successful season for any striker, but Haaland has taken only 13 games to reach that mark in all competitions, with struggling Saints the latest side to find out how hard it is to keep him or his team-mates quiet.\nCity attacked relentlessly from the start and Haaland was within inches of giving them an early lead when - to the surprise of virtually the entire stadium - he hit the inside of the post after galloping clear.\nInstead it was Joao Cancelo who put the home side ahead, running on to Phil Foden's pass and cutting past James Ward-Prowse before finding the bottom corner of the net.\nFoden, who like Haaland scored a hat-trick here against Manchester United last weekend, got on the scoresheet himself soon afterwards with a dinked finish after De Bruyne found him in space in the box.\nThat put City in complete control at the break and they wrapped up the points at the start of the second half when Riyad Mahrez volleyed home a Rodri cross.\nThe only thing missing for the home fans was another Haaland goal and, after three successive home league hat-tricks, for once it appeared it might not be his day.\nHaaland was unable to get on the end of De Bruyne's cross under pressure from Mohammed Salisu, and then brilliantly denied by Gavin Bazunu who dived at his feet as he charged through on goal.\nAs the chances kept coming however, you just knew Haaland would take one - and so he did, meeting Cancelo's cutback with a typically precise low finish to make it 4-0 after 65 minutes.\nSouthampton, who managed only one touch in the City area and a total of two shots - both from distance, and both off target - drew home and away against Guardiola's side last season. This time, they never looked like avoiding a fourth consecutive defeat.\nCity keep scoring, and keep on winning\nCity were last in top spot on 20 August and might not stay there for long - Arsenal will return to the summit if they beat Liverpool on Sunday.\nRegardless of their current position in the table, though, it is clear the defending champions are in the sort of form which will worry all their title rivals.\nCity are the last unbeaten side in England's top four divisions, but it is the way they are dispatching opponents that is ominous.\nCity's stroll against Saints means they have now scored 33 goals in nine league games, 13 more than Arsenal who have the next best tally.\nHaving Haaland obviously helps - he now has 15 Premier League goals for the season, matching the tally of De Bruyne when he finished as top scorer in the competition in 2021-22 - but his team-mates keep scoring too.\nSaints put up a fight for their manager\nSouthampton's performance was far more important to their manager's cause than the end result.\nReports this week suggested Ralph Hasenhuttl is on the brink of the sack after four years at St Mary's, but his side did not play like one that has given up on him.\nTrue, damage limitation was always their main aim, but that has not saved others from worse drubbings at Etihad Stadium this season.\nHasenhuttl must have feared the worst when City came flying out of the blocks but his side defended well, and continued to do so even when the game was long lost.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "West Ham 3-1 Fulham: Gianluca Scamacca continues scoring streak to settle London derby\nGianluca Scamacca scored for a third successive game as West Ham came from behind to beat Fulham.\nFulham led after six minutes as Andreas Pereira fired in from a tight angle.\nBut Pereira then fouled Craig Dawson from a corner, Jarrod Bowen scoring the penalty.\nScamacca missed a series of good chances but netted when it counted as he lobbed Bernd Leno, before a defensive mix-up presented Michail Antonio with the third.\nScamacca shows signs of ending West Ham striker curse\nFulham took the lead with the first major attack of the game - Kurt Zouma failed to close down Pereira on the left side of the West Ham box, and the Brazilian beat \u0141ukasz Fabianski for power with his shot high into the net from a tight angle.\nIn an entertaining first half full of chances, Daniel James cracked the crossbar from 20 yards with a dipping left foot shot, before Scamacca missed a trio of opportunities to draw West Ham level.\nThe Hammers equalised instead from the penalty spot, with Pereira going from hero to villain as he barged Dawson to the floor from a corner. Bowen slotted the spot kick to Bernd Leno's right.\nScamacca missed another headed chance from six yards, however he finally found the net in superb fashion by chipping Leno, with the goal given after a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) check.\nHe was replaced by Antonio with 10 minutes to go, and the sub finished the game in comical fashion - after his initial shot was saved by Leno, the German keeper and Tim Ream got in each other's way trying to clear, inadvertently presenting the striker with an open goal to finish.\nScattergun Scamacca finds the target\nHaving had to bide his time following his \u00a332m move from Sassuolo in the summer, Scamacca now has six goals in 12 games for West Ham.\nAfter netting against Wolves last weekend and the winner against Anderlecht on Thursday, the Italian was the Hammers' main man once again.\nHe could - perhaps should - have scored several more. On 16 minutes he headed down a driven Paqueta cross from eight yards while unmarked which, while Leno brilliantly scooped it out from near his boot, he should have guided further away from the keeper.\nBefore the 25th minute Scamacca had missed two more chances, dragging a one on one narrowly wide of the far post before sending another header straight at Leno.\nFive minutes after the break he missed another free header, this time from only six yards - yet when the toughest chance came, after being put through by Paqueta with a lovely chipped through ball, he kept his nerve to scoop it over the goalie.\nScamacca did not immediately celebrate and was subjected to a VAR check of several minutes, which looked at whether he was offside or had handled the ball. With no clear evidence to disallow for either reason, the goal was given - and the Italian finally celebrated wildly with fans.\nIt encapsulated Scamacca's Premier League career so far - a slow start peppered with what-ifs, finally coming good. He is the first West Ham striker to score in his opening two home starts at London Stadium - fans will hope the club's recent poor run of forward signings is at an end.\nFor West Ham it continues their dominance over Fulham - they have won their last five Premier League games against the Cottagers, while David Moyes has now won 14 of his 15 games against them.\nIt also means they have won consecutive league matches for the first time since January, further raising hopes a difficult start is behind them.\nMitrovic missed as Fulham frustrated\nIt was a frustrating afternoon for Marco Silva, who was booked for his remonstrations with the officials after the Scamacca goal was given. Fulham started well but faded after West Ham equalised.\nThings could have been very different - Pereira was busy in the opening stages and took his goal brilliantly, his first Premier League strike in two years and 333 days since scoring for Manchester United against Brighton in November 2019.\nAnd had James' 20-yard dipper on 13 minutes been a few inches lower, the story of the game would surely have been different.\nInstead this game shows how much Fulham miss Aleksandar Mitrovic when the Serbian bruiser is unavailable. He was absent for this game after aggravating a foot injury last week against Newcastle, and replacement Carlos Vinicius was unremarkable.\nSilva also has problems to solve at the other end of the pitch. Fulham have kept just one clean sheet in the past 22 top-flight away meetings, conceding 52 goals.\nComedy mix-ups such as the one between Leno and Ream for West Ham's third aside, Fulham were picked apart regularly and had Scamacca had his sights aligned all game, they could have conceded several more.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

That allowed us to go through those difficult periods. But now we have to build from that.\"\nSet-piece woes for Leeds again\nAfter avoiding relegation on the final day of last term, Leeds are hoping for a less stressful time in what is boss Jesse Marsch's first full season in charge.\nThe West Yorkshire side made an excellent start to the campaign with wins against Wolves and Chelsea in their first three games, but they are now without a win since late August.\nThey began this match in dominant form as Palace struggled to deal with them, with Aaronson looking lively and Bamford sharp on his return to the starting XI.\nBut set pieces have been a point of concern, and once again they were Leeds' undoing as they failed to pick up Edouard for Olise's free-kick.\nSince the start of last season, they have conceded 20 goals from set pieces, with only Southampton (21), Everton (23) and Leicester (25) letting in more.\nAfter conceding the equaliser, Leeds rarely looked like scoring again as their struggles on the road continued, and they have now taken just one point in four away games so far this season.\n\"Most of the teams I've coached, we score goals in bunches, and here we just aren't able to reward ourselves in big moments when we create advantages and are often on top of the game,\" said Marsch.\n\"In every game it's been a little like that. We've got to find a way to get leads and then add onto them.\n\"We like our group a lot. I like this team. I love this team, I really do.

John McGinn, Philippe Coutinho and Emiliano Buendia were all included in Gerrard's starting XI but none were able to deliver a telling moment for their side.\nA well-worked early corner routine that saw McGinn scuff his shot into a posse of a defenders was in keeping with what was to follow for the visitors.\nVilla enjoyed plenty of possession but lacked potency once they approached the Forest penalty area, with just two of their 12 efforts on goal on target.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

And Chelsea's second goal dispirited them.\nWolves have won just one of their past 16 Premier League games, failing to score in six of their past nine matches.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Man City 4-0 Southampton: Erling Haaland scores again as defending champions move top\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola says Erling Haaland is helping to bring the best out of Kevin de Bruyne after seeing the pair help his side sweep Southampton aside to move top of the Premier League.\nHaaland scored his 20th goal for City against Saints, while De Bruyne's pass to set up Phil Foden means his stats are just as stellar, with nine assists in his first nine league games.\nDe Bruyne has already bettered the tally of eight league assists he made last season, and is well on his way towards breaking the record of 20 in a single campaign that he shares with Thierry Henry.\n\"Of course for a player like Kevin, and especially Kevin, having this threat, this guy [Haaland] who likes to run in behind with this pace, it helps him a lot,\" Guardiola said.\n\"Kevin again created three or four chances [against Southampton], but he can play better. Today was not the best Kevin that we know, because he can put his mate in front of the keeper most of the time - but having players like Erling, Julian [Alvarez] or Phil, making movements in behind, it is so important to him.\"\nHaaland called 'ridiculous' and 'sublime' as he sets more scoring records\nRelive all Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nVisit our Southampton page\nTwenty goals is usually the benchmark of a successful season for any striker, but Haaland has taken only 13 games to reach that mark in all competitions, with struggling Saints the latest side to find out how hard it is to keep him or his team-mates quiet.\nCity attacked relentlessly from the start and Haaland was within inches of giving them an early lead when - to the surprise of virtually the entire stadium - he hit the inside of the post after galloping clear.\nInstead it was Joao Cancelo who put the home side ahead, running on to Phil Foden's pass and cutting past James Ward-Prowse before finding the bottom corner of the net.\nFoden, who like Haaland scored a hat-trick here against Manchester United last weekend, got on the scoresheet himself soon afterwards with a dinked finish after De Bruyne found him in space in the box.\nThat put City in complete control at the break and they wrapped up the points at the start of the second half when Riyad Mahrez volleyed home a Rodri cross.\nThe only thing missing for the home fans was another Haaland goal and, after three successive home league hat-tricks, for once it appeared it might not be his day.\nHaaland was unable to get on the end of De Bruyne's cross under pressure from Mohammed Salisu, and then brilliantly denied by Gavin Bazunu who dived at his feet as he charged through on goal.\nAs the chances kept coming however, you just knew Haaland would take one - and so he did, meeting Cancelo's cutback with a typically precise low finish to make it 4-0 after 65 minutes.\nSouthampton, who managed only one touch in the City area and a total of two shots - both from distance, and both off target - drew home and away against Guardiola's side last season. This time, they never looked like avoiding a fourth consecutive defeat.\nCity keep scoring, and keep on winning\nCity were last in top spot on 20 August and might not stay there for long - Arsenal will return to the summit if they beat Liverpool on Sunday.\nRegardless of their current position in the table, though, it is clear the defending champions are in the sort of form which will worry all their title rivals.\nCity are the last unbeaten side in England's top four divisions, but it is the way they are dispatching opponents that is ominous.\nCity's stroll against Saints means they have now scored 33 goals in nine league games, 13 more than Arsenal who have the next best tally.\nHaving Haaland obviously helps - he now has 15 Premier League goals for the season, matching the tally of De Bruyne when he finished as top scorer in the competition in 2021-22 - but his team-mates keep scoring too.\nSaints put up a fight for their manager\nSouthampton's performance was far more important to their manager's cause than the end result.\nReports this week suggested Ralph Hasenhuttl is on the brink of the sack after four years at St Mary's, but his side did not play like one that has given up on him.\nTrue, damage limitation was always their main aim, but that has not saved others from worse drubbings at Etihad Stadium this season.\nHasenhuttl must have feared the worst when City came flying out of the blocks but his side defended well, and continued to do so even when the game was long lost.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We lose too many second balls, too many duels. We made mistakes about shooting, about the last pass, about crosses. But this is the right way for us.\n\"We have to do more. We have to improve, to learn, to understand.\"\nBrentford and Toney made the most of their opportunities, scoring twice from just three efforts on target. Mads Roerslev could have added further gloss to a fine victory but he saw his effort cleared off the line after Sanchez had been unable to claim a cross.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Neither side were able to force the issue, despite the introduction of Jamie Vardy and Kelechi Iheanacho.

Wout Faes, their only major summer signing, was their standout player at the back.\nThis was another long afternoon in what is becoming a long season for Rodgers' side, summed up by the talismanic Maddison picking up a booking for simulation that will keep him out of Thursday's match with Leeds.\nZaha on the periphery for Palace\nBeing substituted inside the last 15 minutes with the game still on a knife-edge epitomised Zaha's day.\nThere were moments for the visitors, with Eze particularly busy in midfield, but they couldn't find the killer pass to make the difference.\nZaha cut a frustrated figure on an afternoon he'll have come into hoping to have a decisive impact.\nThis is Palace's second successive goalless draw on the road, and they didn't do enough to gain all three points again.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Substitute Rashford climbed highest but his effort went wide of the far post.\nA goal at that point would have been harsh on Newcastle, who came close to securing only their second victory at Old Trafford since 1972 but after Joelinton's first-half header had hit the bar, the Brazilian failed to head the rebound into an empty net.\nThe hosts' frustrations were summed up by Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThe Portuguese striker, who had two second-half efforts disallowed, shook his head in irritation when he was replaced by Rashford 18 minutes from time.\nHe carried on chuntering to himself and shaking his head until he reached the dug-out, when he slumped down in simmering discontent.\nTen Hag calls on players to 'kill' opponents after Newcastle draw\nUnited miss Eriksen\nSir Alex Ferguson presented David de Gea and Ronaldo with personal awards before kick-off. Before that, he greeted Erik ten Hag warmly.\nThe Scot did not experience defeat in this particular fixture throughout his 27-year reign as Manchester United manager.\nIncluding Ralf Rangnick, Ten Hag is the sixth man since Ferguson to be given the task of restoring the Old Trafford outfit to something like its former self.\nThe early weeks have been a switchback, brilliant against Liverpool and Arsenal, terrible against Brentford and Manchester City. There has been one constant, Christian Eriksen has proved to be an outstanding signing.\nRelive all Sunday's action\nSadly for Ten Hag, the Dane missed his first Premier League game of the season through illness and without him, Manchester United lacked creativity.\nIt was deep into the opening period before Antony forced Nick Pope into his first meaningful save and that came at the end of a Jadon Sancho-led counter-attack.\nThe home side did get the ball in the net twice in as many minutes after half-time but in both instances, Ronaldo's effort was ruled out.\nThe first was clearly offside. The second was more debatable.\nRonaldo and his team-mates argued Fabian Schar had rolled a free-kick back to Pope and therefore the ball was in play. Pope did not move as Ronaldo closed in, suggesting he thought the kick was still to be taken.\nReferee Craig Pawson sided with the England keeper, so Ronaldo nipping in to get the ball and tap into an empty net only brought him a yellow card.\nEvidently Ten Hag was not impressed with Pawson's performances judging by the way the Dutchman marched towards the official at the final whistle.\nImpressive Newcastle\nIt was another good result for Newcastle, who have now drawn with both Manchester clubs and have still only lost once this season.\nJoelinton should have put them in front. De Gea was on the floor having tried to save the Brazilian's initial header from Kieran Trippier's cross, so all the Brazilian had to do was get his effort on target.\nSadly for the visitors, he did not manage it, just as Miguel Almiron rushed his second-half shot from a pre-planned corner routine and blazed it into the Stretford End when he had time to do much better.\nNevertheless, on a ground where they hardly win and have not even secured a point since 2015, this was one of Newcastle's better efforts.\nTrippier in particular looked good, which is positive for Gareth Southgate given his recent bad news on the injury front for so many of his right-backs.\nCertainly if anyone is going to gate-crash the established top six this season, Newcastle look like being the ones to do it.\nGo straight to all the best Manchester United content\nVisit our Newcastle United page\nSutton's full predictions v Ian Broudie of The Lightning Seeds\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He will have an MRI tomorrow.\"\nToothless Toffees pay price for first-half misses\nBefore the game, manager Lampard spoke of Everton's improved strength of character since their narrow escape from relegation last season.\nThe Merseyside club have undoubtedly come a long way since losing 5-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in March but the visitors were taking no risks in the early stages here, with midfield trio Iwobi, Onana and Idrissa Gueye operating deep in front of the Toffees' back five in an effort to stifle Conte's side.\nBut Everton soon grew into the contest and should have taken the lead when Coady released Gray, but the winger's finish lacked composure.\nThe same applied to Onana's wild effort not long afterwards, which came after the Everton midfielder had capitalised on a lapse in concentration from Hojbjerg inside the Tottenham half.\nIt was one-way traffic in the second-half, however, as the Toffees failed to register a shot at Hugo Lloris' goal.\nTheir overall tally of four attempts is their lowest total in a Premier League game this season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The Egyptian showed he is still Liverpool's match-winner when he raced clear with Anfield expectant, and Ederson was unable to halt him on this occasion.\nLiverpool's false start to the season means they are off the pace in the title race with Klopp, who was shown a red card for vehement protests as tensions grew, already downplaying their chances.\nHowever, they are still the team with the capacity to come closest to City at their best - although great credit must be given to the way Arsenal have set the pace in outstanding style.\nAnfield was at its intimidating best once it became clear Liverpool were going to stand toe-to-toe with City, with other chances created apart from Salah's winning goal.\nLiverpool's fans were in joyous mood at the end as they celebrated a victory they always relish.\nMan City's killer touch deserts them\nManchester City have been performing with ominous menace this season, with Haaland as the spearhead, and have looked unstoppable in attack, but in the Anfield cauldron their final flourish was missing and it condemned them to their first league defeat of the season.\nThe goal that decided the game was celebrated wildly, with justification, by Liverpool but City and Guardiola will be furious at the manner of its concession.\nCity wasted a free-kick which ended tamely in the arms of Alisson, whose clearance was missed by Cancelo as he slipped, leaving Salah, who scored a hat-trick in the 7-1 Champions League win at Rangers, to confirm he has rediscovered his best form with a trademark finish.\nGuardiola, as so often at Anfield, was infuriated by a decision, this time when Foden's goal was ruled out but when referee Taylor was called to the screen, it was clear Haaland had a piece of Fabinho's shirt in the build-up.\nCity are too good, and have too many threats, to be knocked off their stride by one defeat but it is clear that losses to Liverpool cause them particularly acute pain.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Marc Cucurella struggled as Ings, Ollie Watkins and Leon Bailey caused problems right across the attack, helped by the fact that McGinn was doubling up on Villa's left side.\nThe defence was indebted to Arrizabalaga, who made six first-half saves, including a brilliant stop to deny Ings' header from point-blank range.\nFive minutes before half-time, Potter admitted his tactical plan had failed by moving Ruben Loftus-Cheek into the right wing-back position instead of Sterling.\nChelsea show support for Emma Hayes after 'trying week'\nAnd after Cesar Azpilicueta and Kalidou Koulibaly replaced Cucurella and Kai Havertz at the break, Chelsea looked a lot more solid. They could have gone further ahead when Sterling, restored to the attack, headed wide and had another effort saved by Martinez.\nMount, who is in talks about a new Chelsea contract, killed the game off with a well-taken free-kick, but again he had a helping hand when Martinez shifted to his right.\nThe Chelsea forward's strike went to the goalkeeper's left, but crossed the line close to the middle of the goal.\nMistakes prove costly for Villa\nIn addition to the boos at the final whistle, Gerrard was also jeered as he made his way down the tunnel.\nBut after the manager asked for recent \"frustration\" about his team's results to be channelled in the right way, the hosts answered with a first half that saw them also hit the woodwork twice.\nHow they did not score was largely down to Arrizabalaga, who, in addition to a brilliant save from Ings, made an extraordinary double save to stop McGinn and then Ramsey after Bailey hit the bar with an earlier header.\nWith Ings and Bailey in the starting line-up in place of Philippe Coutinho and Emiliano Buendia, there was plenty of joy down the flanks and the hosts were ably helped by Douglas Luiz in midfield.\nBut Mings' error was inexplicable as he mistimed his header under no pressure as Ben Chilwell's flick looped up to him in the penalty area.\nVilla might argue that Chilwell was lucky to stay on the pitch after a robust tackle on Ramsey, for which he was only booked.\nIn the second half, there were fewer chances as Chelsea tightened up and took control of possession. Arrizabalaga denied McGinn once more after 62 minutes, and within three minutes there was no coming back once Martinez misjudged Mount's free-kick.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Substitute Rashford climbed highest but his effort went wide of the far post.\nA goal at that point would have been harsh on Newcastle, who came close to securing only their second victory at Old Trafford since 1972 but after Joelinton's first-half header had hit the bar, the Brazilian failed to head the rebound into an empty net.\nThe hosts' frustrations were summed up by Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThe Portuguese striker, who had two second-half efforts disallowed, shook his head in irritation when he was replaced by Rashford 18 minutes from time.\nHe carried on chuntering to himself and shaking his head until he reached the dug-out, when he slumped down in simmering discontent.\nTen Hag calls on players to 'kill' opponents after Newcastle draw\nUnited miss Eriksen\nSir Alex Ferguson presented David de Gea and Ronaldo with personal awards before kick-off. Before that, he greeted Erik ten Hag warmly.\nThe Scot did not experience defeat in this particular fixture throughout his 27-year reign as Manchester United manager.\nIncluding Ralf Rangnick, Ten Hag is the sixth man since Ferguson to be given the task of restoring the Old Trafford outfit to something like its former self.\nThe early weeks have been a switchback, brilliant against Liverpool and Arsenal, terrible against Brentford and Manchester City. There has been one constant, Christian Eriksen has proved to be an outstanding signing.\nRelive all Sunday's action\nSadly for Ten Hag, the Dane missed his first Premier League game of the season through illness and without him, Manchester United lacked creativity.\nIt was deep into the opening period before Antony forced Nick Pope into his first meaningful save and that came at the end of a Jadon Sancho-led counter-attack.\nThe home side did get the ball in the net twice in as many minutes after half-time but in both instances, Ronaldo's effort was ruled out.\nThe first was clearly offside. The second was more debatable.\nRonaldo and his team-mates argued Fabian Schar had rolled a free-kick back to Pope and therefore the ball was in play. Pope did not move as Ronaldo closed in, suggesting he thought the kick was still to be taken.\nReferee Craig Pawson sided with the England keeper, so Ronaldo nipping in to get the ball and tap into an empty net only brought him a yellow card.\nEvidently Ten Hag was not impressed with Pawson's performances judging by the way the Dutchman marched towards the official at the final whistle.\nImpressive Newcastle\nIt was another good result for Newcastle, who have now drawn with both Manchester clubs and have still only lost once this season.\nJoelinton should have put them in front. De Gea was on the floor having tried to save the Brazilian's initial header from Kieran Trippier's cross, so all the Brazilian had to do was get his effort on target.\nSadly for the visitors, he did not manage it, just as Miguel Almiron rushed his second-half shot from a pre-planned corner routine and blazed it into the Stretford End when he had time to do much better.\nNevertheless, on a ground where they hardly win and have not even secured a point since 2015, this was one of Newcastle's better efforts.\nTrippier in particular looked good, which is positive for Gareth Southgate given his recent bad news on the injury front for so many of his right-backs.\nCertainly if anyone is going to gate-crash the established top six this season, Newcastle look like being the ones to do it.\nGo straight to all the best Manchester United content\nVisit our Newcastle United page\nSutton's full predictions v Ian Broudie of The Lightning Seeds\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He will have an MRI tomorrow.\"\nToothless Toffees pay price for first-half misses\nBefore the game, manager Lampard spoke of Everton's improved strength of character since their narrow escape from relegation last season.\nThe Merseyside club have undoubtedly come a long way since losing 5-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in March but the visitors were taking no risks in the early stages here, with midfield trio Iwobi, Onana and Idrissa Gueye operating deep in front of the Toffees' back five in an effort to stifle Conte's side.\nBut Everton soon grew into the contest and should have taken the lead when Coady released Gray, but the winger's finish lacked composure.\nThe same applied to Onana's wild effort not long afterwards, which came after the Everton midfielder had capitalised on a lapse in concentration from Hojbjerg inside the Tottenham half.\nIt was one-way traffic in the second-half, however, as the Toffees failed to register a shot at Hugo Lloris' goal.\nTheir overall tally of four attempts is their lowest total in a Premier League game this season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Marc Cucurella struggled as Ings, Ollie Watkins and Leon Bailey caused problems right across the attack, helped by the fact that McGinn was doubling up on Villa's left side.\nThe defence was indebted to Arrizabalaga, who made six first-half saves, including a brilliant stop to deny Ings' header from point-blank range.\nFive minutes before half-time, Potter admitted his tactical plan had failed by moving Ruben Loftus-Cheek into the right wing-back position instead of Sterling.\nChelsea show support for Emma Hayes after 'trying week'\nAnd after Cesar Azpilicueta and Kalidou Koulibaly replaced Cucurella and Kai Havertz at the break, Chelsea looked a lot more solid. They could have gone further ahead when Sterling, restored to the attack, headed wide and had another effort saved by Martinez.\nMount, who is in talks about a new Chelsea contract, killed the game off with a well-taken free-kick, but again he had a helping hand when Martinez shifted to his right.\nThe Chelsea forward's strike went to the goalkeeper's left, but crossed the line close to the middle of the goal.\nMistakes prove costly for Villa\nIn addition to the boos at the final whistle, Gerrard was also jeered as he made his way down the tunnel.\nBut after the manager asked for recent \"frustration\" about his team's results to be channelled in the right way, the hosts answered with a first half that saw them also hit the woodwork twice.\nHow they did not score was largely down to Arrizabalaga, who, in addition to a brilliant save from Ings, made an extraordinary double save to stop McGinn and then Ramsey after Bailey hit the bar with an earlier header.\nWith Ings and Bailey in the starting line-up in place of Philippe Coutinho and Emiliano Buendia, there was plenty of joy down the flanks and the hosts were ably helped by Douglas Luiz in midfield.\nBut Mings' error was inexplicable as he mistimed his header under no pressure as Ben Chilwell's flick looped up to him in the penalty area.\nVilla might argue that Chilwell was lucky to stay on the pitch after a robust tackle on Ramsey, for which he was only booked.\nIn the second half, there were fewer chances as Chelsea tightened up and took control of possession. Arrizabalaga denied McGinn once more after 62 minutes, and within three minutes there was no coming back once Martinez misjudged Mount's free-kick.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Neither side were able to force the issue, despite the introduction of Jamie Vardy and Kelechi Iheanacho.

The Egyptian showed he is still Liverpool's match-winner when he raced clear with Anfield expectant, and Ederson was unable to halt him on this occasion.\nLiverpool's false start to the season means they are off the pace in the title race with Klopp, who was shown a red card for vehement protests as tensions grew, already downplaying their chances.\nHowever, they are still the team with the capacity to come closest to City at their best - although great credit must be given to the way Arsenal have set the pace in outstanding style.\nAnfield was at its intimidating best once it became clear Liverpool were going to stand toe-to-toe with City, with other chances created apart from Salah's winning goal.\nLiverpool's fans were in joyous mood at the end as they celebrated a victory they always relish.\nMan City's killer touch deserts them\nManchester City have been performing with ominous menace this season, with Haaland as the spearhead, and have looked unstoppable in attack, but in the Anfield cauldron their final flourish was missing and it condemned them to their first league defeat of the season.\nThe goal that decided the game was celebrated wildly, with justification, by Liverpool but City and Guardiola will be furious at the manner of its concession.\nCity wasted a free-kick which ended tamely in the arms of Alisson, whose clearance was missed by Cancelo as he slipped, leaving Salah, who scored a hat-trick in the 7-1 Champions League win at Rangers, to confirm he has rediscovered his best form with a trademark finish.\nGuardiola, as so often at Anfield, was infuriated by a decision, this time when Foden's goal was ruled out but when referee Taylor was called to the screen, it was clear Haaland had a piece of Fabinho's shirt in the build-up.\nCity are too good, and have too many threats, to be knocked off their stride by one defeat but it is clear that losses to Liverpool cause them particularly acute pain.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He was back defending and working for his team.\n\"When they defend well and these attacking players are let off the leash for Palace, it really is a joy to watch.\"\nEntertaining affair surpasses humble expectations\nGiven Palace had scored just four goals in their previous five games and Wolves had only managed that meagre tally all season, a thriller was not exactly expected but both sides served up a pleasant surprise.\nThe tone was set after just four minutes as Cheick Doucoure rattled Wolves' post from 20 yards and Guaita had to react smartly to keep out Diego Costa at the other end soon after.\nWolves then opened the scoring to end an away goal drought just five minutes shy of eight hours - 475 minutes to be precise - dating back to the opening day of the season.\nIt was worth the wait as 20-year-old full-back Hugo Bueno, making his first Wanderers start, put in a teasing deep cross for Traore to bury a header inside Guaita's near post.\nHowever, the game turned either side of the interval as Neves' 25-yard free-kick came back off the post just before the break and Eze headed Palace level right after the restart.\nIf that was a cool finish, Zaha trumped it with the winner, sending Sa the wrong way after a clever touch from Edouard's low ball afforded him the freedom of the Wolves box.\nThe Eagles are also making a habit of turnarounds, all three of their league wins this season - the others coming against Aston Villa and Leeds - have seen them fall behind first at home.\nFor Wolves, meanwhile, an awful away run of 10 games without a win goes on, even if there were positives for caretaker managerial duo Steve Davis and James Collins to draw on.\nThey will likely remain in charge for Sunday's important home game against fellow strugglers Leicester City, by which time Wolves could sit in the bottom three if other midweek results go against them.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The 24-year-old is evidently a player of immense talent. What he has not been able to do is reach his highest level on a consistent basis, which explains why he has not added to his solitary England cap, won against Wales, a month before that first goal against Leeds.\nHis intelligence in not following the ball contributed to both Leicester's first-half goals.\nKoch knew Barnes was behind him and ready to pounce when he diverted Dennis Praet's cross past Illan Meslier after 16 minutes.\nBarnes was then on his own in a similar position when he drilled a shot through Meslier's legs after Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall had provided the final pass of a flowing four-man move.\nIt was the kind of goal that has Leicester fans scratching their heads and wondering how their club has ended up in their present predicament.\nSummerville can't spark Leeds as fans vent fury\nDespite Leeds' troubles, Crysencio Summerville has had to be patient in waiting for his first Premier League start.\nThe 20-year-old Dutchman was given the prized number 10 shirt by Marsch in the summer, yet it was only against Leicester that the Leeds boss felt confident enough to hand Summerville his first-team chance.\nIt is true there are some raw edges that need to be smoothed and Diego Llorente gave him a real ear-bashing for failing to follow a runner as the Leeds defence scrambled to nullify one early Leicester attack.\nHowever, for the first hour he was one of the visiting players who looked most likely to threaten.\nSummerville might have done better than float a shot wide after one enterprising run into the box. Not long afterwards he brought a good save out of Ward, although he was marginally offside.\nThe Dutch Under-21 international has plenty of pace and is eager to get on the ball, but he should be getting helped out by more experienced colleagues as his Leeds team-mates simply failed to deliver.\nThe chants following Sinisterra's departure were clearly directed at Marsch and the continuing discontent from the Leeds contingent after the final whistle suggested issues that go beyond a single loss, as disappointing as this was.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

I am proud for the boys for the effort they put in and this time we were absolutely ready for this win and the clean sheet.\n\"I think we deserved it today because we did a very good job.\n\"All the things that we tried worked, from the set-up, to the gameplan, to the subs. Everything was perfect.\"\nThe result lifts Southampton to 14th, two points clear of the relegation zone, while Bournemouth sit 11th.\nReaction to Southampton's win at Bournemouth & Wednesday's Premier League action\nVisit our AFC Bournemouth page\nGo straight to the best Southampton content\nCaleta-Car impresses but both sides lack quality in final third\nHasenhuttl has spent most of the season among the bookmakers' favourites to be sacked - he sat second below Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard before kick-off - but on this evidence his players are still playing for him.\nThey were well organised at the back, with Croatia international Duje Caleta-Car impressing on his second start since joining from Marseille this summer.\nHasenhuttl spoke about Caleta-Car's leadership being integral in his pre-match interview and that was evident with the 26-year-old showing composure throughout, alongside making a crucial block to deny Philip Billing in the second half.\nGoing forward the Saints had energy with Adams and Adam Armstrong, but they often lacked quality, with Joe Aribo's toe-poked effort, saved by the outstretched feet of Neto, the closest they came to a second goal.\nThat chance was set up by the impressive Kyle Walker-Peters at right-back, but he went off injured in the second period, which will put a dampener on three important points.\n\"In the end it's a win for the whole group,\" Hasenhuttl added.\n\"We know that we have to fight as a group together after an intense transfer window in the summer and there are some phases that you are going through as a club and a team.\n\"We speak very often about the patience we need to have for them.\n\"It's not always that you get the patience in this business, especially when you are a little bit long working in a club like I do.\"\nO'Neil has done a remarkable job for Bournemouth since taking over the reins from Scott Parker, winning two games and drawing four, and you could see the confidence in his side as they tried to match their best unbeaten run in the top flight.\nBut they too showed a lack of quality in the final third, with Billing's drive from 22 yards the only time they really called Bazunu into action.\nThey nearly got their reward for their pressure in stoppage time when Bazunu dropped a corner and Lewis Cook turned towards goal but Mohammed Salisu was there to hack off the line for Southampton.\nThis game will be one Bournemouth targeted points from, especially with tough games against West Ham and Tottenham next on the agenda, but a four-point gap to the bottom three at this stage represents a decent start on their return to the top flight.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

That delay was worth it because without VAR I don't know what would have happened.\"\nFormer Chelsea winger Pat Nevin said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"What a fantastic game of football. That is one of the most exciting 1-0 scorelines I have ever seen.\n\"This game will be talked about for a long long time. Arsenal got very, very, lucky and Leeds were very unlucky. If they keep playing like that, don't worry Leeds fans, you will be fine.\"\nOn the overturned red card, Nevin said: \"I agree with every single part of the referee's decision except changing the red card to a yellow card. Apparently that is not violent conduct.\n\"If the ball is nowhere near you and you stick both feet into a opponent, that is violent conduct.\"\n'Better than best team in league'\nLeeds were much the better side in the second half but could not find the leveller and their winless run now stands at six games.\n\"It was a really good performance from us,\" boss Jesse Marsch told Sky Sports. \"[We had] discipline, concentration over the entire match, even with the late start, which was strange on the day.\n\"[It was] a performance that showed that when we play the way we want to play, we can be very good.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 0-1 Southampton: Che Adams winner relieves pressure on Ralph Hasenhuttl\nSouthampton relieved the pressure on boss Ralph Hasenhuttl with their first win in six games against south-coast rivals Bournemouth, who lost for the first time under interim manager Gary O'Neil.\nIt is hard to remember a time when pressure was not on Hasenhuttl, who has been in charge of the Saints since December 2018, but his side seem to grind out results when required and this was another example of that.\nChe Adams' first-half glancing header, after a left-wing cross from full-back Romain Perraud, was their first away goal in four games and ultimately proved enough as the Saints won for the first time since 30 August.\nPerhaps more importantly, and certainly more encouragingly for the remainder of the season, they kept their first clean sheet in 17 games, dating back to 16 April last season.\nThey invited pressure from Bournemouth after the goal, but the hosts, who were unbeaten in six games under the guidance of O'Neil, failed to really test Republic of Ireland international Gavin Bazunu in the Saints' goal.\nHasenhuttl told BBC Match of the Day: \"I am a proud man. I am proud for the boys for the effort they put in and this time we were absolutely ready for this win and the clean sheet.\n\"I think we deserved it today because we did a very good job.\n\"All the things that we tried worked, from the set-up, to the gameplan, to the subs. Everything was perfect.\"\nThe result lifts Southampton to 14th, two points clear of the relegation zone, while Bournemouth sit 11th.\nReaction to Southampton's win at Bournemouth & Wednesday's Premier League action\nVisit our AFC Bournemouth page\nGo straight to the best Southampton content\nCaleta-Car impresses but both sides lack quality in final third\nHasenhuttl has spent most of the season among the bookmakers' favourites to be sacked - he sat second below Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard before kick-off - but on this evidence his players are still playing for him.\nThey were well organised at the back, with Croatia international Duje Caleta-Car impressing on his second start since joining from Marseille this summer.\nHasenhuttl spoke about Caleta-Car's leadership being integral in his pre-match interview and that was evident with the 26-year-old showing composure throughout, alongside making a crucial block to deny Philip Billing in the second half.\nGoing forward the Saints had energy with Adams and Adam Armstrong, but they often lacked quality, with Joe Aribo's toe-poked effort, saved by the outstretched feet of Neto, the closest they came to a second goal.\nThat chance was set up by the impressive Kyle Walker-Peters at right-back, but he went off injured in the second period, which will put a dampener on three important points.\n\"In the end it's a win for the whole group,\" Hasenhuttl added.\n\"We know that we have to fight as a group together after an intense transfer window in the summer and there are some phases that you are going through as a club and a team.\n\"We speak very often about the patience we need to have for them.\n\"It's not always that you get the patience in this business, especially when you are a little bit long working in a club like I do.\"\nO'Neil has done a remarkable job for Bournemouth since taking over the reins from Scott Parker, winning two games and drawing four, and you could see the confidence in his side as they tried to match their best unbeaten run in the top flight.\nBut they too showed a lack of quality in the final third, with Billing's drive from 22 yards the only time they really called Bazunu into action.\nThey nearly got their reward for their pressure in stoppage time when Bazunu dropped a corner and Lewis Cook turned towards goal but Mohammed Salisu was there to hack off the line for Southampton.\nThis game will be one Bournemouth targeted points from, especially with tough games against West Ham and Tottenham next on the agenda, but a four-point gap to the bottom three at this stage represents a decent start on their return to the top flight.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Costa also saw other attempts blocked or deflected away.\nDaniel Podence was another to be denied by a brilliant Ward stop, while Ruben Neves fired a free-kick just wide at the start of the second half.\nBy the time Leicester scored their third - James Maddison again pressing his claim for a place in England's World Cup squad with a lovely low strike from 18 yards out - Wolves had created, and missed, 20 opportunities.\nThat Maddison goal came from only Leicester's third attempt of the match and they scored with their fourth too, Jamie Vardy scoring from close range following Timothy Castagne's cross, as they finally won away from home in the league after five successive defeats.\nWolves v Leicester as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nVisit our Wolves page\nGo straight to all the best Leicester City content\n\"We are growing nicely, but there is a long way to go,\" said Foxes manager Brendan Rodgers following his side's third win in five games after home victories against Nottingham Forest and Leeds earlier this month.\n\"Collectively, we were very, very good. We carried a threat, and defensively we were excellent. Our pressing has been very good and all the goals were fantastic.\n\"Confidence will grow and we'll get better. The concentration is better, everybody is focused, pressing at the right time and forcing teams into mistakes. Then we know we have the quality in the final third.\"\nThe win takes Leicester up from 20th to 16th, while Wolves drop a place to 19th and are only above bottom side Nottingham Forest on goal difference.\nWolves fans call for technical director to 'get out of our club'\nDuring the second half the home fans at Molineux showed their anger towards technical director Scott Sellars, with chants of \"We want Sellars out\" and \"Scott Sellars, get out of our club\".\nAnother chant was \"Sellars, make a sub\", but interim head coach Steve Davis rejected suggestions that Sellars, a former Leeds, Newcastle, Blackburn and Bolton winger, was having a say on tactics during a game.\n\"Scott does his job upstairs and we do our job downstairs,\" said Davis. \"I'm not on social media so that was the first time I heard something like that [from the fans].\n\"He is not involved in picking the team. We [Davis and coach James Collins] select how we play and we make the substitutions.\"\nThese are tough times for Wolves, who reached the Europa League quarter-finals in 2020, but sacked manager Bruno Lage earlier this month.\nTheir attempts to secure a replacement have not gone well. Former Spain manager Julen Lopetegui and ex-Watford manager Rob Edwards have been interviewed, while former boss Nuno Espirito Santo, who took them into Europe, was linked with a return. And on Thursday, QPR boss Michael Beale rejected them, preferring instead to stay with the Championship leaders.\nWolves chairman Jeff Shi then said lifelong Wolves fan Davis, in charge of coaching the club's under-18s before Lage was dismissed, would continue to be interim head coach \"until 2023\".\nDavis' side made a bright start in his fourth game in charge, but once again they could not convert their chances and their total of five goals in 12 games is the lowest in the division.\nCosta, Nunes, Hugo Bueno and Podence had shots saved or blocked and Joao Moutinho and Max Kilman narrowly missed the target on a frustrating day for the home fans.\n\"We're in a battle,\" added Davis. \"It's early in the season and it has to change. We can't be saying this beyond the World Cup, we need to be getting points.\n\"It's frustrating. Losing 4-0 at home is hard. I'm very disappointed for the fans and I feel their pain too.\"\nLeicester scored four excellent goals from five shots and only a late missed header from substitute Marc Albrighton meant they failed to end the match with a 100% conversion record.\nUnderstandably, Rodgers was delighted with a much needed three points.\n\"When we played the ball forward, we looked good and could have scored more goals,\" he added.\n\"We broke forward really well. Our objective was to get over the line. It is a Midlands derby so a great day for the supporters.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They have scored at least three goals in all of them, something no side had done since Aston Villa, also across two seasons, in 1930 and 1931.\nHaaland now has an incredible 17 goals in 11 league games - and 12 in his past five home games.\nHowever, it was skipper Kevin de Bruyne who scored the best of the day, curling a superb shot into the top corner from 25 yards from Bernardo Silva's inside pass.\nIt ended hopes of a Brighton comeback, which were raised after Leandro Trossard's second-half effort beat Ederson from the corner of the area.\nAs it is, Brighton are still without a win under new boss Roberto de Zerbi, while Pep Guardiola's side close to within a point of leaders Arsenal.\nReaction to Man City's win against Brighton, plus live coverage of Chelsea v Man Utd\nHaaland the scoring machine\nAfter failing to score at Liverpool last weekend, Haaland was on - for him - a barren run of two hours without a goal.\nHis opener emphasised how much speed, power and awareness he has.\nCity keeper Ederson deserves huge credit for launching a long ball from his penalty area over the top of the Brighton defence.\nSeagulls keeper Robert Sanchez dashed out of his goal but Haaland beat him to the ball and knocked it past him. Then he barged Adam Webster out of the way before rolling the ball into an empty net.\nIt meant the longest Haaland has gone without a Premier League goal remains 148 minutes.\nPretty soon, he had another as he drove home a penalty after the video assistant referee stopped play to rule Lewis Dunk had fouled Silva.\nThat goal was Guardiola's 600th as City boss, a figure achieved in six and a half trophy-laden years that last week was marked by City being confirmed as 'Club of the Year' at the Ballon d'Or awards.\nNot everything was perfect for City. Riyad Mahrez missed a glorious chance to put them three ahead just before Trossard's goal after being set up by De Bruyne. The Algerian looked distinctly unimpressed as he was replaced by Phil Foden.\nAnd Aymeric Laporte needed treatment for an injury in stoppage time that might make him a doubt for Tuesday's Champions League trip to Borussia Dortmund.\nBrighton complaints\nThere were Brighton grievances against both City's first-half goals.\nWebster was still complaining to referee Craig Pawson at the break that he was fouled by Haaland for the opening goal, while central defensive partner Dunk argued that Silva kicked him rather than the other way round for the penalty.\nThey were both debatable calls - and the type visiting teams need to go their way if they are to leave Etihad Stadium with anything.\nIt was pretty obvious Brighton's fourth place in the table when Graham Potter left for Chelsea was a false one and there were some tough games to come.\nNevertheless, that is two points from five games in charge now for De Zerbi before Potter's return to the Amex Stadium next Saturday.\nThere have been subtle tweaks to Potter's team by the Italian, who wants Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister to get on the ball more often in midfield, but a familiar Brighton failing of not scoring enough goals is becoming evident once more.\nTrossard's goal fell into the speculative category. But he wasted Brighton's best chance to equalise when he sprinted into the box and, instead of trying to find a centrally placed team-mate, attempted to beat Ederson from an impossible angle.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Brentford, meanwhile, are 10th on 14 points.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nShackles off as Villa show immediate response\nThis was an unbelievable display by a Villa team who had been struggling to score goals under Gerrard but, seemingly with the shackles off, they let loose on a stunned Brentford side.\nBefore Sunday, Villa were the joint-second lowest goalscorers in the Premier League this season with seven, but in just 14 minutes they scored as many goals as they managed in 409 minutes under Gerrard.\nTheir build-up play was fast and incisive, with Brentford struggling to close down the spaces and they could have won by an even bigger margin with both Luiz and Emi Buendia not far off with shots from distance.\nDanks, who had been assistant to Dean Smith prior to Gerrard's arrival, had also made a brave call before kick-off by benching captain John McGinn. His bold leadership may be just what Villa need - certainly in the short term - as they look to climb the table quickly.\n\"I have been asked to lead the team at the moment and will continue to do that,\" Danks said.\n\"I will step forward Monday morning to prepare the team as we go and, until I hear otherwise, it is full focus and energy on that.\"\n'Embarrassing' Bees' away struggles continue\nSunday's defeat was a completely unexpected result for Brentford, especially coming just four days after a fine display against Chelsea.\nThis was probably one of the visitors' worst performances since they were promoted to the Premier League, with Thomas Frank's side largely limited to chasing shadows - particularly in the first half.\nAlarm bells shouldn't be ringing after this loss, which was more likely a consequence of a Villa response to Gerrard's departure coupled with an off day for Brentford, who are sitting pretty comfortably in 10th place.\nHowever, Brentford are still without an away win this season and striker Ivan Toney insists similar performances to this will be unacceptable.\n\"Shambles, to be honest. Shambles,\" he said.\n\"We were like a bunch of kids out there. I don't mind losing games but not like that. Embarrassing performance from the boys.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They have scored at least three goals in all of them, something no side had done since Aston Villa, also across two seasons, in 1930 and 1931.\nHaaland now has an incredible 17 goals in 11 league games - and 12 in his past five home games.\nHowever, it was skipper Kevin de Bruyne who scored the best of the day, curling a superb shot into the top corner from 25 yards from Bernardo Silva's inside pass.\nIt ended hopes of a Brighton comeback, which were raised after Leandro Trossard's second-half effort beat Ederson from the corner of the area.\nAs it is, Brighton are still without a win under new boss Roberto de Zerbi, while Pep Guardiola's side close to within a point of leaders Arsenal.\nReaction to Man City's win against Brighton, plus live coverage of Chelsea v Man Utd\nHaaland the scoring machine\nAfter failing to score at Liverpool last weekend, Haaland was on - for him - a barren run of two hours without a goal.\nHis opener emphasised how much speed, power and awareness he has.\nCity keeper Ederson deserves huge credit for launching a long ball from his penalty area over the top of the Brighton defence.\nSeagulls keeper Robert Sanchez dashed out of his goal but Haaland beat him to the ball and knocked it past him. Then he barged Adam Webster out of the way before rolling the ball into an empty net.\nIt meant the longest Haaland has gone without a Premier League goal remains 148 minutes.\nPretty soon, he had another as he drove home a penalty after the video assistant referee stopped play to rule Lewis Dunk had fouled Silva.\nThat goal was Guardiola's 600th as City boss, a figure achieved in six and a half trophy-laden years that last week was marked by City being confirmed as 'Club of the Year' at the Ballon d'Or awards.\nNot everything was perfect for City. Riyad Mahrez missed a glorious chance to put them three ahead just before Trossard's goal after being set up by De Bruyne. The Algerian looked distinctly unimpressed as he was replaced by Phil Foden.\nAnd Aymeric Laporte needed treatment for an injury in stoppage time that might make him a doubt for Tuesday's Champions League trip to Borussia Dortmund.\nBrighton complaints\nThere were Brighton grievances against both City's first-half goals.\nWebster was still complaining to referee Craig Pawson at the break that he was fouled by Haaland for the opening goal, while central defensive partner Dunk argued that Silva kicked him rather than the other way round for the penalty.\nThey were both debatable calls - and the type visiting teams need to go their way if they are to leave Etihad Stadium with anything.\nIt was pretty obvious Brighton's fourth place in the table when Graham Potter left for Chelsea was a false one and there were some tough games to come.\nNevertheless, that is two points from five games in charge now for De Zerbi before Potter's return to the Amex Stadium next Saturday.\nThere have been subtle tweaks to Potter's team by the Italian, who wants Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister to get on the ball more often in midfield, but a familiar Brighton failing of not scoring enough goals is becoming evident once more.\nTrossard's goal fell into the speculative category. But he wasted Brighton's best chance to equalise when he sprinted into the box and, instead of trying to find a centrally placed team-mate, attempted to beat Ederson from an impossible angle.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 1-1 Man Utd: Hosts remain above United after dramatic finale\nCasemiro's looping stoppage-time header gave Manchester United a deserved point in a dramatic finale against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\nJorginho's late penalty looked to have given Chelsea a narrow win when he sent goalkeeper David de Gea the wrong way from the spot after substitutes Scott McTominay and Armando Broja tangled at a corner three minutes from time.\nDefeat would have been harsh on United but they got the reward their performance merited when Casemiro rose to meet Luke Shaw's cross deep into six minutes of stoppage time, Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga getting a fingertip touch but unable to stop the ball crossing the line as it bounced back off the inside of the post.\nUnited, with Cristiano Ronaldo left out of the squad as a disciplinary measure following his refusal to come on as a substitute in the win against Tottenham, had the better chances as they dominated the first half.\nErik ten Hag's side were well on top and far more dangerous, Kepa saving well from Marcus Rashford and Antony, the latter also missing a great chance when clean through.\nThe second half was closer and concluded with that frantic finish, but the main worry for United now is an injury to defender Raphael Varane, who left the pitch in tears as he clearly fears for his World Cup chances with France.\nManagers condemn homophobic chanting at Stamford Bridge\nVarane suffers injury at Chelsea and leaves pitch in tears\nReaction from Stamford Bridge\nDisappointment for Chelsea & Potter\nChelsea manager Graham Potter must have thought he was on the way to his second victory over United this season after Jorginho calmly slotted home late on.\nPotter, who won at Old Trafford with Brighton on the opening weekend, was also set to see his side earn a sixth successive clean sheet in all competitions until that late Casemiro intervention.\nIn reality, however, Chelsea would have been fortunate to win. Indeed, so outmanoeuvred were they in the first half that Potter was forced into a tactical reshuffle to bolster his struggling midfield after only 36 minutes, Mateo Kovacic coming on for Marc Cucurella.\nChelsea were grateful to goalkeeper Kepa in that period but they improved after the break - albeit they were still unable to force De Gea into any serious work, the one anxious moment for the visitors coming when Trevoh Chalobah's header glanced off the top of the bar.\nThe hosts ultimately could muster just two shots on target in a game that failed to live up to its billing - but there will be real disappointment that they could not close out the win after taking the lead so late.\nPotter was at least able to maintain his unbeaten record as Chelsea manager but it could have been so much more satisfying.\nMan Utd boss Ten Hag can be satisfied\nTen Hag will be happy with a point after coming close to leaving with nothing. When the dust settles, however, he will know this was a missed opportunity.\nRashford and Antony should each have done better when clean through and it looked like they would pay for their profligacy before the outstanding Casemiro's first goal for the club provided the sting in the tail.\nTen Hag would have been bitterly frustrated at McTominay's rash tangle with Broja to concede the penalty and it was no surprise that the Scotland midfielder embraced Casemiro in sheer relief at the end.\nUnited's manager has brought clear improvements to the team, who now press more effectively and play with more intensity.\nHe has also dealt firmly and strongly with Ronaldo's insubordination, leaving him out of the squad here to deliver a clear message clear that there will only be one man making the decisions at Old Trafford.\nHowever, United will worry about Varane, who collapsed with what looked like a muscle injury as he went to challenge Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\nThe defender's tearful reaction clearly suggests it is a problem that threatens his World Cup chances.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

There are no complaints.\"\nThe effervescent Gabriel Martinelli had a shot deflected wide and Gabriel Jesus was denied by Southampton goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu as the visitors threatened to double their advantage before the interval.\nRalph Hasenhuttl's team improved in the second half but needed a superb last-ditch challenge from Elyounoussi to deny Jesus, who had broken clear of the Southampton defence.\nMartin Odegaard thought he had put Arsenal back ahead not long after Armstrong's equaliser, but the Norwegian's effort was disallowed after the ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\n\"We created big chances that we didn't put away,\" Arteta said. \"In the Premier League, when you don't do that when you're on top, you can pay the price.\n\"We were really good in the first half and totally controlled the game. In the second half we stopped doing the simple things right.

Considering we were 1-0 down, it's a good result.\"\nSaints have won eight points from losing positions in the league this season - only Crystal Palace have collected more after falling behind.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Brentford, meanwhile, are 10th on 14 points.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nShackles off as Villa show immediate response\nThis was an unbelievable display by a Villa team who had been struggling to score goals under Gerrard but, seemingly with the shackles off, they let loose on a stunned Brentford side.\nBefore Sunday, Villa were the joint-second lowest goalscorers in the Premier League this season with seven, but in just 14 minutes they scored as many goals as they managed in 409 minutes under Gerrard.\nTheir build-up play was fast and incisive, with Brentford struggling to close down the spaces and they could have won by an even bigger margin with both Luiz and Emi Buendia not far off with shots from distance.\nDanks, who had been assistant to Dean Smith prior to Gerrard's arrival, had also made a brave call before kick-off by benching captain John McGinn. His bold leadership may be just what Villa need - certainly in the short term - as they look to climb the table quickly.\n\"I have been asked to lead the team at the moment and will continue to do that,\" Danks said.\n\"I will step forward Monday morning to prepare the team as we go and, until I hear otherwise, it is full focus and energy on that.\"\n'Embarrassing' Bees' away struggles continue\nSunday's defeat was a completely unexpected result for Brentford, especially coming just four days after a fine display against Chelsea.\nThis was probably one of the visitors' worst performances since they were promoted to the Premier League, with Thomas Frank's side largely limited to chasing shadows - particularly in the first half.\nAlarm bells shouldn't be ringing after this loss, which was more likely a consequence of a Villa response to Gerrard's departure coupled with an off day for Brentford, who are sitting pretty comfortably in 10th place.\nHowever, Brentford are still without an away win this season and striker Ivan Toney insists similar performances to this will be unacceptable.\n\"Shambles, to be honest. Shambles,\" he said.\n\"We were like a bunch of kids out there. I don't mind losing games but not like that. Embarrassing performance from the boys.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Costa also saw other attempts blocked or deflected away.\nDaniel Podence was another to be denied by a brilliant Ward stop, while Ruben Neves fired a free-kick just wide at the start of the second half.\nBy the time Leicester scored their third - James Maddison again pressing his claim for a place in England's World Cup squad with a lovely low strike from 18 yards out - Wolves had created, and missed, 20 opportunities.\nThat Maddison goal came from only Leicester's third attempt of the match and they scored with their fourth too, Jamie Vardy scoring from close range following Timothy Castagne's cross, as they finally won away from home in the league after five successive defeats.\nWolves v Leicester as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nVisit our Wolves page\nGo straight to all the best Leicester City content\n\"We are growing nicely, but there is a long way to go,\" said Foxes manager Brendan Rodgers following his side's third win in five games after home victories against Nottingham Forest and Leeds earlier this month.\n\"Collectively, we were very, very good. We carried a threat, and defensively we were excellent. Our pressing has been very good and all the goals were fantastic.\n\"Confidence will grow and we'll get better. The concentration is better, everybody is focused, pressing at the right time and forcing teams into mistakes. Then we know we have the quality in the final third.\"\nThe win takes Leicester up from 20th to 16th, while Wolves drop a place to 19th and are only above bottom side Nottingham Forest on goal difference.\nWolves fans call for technical director to 'get out of our club'\nDuring the second half the home fans at Molineux showed their anger towards technical director Scott Sellars, with chants of \"We want Sellars out\" and \"Scott Sellars, get out of our club\".\nAnother chant was \"Sellars, make a sub\", but interim head coach Steve Davis rejected suggestions that Sellars, a former Leeds, Newcastle, Blackburn and Bolton winger, was having a say on tactics during a game.\n\"Scott does his job upstairs and we do our job downstairs,\" said Davis. \"I'm not on social media so that was the first time I heard something like that [from the fans].\n\"He is not involved in picking the team. We [Davis and coach James Collins] select how we play and we make the substitutions.\"\nThese are tough times for Wolves, who reached the Europa League quarter-finals in 2020, but sacked manager Bruno Lage earlier this month.\nTheir attempts to secure a replacement have not gone well. Former Spain manager Julen Lopetegui and ex-Watford manager Rob Edwards have been interviewed, while former boss Nuno Espirito Santo, who took them into Europe, was linked with a return. And on Thursday, QPR boss Michael Beale rejected them, preferring instead to stay with the Championship leaders.\nWolves chairman Jeff Shi then said lifelong Wolves fan Davis, in charge of coaching the club's under-18s before Lage was dismissed, would continue to be interim head coach \"until 2023\".\nDavis' side made a bright start in his fourth game in charge, but once again they could not convert their chances and their total of five goals in 12 games is the lowest in the division.\nCosta, Nunes, Hugo Bueno and Podence had shots saved or blocked and Joao Moutinho and Max Kilman narrowly missed the target on a frustrating day for the home fans.\n\"We're in a battle,\" added Davis. \"It's early in the season and it has to change. We can't be saying this beyond the World Cup, we need to be getting points.\n\"It's frustrating. Losing 4-0 at home is hard. I'm very disappointed for the fans and I feel their pain too.\"\nLeicester scored four excellent goals from five shots and only a late missed header from substitute Marc Albrighton meant they failed to end the match with a 100% conversion record.\nUnderstandably, Rodgers was delighted with a much needed three points.\n\"When we played the ball forward, we looked good and could have scored more goals,\" he added.\n\"We broke forward really well. Our objective was to get over the line. It is a Midlands derby so a great day for the supporters.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It could well be the last this ground sees of the American.\nFor Fulham, this represents another big feather in the cap.

Indeed, so outmanoeuvred were they in the first half that Potter was forced into a tactical reshuffle to bolster his struggling midfield after only 36 minutes, Mateo Kovacic coming on for Marc Cucurella.\nChelsea were grateful to goalkeeper Kepa in that period but they improved after the break - albeit they were still unable to force De Gea into any serious work, the one anxious moment for the visitors coming when Trevoh Chalobah's header glanced off the top of the bar.\nThe hosts ultimately could muster just two shots on target in a game that failed to live up to its billing - but there will be real disappointment that they could not close out the win after taking the lead so late.\nPotter was at least able to maintain his unbeaten record as Chelsea manager but it could have been so much more satisfying.\nMan Utd boss Ten Hag can be satisfied\nTen Hag will be happy with a point after coming close to leaving with nothing. When the dust settles, however, he will know this was a missed opportunity.\nRashford and Antony should each have done better when clean through and it looked like they would pay for their profligacy before the outstanding Casemiro's first goal for the club provided the sting in the tail.\nTen Hag would have been bitterly frustrated at McTominay's rash tangle with Broja to concede the penalty and it was no surprise that the Scotland midfielder embraced Casemiro in sheer relief at the end.\nUnited's manager has brought clear improvements to the team, who now press more effectively and play with more intensity.\nHe has also dealt firmly and strongly with Ronaldo's insubordination, leaving him out of the squad here to deliver a clear message clear that there will only be one man making the decisions at Old Trafford.\nHowever, United will worry about Varane, who collapsed with what looked like a muscle injury as he went to challenge Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\nThe defender's tearful reaction clearly suggests it is a problem that threatens his World Cup chances.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Jimenez is in Mexico's provisional squad for the World Cup and it remains to be seen if he will play in any of his club's three matches before the World Cup begins.\n\"It will open up doors for other players or maybe we will play in a different way,\" Davis added.\nCosta, 34, had become more of a threat as the game developed and forced David Raya into making a save with a shot from a tight angle, before being dismissed for the first time in the Premier League.\nHis clash with Mee on the edge of Brentford's box late in the game was referred to VAR and when referee Bobby Madley consulted the pitchside monitor, it felt inevitable that the ex-Chelsea forward would see a straight red card.\nLast week's 4-0 defeat by Leicester City had featured chants from sections of Wolves' Molineux support aimed at technical director Scott Sellars, who was later defended by interim head coach Steve Davis.\nVisit our Brentford page\nGo straight to the best Wolves content\nAnd their struggles in front of goal this season, with only five scored before kick-off, continued with substitute Joao Moutinho coming closest in the first half when his volley direct from a corner was deflected away by Mee.\nBut the Brentford centre-back's goal stung them into action, with Neves being picked out with a pass from the right from Nelson Semedo before he shot past a motionless Raya into the bottom corner\nBees held to sixth draw of season\nThe home side were tentative before the break, and like the visitors did not manage a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nToney, whose eight goals pre kick-off were more than Wolves' entire tally for the season so far, fluffed a chance when he slipped over in the area but Josh Dasilva was much closer with a fine curling shot that shaped just wide.\nThomas Frank's side were livelier from the start of the second half, and an exchange of passes from a corner then saw Bryan Mbeumo's cross brilliantly converted by Mee.\nRocked back by Neves' goal just 109 seconds later, they came closest to retaking the lead when Dasilva's on-target effort drew a vital block from Nathan Collins.\nAn unmarked Toney missed a header from close range with just under 10 minutes left, and after Mee had grappled with Costa the Bees could not take advantage of having an extra player and had to settle for their sixth draw of the league campaign.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I think I did a good job at the club and left it in a good place.\n\"Once the crowd were so engaged it was a difficult one for us. The scoreline is a painful one.\"\nKai Havertz nodded in Conor Gallagher's exquisite cross to give the visitors hope, but Pascal Gross capped a miserable afternoon for Potter and his players with a close-range finish after Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy parried Julio Enciso's shot into the German's path.\nReaction to Brighton v Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion content\nVisit our Chelsea page\n'We have to take responsibility'\nAfter emerging from the Amex Stadium tunnel to a chorus of boos, matters only got worse for Potter as his side produced a defensive horror show to gift Brighton a dream start.\nIn a chaotic opening, Trossard's calm finish put the home side in front after Thiago Silva - who had already produced two goalline clearances to deny the Seagulls - surrendered possession cheaply in his own half.\nLike Brighton's first, the hosts' second and third goals were entirely self-inflicted. Loftus-Cheek stuck out a knee to inadvertently steer Gallagher's flick-on into the net via the crossbar, before Estupinan's delivery was guided past his own keeper by the somewhat unfortunate Chalobah.\n\"We didn't recover,\" Potter said afterwards. \"We have to take responsibility a bit for the first half. We have had a lot of football but that's no excuse. We couldn't quite get to that level.\"\nChelsea did have chances of their own - Christian Pulisic firing wide from a promising position and Robert Sanchez tipping Gallagher's looping header over the crossbar - but Havertz's header early in the second half failed to spark a revival and Gross finished off an incisive counter-attack late on to rub salt into the visitors' wounds.\n\"Unfortunately we missed the pass or didn't execute it,\" the Chelsea boss continued. \"We didn't take our chances and they did.\n\"It's part of the process, You have to suffer and feel pain in order to grow and get better. Nobody said we're the finished article. We have to take the pain today and learn from it.\"\n'Our fans were the best player'\nA run of five games without a win since Potter's departure did not make pleasant pre-match reading for Seagulls supporters or their new coaching staff, but Chelsea were unable to cope with Brighton's high pressing in the early stages as De Zerbi's team threatened to run riot.\nOnly Glenn Murray and Neal Maupay have scored more Premier League goals for the Seagulls than in-form Trossard, whose early opener - his 25th in the league for the club - made him the first player to score a team's first five top-flight goals under a new manager.\nHad it not been for Silva's two last-ditch clearances and a close-range Moises Caicedo effort which struck the outside of the post, Brighton could have been even further ahead by half-time.\nTheir second-half display was more measured as Chelsea sought a route back into the game, but De Zerbi's side never looked like surrendering their healthy lead - even after Havertz's strike.\n\"We must continue to play this level of football,\" De Zerbi said afterwards. \"We have to think only about the level of performance.\n\"The atmosphere was fantastic. Our fans were the best player on the pitch and it is very nice to work in Brighton. I am proud for this.\"\nThe win is Brighton's first in the league over Chelsea, who had won 10 and drawn four of the teams' previous 14 meetings.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

VAR is there to deal with these things.\"\nWillian was twice denied by Pickford on what was his 265th Premier League appearance, the most for any Brazilian in the English top flight.\nAnd the Cottagers had two penalty shouts turned down either side of the break, while Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin had an effort ruled out for a clear offside.\nThe point moved last season's Championship winners back into seventh place, while Everton are 12th.\nFree-scoring Fulham kept at bay\nOnly Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham had scored more than Fulham's 22 goals in the Premier League going into this weekend's fixtures.\nManager Marco Silva, facing Everton for the first time since being sacked by them in December 2019, says Fulham's form is merely a continuation of the attacking philosophy he put in place as they rattled in 106 goals on their way to the Championship title last season.\nBut Pickford proved his rightful place as England's top stopper to keep Silva's free-scoring side at bay.\nHe produced three saves in quick succession in a breathless start to the game, tipping over Willian's shot on the turn and Mitrovic's looping header before palming away a curling long-range effort from Harrison Reed.\nEverton striker Calvert-Lewin, whose return to the side following injury was hoped would boost their tally of just 11 goals in 13 games, also helped keep Fulham out, producing a headed goalline clearance.\nWhen Fulham did manage to breach the Everton rear-guard, Tim Ream's free header from Andreas Pereira's centre bounced just wide of Pickford's far post.\nReferee John Brooks, backed up by brief VAR checks, ruled out two claims for Fulham penalties either side of the break - the first after James Tarkowski tangled with Bobby Decordova-Reid in the box, the second when Willian went down following a stretched challenge from Gueye.\nThe pace noticeably dropped as Everton's own forays up-field tailed off and, despite their endeavour, Fulham's run of scoring in every home game of the season came to an end.\nEverton's defensive display combined with toothless attack\nMitrovic provided the game's only flashpoint midway through the first half, triggering a furious reaction from the Everton manager on the touchline after his studs-up tackle connected with Gueye's right ankle.\nThe Serb claimed it was a genuine, if clumsy, attempt to win the ball, but Lampard felt it warranted a stronger punishment.\n\"Last year our midfielder Allan got a yellow, it was upgraded to red and he got a four-game ban. It was nowhere near as forceful as that one tonight. It was a red card and we haven't had those decisions this year,\" said the Everton boss.\nIt was an uncharacteristic moment in what was an otherwise good-spirited match that acted as a microcosm of all that has been good and bad in the Merseysiders' start to the season.\nA resolute defensive display was undermined by a toothless attack as Lampard's side failed to score for the 11th time in his 31 Premier League games in charge.\nCalvert-Lewin's third start after returning from injury looked to have given the visitors a fresh impetus early on.\nTop scorer Anthony Gordon's close-range shot was blocked by Antonee Robinson and Bernd Leno tipped over Demarai Gray's stinging drive from the edge of the box in the opening five minutes.\nGray also set up a good scoring chance for Calvert-Lewin, who just failed to connect properly with his superb low cross, while Tarkowski put a strong header straight at Leno.\nBut in the closing stages Lampard's side looked to be more than happy to take the point, moving on to next Saturday's visit of Leicester.\nReaction to Fulham v Everton & today's other Premier League matches\nVisit our Fulham page\nGo straight to the best Everton content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

In the end we deserved to win because we created chances.\"\nFollow reaction to Bournemouth v Spurs and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nSpurs answer some questions before important trip to Marseille\nTottenham remain third in the Premier League table after recovering to beat Bournemouth, yet lingering questions remain about the issues faced by Conte.\nWith almost an hour on the clock, it looked like a bad week for Spurs - who were beaten by Manchester United and Newcastle before a controversial draw against Sporting stopped them securing a place in the Champions League last 16 - would get even worse.\nDiscussion about whether the Italian's tactical style is stifling Spurs' attacking talent, and why they continue to start slowly, remain.\nBut his side, which featured seven changes with one eye on the trip to Marseille, certainly cannot be accused of not showing fight.\nSpurs dominated possession in the first half but lacked creativity as they barely tested Bournemouth's stand-in keeper Travers.\nThey were made to pay as Bournemouth took control but Sessegnon's strike, which came out of almost nowhere when he latched on to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's incisive pass, provided much-needed impetus.\nConte has talked about his team being short of belief and, with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min relatively well contained, Spurs were unable to create a lot from open play.\nEventually, it was set-pieces that provided the breakthrough and allowed Spurs to go to Marseille in higher spirits.\nO'Neil not worried despite third straight defeat\nThe mood around Bournemouth has been transformed by interim manager Gary O'Neil, who took over following the 9-0 defeat at Liverpool in August and immediately led the newly promoted Cherries to a six-game unbeaten run.\nProgress was stalled by back-to-back defeats at Southampton and West Ham, but it looked like O'Neil's side were going to get back on track against Spurs.\nFor large periods they coped well with what Spurs managed to throw at them.\nBut once Davies equalised after Travers was weak in coming off his line, the home defence suddenly looked uneasy in dealing with Spurs' set-pieces.\nTottenham's 19th corner of the game, deep into stoppage time, led to second-half substitute Bentancur heading at a Cherries defender before firing in the rebound.\n\"Conceding from set-pieces against a team like this is unforgivable,\" said Cherries defender Jordan Zemura, who took responsibility for not marking Davies tighter.\n\"It's something we need to sort out. We know we need to be better. It is a collective.\"\nDespite a third straight defeat, O'Neil - whose future is still unclear with the club's takeover by A\ufeffmerican businessman Bill Foley close to being completed - said he was not unduly worried.\n\"We've had some tough games, with this being the toughest,\" said O'Neil, who took over from Scott Parker following the heavy defeat at Anfield.\n\"There is a gulf between us [and Spurs] and we did everything we could to close that gap. We made it competitive and Spurs had to dig very deep.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Jimenez is in Mexico's provisional squad for the World Cup and it remains to be seen if he will play in any of his club's three matches before the World Cup begins.\n\"It will open up doors for other players or maybe we will play in a different way,\" Davis added.\nCosta, 34, had become more of a threat as the game developed and forced David Raya into making a save with a shot from a tight angle, before being dismissed for the first time in the Premier League.\nHis clash with Mee on the edge of Brentford's box late in the game was referred to VAR and when referee Bobby Madley consulted the pitchside monitor, it felt inevitable that the ex-Chelsea forward would see a straight red card.\nLast week's 4-0 defeat by Leicester City had featured chants from sections of Wolves' Molineux support aimed at technical director Scott Sellars, who was later defended by interim head coach Steve Davis.\nVisit our Brentford page\nGo straight to the best Wolves content\nAnd their struggles in front of goal this season, with only five scored before kick-off, continued with substitute Joao Moutinho coming closest in the first half when his volley direct from a corner was deflected away by Mee.\nBut the Brentford centre-back's goal stung them into action, with Neves being picked out with a pass from the right from Nelson Semedo before he shot past a motionless Raya into the bottom corner\nBees held to sixth draw of season\nThe home side were tentative before the break, and like the visitors did not manage a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nToney, whose eight goals pre kick-off were more than Wolves' entire tally for the season so far, fluffed a chance when he slipped over in the area but Josh Dasilva was much closer with a fine curling shot that shaped just wide.\nThomas Frank's side were livelier from the start of the second half, and an exchange of passes from a corner then saw Bryan Mbeumo's cross brilliantly converted by Mee.\nRocked back by Neves' goal just 109 seconds later, they came closest to retaking the lead when Dasilva's on-target effort drew a vital block from Nathan Collins.\nAn unmarked Toney missed a header from close range with just under 10 minutes left, and after Mee had grappled with Costa the Bees could not take advantage of having an extra player and had to settle for their sixth draw of the league campaign.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

VAR is there to deal with these things.\"\nWillian was twice denied by Pickford on what was his 265th Premier League appearance, the most for any Brazilian in the English top flight.\nAnd the Cottagers had two penalty shouts turned down either side of the break, while Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin had an effort ruled out for a clear offside.\nThe point moved last season's Championship winners back into seventh place, while Everton are 12th.\nFree-scoring Fulham kept at bay\nOnly Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham had scored more than Fulham's 22 goals in the Premier League going into this weekend's fixtures.\nManager Marco Silva, facing Everton for the first time since being sacked by them in December 2019, says Fulham's form is merely a continuation of the attacking philosophy he put in place as they rattled in 106 goals on their way to the Championship title last season.\nBut Pickford proved his rightful place as England's top stopper to keep Silva's free-scoring side at bay.\nHe produced three saves in quick succession in a breathless start to the game, tipping over Willian's shot on the turn and Mitrovic's looping header before palming away a curling long-range effort from Harrison Reed.\nEverton striker Calvert-Lewin, whose return to the side following injury was hoped would boost their tally of just 11 goals in 13 games, also helped keep Fulham out, producing a headed goalline clearance.\nWhen Fulham did manage to breach the Everton rear-guard, Tim Ream's free header from Andreas Pereira's centre bounced just wide of Pickford's far post.\nReferee John Brooks, backed up by brief VAR checks, ruled out two claims for Fulham penalties either side of the break - the first after James Tarkowski tangled with Bobby Decordova-Reid in the box, the second when Willian went down following a stretched challenge from Gueye.\nThe pace noticeably dropped as Everton's own forays up-field tailed off and, despite their endeavour, Fulham's run of scoring in every home game of the season came to an end.\nEverton's defensive display combined with toothless attack\nMitrovic provided the game's only flashpoint midway through the first half, triggering a furious reaction from the Everton manager on the touchline after his studs-up tackle connected with Gueye's right ankle.\nThe Serb claimed it was a genuine, if clumsy, attempt to win the ball, but Lampard felt it warranted a stronger punishment.\n\"Last year our midfielder Allan got a yellow, it was upgraded to red and he got a four-game ban. It was nowhere near as forceful as that one tonight. It was a red card and we haven't had those decisions this year,\" said the Everton boss.\nIt was an uncharacteristic moment in what was an otherwise good-spirited match that acted as a microcosm of all that has been good and bad in the Merseysiders' start to the season.\nA resolute defensive display was undermined by a toothless attack as Lampard's side failed to score for the 11th time in his 31 Premier League games in charge.\nCalvert-Lewin's third start after returning from injury looked to have given the visitors a fresh impetus early on.\nTop scorer Anthony Gordon's close-range shot was blocked by Antonee Robinson and Bernd Leno tipped over Demarai Gray's stinging drive from the edge of the box in the opening five minutes.\nGray also set up a good scoring chance for Calvert-Lewin, who just failed to connect properly with his superb low cross, while Tarkowski put a strong header straight at Leno.\nBut in the closing stages Lampard's side looked to be more than happy to take the point, moving on to next Saturday's visit of Leicester.\nReaction to Fulham v Everton & today's other Premier League matches\nVisit our Fulham page\nGo straight to the best Everton content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I think I did a good job at the club and left it in a good place.\n\"Once the crowd were so engaged it was a difficult one for us. The scoreline is a painful one.\"\nKai Havertz nodded in Conor Gallagher's exquisite cross to give the visitors hope, but Pascal Gross capped a miserable afternoon for Potter and his players with a close-range finish after Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy parried Julio Enciso's shot into the German's path.\nReaction to Brighton v Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion content\nVisit our Chelsea page\n'We have to take responsibility'\nAfter emerging from the Amex Stadium tunnel to a chorus of boos, matters only got worse for Potter as his side produced a defensive horror show to gift Brighton a dream start.\nIn a chaotic opening, Trossard's calm finish put the home side in front after Thiago Silva - who had already produced two goalline clearances to deny the Seagulls - surrendered possession cheaply in his own half.\nLike Brighton's first, the hosts' second and third goals were entirely self-inflicted. Loftus-Cheek stuck out a knee to inadvertently steer Gallagher's flick-on into the net via the crossbar, before Estupinan's delivery was guided past his own keeper by the somewhat unfortunate Chalobah.\n\"We didn't recover,\" Potter said afterwards. \"We have to take responsibility a bit for the first half. We have had a lot of football but that's no excuse. We couldn't quite get to that level.\"\nChelsea did have chances of their own - Christian Pulisic firing wide from a promising position and Robert Sanchez tipping Gallagher's looping header over the crossbar - but Havertz's header early in the second half failed to spark a revival and Gross finished off an incisive counter-attack late on to rub salt into the visitors' wounds.\n\"Unfortunately we missed the pass or didn't execute it,\" the Chelsea boss continued. \"We didn't take our chances and they did.\n\"It's part of the process, You have to suffer and feel pain in order to grow and get better. Nobody said we're the finished article. We have to take the pain today and learn from it.\"\n'Our fans were the best player'\nA run of five games without a win since Potter's departure did not make pleasant pre-match reading for Seagulls supporters or their new coaching staff, but Chelsea were unable to cope with Brighton's high pressing in the early stages as De Zerbi's team threatened to run riot.\nOnly Glenn Murray and Neal Maupay have scored more Premier League goals for the Seagulls than in-form Trossard, whose early opener - his 25th in the league for the club - made him the first player to score a team's first five top-flight goals under a new manager.\nHad it not been for Silva's two last-ditch clearances and a close-range Moises Caicedo effort which struck the outside of the post, Brighton could have been even further ahead by half-time.\nTheir second-half display was more measured as Chelsea sought a route back into the game, but De Zerbi's side never looked like surrendering their healthy lead - even after Havertz's strike.\n\"We must continue to play this level of football,\" De Zerbi said afterwards. \"We have to think only about the level of performance.\n\"The atmosphere was fantastic. Our fans were the best player on the pitch and it is very nice to work in Brighton.

The first was well saved by Saints goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu, while the second went inches wide.\n\"In the first half we were really good,\" Palace boss Patrick Vieira said. \"[We] played some good football, created chances but couldn't score. We should've gone into half-time with more goals and that is one of the sides of the game we have to improve.\"\nPalace have had to come from behind in all of their Premier League victories this season until this one, and had also held a record of one draw and one loss when leading at half-time.\nSouthampton continued to lose the ball in dangerous areas, with the majority of the game played in their own half.\nThe Eagles had a goal struck off when Michael Olise released Edouard and the French forward tucked away a simple finish but Olise was offside in the build-up.

I think we showed good character.\"\nInitially Spurs were flat as Bournemouth looked set to end a run of two successive defeats.\nWales international Kieffer Moore, making a rare start, swept the Cherries ahead following a flowing counter attack.\nHis second was more about guts than guile as he outmuscled Emerson Royal to meet Adam Smith's cross with a powerful header which went in off the bar.\nSpurs rarely threatened before Ryan Sessegnon narrowed the gap with a cool finish into the bottom corner.\nThat sparked a shift of momentum and Spurs levelled when home keeper Mark Travers made an unconvincing attempt at claiming a corner, allowing Ben Davies to head in from Ivan Perisic's delivery.\nSlicker, quicker passing saw Spurs continue to press and their improvement was rewarded when Bentancur reacted quickest to side-foot in from another set-piece.\nThe relieved celebrations at the full-time whistle, from both the Spurs players and the travelling support, illustrated the importance of a morale-boosting win.\n\"My feeling [when 2-0 down] was we still had the possibility to win this game,\" added Conte.\n\"When we suffered in the first half I told my players it is on us. I asked for more personality, more responsibility and more decisions.\n\"My players showed great character and great desire and didn't accept defeat. In the end we deserved to win because we created chances.\"\nFollow reaction to Bournemouth v Spurs and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nSpurs answer some questions before important trip to Marseille\nTottenham remain third in the Premier League table after recovering to beat Bournemouth, yet lingering questions remain about the issues faced by Conte.\nWith almost an hour on the clock, it looked like a bad week for Spurs - who were beaten by Manchester United and Newcastle before a controversial draw against Sporting stopped them securing a place in the Champions League last 16 - would get even worse.\nDiscussion about whether the Italian's tactical style is stifling Spurs' attacking talent, and why they continue to start slowly, remain.\nBut his side, which featured seven changes with one eye on the trip to Marseille, certainly cannot be accused of not showing fight.\nSpurs dominated possession in the first half but lacked creativity as they barely tested Bournemouth's stand-in keeper Travers.\nThey were made to pay as Bournemouth took control but Sessegnon's strike, which came out of almost nowhere when he latched on to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's incisive pass, provided much-needed impetus.\nConte has talked about his team being short of belief and, with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min relatively well contained, Spurs were unable to create a lot from open play.\nEventually, it was set-pieces that provided the breakthrough and allowed Spurs to go to Marseille in higher spirits.\nO'Neil not worried despite third straight defeat\nThe mood around Bournemouth has been transformed by interim manager Gary O'Neil, who took over following the 9-0 defeat at Liverpool in August and immediately led the newly promoted Cherries to a six-game unbeaten run.\nProgress was stalled by back-to-back defeats at Southampton and West Ham, but it looked like O'Neil's side were going to get back on track against Spurs.\nFor large periods they coped well with what Spurs managed to throw at them.\nBut once Davies equalised after Travers was weak in coming off his line, the home defence suddenly looked uneasy in dealing with Spurs' set-pieces.\nTottenham's 19th corner of the game, deep into stoppage time, led to second-half substitute Bentancur heading at a Cherries defender before firing in the rebound.\n\"Conceding from set-pieces against a team like this is unforgivable,\" said Cherries defender Jordan Zemura, who took responsibility for not marking Davies tighter.\n\"It's something we need to sort out. We know we need to be better. It is a collective.\"\nDespite a third straight defeat, O'Neil - whose future is still unclear with the club's takeover by A\ufeffmerican businessman Bill Foley close to being completed - said he was not unduly worried.\n\"We've had some tough games, with this being the toughest,\" said O'Neil, who took over from Scott Parker following the heavy defeat at Anfield.\n\"There is a gulf between us [and Spurs] and we did everything we could to close that gap. We made it competitive and Spurs had to dig very deep.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Instead the game took an unexpected turn just before the the half-hour mark when Joao Cancelo muscled Fulham forward Harry Wilson off the ball in the box.\nReferee Darren England pointed to the spot and showed Cancelo the red card, to the disbelief of Guardiola and his players, before Andreas Pereira sent Ederson the wrong way from the spot.\nThat was Fulham's first effort at goal and they rarely threatened afterwards either, even with the extra man, instead being content to sit deep and frustrate their hosts.\nIt initially appeared they would be successful, even when Haaland came off the bench in the second half after two games out injured.\nHaaland thought he had scored the winner when he headed home a Kevin de Bruyne cross with 15 minutes to go, but the home side's celebrations were cut short when VAR showed he was offside.\nCity's attacks grew increasingly frantic towards the end and Haaland got no closer to finding the net, until Antonee Robinson tripped De Bruyne inside the area in injury time.\nHaaland - who else? - stepped up to fire his penalty into the bottom corner, despite the best efforts of Bernd Leno, and spark wild celebrations from his team-mates, manager and in the stands.\nFollow Saturday's live Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nVisit our Fulham page\nHaaland comes off the bench to save the day\nCity have now won all seven of their home league games this season, but they have never left it as late as this to secure victory.\nTheir frustration at the way this game was panning out was demonstrated by Bernardo Silva's outburst at England before half-time when the referee failed to book Wilson for a foul - which earned Silva a booking instead.\nThe clamour for Haaland's introduction grew as the second half went on, with City dominating possession but failing to find a way through Fulham's massed defence.\nHaaland and Phil Foden were both introduced on their rescue mission in the 63rd minute but it appeared they would find it just as difficult to make the breakthrough.\nHaaland's first effort was an air-shot as he completely missed Ilkay Gundogan's knockdown and his second flew a mile wide, although in his defence he was at full stretch to reach a John Stones cross at the far post.\nHis disallowed goal appeared likely to be a part of the story of two points dropped for his side, but City kept coming forward and finally got their reward right at the end of the game.\nFulham will feel hard done by\nFulham came within seconds of claiming what would have been a draw that few people gave them a chance of getting at kick-off.\nTheir prospects had hardly been helped by a late ankle injury to top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, which ruled the Serb out of their squad.\nNot for the first time this season, however, Marco Silva's side exceeded expectations. Their penalty and Cancelo's red card were a huge help of course, but Silva stuck to the same plan to keep his team compact and hit City on the break even when it was 11 men vs 10.\nThe four-game unbeaten run that had taken the Cottagers up to seventh in the table is over, but the spirit and organisation that Silva's side showed in the second half bodes well for tests to come.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Both goals featured different elements of a goalscoring masterclass, the first with one touch and an instant finish, the second showing coolness and technique to make Dier pay for his error.\nLast season's joint Golden Boot winner had endured a slow start by his own high standards with only five goals during the first two months but now has 11 in his last 12 matches.\nBoss Jurgen Klopp said: \"Even in this slow start, Mo was involved in the most chances in Europe but we didn't take them or he didn't take them and it can happen for a striker, it is a completely normal phase.\n\"But everyone knows when you look back at his career, everybody will remember one of the best strikers you ever saw because the numbers will be absolutely insane.\n\"Tonight what pleased me the most is he scored the two goals and then he played like a real, real team player.\"\nLiverpool also rode their luck as those Perisic efforts hit the woodwork, and Trent Alexander-Arnold was fortunate to escape when Spurs appeals for a penalty were waved away after he appeared to push Ryan Sessegnon to the ground. They are still conceding too many chances.\nNunez was a tireless, constant threat, while Ibrahima Konate's return has added steel to a Liverpool defence that has been vulnerable at times this season. Goalkeeper Alisson was, as usual, reliability and excellence personified, and the reaction at the final whistle demonstrated just how important this win might be for Liverpool.\nSpurs pay for mistakes\nTottenham once again made life difficult for themselves by falling behind early when Liverpool took advantage of the wide open spaces on the home team's right flank, which had been exposed several times even before they went behind.\nIn the final reckoning, however, it was Dier's mistake that left them with a hill that was too steep to climb, even in a season when they have been comeback specialists.\nThis was not a Spurs side that only showed up in the second half, as has happened before this season, because they had responded well to Salah's early goal before Dier made his ill-advised attempt to head the ball back to keeper Hugo Lloris. Instead, he only diverted it off his shoulder and into the path of the unmarked Salah, with inevitable results.\nSpurs also had a clear case for a penalty, their frustration increasing when referee Andy Madley awarded a free-kick for an almost identical incident shortly afterwards.\nEven without the injured Son, Spurs dominated most of the second half but could not take advantage of the opportunities they created, with Dejan Kulusevski showing what they have been missing when he returned from injury to set up Kane's goal moments after coming on.\nSpurs showed plenty of heart and character, but ultimately paid the price for gifting Salah the goal that meant Liverpool were always able to stay just out of reach.\nManager Conte started his press conference by reopening old wounds after Klopp had criticised his style of football following their draw back at Anfield last season.\n\"Before I answer your question, Jurgen was happy for the way we played tonight? Yeah? No, because it was important to know his opinion,\" he said.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Liverpool: Mohamed Salah scores double in Reds win\nMohamed Salah struck twice in the first half as Liverpool secured their first away win in the Premier League this season with victory at Tottenham.\nLiverpool had lost their two previous league games to struggling Nottingham Forest and Leeds United, so manager Jurgen Klopp will be delighted with this win at Spurs, who are shaping up as rivals for a place in the top four.\nSalah was the inspiration, sweeping home a sharp left-foot finish from Darwin Nunez's pass after 11 minutes, then cashing in on Eric Dier's misplaced headed back-pass to double Liverpool's advantage with great composure five minutes before the break.\nSpurs, without the injured Son Heung-min, were never out of the game as Ivan Perisic hit the woodwork either side of half-time before Harry Kane pulled one back with 20 minutes remaining.\nBut they failed to complete one of the comebacks that have become their trademark this season.\nFollow reaction to Sunday's Premier League games\nLiverpool dig deep for victory\nLiverpool got their stuttering season back in some sort of shape with the Champions League win against Napoli in midweek to reach the last 16 once again, although in reality that match was little more than a dead rubber.\nThis victory, their first league away win of the season, carries greater significance because of the opposition and also the need to get their Premier League show back on the road after two damaging losses.\nSalah showed he is right back to his best after a slow start to the campaign. Both goals featured different elements of a goalscoring masterclass, the first with one touch and an instant finish, the second showing coolness and technique to make Dier pay for his error.\nLast season's joint Golden Boot winner had endured a slow start by his own high standards with only five goals during the first two months but now has 11 in his last 12 matches.\nBoss Jurgen Klopp said: \"Even in this slow start, Mo was involved in the most chances in Europe but we didn't take them or he didn't take them and it can happen for a striker, it is a completely normal phase.\n\"But everyone knows when you look back at his career, everybody will remember one of the best strikers you ever saw because the numbers will be absolutely insane.\n\"Tonight what pleased me the most is he scored the two goals and then he played like a real, real team player.\"\nLiverpool also rode their luck as those Perisic efforts hit the woodwork, and Trent Alexander-Arnold was fortunate to escape when Spurs appeals for a penalty were waved away after he appeared to push Ryan Sessegnon to the ground. They are still conceding too many chances.\nNunez was a tireless, constant threat, while Ibrahima Konate's return has added steel to a Liverpool defence that has been vulnerable at times this season. Goalkeeper Alisson was, as usual, reliability and excellence personified, and the reaction at the final whistle demonstrated just how important this win might be for Liverpool.\nSpurs pay for mistakes\nTottenham once again made life difficult for themselves by falling behind early when Liverpool took advantage of the wide open spaces on the home team's right flank, which had been exposed several times even before they went behind.\nIn the final reckoning, however, it was Dier's mistake that left them with a hill that was too steep to climb, even in a season when they have been comeback specialists.\nThis was not a Spurs side that only showed up in the second half, as has happened before this season, because they had responded well to Salah's early goal before Dier made his ill-advised attempt to head the ball back to keeper Hugo Lloris. Instead, he only diverted it off his shoulder and into the path of the unmarked Salah, with inevitable results.\nSpurs also had a clear case for a penalty, their frustration increasing when referee Andy Madley awarded a free-kick for an almost identical incident shortly afterwards.\nEven without the injured Son, Spurs dominated most of the second half but could not take advantage of the opportunities they created, with Dejan Kulusevski showing what they have been missing when he returned from injury to set up Kane's goal moments after coming on.\nSpurs showed plenty of heart and character, but ultimately paid the price for gifting Salah the goal that meant Liverpool were always able to stay just out of reach.\nManager Conte started his press conference by reopening old wounds after Klopp had criticised his style of football following their draw back at Anfield last season.\n\"Before I answer your question, Jurgen was happy for the way we played tonight? Yeah? No, because it was important to know his opinion,\" he said.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It makes life easier for a manager instead of living on the edge of your emotion,\" said the American after his eighth win in 25 Premier League games since taking over in late February.\n\"I feel like we never have simple victories.\"\nThe win at Liverpool helped create some breathing space for Marsch after a poor run of form - but the goodwill did not last and supporters made their feelings known as they trailed at the break.\nYet after Solanke made it 3-1, the home side scored three times in a remarkable spell which completely transformed the mood at Elland Road and lifted the Whites up to 12th in the table.\nTo eradicate mistakes, Marsch still has his work cut out but the character and determination of his players cannot be questioned.\nLeeds meet Tottenham next in the top flight on 12 November and Marsch's side can travel to London for their final game before the break for the World Cup with spirits high.\n'It's unacceptable'\nThese are worrying times for Bournemouth who are in desperate need of a lift after a fourth successive defeat.\nHaving lost 3-2 to Tottenham after blowing a 2-0 lead last weekend, they let another two-goal lead slip to lose again. The Cherries are the first side in Premier League history to suffer back-to-back defeats in the competition despite leading by two goals in both games.\nBournemouth were eighth in the table after a 2-1 home win over Leicester on 8 October but end the day down in 16th - one point above the relegation zone - after a defeat that will hurt badly.\nThere is frustration on and off the pitch. Bournemouth's prospective new owner, American businessman Bill Foley, is still awaiting Premier League approval to take over the club.\nOn the pitch, interim boss Gary O'Neil must find a way of stopping the alarming number of goals his side is letting in.\nThey have now conceded 32 in just 14 matches - and that's far too many if they want to steer clear of danger.\n\"You can't walk away from the game with no points having played like that, it's unacceptable,\" said O'Neil.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The only away win they had managed this season until now was at Oxford in the Carabao Cup.\nBut then Olise was the hero in the fourth minute of injury time with a fortuitous deflected goal. In one of those quirks of football, this was his first Premier League goal since netting in the last minute against the same opposition on New Year's Day - although that was a defeat.\nExtra frustrating for West Ham is the fact Antonio could have helped set up a winner - or take the ball to the corner - seconds earlier.\nEze had a few chances to score early on, forcing a save from Lukasz Fabianski with a free-kick and firing two shots wide, as well as dragging two shots wide.\nThis was probably his last chance to impress boss Gareth Southgate, who names his World Cup squad on Thursday.\nHe did well for the Eagles equaliser though, taking the ball off Thilo Kehrer, who struggled to control Craig Dawson's overhit pass, before feeding Zaha to score.\nThat was Zaha's first away goal at West Ham in nine attempts.\nHis goal was a welcome relief after Benrahma's opener against the run of play following Palace's good start. That one was set up by Lucas Paqueta on his return from a collarbone injury.\nDawson almost accidentally won the game for Palace as he blocked a cross with his keeper Fabianski doing well to keep it out.\nWest Ham did not create enough clear-cut chances after that to make it seven home wins in a row for the first time since 1999.\nIn fact, Palace keeper Vicente Guaita only made one save all day - to deny Kehrer in the second half.\nThey did think they were going to have a chance to win it when Antonio ran from halfway before feeling a slight bit of contact from Guehi's arm and going theatrically down.\nReferee Paul Tierney pointed to the spot, but realised his mistake when he saw the incident again on the screen.\nAnd then Olise struck from Zaha's pass.\nThis game came just three days after West Ham played in Romania in the Europa Conference League, a 3-0 win at FCSB, but with 11 changes made it would be hard to blame that for this performance.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

James Tarkowski and Idrissa Gueye both produced blocks to deny the former Norwich man in the first half, before he rattled the woodwork with an ingenious effort midway through the second half.\nHe did, however, set up both Leicester goals - the first of which was a contender for goal of the season from Tielemans. The Belgium international is out of contract next summer but Rodgers has said he will \"continue to work with\" the 25-year-old despite his uncertain future.\nJust as Everton appeared to be pushing for an equaliser, Barnes collected Maddison's lay-off before beating Pickford with a ferocious effort.\nAfter conceding 22 goals in their first eight league games of the campaign, Leicester have shipped just three in their previous six.\nCalvert-Lewin World Cup hopes in balance\nBefore the game, Frank Lampard had called on his Everton players to \"find consistency week-in, week-out\" after collecting four points from their past two games against Crystal Palace and Fulham.\nBut the Toffees boss will have been left bitterly disappointed with his team's disjointed showing against Leicester, who registered 15 shots in the first half alone.\nThe hosts were guilty of squandering possession on several occasions, while Calvert-Lewin struggled for service in a toothless first-half performance.\nAlex Iwobi, who flashed an early shot wide after Gueye had robbed Boubakary Soumare of the ball, released Calvert-Lewin in the opening minutes of the second half but the Everton striker shot straight at the onrushing Danny Ward.\nWhile Maddison was able to enhance his World Cup prospects, Calvert-Lewin's hopes of being included in Southgate's squad appear to be hanging in the balance after the 25-year-old's second-half injury.\nThe Sheffield-born frontman went down clutching the back of his left thigh before being replaced by Neal Maupay.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Instead the game took an unexpected turn just before the the half-hour mark when Joao Cancelo muscled Fulham forward Harry Wilson off the ball in the box.\nReferee Darren England pointed to the spot and showed Cancelo the red card, to the disbelief of Guardiola and his players, before Andreas Pereira sent Ederson the wrong way from the spot.\nThat was Fulham's first effort at goal and they rarely threatened afterwards either, even with the extra man, instead being content to sit deep and frustrate their hosts.\nIt initially appeared they would be successful, even when Haaland came off the bench in the second half after two games out injured.\nHaaland thought he had scored the winner when he headed home a Kevin de Bruyne cross with 15 minutes to go, but the home side's celebrations were cut short when VAR showed he was offside.\nCity's attacks grew increasingly frantic towards the end and Haaland got no closer to finding the net, until Antonee Robinson tripped De Bruyne inside the area in injury time.\nHaaland - who else? - stepped up to fire his penalty into the bottom corner, despite the best efforts of Bernd Leno, and spark wild celebrations from his team-mates, manager and in the stands.\nFollow Saturday's live Premier League action\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nVisit our Fulham page\nHaaland comes off the bench to save the day\nCity have now won all seven of their home league games this season, but they have never left it as late as this to secure victory.\nTheir frustration at the way this game was panning out was demonstrated by Bernardo Silva's outburst at England before half-time when the referee failed to book Wilson for a foul - which earned Silva a booking instead.\nThe clamour for Haaland's introduction grew as the second half went on, with City dominating possession but failing to find a way through Fulham's massed defence.\nHaaland and Phil Foden were both introduced on their rescue mission in the 63rd minute but it appeared they would find it just as difficult to make the breakthrough.\nHaaland's first effort was an air-shot as he completely missed Ilkay Gundogan's knockdown and his second flew a mile wide, although in his defence he was at full stretch to reach a John Stones cross at the far post.\nHis disallowed goal appeared likely to be a part of the story of two points dropped for his side, but City kept coming forward and finally got their reward right at the end of the game.\nFulham will feel hard done by\nFulham came within seconds of claiming what would have been a draw that few people gave them a chance of getting at kick-off.\nTheir prospects had hardly been helped by a late ankle injury to top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, which ruled the Serb out of their squad.\nNot for the first time this season, however, Marco Silva's side exceeded expectations. Their penalty and Cancelo's red card were a huge help of course, but Silva stuck to the same plan to keep his team compact and hit City on the break even when it was 11 men vs 10.\nThe four-game unbeaten run that had taken the Cottagers up to seventh in the table is over, but the spirit and organisation that Silva's side showed in the second half bodes well for tests to come.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It was a special day today.\"\nIt is very early into Emery's reign, but the victory moved Villa three points above the relegation zone and the talk from some of the fans coming out of the ground was not of avoiding the drop.\n\"We could get into Europe,\" said one optimistic supporter, while another added: \"Bring on Thursday\" - looking ahead to when Villa make the trip north to play Manchester United again, this time in the League Cup.\nEmery's 'dream' is to win a trophy with Villa\n'Unacceptable' Man Utd made 'stupid' decisions - Ten Hag\nThursday's cup game provides United with a quick opportunity to make amends, with a disappointed Erik ten Hag clearly expecting much more from his side.\nThere has been enough improvement under Ten Hag to suggest this was probably just an off day, but even having that was not acceptable for the Dutchman.\n\"They are humans, not robots, and sometimes it is the way it is, but it is not acceptable,\" he said. \"We have to be ready for every game and not give a game away.\"\nOne of the big talking points before the game was Ten Hag's decision to give Cristiano Ronaldo the captaincy less than three weeks after the forward walked out of Old Trafford after refusing to go on as a late substitute against Tottenham.\nAfter initially being dropped from the squad, the Portugal international has been gradually reintegrated, culminating in him taking the armband for the first time under Ten Hag on Sunday.\nIt was hard to judge Ronaldo's performance given the whole team were off the boil, and Ten Hag would not be drawn into assessing how the 37-year-old superstar did in any significant detail.\nInstead, he was critical of continuous attempts to find Ronaldo with crosses, something he said was not part of the gameplan.\n\"I think it was stupid to do that,\" Ten Hag said. \"We delivered some crosses in for too far. We have to bring in crosses in the right moment.\"\nHe added: \"It was collectively a bad performance.\"\nManchester United have been producing some good performances of late, and Ten Hag will be hoping that form returns when they swiftly renew acquaintances with Aston Villa on Thursday."

No-one could begrudge Brentford their celebrations.\nNo escape for Manchester City\nManchester City just crawled over the line against Fulham with a stoppage-time penalty from Haaland but there were no escape this time and they did not deserve one.\nCity started as if in a daze, conceding early chances, and they were still only half awake even after Toney headed Brentford in front.\nIt looked like they were back on track after Foden's leveller but for all their increased pressure there was none of their trademark fluency as they were frustrated by Brentford's defensive resilience and determination.\nIt could have been a lot worse but for keeper Ederson and it was hardly a huge shock when Brentford raided so deep into added time to take the points, City caught in disarray at the back as the Bees swept forward.\nThis is a result that dents City's hopes of retaining their title and sends them into the lengthy break for the World Cup on the worst possible note.\nGo straight to all the best Manchester City content\nVisit our Brentford page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I'm really happy to have this break [for the World Cup in Qatar] because we arrived today very tired, with a lot of stress. I think for sure we have to continue to improve.\"\nLeeds' misery was compounded when Tyler Adams was dismissed for a second bookable offence with three minutes remaining.\nThe victory consolidates Spurs' place in the top four, while Leeds drop two places to 14th.\nReaction to Tottenham v Leeds and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nVisit our Tottenham page\nGo straight to all the best Leeds United content\nSpurs edge rollercoaster contest\nConte suggested after Wednesday's Carabao Cup defeat by Nottingham Forest that Spurs' busy pre-World Cup schedule had taken its toll on his side, who had lost four of their previous seven matches in all competitions prior to Leeds' visit.\nSlow starts have become a theme in recent weeks and Saturday's game was no different, Summerville giving the visitors a deserved lead with only 10 minutes on the clock.\nBut the hosts soon started to cause Leeds problems - particularly down the right-hand side, where Pascal Struijk struggled to keep the impressive Kulusevski in check.\nKane's seventh goal in as many home league fixtures made it 1-1, only for Rodrigo to capitalise on some questionable Spurs defending from a corner to put the visitors back ahead.\nThe topsy-turvy pattern continued into the second half as Davies squeezed a long-range effort into the net, before Rodrigo's second of the game put Leeds within touching distance of a third straight league win.\nBut Tottenham rallied once again as Bentancur - who also scored Spurs' late winner at Bournemouth two weeks ago - netted his fourth and fifth goals of the campaign to send the home fans into ecstasy.\nSpurs have won 13 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other team.\n\"If we want to be competitive, conceding three goals is too much,\" Conte said. \"To go 1-0 down in every game is not positive. For this reason I want to see the positive side because my players showed great will and desire to win the three points.\"\nDefensive frailties prove Leeds' undoing\nHaving recovered from 3-1 down to defeat Bournemouth last weekend, Jesse Marsch's team were given a taste of their own medicine at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nThis was a game that showcased Leeds' technical qualities and defensive vulnerabilities in equal measure.\nThey could have been further ahead by the time Kane fired Spurs level for the first time in the match, Summerville having been denied by Lloris moments beforehand.\nWhile the England captain's strike was controversial - Leeds felt Meslier was fouled in the build-up to the goal - Kristensen and Meslier will be bitterly disappointed not to have kept out Davies' hopeful effort, particularly after the Leeds keeper had done well to deny Kane in the build-up.\nRodrigo's crisp finish into the far corner put Leeds on course for another memorable three points, but they let their advantage slip through their grasp yet again in the final minutes.\nAdams' clumsy, late challenge on Davinson Sanchez resulted in a second yellow card for the United States international as the Yorkshire club's recent resurgence shuddered to a halt.\n\"I'm gutted, I feel like someone has ripped my heart out,\" Marsch told BBC Match of the Day. \"I thought we had control of the match but then we let it slip.\n\"There's obviously positives in there because in our good moments we look like we have quality, but in our bad we still look vulnerable and naive.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Referee Craig Pawson could have stopped the game when Tarkowski went down holding his head in the lead-up to Bournemouth's second goal, while Cook was perhaps fortunate to only be booked for a lunge on Amadou Onana.\nHowever, Lampard can have few complaints with the result, with Bournemouth wasting a number of chances to make the scoreline even more painful for the Everton boss in the second half.\nBournemouth go into break on a high\nThis could have been O'Neil's last game in charge, with Bournemouth having held talks with Marcelo Bielsa about becoming Scott Parker's permanent successor.\nIf that proves the case, O'Neil will bow out on a high note after two quick-fire wins over the Toffees to end a run of four straight defeats, sending the supporters into the World Cup break in buoyant mood.\nTwo of those previous defeats - against Tottenham and Leeds - saw the Cherries concede two-goal leads, but they were never in any danger of conceding that advantage here, with a first clean sheet in eight games completing a perfect afternoon.\nThey could have added to their tally in the second half, but Solanke spurned two decent opportunities before having a goal disallowed for a marginal offside, while Philip Billing drilled just wide late on.\nAs well as a new manager, Bournemouth could have new owner when the Premier League resumes, with US businessman Bill Foley progressing with his takeover of the south coast club.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

You start to do that on the second game of the season because the competition is so big that you're always looking at other opponents. It's something that every team does.\"\nThere was more good news from the Arsenal camp as Arteta revealed Granit Xhaka's first-half exit was down to a sickness bug that affected the visitors before kick-off, rather than anything that would put the Switzerland player's World Cup in jeopardy.\nIn contrast, Wolves are now bottom as new manager Julen Lopetegui prepares to take charge.\nThe former Spain, Real Madrid and Sevilla boss was introduced 15 minutes before kick-off at Molineux and watched the game from the stands.\nHe saw a microcosm of Wolves' season given the hosts battled hard and produced some opportunities despite spending much of the game on the back foot, but were undone by a lack of goal threat as they failed to score for the eighth time in 15 top-flight games.\nReaction from Wolves v Arsenal and all of Saturday's other Premier League games\nVisit our Wolves page\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nOdegaard could be Arsenal's title key\nTwelve victories and 37 points represents Arsenal's best record 14 games into a season.\nThey do still have to play defending champions City as their first planned league game against them was called off last month to allow the Gunners to get up to date with their Europa League programme.\nThey also have to face an in-form Newcastle, but they have met all the rest of their 'big six' rivals and look very much the real deal.\nOdegaard in particular has proved an inspired choice as captain by Mikel Arteta.\nThe 23-year-old Norwegian goes about his work in a quietly effective way, clean in his passing and astute in terms of his positioning, which given his central role is essential.\nHe is a goal threat too. His first was a poacher's effort as he evaded the attentions of Wolves defenders despite his proximity to the home goal. His second involved superb first-touch control as the ball ran out to him, then a precise finish.\nMuch has been made of Erling Haaland's likely impact for City after the World Cup, given Norway's absence means he will be resting when so many influential players are in Qatar. The same is also true of Odegaard.\nLopetegui's scoring problem\nAs no Premier League season has reached Christmas Day with so few fixtures played, comparisons to previous years must come with an asterisk.\nAnd before Arsenal's supporters get too excited, it is 1947 since they were top and went on to become champions, which now has to be the aim.\nAt the other end, only three clubs in the Premier League era have escaped the drop after being at the foot of the table.\nIf there is a shining light at the end of that particular tunnel for Wolves, the last team to do it were Leicester, who went on to become champions the following season.\nChairman Jeff Shi has less lofty aims judging by his programme notes, where he admitted he doesn't 'expect to start winning straight away', which is a novel approach.\nThere has been no word from Wolves about Lopetegui's contract but it would be a major surprise if it did not contain an escape clause on both sides at the end of the season should the managerial change fail to work as hoped.\nNo manager can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear though. And while Adama Traore's pace caused Arsenal problems and Goncalo Guedes produced one of his more effective displays, Wolves did not find the net.\nThey have scored only eight times in the league this season, by far the worst return in the top flight.\nDiego Costa will be back after suspension once domestic combat resumes following Qatar 2022, although whether that will be enough to save Wolves is debatable.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

I'm excited by what can be, while respecting the quality of the league.\n\"We haven't thought about any permutation or any consequence of the games. We've just tried to win them and I think that's the best way for us to attack the second half of the season as well.\"\nNewcastle already built for European challenge\nThis was a match that once again underlined the rapid progress made by Howe's side in the 13 months since the club's takeover, and the team celebrated with their fans at the final whistle following a robust end to the game, when some steaming challenges were exchanged.\nThose confrontations continued after full-time with an altercation between Dan Burn and Kai Havertz, and angry Chelsea players maintained their arguments as they departed the field.\nBut after a lap of the pitch, the Newcastle players headed down the tunnel with huge smiles on their faces after a win that could make their fans dream of a European campaign next season, maybe even in the Champions League.\nFor long periods, they showed greater fluency than their opponents, perhaps in keeping with a more consistent team selection than Chelsea, and the result of having Bruno Guimaraes in the fulcrum of their midfield.\nBut with Chris Wood starting in place of Wilson up front, Newcastle failed to truly test Chelsea before the break, with top scorer Almiron flashing a volley over and Gallagher blocking a Dan Burn shot. They also had a penalty appeal waved away by referee Robert Jones after the ball struck Trevoh Chalobah.\nThe hosts should have taken the lead shortly after half-time when Almiron's cross was nodded back by Joelinton, with Longstaff having his effort saved by Mendy and then firing over.\nBut another dart from Paraguayan Almiron, who has scored seven goals in seven games, helped set up Willock's curling strike to send St James' Park into raptures.\nFor two teams that have recently gone through takeovers, perhaps it is no surprise that Newcastle seem more advanced than Chelsea given they are six months further into their new-found status.\nThe new owners have preached that their evolution will take time, but the result, performance and feeling around the ground on Saturday suggested Howe's side are already built to challenge the Premier League hierarchy.\nChelsea's season unravelling\nWhile Newcastle fans basked in the glory of a 10-game unbeaten run as they headed home, Chelsea supporters will wonder what is becoming of their side as they suffered a third consecutive loss in all competitions, excluding penalty shootout defeats, for the first time since 2002.\nPotter admitted afterwards that \"a lot of learning had happened\" since he was appointed two months ago.\nThere was plenty of effort from the visitors, but once again an unpredictable Potter team selection looked disjointed, with their injury situation summed up by three players performing at right wing-back at different points during the game.\nThere was little they could do about Ruben Loftus-Cheek's early injury, but after Cesar Azpilicueta was withdrawn at half-time, Gallagher slotted into the position - and came closest to scoring for Chelsea.\nPotter's side also included Lewis Hall, making his Premier League debut at left wing-back, and had Almiron for company. But the 18-year-old still had chances to attack in support of Gallagher, Mason Mount and Armando Broja further forward.\nHe set up Broja for a shot that failed to test Pope in the Newcastle goal, and played a part in another attack, where Sven Botman headed away as Broja almost connected with Mount's cross.\nChelsea had Thiago Silva to thank for steering them through the first half after the Brazilian replaced Loftus-Cheek early on, but Newcastle's second-half pressure finally told.\nPulisic was one of the few bright sparks and his running helped the visitors pin back Newcastle, but their desperation in search of an equaliser led to the unsavoury scenes at the end and pointed to an unhappy Chelsea camp with further questions for Potter.\nThe Blues boss said the club had experienced an \"incredibly challenging period\" with a busy run of games and injuries to key players.\n\"It's not nice to not get results, it's as simple as that,\" he said. \"But I have to look at why that is and the situation that we've had to deal with. It hasn't been straightforward at all.\"\nAsked if the break came at a good time, he added: \"We have to see it that way. We have to use it as a positive and as I said we'll have a couple of players back, we need time to refocus, reflect and get ready for the second half of the season.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

You start to do that on the second game of the season because the competition is so big that you're always looking at other opponents. It's something that every team does.\"\nThere was more good news from the Arsenal camp as Arteta revealed Granit Xhaka's first-half exit was down to a sickness bug that affected the visitors before kick-off, rather than anything that would put the Switzerland player's World Cup in jeopardy.\nIn contrast, Wolves are now bottom as new manager Julen Lopetegui prepares to take charge.\nThe former Spain, Real Madrid and Sevilla boss was introduced 15 minutes before kick-off at Molineux and watched the game from the stands.\nHe saw a microcosm of Wolves' season given the hosts battled hard and produced some opportunities despite spending much of the game on the back foot, but were undone by a lack of goal threat as they failed to score for the eighth time in 15 top-flight games.\nReaction from Wolves v Arsenal and all of Saturday's other Premier League games\nVisit our Wolves page\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nOdegaard could be Arsenal's title key\nTwelve victories and 37 points represents Arsenal's best record 14 games into a season.\nThey do still have to play defending champions City as their first planned league game against them was called off last month to allow the Gunners to get up to date with their Europa League programme.\nThey also have to face an in-form Newcastle, but they have met all the rest of their 'big six' rivals and look very much the real deal.\nOdegaard in particular has proved an inspired choice as captain by Mikel Arteta.\nThe 23-year-old Norwegian goes about his work in a quietly effective way, clean in his passing and astute in terms of his positioning, which given his central role is essential.\nHe is a goal threat too. His first was a poacher's effort as he evaded the attentions of Wolves defenders despite his proximity to the home goal. His second involved superb first-touch control as the ball ran out to him, then a precise finish.\nMuch has been made of Erling Haaland's likely impact for City after the World Cup, given Norway's absence means he will be resting when so many influential players are in Qatar. The same is also true of Odegaard.\nLopetegui's scoring problem\nAs no Premier League season has reached Christmas Day with so few fixtures played, comparisons to previous years must come with an asterisk.\nAnd before Arsenal's supporters get too excited, it is 1947 since they were top and went on to become champions, which now has to be the aim.\nAt the other end, only three clubs in the Premier League era have escaped the drop after being at the foot of the table.\nIf there is a shining light at the end of that particular tunnel for Wolves, the last team to do it were Leicester, who went on to become champions the following season.\nChairman Jeff Shi has less lofty aims judging by his programme notes, where he admitted he doesn't 'expect to start winning straight away', which is a novel approach.\nThere has been no word from Wolves about Lopetegui's contract but it would be a major surprise if it did not contain an escape clause on both sides at the end of the season should the managerial change fail to work as hoped.\nNo manager can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear though. And while Adama Traore's pace caused Arsenal problems and Goncalo Guedes produced one of his more effective displays, Wolves did not find the net.\nThey have scored only eight times in the league this season, by far the worst return in the top flight.\nDiego Costa will be back after suspension once domestic combat resumes following Qatar 2022, although whether that will be enough to save Wolves is debatable.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He's OK.\"\nWest Ham were more involved in the game after Maddison's departure but Craig Dawson gave away a penalty which was well saved by Lukasz Fabianski from Youri Tielemans' low drive.\nBut Harvey Barnes finished off a lovely counter-attacking move when he slotted past Fabianksi to seal a third consecutive away win for the Foxes.\nHaving won six games at home in the Premier League West Ham have now lost their last two on the spin at London Stadium, suffering defeat last weekend after conceding a last-minute goal to Crystal Palace.\nMoyes being under pressure is nonsense - Rice\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action and reaction\nBrendan Rodgers plays down James Maddison injury worries\nLeicester earn third consecutive win on the road\nBoth West Ham and Leicester came into the game completely evenly matched with four wins, two draws and eight losses.\nLeicester, who have not conceded a goal in their last three away wins, got off to a fast start having beaten Newport in the Carabao Cup earlier this week.\nBarnes drove forward and did well to keep the ball in play, his cut-back to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall shifted along to Patson Daka, who miscued his kick but which turned into the perfect tee-up for Maddison to hammer it into the roof of the net from 10 yards.\nThat strike took Maddison (40) past Riyad Mahrez (39) in Leicester's leading Premier League goalscorers, behind only forward Jamie Vardy (134).\nThe visitors had a terrific effort from range when Daniel Amartey ambled through the middle of the pitch and hit a rocket from 20 yards out, forcing a big save from Fabianski before Tielemans' penalty miss.\nThe second half brought wholesale changes for Brendan Rodgers' side as they looked to see the game off and substitute Ayoze Perez set up Barnes, who has scored in all five of Leicester's victories this season, to slide home.\nThe Foxes defended resolutely and were ultimately more efficient with their chances, and have now won four of their last five Premier League games after winning just one of their first 10 this season.\nVisit our Leicester City page\nGo straight to all the best West Ham content\nWest Ham's form dips before break\nFollowing their surprise loss to Blackburn on penalties in the Carabao Cup, West Ham started the game tentatively and were forced into an early substitution when Kurt Zouma, who had pulled up in the warm-up but still started, was unable to continue and was replaced by Nayef Aguerd, making his Premier League debut.\nFollowing Maddison's departure, West Ham improved as Jarrod Bowen saw his shot from range deflected over the bar and Lucas Paqueta headed wide after hammering a shot over from outside the area.\nTomas Soucek had the ball in the back of the net from Bowen's cut-back but it was overruled for an offside.\nThe Hammers were just finding their feet in the game when referee Jarred Gillett was advised to go to the monitor after Dawson clattered into Daka, as the Zambian tried to shift the ball onto his left foot.\nBut Tielemans' resulting penalty was poor and well saved by Fabianski to keep the difference to one.\nThe Hammers had 10 attempts to Leicester's four in the second half, with one coming when Declan Rice made a decisive run from his own half and played wide to Thilo Kehrer, who sent a teasing ball across the six-yard box but Gianluca Scamacca couldn't finish the move.\nWest Ham weren't clinical enough with the chances they had and that, coupled with Leicester's superb defensive performance, culminated in David Moyes' side's ninth loss of the season before the Premier League breaks for the World Cup.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

I'm excited by what can be, while respecting the quality of the league.\n\"We haven't thought about any permutation or any consequence of the games. We've just tried to win them and I think that's the best way for us to attack the second half of the season as well.\"\nNewcastle already built for European challenge\nThis was a match that once again underlined the rapid progress made by Howe's side in the 13 months since the club's takeover, and the team celebrated with their fans at the final whistle following a robust end to the game, when some steaming challenges were exchanged.\nThose confrontations continued after full-time with an altercation between Dan Burn and Kai Havertz, and angry Chelsea players maintained their arguments as they departed the field.\nBut after a lap of the pitch, the Newcastle players headed down the tunnel with huge smiles on their faces after a win that could make their fans dream of a European campaign next season, maybe even in the Champions League.\nFor long periods, they showed greater fluency than their opponents, perhaps in keeping with a more consistent team selection than Chelsea, and the result of having Bruno Guimaraes in the fulcrum of their midfield.\nBut with Chris Wood starting in place of Wilson up front, Newcastle failed to truly test Chelsea before the break, with top scorer Almiron flashing a volley over and Gallagher blocking a Dan Burn shot. They also had a penalty appeal waved away by referee Robert Jones after the ball struck Trevoh Chalobah.\nThe hosts should have taken the lead shortly after half-time when Almiron's cross was nodded back by Joelinton, with Longstaff having his effort saved by Mendy and then firing over.\nBut another dart from Paraguayan Almiron, who has scored seven goals in seven games, helped set up Willock's curling strike to send St James' Park into raptures.\nFor two teams that have recently gone through takeovers, perhaps it is no surprise that Newcastle seem more advanced than Chelsea given they are six months further into their new-found status.\nThe new owners have preached that their evolution will take time, but the result, performance and feeling around the ground on Saturday suggested Howe's side are already built to challenge the Premier League hierarchy.\nChelsea's season unravelling\nWhile Newcastle fans basked in the glory of a 10-game unbeaten run as they headed home, Chelsea supporters will wonder what is becoming of their side as they suffered a third consecutive loss in all competitions, excluding penalty shootout defeats, for the first time since 2002.\nPotter admitted afterwards that \"a lot of learning had happened\" since he was appointed two months ago.\nThere was plenty of effort from the visitors, but once again an unpredictable Potter team selection looked disjointed, with their injury situation summed up by three players performing at right wing-back at different points during the game.\nThere was little they could do about Ruben Loftus-Cheek's early injury, but after Cesar Azpilicueta was withdrawn at half-time, Gallagher slotted into the position - and came closest to scoring for Chelsea.\nPotter's side also included Lewis Hall, making his Premier League debut at left wing-back, and had Almiron for company. But the 18-year-old still had chances to attack in support of Gallagher, Mason Mount and Armando Broja further forward.\nHe set up Broja for a shot that failed to test Pope in the Newcastle goal, and played a part in another attack, where Sven Botman headed away as Broja almost connected with Mount's cross.\nChelsea had Thiago Silva to thank for steering them through the first half after the Brazilian replaced Loftus-Cheek early on, but Newcastle's second-half pressure finally told.\nPulisic was one of the few bright sparks and his running helped the visitors pin back Newcastle, but their desperation in search of an equaliser led to the unsavoury scenes at the end and pointed to an unhappy Chelsea camp with further questions for Potter.\nThe Blues boss said the club had experienced an \"incredibly challenging period\" with a busy run of games and injuries to key players.\n\"It's not nice to not get results, it's as simple as that,\" he said. \"But I have to look at why that is and the situation that we've had to deal with. It hasn't been straightforward at all.\"\nAsked if the break came at a good time, he added: \"We have to see it that way. We have to use it as a positive and as I said we'll have a couple of players back, we need time to refocus, reflect and get ready for the second half of the season.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Referee Craig Pawson could have stopped the game when Tarkowski went down holding his head in the lead-up to Bournemouth's second goal, while Cook was perhaps fortunate to only be booked for a lunge on Amadou Onana.\nHowever, Lampard can have few complaints with the result, with Bournemouth wasting a number of chances to make the scoreline even more painful for the Everton boss in the second half.\nBournemouth go into break on a high\nThis could have been O'Neil's last game in charge, with Bournemouth having held talks with Marcelo Bielsa about becoming Scott Parker's permanent successor.\nIf that proves the case, O'Neil will bow out on a high note after two quick-fire wins over the Toffees to end a run of four straight defeats, sending the supporters into the World Cup break in buoyant mood.\nTwo of those previous defeats - against Tottenham and Leeds - saw the Cherries concede two-goal leads, but they were never in any danger of conceding that advantage here, with a first clean sheet in eight games completing a perfect afternoon.\nThey could have added to their tally in the second half, but Solanke spurned two decent opportunities before having a goal disallowed for a marginal offside, while Philip Billing drilled just wide late on.\nAs well as a new manager, Bournemouth could have new owner when the Premier League resumes, with US businessman Bill Foley progressing with his takeover of the south coast club.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Gabriel Martinelli put the hosts ahead, catching out West Ham's former Gunners keeper Lukasz Fabianski by tucking inside the near post from a tight angle when he seemed more likely to cross.\nThe points were sealed when Eddie Nketiah - starting in place of the injured Gabriel Jesus - spun sharply in the box before firing into the opposite bottom corner.\nArsenal extended their lead at the top over Newcastle, who moved second by beating Leicester earlier on Monday.\nReigning champions Manchester City - who go to Leeds United on Wednesday - are now eight points behind the Gunners.\nWest Ham are 16th and just a point above the relegation zone after their fourth league defeat in a row.\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nVisit our West Ham page\nArsenal show progression on Arteta anniversary\nArsenal fans are starting to believe Arteta's side can genuinely maintain their push for the club's first title since Wenger's Invincibles in 2004.\nAnd as Wenger watched and heard his name lovingly sang by the home crowd, Arteta's young team added further encouragement to those dreaming of a long-awaited triumph.\n\"It is a really special day because Boxing Day is a beautiful day to play football and I thought the performance was at the level today that we deserve,\" said Arteta.\n\"Hopefully he [Wenger] will like it.\"\nThe match came on the third anniversary of Arteta's first game as Arsenal manager, and significant progress has been made since then.\nWhen the former Gunners midfielder took over, they were closer to the relegation zone than the top four.\nTheir current position - and mood around the club - is a measure of how they have come.\nThe Spaniard has built a new team in the past three years which bears little resemblance - in style and substance - to the one picked for his first game at Bournemouth in 2019.\nArteta will not be getting carried after this win over West Ham, especially with several significant fixtures - not least against Manchester City on 15 February - on the horizon.\nBut the Gunners sent a message with a clinical second-half performance and the omens are also in their favour.\nThe team who topped the Premier League table on Christmas Day have gone on to be champions in 10 of the past 13 seasons.\nNketiah takes chance as West Ham struggle in front of goal\nOne of the key questions as the Premier League returned was how the Gunners would cope without key striker Jesus.\nThe Brazil international had knee surgery after being injured in Qatar and is expected to be out until late February, fuelling talk the Gunners might need to sign some cover.\nBut against West Ham, a first Premier League start of the season was handed to Nketiah - and the 23-year-old delivered.\nAfter stretching the Hammers defence and creating space with his sharp movement, he capped an impressive all-round performance with a fierce finish and staked his claim to be Jesus' replacement.\n\"Gabby will be a big miss but we all believe in Eddie,\" Saka told Amazon Prime. \"That's all he needs, us to keep supporting him and we will keep encouraging him.\n\"Everyone in the team is chipping in [with goals] and everyone will be important.\"\nIn contrast to the leaders, West Ham are struggling in front of goal.\nThey have been better than their league position suggests, according to their expected goals statistics, with converting chances being their main problem.\nFew opportunities came against Arsenal, although the game might have panned out differently had Michail Antonio not been denied by Aaron Ramsdale shortly after the restart at 1-0.\nHammers manager David Moyes said before the match he has not been feeling pressure because of results, instead urging for perspective and togetherness across the club.\nBut a fourth straight league defeat leaves West Ham as one of the cluster of teams packed tightly together in the bottom half.\n\"I don't think we're in a relegation fight. Every team has a blip when it isn't plain sailing and results don't go your way,\" said midfielder Declan Rice.\n\"It's down to me as captain to keep everyone going and pushing. We still believe we are a top team. But we need to start showing that.

created by a couple of sublime passes from full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson - gave them the perfect start on their league return.\nDarwin Nunez's wastefulness prevented the visitors from extending their lead but they were able to add a second before half-time when Van Dijk's shot deflected in off Ezri Konsa following a corner.\nOllie Watkins and Leon Bailey had both squandered a couple of fine opportunities for Villa in an exciting first half but Unai Emery's side were rewarded for their persistence after the restart when Watkins headed in Douglas Luiz's cross.\nHowever, Spanish 18-year-old Bajcetic's first senior goal two minutes after coming on as a substitute, which followed great work by Nunez to sprint for a ball over the top, ended home hopes of a dramatic fightback at Villa Park.\nStefan Bajcetic - the 'cheeky' teenager and his 'Christmas story'\nLiverpool up and running in top-four bid\nWhile Jurgen Klopp said he was pleased that his sixth-placed side would resume their campaign \"within punching distance\" of the Premier League's top four, he added prior to kick-off that he felt it was a \"long arm still\" following their early season struggles.\nBut, with a game in hand on fourth-placed Tottenham, the Liverpool boss must now feel confident of attaining their target in the second half of the campaign.\nThe Reds' cause had received an early boost when Spurs drew with Brentford earlier in the day and their first-half double put them in position to take full advantage.\nRobertson's crucial role in the opener - setting up Salah with a first-time ball across the six-yard box after Alexander-Arnold's stunning outside-of-the-foot pass - saw him overtake Leighton Baines as the defender with the most assists in the competition's history (54).\nDespite appearing comfortable at half-time it was certainly not job done for Liverpool against determined opposition and they were relieved to add a late third after withstanding spells of intense Villa pressure following Watkins' lifeline.\nKlopp's side dropped 20 points from their opening 14 fixtures - two shy of the total number of points they let slip in the whole of the last campaign - but there are now signs of momentum for last season's runners-up.\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nNunez shows worth despite misses\nThere may not have been a goal for Nunez to celebrate at Villa Park but the Uruguayan demonstrated flashes of the promise that convinced Liverpool to pay big money to sign him from Benfica in the summer.\nThere is certainly no doubt that he should have added to his tally of nine goals in 20 games for the club here - and on another occasion such misses could prove costly.\nThe tenacious 23-year-old ended the match with the highest expected goals value of any player (1.15 xG) after landing four of his six shots on target - five of which were taken inside the penalty area.\nBut his 12 touches inside the opposition box - also a match-leading figure - hinted at his broader influence and his unpredictable movements caused huge issues for the Villa defence throughout.\nPerhaps the clearest demonstration of his importance arrived in the build-up to Liverpool's third.\nWith the match inside the final 10 minutes, Nunez refused to give up the chase and cut the ball back from the byeline to allow substitute Bajcetic to all but seal the three points and avoid a potentially awkward finish.\nPositive signs for Emery's Villa\nDespite defeat, there remains much for Aston Villa supporters to be optimistic about with the Emery era only just beginning.\nThe four-time Europa League winner was bidding to become the first Villa manager to win each of his first three league games in the club's history and he will believe his side's positive approach deserved more.\nWatkins had already been denied by Alisson prior to Liverpool's first and later passed up an opportunity from John McGinn's back-post cross, while twice an off-balance Bailey failed to connect with the ball when well-placed.\nThis was another positive showing and they remain five points clear of the relegation positions following encouraging pre-World Cup victories over Manchester United and Brighton.\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

However, there was a potential handball which needed to be checked. Once those replays had been studied, it became apparent Willy Boly had actually diverted the ball home.\nAs it turned out, Yates didn't handle.

Grealish was especially wasteful, drawing derision from a home crowd already hostile towards him with three misses, all of which a player of his class should convert.\nHowever, after Rodri had broken the deadlock at the end of an incisive break just before half-time, Haaland and Grealish stepped up in emphatic fashion.\nThe latter won a ball high up and laid a goal on a plate for the latter before again providing the assists for another simple finish soon after. The two moments secured the points, despite Struijk's provision of a late moment of hope for the home side.\nIt was further evidence of Haaland's threat. He can drift through much of a game, but he needs only a fraction of a yard on a defender or the slightest sight of goal to hurt opponents.\nIn the end, Leeds were let off the hook somewhat, with the Norwegian missing a number of opportunities to register what would have been a fourth league hat-trick of what is shaping up to be a remarkable season.\nAfter the full-time whistle, he shared a hug and chat with Leeds boss Jesse Marsch and defender Rasmus Kristensen - former Red Bull Salzburg colleagues - while the home fans serenaded him chants of \"you're Leeds and you know you are\".\nIf he was taking a moment to bask in the surroundings, it was only a brief one. He and City have just three days to prepare for the visit of Everton on New Year's Eve.

Grealish was especially wasteful, drawing derision from a home crowd already hostile towards him with three misses, all of which a player of his class should convert.\nHowever, after Rodri had broken the deadlock at the end of an incisive break just before half-time, Haaland and Grealish stepped up in emphatic fashion.\nThe latter won a ball high up and laid a goal on a plate for the latter before again providing the assists for another simple finish soon after. The two moments secured the points, despite Struijk's provision of a late moment of hope for the home side.\nIt was further evidence of Haaland's threat. He can drift through much of a game, but he needs only a fraction of a yard on a defender or the slightest sight of goal to hurt opponents.\nIn the end, Leeds were let off the hook somewhat, with the Norwegian missing a number of opportunities to register what would have been a fourth league hat-trick of what is shaping up to be a remarkable season.\nAfter the full-time whistle, he shared a hug and chat with Leeds boss Jesse Marsch and defender Rasmus Kristensen - former Red Bull Salzburg colleagues - while the home fans serenaded him chants of \"you're Leeds and you know you are\".\nIf he was taking a moment to bask in the surroundings, it was only a brief one. He and City have just three days to prepare for the visit of Everton on New Year's Eve. A victory then will put the heat back on Arsenal, who play the same evening against Brighton.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Gabriel Martinelli put the hosts ahead, catching out West Ham's former Gunners keeper Lukasz Fabianski by tucking inside the near post from a tight angle when he seemed more likely to cross.\nThe points were sealed when Eddie Nketiah - starting in place of the injured Gabriel Jesus - spun sharply in the box before firing into the opposite bottom corner.\nArsenal extended their lead at the top over Newcastle, who moved second by beating Leicester earlier on Monday.\nReigning champions Manchester City - who go to Leeds United on Wednesday - are now eight points behind the Gunners.\nWest Ham are 16th and just a point above the relegation zone after their fourth league defeat in a row.\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nVisit our West Ham page\nArsenal show progression on Arteta anniversary\nArsenal fans are starting to believe Arteta's side can genuinely maintain their push for the club's first title since Wenger's Invincibles in 2004.\nAnd as Wenger watched and heard his name lovingly sang by the home crowd, Arteta's young team added further encouragement to those dreaming of a long-awaited triumph.\n\"It is a really special day because Boxing Day is a beautiful day to play football and I thought the performance was at the level today that we deserve,\" said Arteta.\n\"Hopefully he [Wenger] will like it.\"\nThe match came on the third anniversary of Arteta's first game as Arsenal manager, and significant progress has been made since then.\nWhen the former Gunners midfielder took over, they were closer to the relegation zone than the top four.\nTheir current position - and mood around the club - is a measure of how they have come.\nThe Spaniard has built a new team in the past three years which bears little resemblance - in style and substance - to the one picked for his first game at Bournemouth in 2019.\nArteta will not be getting carried after this win over West Ham, especially with several significant fixtures - not least against Manchester City on 15 February - on the horizon.\nBut the Gunners sent a message with a clinical second-half performance and the omens are also in their favour.\nThe team who topped the Premier League table on Christmas Day have gone on to be champions in 10 of the past 13 seasons.\nNketiah takes chance as West Ham struggle in front of goal\nOne of the key questions as the Premier League returned was how the Gunners would cope without key striker Jesus.\nThe Brazil international had knee surgery after being injured in Qatar and is expected to be out until late February, fuelling talk the Gunners might need to sign some cover.\nBut against West Ham, a first Premier League start of the season was handed to Nketiah - and the 23-year-old delivered.\nAfter stretching the Hammers defence and creating space with his sharp movement, he capped an impressive all-round performance with a fierce finish and staked his claim to be Jesus' replacement.\n\"Gabby will be a big miss but we all believe in Eddie,\" Saka told Amazon Prime. \"That's all he needs, us to keep supporting him and we will keep encouraging him.\n\"Everyone in the team is chipping in [with goals] and everyone will be important.\"\nIn contrast to the leaders, West Ham are struggling in front of goal.\nThey have been better than their league position suggests, according to their expected goals statistics, with converting chances being their main problem.\nFew opportunities came against Arsenal, although the game might have panned out differently had Michail Antonio not been denied by Aaron Ramsdale shortly after the restart at 1-0.\nHammers manager David Moyes said before the match he has not been feeling pressure because of results, instead urging for perspective and togetherness across the club.\nBut a fourth straight league defeat leaves West Ham as one of the cluster of teams packed tightly together in the bottom half.\n\"I don't think we're in a relegation fight. Every team has a blip when it isn't plain sailing and results don't go your way,\" said midfielder Declan Rice.\n\"It's down to me as captain to keep everyone going and pushing. We still believe we are a top team. But we need to start showing that.

created by a couple of sublime passes from full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson - gave them the perfect start on their league return.\nDarwin Nunez's wastefulness prevented the visitors from extending their lead but they were able to add a second before half-time when Van Dijk's shot deflected in off Ezri Konsa following a corner.\nOllie Watkins and Leon Bailey had both squandered a couple of fine opportunities for Villa in an exciting first half but Unai Emery's side were rewarded for their persistence after the restart when Watkins headed in Douglas Luiz's cross.\nHowever, Spanish 18-year-old Bajcetic's first senior goal two minutes after coming on as a substitute, which followed great work by Nunez to sprint for a ball over the top, ended home hopes of a dramatic fightback at Villa Park.\nStefan Bajcetic - the 'cheeky' teenager and his 'Christmas story'\nLiverpool up and running in top-four bid\nWhile Jurgen Klopp said he was pleased that his sixth-placed side would resume their campaign \"within punching distance\" of the Premier League's top four, he added prior to kick-off that he felt it was a \"long arm still\" following their early season struggles.\nBut, with a game in hand on fourth-placed Tottenham, the Liverpool boss must now feel confident of attaining their target in the second half of the campaign.\nThe Reds' cause had received an early boost when Spurs drew with Brentford earlier in the day and their first-half double put them in position to take full advantage.\nRobertson's crucial role in the opener - setting up Salah with a first-time ball across the six-yard box after Alexander-Arnold's stunning outside-of-the-foot pass - saw him overtake Leighton Baines as the defender with the most assists in the competition's history (54).\nDespite appearing comfortable at half-time it was certainly not job done for Liverpool against determined opposition and they were relieved to add a late third after withstanding spells of intense Villa pressure following Watkins' lifeline.\nKlopp's side dropped 20 points from their opening 14 fixtures - two shy of the total number of points they let slip in the whole of the last campaign - but there are now signs of momentum for last season's runners-up.\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nNunez shows worth despite misses\nThere may not have been a goal for Nunez to celebrate at Villa Park but the Uruguayan demonstrated flashes of the promise that convinced Liverpool to pay big money to sign him from Benfica in the summer.\nThere is certainly no doubt that he should have added to his tally of nine goals in 20 games for the club here - and on another occasion such misses could prove costly.\nThe tenacious 23-year-old ended the match with the highest expected goals value of any player (1.15 xG) after landing four of his six shots on target - five of which were taken inside the penalty area.\nBut his 12 touches inside the opposition box - also a match-leading figure - hinted at his broader influence and his unpredictable movements caused huge issues for the Villa defence throughout.\nPerhaps the clearest demonstration of his importance arrived in the build-up to Liverpool's third.\nWith the match inside the final 10 minutes, Nunez refused to give up the chase and cut the ball back from the byeline to allow substitute Bajcetic to all but seal the three points and avoid a potentially awkward finish.\nPositive signs for Emery's Villa\nDespite defeat, there remains much for Aston Villa supporters to be optimistic about with the Emery era only just beginning.\nThe four-time Europa League winner was bidding to become the first Villa manager to win each of his first three league games in the club's history and he will believe his side's positive approach deserved more.\nWatkins had already been denied by Alisson prior to Liverpool's first and later passed up an opportunity from John McGinn's back-post cross, while twice an off-balance Bailey failed to connect with the ball when well-placed.\nThis was another positive showing and they remain five points clear of the relegation positions following encouraging pre-World Cup victories over Manchester United and Brighton.\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

However, there was a potential handball which needed to be checked. Once those replays had been studied, it became apparent Willy Boly had actually diverted the ball home.\nAs it turned out, Yates didn't handle. But Boly was offside and what would have been Forest's first Premier League away goal since Brennan Johnson scored in a 1-1 draw at Everton was ruled out.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Christian Norgaard hit his swivelling volley well, and after it was saved by Lukasz Fabianski, Toney reacted first to follow up and stab home.\nThe second, shortly before half-time, was even worse from a West Ham perspective.

Whether Moyes remains in post for that fixture remains to be seen.\nToney hits landmark - but leaves on a stretcher\nIn complete contrast to West Ham, Brentford have set a new club Premier League record of five consecutive games unbeaten. The Bees have not had a longer top-flight unbeaten run since they went six games without defeat between February and March 1939.\nThings could have been different had West Ham taken their chances - notably when Declan Rice struck the post early on and when Emerson Palmieri stung the gloves of David Raya with a near-post drive.\nHowever Brentford saw out the second half in relative comfort and this result, combined with the 2-2 draw against Tottenham on Boxing Day, will leave Thomas Frank satisfied with how his side have returned to action following the World Cup.\nOne question which remains however is what Brentford will do should Toney be ruled out by a long-term injury.\nThis is the stark reality they could face after the forward, tipped by many for a place in England's 2022 World Cup squad, jarred his knee in the turf after an innocuous challenge for a late corner.\nToney was left banging the turf, his face screwed up in clear pain, before being carried from the field on a stretcher.\n\"Of course, it didn't look great, but I've also been in this game long enough to know that you never know exactly what it is until it's been assessed over the following days,\" Frank said.\n\"Hopefully it's a minor injury, a minor thing, there's a good chance for that, but of course it could be worse.

There are big challenges ahead but we look forward to those.\"\nNewcastle offered almost all the attacking threat at St James' Park but were unable to find a winner which would have given them a seventh consecutive league win.\nLeeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier saved excellently from both Chris Wood and Fabian Schar in the second half, which was played almost exclusively in the visitors' territory.\nStill, Newcastle are now unbeaten in 12 games - a run which goes back to August - and are two points behind second-placed Manchester City. They are nine adrift of leaders Arsenal, who increased their cushion with victory against Brighton.\nThe hard-earned point for Leeds, who had one shot on target all match, moved them up a place to 14th.\nJesse Marsch's side are now three points clear of the relegation zone.\nWhat did you make of Newcastle's display?

Despite almost constant pressure, the winger was largely kept in check by Leeds' resolute defence, who repelled wave after wave of Newcastle attack.\nSean Longstaff blazed over from inside the area but otherwise Newcastle's clearest opening came from set-pieces with Kieran Tripper's delivery proving dangerous.\nMeslier spread himself to make the block at the feet of Wood after a knock-down and saved with his feet to keep out Schar's header.\nCallum Wilson, fit again after illness, came on after 64 minutes for his first appearance since the World Cup but was kept quiet.\n\"It is a sign of how far we have come that they were timewasting and doing everything they could to take time out of the game,\" Howe told Sky Sports. \"All that was missing was the final third.\n\"It was one of those days for us. We had enough chances to win the game comfortably.\"\nNewcastle's next match, a visit to Arsenal on 3 January, will offer some indication of whether they can indeed mount a title challenge.\nMeanwhile, the clenched-fisted celebrations at the end from Leeds, whose one goalbound effort was a curling strike by Rodrigo tipped away by Nick Pope, suggested this was a point gained from their perspective.\n\"I feel good about coming here and getting a draw,\" Marsch said. \"The first half was good from us but in the second half they started playing every ball into our end.\n\"I'm happy with how we dealt with the crowd and the mentality to get a draw and keep a clean sheet.\"\nVisit our Newcastle United page\nGo straight to all the best Leeds United content\nSutton's full predictions v Afrobeats star Maulo\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

I feel like we've lost two points,\" said Stones.\n\"It's difficult to take after the game. We showed great character to keep fighting and pushing. It was a bit of a scrappy game.\"\nErling Haaland, noticeably incensed after an early exchange with Everton's Ben Godfrey that left the Norway striker requiring treatment, finished off a lovely Riyad Mahrez move to open the scoring in the 24th minute.\nHowever, during a tumultuous second half Demarai Gray scored a stunning equaliser after Rodri gave the ball away, making ground down the left and curling home a shot from just inside the area.\nCity threw what they could at the visitors during 11 minutes of stoppage time, but Everton stifled their attempts to cap off the year with a win.\nWhat did you make of City's performance?

The result doesn't reflect that. When the game is so disrupted, a lot of time-wasting [happens]. We kept creating chances but it didn't come off.\n\"We conceded two shots all game but it's overlooked because of that incredible goal.\"\nA victory would have seen Pep Guardiola's side close the gap on his former assistant Mikel Arteta's relentless Arsenal. After the same number of games last season, City were top of the league and the Gunners were 12 points behind in sixth.\nThis season, City are trying to win a third successive Premier League title but have dropped points on three more occasions than Arsenal, with the two sides still yet to face each other in the league.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nVisit our dedicated Manchester City page\nStay up to date with all things Everton\nHaaland fired up but stoppages restrict City's flow\nHaving scored twice against Leeds on Wednesday to become the quickest player to 20 Premier League goals in a season, Haaland seemed to direct any further frustration at his four-week World Cup-enforced absence from football towards Godfrey.\nThe defender, starting his first game since breaking a leg in Everton's season opener, nudged Haaland in the early stages in an attempt to assert his authority, but seemed to only anger him - and the two engaged in a battle throughout the opening 45 minutes.\nHaaland gesticulated and waved at the crowd in an attempt to spur them on, celebrated his opener wildly in Godfrey's direction, and was eventually forced to calm down after being booked for a rash challenge just before half-time.\nIn a first half lacking clear opportunities, Haaland hit the side netting and Stones' header struck a post as referee Andy Madley dished out five yellow cards.\nLengthy delays prevented City from truly taking control of the game in the second half.\nA six-minute delay on account of the assistant referee's radio being faulty, followed by another break as City forward Jack Grealish received treatment, sapped the energy that had been so high in the first period.\nGray's equaliser rekindled some fire in City but the game ebbed away from them as Everton defended resolutely.\nA searching pass from Mahrez could not find a way through to Haaland and a frantic melee in the box resulted in a stellar save from Pickford.\nCity are without a win in two home games, having recorded 11 straight victories at the Etihad before conceding in the 98th minute and losing to Brentford last time out.\nGuardiola said: \"I would say they had eight in the back. They made a fantastic goal and when that happens you say 'congratulations', but in general we did really well.\"\nGray stunner eases pressure on Lampard\nEverton had shipped seven goals in their past three league matches and won only one of their past eight.\nAn air of inevitability around how Everton's season was shaping up had seemed to settle on supporters, pressure was mounting on manager Frank Lampard, and a lack of progress on the pitch looked to be continuing in Manchester.\nBut while Guardiola's side looked somewhat deflated by the second-half stoppages, Everton seemed all too pleased for the game to become fragmented and to limit City's usually expansive football.\nGray's magnificent goal almost came from nowhere, and every City attempt at a winner was blocked by a pink Everton shirt.\nCrucially, Seamus Coleman got in the way of Phil Foden's late opportunity and Rodri completely mistimed a header from a corner in the final seconds.\nA point, at the home of the defending champions, is a valuable one for Everton and leaves them 16th in the table, two points above the relegation zone.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Had he left it, then goalkeeper Ward - who clearly shouted for him to do so - had a straightforward gather at his near post, but instead Faes made the most awkward of connections to send the ball looping over the Wales international.\nThe second goal, however, was just plain unfortunate as Faes' momentum as he rushed to get back and clear off the line meant he could do little when the ball from Nunez's shot bounced back off the post and into his path.\nFaes becomes just the fourth player to score two own goals in a single Premier League game, after Jamie Carragher (1999, Liverpool vs Manchester United), Michael Proctor (2003, Sunderland vs Charlton) and Jonathan Walters (2013, Stoke vs Chelsea).\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

A minute's applause ended with the home fans chanting the former full-back's name.\nOnce under way, Southampton had the clearest early chance when Che Adams darted behind the hosts' high line, but goalkeeper Bernd Leno did well to repel his effort.\nMohamed Elyounoussi skimmed a shot narrowly over the crossbar, but Fulham gradually asserted themselves in midfield, with Palhinha to the fore, and were rewarded on 32 minutes.\nWillian clipped a corner to the edge of the penalty area, which Andreas Pereira met with his instep. The volley was well-struck but seemed to be heading off target until Ward-Prowse's instinctive attempt to block instead ensured it ended up in the back of the net.\nPereira stabbed a shot wide after the break as Fulham started the second half brightly.\nBut Ward-Prowse, who is second only to David Beckham in Premier League free-kick goals, gives Saints a threat that few other sides can offer at set-pieces.\nThe 28-year-old captain whipped a superb swirling free-kick around the wall and beyond Leno's dive to cancel out his own-goal and level the contest.\nIt seemed the scores would remain equal before the contest sprung back into life in the final few minutes.\nTom Cairney and Willian almost combined to set up Pereira at one end before Southampton substitute Romain Perraud threatened at the other.\nThe hosts went ahead again when another well-worked set-piece isolated Palhinha, who stands 6ft 3in tall, against a clutch of smaller defenders.\nMitrovic, who has 10 goals in his previous 13 Premier League games, had a chance to add to his prolific season after a foul on Dan James. But his penalty, well saved by Gavin Bazunu, ended an uncharacteristically quiet afternoon for the Serbian striker.\nSaints 'have to be better'\nSouthampton's next game is against Nottingham Forest, one place above them in the table, at home on Wednesday.\nManager Nathan Jones, who took over from sacked Ralph Hasenhuttl in November, said his players need to be sharper tactically and mentally to avoid their efforts being undermined by more bad defending.\n\"We didn't do the basics well on two occasions and that is what let us down,\" he said. \"They have to be ironed out on the training ground and in peoples' heads.\n\"The overall performance was good today - we negated a fluent team - but we have to be better in those moments.

In their absence, Rashford remains United's most potent goal threat.\nThe determination he showed to drive through so many defenders and score his latest effort indicates a hunger that was absent for much of last season.\nRashford thought he had a second near the end but his close-range effort - after Sa saved his initial shot - was ruled out for handball.\nThe win moved United into the top four - the first time they have been in the Champions League qualification places this season.\nTen Hag said: \"We made a good step today - first time we are in top four but it means nothing.\n\"We have to win every game. We want to try and win something. It depends on hard work from everyone.\"\nLopetegui must find answer to scoring woes\nIn his first home league game in charge of Wolves, Lopetegui was a demonstrative presence on the edge of his technical area.\nIf not quite as manic as Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, the former Sevilla boss was open with his feelings.\nThat included demanding a yellow card for Casemiro when he blocked Ruben Neves off during the first half, then letting the fourth official know it should have been two as referee Rob Jones finally showed a yellow card to the Brazilian when he fouled Daniel Podence.\nOnce he calms down from such injustices, Lopetegui will know - as he always has - the answer to Wolves' problems comes through finding the net.\nLopetegui said: \"We have to improve. I believe in my players. But it is not about one or two players. It is a team task. If we have more chances, we may score more.\"\nDiego Costa worked hard for little reward before the break and, until Jimenez was introduced once the Spaniard was replaced, there was no focal point for the Wolves midfield to play to.\nNeves almost pulled one of his wonder strikes out of his repertoire to put the hosts in front, but De Gea was equal to that, just as he was when Jimenez's stoppage-time effort was heading into the net.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here\nWhat did you think about Southampton's display? Send your comments here\nReaction to Saturday's action in the Premier League\nCraven Cottage legend Cohen honoured\nThe hosts paid tribute to one of their own before kick-off.\nManager Marco Silva, one of his mostly fondly-remembered predecessors Roy Hodgson and George Cohen's son Anthony laid wreathes around the centre circle in memory of the 1966 World Cup winner, who died at the age of 83 on 23 December.\nCohen was born in Fulham and swept the Craven Cottage stands as part of the ground staff before embarking on a 459-game one-club career with the Whites. A minute's applause ended with the home fans chanting the former full-back's name.\nOnce under way, Southampton had the clearest early chance when Che Adams darted behind the hosts' high line, but goalkeeper Bernd Leno did well to repel his effort.\nMohamed Elyounoussi skimmed a shot narrowly over the crossbar, but Fulham gradually asserted themselves in midfield, with Palhinha to the fore, and were rewarded on 32 minutes.\nWillian clipped a corner to the edge of the penalty area, which Andreas Pereira met with his instep. The volley was well-struck but seemed to be heading off target until Ward-Prowse's instinctive attempt to block instead ensured it ended up in the back of the net.\nPereira stabbed a shot wide after the break as Fulham started the second half brightly.\nBut Ward-Prowse, who is second only to David Beckham in Premier League free-kick goals, gives Saints a threat that few other sides can offer at set-pieces.\nThe 28-year-old captain whipped a superb swirling free-kick around the wall and beyond Leno's dive to cancel out his own-goal and level the contest.\nIt seemed the scores would remain equal before the contest sprung back into life in the final few minutes.\nTom Cairney and Willian almost combined to set up Pereira at one end before Southampton substitute Romain Perraud threatened at the other.\nThe hosts went ahead again when another well-worked set-piece isolated Palhinha, who stands 6ft 3in tall, against a clutch of smaller defenders.\nMitrovic, who has 10 goals in his previous 13 Premier League games, had a chance to add to his prolific season after a foul on Dan James. But his penalty, well saved by Gavin Bazunu, ended an uncharacteristically quiet afternoon for the Serbian striker.\nSaints 'have to be better'\nSouthampton's next game is against Nottingham Forest, one place above them in the table, at home on Wednesday.\nManager Nathan Jones, who took over from sacked Ralph Hasenhuttl in November, said his players need to be sharper tactically and mentally to avoid their efforts being undermined by more bad defending.\n\"We didn't do the basics well on two occasions and that is what let us down,\" he said. \"They have to be ironed out on the training ground and in peoples' heads.\n\"The overall performance was good today - we negated a fluent team - but we have to be better in those moments.

They put us under pressure second half.\n\"Our performance level wasn't good enough to take the three points. We didn't move the ball fast enough, not enough movement.\n\"Forest played a good game but we're disappointed with our performance over the 90 minutes and concerned we didn't deserve the win.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

There are big challenges ahead but we look forward to those.\"\nNewcastle offered almost all the attacking threat at St James' Park but were unable to find a winner which would have given them a seventh consecutive league win.\nLeeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier saved excellently from both Chris Wood and Fabian Schar in the second half, which was played almost exclusively in the visitors' territory.\nStill, Newcastle are now unbeaten in 12 games - a run which goes back to August - and are two points behind second-placed Manchester City. They are nine adrift of leaders Arsenal, who increased their cushion with victory against Brighton.\nThe hard-earned point for Leeds, who had one shot on target all match, moved them up a place to 14th.\nJesse Marsch's side are now three points clear of the relegation zone.\nWhat did you make of Newcastle's display? Have your say here\nWhat did you think of Leeds' performance? Send your comments here\nReaction to Saturday's action in the Premier League\nStubborn Leeds hold impressive Magpies\nThis time a year ago the thought of Howe refusing to rule out a title challenge, as he did before this game, would have been fanciful at best.\nThey end the year in the top three for only the third time in the Premier League era - and the first since the 2001-02 campaign.\nMuch has been made of Newcastle as an attacking force this season with Miguel Almiron the most obvious improvement. Despite almost constant pressure, the winger was largely kept in check by Leeds' resolute defence, who repelled wave after wave of Newcastle attack.\nSean Longstaff blazed over from inside the area but otherwise Newcastle's clearest opening came from set-pieces with Kieran Tripper's delivery proving dangerous.\nMeslier spread himself to make the block at the feet of Wood after a knock-down and saved with his feet to keep out Schar's header.\nCallum Wilson, fit again after illness, came on after 64 minutes for his first appearance since the World Cup but was kept quiet.\n\"It is a sign of how far we have come that they were timewasting and doing everything they could to take time out of the game,\" Howe told Sky Sports. \"All that was missing was the final third.\n\"It was one of those days for us. We had enough chances to win the game comfortably.\"\nNewcastle's next match, a visit to Arsenal on 3 January, will offer some indication of whether they can indeed mount a title challenge.\nMeanwhile, the clenched-fisted celebrations at the end from Leeds, whose one goalbound effort was a curling strike by Rodrigo tipped away by Nick Pope, suggested this was a point gained from their perspective.\n\"I feel good about coming here and getting a draw,\" Marsch said. \"The first half was good from us but in the second half they started playing every ball into our end.\n\"I'm happy with how we dealt with the crowd and the mentality to get a draw and keep a clean sheet.\"\nVisit our Newcastle United page\nGo straight to all the best Leeds United content\nSutton's full predictions v Afrobeats star Maulo\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Christian Norgaard hit his swivelling volley well, and after it was saved by Lukasz Fabianski, Toney reacted first to follow up and stab home.\nThe second, shortly before half-time, was even worse from a West Ham perspective. Toney played a simple lobbed ball over the top of the sleeping home defence from a throw-in near the halfway line.\nDa Silva outmuscled and outpaced Aaron Cresswell to streak through and slot past Fabianski for his first goal since August.\nThese teams will meet again in the FA Cup third round on 7 January. Whether Moyes remains in post for that fixture remains to be seen.\nToney hits landmark - but leaves on a stretcher\nIn complete contrast to West Ham, Brentford have set a new club Premier League record of five consecutive games unbeaten. The Bees have not had a longer top-flight unbeaten run since they went six games without defeat between February and March 1939.\nThings could have been different had West Ham taken their chances - notably when Declan Rice struck the post early on and when Emerson Palmieri stung the gloves of David Raya with a near-post drive.\nHowever Brentford saw out the second half in relative comfort and this result, combined with the 2-2 draw against Tottenham on Boxing Day, will leave Thomas Frank satisfied with how his side have returned to action following the World Cup.\nOne question which remains however is what Brentford will do should Toney be ruled out by a long-term injury.\nThis is the stark reality they could face after the forward, tipped by many for a place in England's 2022 World Cup squad, jarred his knee in the turf after an innocuous challenge for a late corner.\nToney was left banging the turf, his face screwed up in clear pain, before being carried from the field on a stretcher.\n\"Of course, it didn't look great, but I've also been in this game long enough to know that you never know exactly what it is until it's been assessed over the following days,\" Frank said.\n\"Hopefully it's a minor injury, a minor thing, there's a good chance for that, but of course it could be worse. We don't know yet.\"\nEven if the injury is not as bad as it first appears, Toney also faces being banned if FA charges of breaching betting rules are proven. He has until January 4 to respond regarding the 262 alleged breaches.\nOn the field, Toney remains one of the Premier League's deadliest strikers. He scored his 12th league goal of the season here, the same as his 2021-22 total, and hHe ends the calendar year of 2022 with 20 Premier League goals\n, external\n- only Harry Kane, with 26, has scored more.\nToney celebrated his strike by baiting the London Stadium crowd, crossing his arms in a symbol closely associated with the Hammers.\nIt demonstrates the dominance Brentford hold over West Ham in this fixture - they have won all three Premier League meetings.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Watkins and Buendia were bright to pounce on the opening Lloris handed them, while Luiz and Boubacar Kamara controlled midfield.\n\"Luiz and Kamara is a good combination,\" said Emery. \"To mix both of them is fantastic. Their performance today was fantastic to help us to win.\"\nVictory ensured Emery became the first Villa manager since John Gregory in 1998 to win his first two Premier League away matches.\n\"Every day when we are working, the players show me very good attitude and commitment,\" he said. \"They show today how they can run, be together, be disciplined together tactically and use our skills.\"\nEmery also set a record of 55 Premier League games in charge without being involved in a goalless draw, surpassing former Spurs boss Ossie Ardiles.\nLeaky Tottenham continue to worry Conte\nHaving lost their place in the top four to Manchester United, the onus was on Tottenham to produce an improved performance.\nWhile they did improve on their previous five games by not trailing at half-time, Spurs continue to look disjointed, exemplified after 18 minutes when Son Heung-min ripped off the protective mask he wore throughout the World Cup and threw it away in frustration.\nStriker Harry Kane also cut an irritated figure, coming deep into midfield to get the ball after barely touching it in the early periods.\nThe England captain came closest to opening the scoring in the first half.\nIvan Perisic was played in over the top before being forced wide by keeper Robin Olsen, but he cleverly dinked a cross back over for Kane to head down. Ashley Young covered, having initially played Perisic onside, and managed to direct the effort behind for a corner.\nPerisic should have scored shortly after Buendia's opener when the ball fell kindly 15 yards out and he scooped over the bar.\nHowever, Spurs set an unwanted club record of conceding at least two goals in seven successive Premier League fixtures.\nThey looked toothless in attack - Bryan Gil made his first league start in place of the injured Dejan Kulusevski, but was replaced just past the hour following an anonymous display - and Conte looked more miserable as his side slipped towards another worrying defeat.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Adding three more points was fantastic.\"\nSpurs were booed off at the final whistle, while some fans directed angry chants towards chairman Daniel Levy.\nVilla news and fan views in one place\nAll your Tottenham news and views\nEmery maintains strong record against Spurs\nWhile Emery's reign at Arsenal was not a success, he did manage to get the better of Tottenham, going unbeaten in three games against their local rivals.\nHe continued that trend on Sunday, a solid defensive performance justifying the decision to leave out a World Cup winner.\nIt appeared this contest would pit the two keepers who faced off in the 2022 World Cup final penalty shootout against each other, but Argentina's spot-kick hero Emiliano Martinez had to settle for a place on the bench.\nRobin Olsen kept his place in goal as Emery named an unchanged team from the side that lost to Liverpool on 26 December.\nHe was rewarded. Watkins and Buendia were bright to pounce on the opening Lloris handed them, while Luiz and Boubacar Kamara controlled midfield.\n\"Luiz and Kamara is a good combination,\" said Emery. \"To mix both of them is fantastic. Their performance today was fantastic to help us to win.\"\nVictory ensured Emery became the first Villa manager since John Gregory in 1998 to win his first two Premier League away matches.\n\"Every day when we are working, the players show me very good attitude and commitment,\" he said. \"They show today how they can run, be together, be disciplined together tactically and use our skills.\"\nEmery also set a record of 55 Premier League games in charge without being involved in a goalless draw, surpassing former Spurs boss Ossie Ardiles.\nLeaky Tottenham continue to worry Conte\nHaving lost their place in the top four to Manchester United, the onus was on Tottenham to produce an improved performance.\nWhile they did improve on their previous five games by not trailing at half-time, Spurs continue to look disjointed, exemplified after 18 minutes when Son Heung-min ripped off the protective mask he wore throughout the World Cup and threw it away in frustration.\nStriker Harry Kane also cut an irritated figure, coming deep into midfield to get the ball after barely touching it in the early periods.\nThe England captain came closest to opening the scoring in the first half.\nIvan Perisic was played in over the top before being forced wide by keeper Robin Olsen, but he cleverly dinked a cross back over for Kane to head down. Ashley Young covered, having initially played Perisic onside, and managed to direct the effort behind for a corner.\nPerisic should have scored shortly after Buendia's opener when the ball fell kindly 15 yards out and he scooped over the bar.\nHowever, Spurs set an unwanted club record of conceding at least two goals in seven successive Premier League fixtures.\nThey looked toothless in attack - Bryan Gil made his first league start in place of the injured Dejan Kulusevski, but was replaced just past the hour following an anonymous display - and Conte looked more miserable as his side slipped towards another worrying defeat.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Send your comments here\nWhat did you make of United's performance? What are your views on Rashford? Have your say here\nReaction to Saturday's action in the Premier League\nTen Hag in charge\nTen Hag proved with his treatment of Cristiano Ronaldo that reputation would not get in the way of reinforcing team discipline.\nRashford's indiscretion - missing a team meeting after oversleeping - was not on the same scale, but given Garnacho was stopped from playing during the club's pre-season tour because of persistent lateness, Ten Hag would view his actions as confirmation the same rules apply to all players, no matter what their status.\nAs it turned out, Garnacho produced a decent first-half display but, with United failing to make the most of limited opportunities, Rashford replaced the 18-year-old at half-time.\nTen Hag has made it clear he wants striking reinforcements this month. In their absence, Rashford remains United's most potent goal threat.\nThe determination he showed to drive through so many defenders and score his latest effort indicates a hunger that was absent for much of last season.\nRashford thought he had a second near the end but his close-range effort - after Sa saved his initial shot - was ruled out for handball.\nThe win moved United into the top four - the first time they have been in the Champions League qualification places this season.\nTen Hag said: \"We made a good step today - first time we are in top four but it means nothing.\n\"We have to win every game. We want to try and win something. It depends on hard work from everyone.\"\nLopetegui must find answer to scoring woes\nIn his first home league game in charge of Wolves, Lopetegui was a demonstrative presence on the edge of his technical area.\nIf not quite as manic as Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, the former Sevilla boss was open with his feelings.\nThat included demanding a yellow card for Casemiro when he blocked Ruben Neves off during the first half, then letting the fourth official know it should have been two as referee Rob Jones finally showed a yellow card to the Brazilian when he fouled Daniel Podence.\nOnce he calms down from such injustices, Lopetegui will know - as he always has - the answer to Wolves' problems comes through finding the net.\nLopetegui said: \"We have to improve. I believe in my players. But it is not about one or two players. It is a team task. If we have more chances, we may score more.\"\nDiego Costa worked hard for little reward before the break and, until Jimenez was introduced once the Spaniard was replaced, there was no focal point for the Wolves midfield to play to.\nNeves almost pulled one of his wonder strikes out of his repertoire to put the hosts in front, but De Gea was equal to that, just as he was when Jimenez's stoppage-time effort was heading into the net.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They put us under pressure second half.\n\"Our performance level wasn't good enough to take the three points.

I feel like we've lost two points,\" said Stones.\n\"It's difficult to take after the game. We showed great character to keep fighting and pushing.

They made a fantastic goal and when that happens you say 'congratulations', but in general we did really well.\"\nGray stunner eases pressure on Lampard\nEverton had shipped seven goals in their past three league matches and won only one of their past eight.\nAn air of inevitability around how Everton's season was shaping up had seemed to settle on supporters, pressure was mounting on manager Frank Lampard, and a lack of progress on the pitch looked to be continuing in Manchester.\nBut while Guardiola's side looked somewhat deflated by the second-half stoppages, Everton seemed all too pleased for the game to become fragmented and to limit City's usually expansive football.\nGray's magnificent goal almost came from nowhere, and every City attempt at a winner was blocked by a pink Everton shirt.\nCrucially, Seamus Coleman got in the way of Phil Foden's late opportunity and Rodri completely mistimed a header from a corner in the final seconds.\nA point, at the home of the defending champions, is a valuable one for Everton and leaves them 16th in the table, two points above the relegation zone.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He was crying but it is good,\" Villa manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Sport, said on Bailey's chance.\n\"If he is crying it is because he was feeling, and to feel moments like that and to have the responsibility is good.

He ghosted in behind the Bournemouth defence, opened his body and steered Eriksen's pinpoint cross from the left into the top corner.\nIt broke the game open after a tentative start and that allowed Shaw to score a magnificent end-to-end goal. The England left-back started the move on the edge of his own box, before tucking home from the penalty spot.\nRashford was then supplied with the easiest of finishes for his fourth goal in four games since the post-World Cup resumption.\nUnited host neighbours Man City in their next league game on 14 January, and could end that game above their city rivals, which would be a strong indication of the improvement they are making under Ten Hag.\nDespite that the Dutchman was unhappy with his side's display, saying: \"Today it was not our best game. We have to be honest, we didn't play that smart as a team.\n\"We made great goals, but at times we were quite lucky, and some great saves from David [de Gea]. We could have been smarter as a team.\"\nNervy times for Bournemouth\nGames against the likes of United are not going to decide Bournemouth's Premier League future, but manager Gary O'Neil wanted a reaction after \"the worst\" performance of his reign against Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day post-match, O'Neil said \"that was us\", adding he was \"pleased with the performance\".\n\"It wasn't a 3-0 game,\" said O'Neil. \"I think we had maybe six or seven chances but obviously Manchester United had some as well.\n\"We need to be sure that we produce that every week.\"\nTo concede from a set-piece, after limiting United in the early exchanges, will frustrate O'Neil, as will a goal so close to his half-time team talk.\nThe second goal did seem to wake Bournemouth up, with three shots on target following in a minute, but there will surely be doubt creeping in on the south coast, despite new chairman Bill Foley insisting the Cherries \"will not be relegated\"\n, external\nlast week.\nFunds are available for new players in the January transfer window, and a creative spark will likely feature high on O'Neil's wishlist with the Cherries looking toothless for large periods.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He could have no complaints after a poor performance in which he looked a thoroughly spent force.\nThis was more disappointment for Chelsea, who now face an uphill struggle to get anywhere near the clubs they would regard as their traditional Premier League rivals.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He was crying but it is good,\" Villa manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Sport, said on Bailey's chance.\n\"If he is crying it is because he was feeling, and to feel moments like that and to have the responsibility is good.

I feel at blame for [us] not coming away with all three points tonight.\"\nBailey added: \"It's really hard to take and I'm very disappointed in myself.

It's all on me, I fully take the blame for that,\" Jones told Match of the Day.\n\"The blame lies solely with me, I set them up, asked them to do certain things but we need to give ourselves a better opportunity to win the game.\n\"We can't gift a goal a game and we've done that almost every game. Something has to change quickly and we need a bit of luck.\"\nSouthampton v Nottingham Forest as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nHow did you rate Southampton's performance?

Obviously time is not our friend and we need to turn it around quickly.\"\n'I really challenged the players'\nBefore the match began, it featured the side with the worst home record against the team with the worst away record.\nChe Adams had a glorious chance to put the hosts ahead after only six minutes but shot wastefully wide from inside the penalty area.\nThat proved costly as Forest, with just two points from their previous eight games on the road, hit the crossbar through the impressive Johnson before he set up Awoniyi 15 minutes later for the opening goal.\nThe first half got even worse for the hosts when centre-back Armel Bella-Kotchap, a member of Germany's World Cup squad although he failed to make an appearance, went off injured after only 34 minutes with Duje Caleta-Car replacing him.\nThe atmosphere was turning with Southampton giving their fans little to cheer for the remainder of the half, with the team booed off at the break.\nSekou Mara had a rare chance for the Saints in the second half but headed wide, although it took a deflection and was wrongly given as a goal-kick.\nJones made an attacking triple substitution in the 64th minute, with Joe Aribo, Samuel Edozie and Adam Armstrong all coming on, but none of them tested Forest goalkeeper Dean Henderson.\nForest then handed a debut to Brazil international midfielder Gustavo Scarpa after he became the club's 24th signing of the campaign when he joined Forest on a free transfer from Palmeiras last month.\nThe visitors were happy to defend deep with Willy Boly, Joe Worrall and Serge Aurier all superb for Forest as they frustrated the hosts.\n\"It's better to be out of the bottom three than in it for sure but it's one step at a time,\" said Forest boss Steve Cooper. \"I really challenged the players to get the first away win and challenged myself and the staff, we're all in it together.\n\"We have had a couple of chances to get out of the bottom three, now we're out, but the objective is not just to stay out but move up the table.\n\"There's a long way to go and tough moments make you stronger.\"\nSingh Gill makes league history\nHistory was made at St Mary's with Bhupinder Singh Gill becoming the first Sikh-Punjabi to serve as an assistant referee at a Premier League match.\nThe 37-year-old, who qualified as a referee at the age of 14, said earlier that he hoped to inspire the future generation.\n\"My dream has always been to reach the top of the game, be a role model for future officials and encourage more people from diverse backgrounds into officiating, especially from a South Asian background just like me,\" he said.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He ghosted in behind the Bournemouth defence, opened his body and steered Eriksen's pinpoint cross from the left into the top corner.\nIt broke the game open after a tentative start and that allowed Shaw to score a magnificent end-to-end goal. The England left-back started the move on the edge of his own box, before tucking home from the penalty spot.\nRashford was then supplied with the easiest of finishes for his fourth goal in four games since the post-World Cup resumption.\nUnited host neighbours Man City in their next league game on 14 January, and could end that game above their city rivals, which would be a strong indication of the improvement they are making under Ten Hag.\nDespite that the Dutchman was unhappy with his side's display, saying: \"Today it was not our best game. We have to be honest, we didn't play that smart as a team.\n\"We made great goals, but at times we were quite lucky, and some great saves from David [de Gea]. We could have been smarter as a team.\"\nNervy times for Bournemouth\nGames against the likes of United are not going to decide Bournemouth's Premier League future, but manager Gary O'Neil wanted a reaction after \"the worst\" performance of his reign against Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day post-match, O'Neil said \"that was us\", adding he was \"pleased with the performance\".\n\"It wasn't a 3-0 game,\" said O'Neil. \"I think we had maybe six or seven chances but obviously Manchester United had some as well.\n\"We need to be sure that we produce that every week.\"\nTo concede from a set-piece, after limiting United in the early exchanges, will frustrate O'Neil, as will a goal so close to his half-time team talk.\nThe second goal did seem to wake Bournemouth up, with three shots on target following in a minute, but there will surely be doubt creeping in on the south coast, despite new chairman Bill Foley insisting the Cherries \"will not be relegated\"\n, external\nlast week.\nFunds are available for new players in the January transfer window, and a creative spark will likely feature high on O'Neil's wishlist with the Cherries looking toothless for large periods.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

For everyone at the club, it is not easy under these circumstances,\" said the 23-year-old.\n\"A lot of things changed this year. We have so many injuries. Today we had five young players in the starting XI, they are doing a really good job at the moment.\"\nThe Germany striker should have doubled Chelsea's advantage but could only flash a header wide from close range from Mason Mount's cross.\nPalace came close to equalising late on when Cheick Doucoure's long-range volley was spectacularly tipped over by Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nChelsea stay 10th despite the win, just their second in 10 Premier League games, but are now level on points with ninth-placed Liverpool.\nPalace are 12th after a fifth defeat in six games in all competitions.\nReaction to Chelsea v Crystal Palace and all of Sunday's other Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content\nVisit our Crystal Palace page\nNervy Blues end losing run\nThis was far from a convincing performance by Chelsea but the relief was palpable at the final whistle as they avoided the ignominy of losing four successive matches in all competitions for the first time in 30 years.\nThe goal arrived when Palace lost concentration from a corner allowing Conor Gallagher to play the ball short to Ziyech, whose curling cross was buried past Vicente Guaita by Havertz for his sixth goal of the season.\nChelsea had struggled for many clear-cut openings up to that stage, with Havertz heading over and Lewis Hall flashing a first-time shot across goal during a tame first half.\nHavertz glanced wide from Mount's dangerous cross and substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shot straight at Guaita as Chelsea threatened a second.\nThiago Silva then made several key defensive headers in stoppage time as the Blues clung on during nine nervy minutes of stoppage time.\n\"Overall we played quite well, they had their moments as well but today was about getting the victory - park it as three valuable points against a team that was pushing as well,\" Potter told BBC Sport.\n\"We try to play well and I thought at times we did, you have to understand the context of the situation we are in so it isn't going to be sensational football all the time. The boys have worked hard.\"\nThe west London club have also been boosted by the arrival of Ukraine forward Mykhailo Mudryk, who was paraded on the pitch at half-time after confirmation of his transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk.\n\"He is a young player with exciting quality in the final third,\" added Potter. \"He is very fast and direct and I think the crowd will like him.\"\nEagles on the slide\nPalace have just one win in seven games in all competitions since the post-World Cup resumption, with manager Patrick Vieira admitting there was a \"challenging mood\" around the club before this game.\nVieira could not fault his players' commitment at Stamford Bridge, but will rue a lapse in concentration for Havertz's goal and a lack of cutting edge up front.\nTyrick Mitchell and Jeffrey Schlupp forced Kepa into two smart stops during the first half but the visitors faded as an attacking threat after the break.\nTheir only other opportunity of note was a long-range effort from Doucoure that was tipped over by the Chelsea goalkeeper late on.\n\"This was a performance where I am really pleased with the attitude and discipline,\" Vieira told BBC Sport. \"We played a really good game of football and to leave with nothing is hard for us but this is a period where we are.\n\"We did enough to score goals. The game could have finished 2-2 but we shouldn't have lost the game, we shouldn't have conceded on a set-piece.\"\nBlues pay tribute to Vialli\nThere were emotional scenes before kick-off as Chelsea paid tribute to their former player and manager Gianluca Vialli in their first home game since his death at the age of 58 earlier this month.\nChelsea's players warmed-up wearing training kit with 'Vialli 9' on the back and also stepped out on to the pitch wearing Chelsea kits bearing his name.\nTwo huge banners in tribute to the Italian were unfurled at either end of Stamford Bridge, before a number of his former team-mates joined the current players in the centre circle for a minute's applause before kick-off.",

Send us your views\nHow did you rate City? Let us know your thoughts\nUnited make statement\nUnited left Etihad Stadium in early October chastened and bruised following a 6-3 thrashing, a scoreline that actually flattered them - but Ten Hag insisted lessons had been learned.\nAnd so they have. This win means United have lost only one of their past 19 games in all competitions and are now on City's heels in third place in the table, barely credible after that derby beating and a dreadful start to the season that saw them lose at home to Brighton before being overwhelmed at Brentford.\nThe debate over Fernandes' equaliser will go on, but what is inescapable is the significant improvement under the disciplinarian and tactically astute Ten Hag to the point where United are looking solid in the top four and may even be casting a glance at leaders Arsenal, who are six points ahead of them.\nThe sight of the diminutive Luke Shaw winning a series of headers in among Erling Haaland and others in stoppage time and Raphael Varane fist-pumping and whipping up the fans at the final whistle was a sign of the renewed belief and confidence surging through United.\nThe reborn Rashford was not deterred by missing two first-half chances to pounce and turn Garnacho's cross past exposed City keeper Ederson for the winner.\nUnited's recovery has been slow but assured under Ten Hag and the scenes at the final whistle demonstrated that a giant that had lost its way is slowing finding itself again.\nCity disappointed - and furious\nCity's players were left with a mixture of emotions at the final whistle following this tumultuous defeat.\nThe Premier League champions looked in control following Grealish's goal after a shaky first half, only for United to turn the tables on them amid chaotic scenes late on.\nCity were bitterly disappointed at the loss and infuriated by the decision to allow Fernandes' equaliser.\nRashford was clearly offside as he chased Casemiro's pass, but did not touch the ball, leaving it for Fernandes to whip his finish beyond Ederson.\nCity's argument, with justification, was that Rashford was having a significant impact on the incident even without touching the ball because his presence clearly put him in a position where he had an effect on Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji's ability to make a challenge.\nReferee Stuart Attwell consulted his assistant and the goal was given, much to City's anger as their players confronted the official at the final whistle.\nCity, trying to recover from Wednesday's Carabao Cup quarter-final loss at Southampton, were not their usual fluent selves but their unhappiness at the result will be even more acute because of their discontent at the decision that went against them.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views\nHow did you rate City? Let us know your thoughts\nUnited make statement\nUnited left Etihad Stadium in early October chastened and bruised following a 6-3 thrashing, a scoreline that actually flattered them - but Ten Hag insisted lessons had been learned.\nAnd so they have. This win means United have lost only one of their past 19 games in all competitions and are now on City's heels in third place in the table, barely credible after that derby beating and a dreadful start to the season that saw them lose at home to Brighton before being overwhelmed at Brentford.\nThe debate over Fernandes' equaliser will go on, but what is inescapable is the significant improvement under the disciplinarian and tactically astute Ten Hag to the point where United are looking solid in the top four and may even be casting a glance at leaders Arsenal, who are six points ahead of them.\nThe sight of the diminutive Luke Shaw winning a series of headers in among Erling Haaland and others in stoppage time and Raphael Varane fist-pumping and whipping up the fans at the final whistle was a sign of the renewed belief and confidence surging through United.\nThe reborn Rashford was not deterred by missing two first-half chances to pounce and turn Garnacho's cross past exposed City keeper Ederson for the winner.\nUnited's recovery has been slow but assured under Ten Hag and the scenes at the final whistle demonstrated that a giant that had lost its way is slowing finding itself again.\nCity disappointed - and furious\nCity's players were left with a mixture of emotions at the final whistle following this tumultuous defeat.\nThe Premier League champions looked in control following Grealish's goal after a shaky first half, only for United to turn the tables on them amid chaotic scenes late on.\nCity were bitterly disappointed at the loss and infuriated by the decision to allow Fernandes' equaliser.\nRashford was clearly offside as he chased Casemiro's pass, but did not touch the ball, leaving it for Fernandes to whip his finish beyond Ederson.\nCity's argument, with justification, was that Rashford was having a significant impact on the incident even without touching the ball because his presence clearly put him in a position where he had an effect on Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji's ability to make a challenge.\nReferee Stuart Attwell consulted his assistant and the goal was given, much to City's anger as their players confronted the official at the final whistle.\nCity, trying to recover from Wednesday's Carabao Cup quarter-final loss at Southampton, were not their usual fluent selves but their unhappiness at the result will be even more acute because of their discontent at the decision that went against them.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Keeper Ramsdale was outstanding and his defenders prepared to throw themselves in front of everything to protect the lead.\nThere was some ill-feeling and ugly scenes at the end when Ramsdale and Richarlison had a flare-up, before a Spurs fan appeared to aim a kick at the England keeper.\nArsenal's players were eventually dragged away to enjoy their thoroughly-deserved celebrations with their own ecstatic supporters.\nSpurs fall short again\nSpurs may have created chances and moments of anxiety for Arsenal, especially in the second half, but this was a sobering game for Conte and his players as they looked well off the pace until it was too late.\nThey were trailing once again at half time for the ninth time this season, the seventh in the Premier League, after a first period in which their mediocrity was a sharp contrast to the excellence of their rivals.\nSpurs have made a habit of slow starts and occasionally been able to dig themselves out of the hole, but they left themselves too much to do against this super-confident Arsenal outfit.\nKane was attempting to equal Jimmy Greaves' record of 266 goals for Spurs, but found Ramsdale at his best. At the other end, though, Lloris produced yet another of those errors that happen far too often to a goalkeeper of his reputation.\nSaka's cross took a deflection of Sessegnon but the French keeper had to do so much better than just let the ball drop behind him into his own net.\nIt summed up Spurs' first-half display and they remain in fifth place, five points behind Manchester United in the Champions League places having played a game more.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Now we have to play another 20-21 games and we have to stay focused on those games.\n\"We want to work harder to achieve our target.\"\nDe Zerbi's side dominated the first half but failed to convert their pressure into goals, Trent Alexander-Arnold blocking March's effort near the goal-line and the lively Mitoma poking wide from a tight angle.\nBrighton thought they had won a penalty shortly before the break when March went to ground in the area under Alisson's challenge, but referee Darren England overturned his initial decision to award a spot-kick after consulting with VAR.\nIt mattered little, however, as March netted his third and fourth goals of the campaign before Welbeck struck to lift Brighton up to seventh - two places and two points above their opponents.\nKlopp 'very concerned' after 'worst' Liverpool game\nReaction to Brighton's win over Liverpool and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nVisit our Brighton & Hove Albion page\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nHapless Liverpool well beaten\nDefensive frailties and a lack of physicality have proved Liverpool's undoing in recent weeks, with Jurgen Klopp's side conceding poor goals in defeat at Brentford in the Premier League and a draw at home to Wolves in the FA Cup last weekend.\nThe visitors, lining up in a 4-3-1-2 formation spearheaded by Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah, managed to keep free-flowing Brighton at bay in the first half but created next to nothing themselves and were fortunate to go into half-time on level terms.\nMitoma, in sparkling form for Brighton of late, caused Alexander-Arnold and Matip countless problems, with Salah - or any other Reds player for that matter - failing to offer any protection down their right flank.\nLiverpool survived a major let-off when Brighton were awarded a penalty for a foul on March by Alisson, only for VAR to rule that the winger had strayed offside from Adam Lallana's pass.\nBut the visitors' luck ran out in the second half as March scored twice in the space of seven minutes to put Brighton on course to a fifth win in seven top-flight games.\nGakpo had a close-range effort saved by Robert Sanchez late on, but Welbeck delivered the final blow with a strike that combined skill and audacity in equal measure.\nSeagulls going from strength to strength\nMac Allister was handed his first start since helping Argentina to World Cup glory in December, as Brighton made two changes to the team that thrashed Everton in their last league match.\nThe midfielder paraded his World Cup winners' medal before kick-off and was given a rousing reception by the Seagulls supporters, who were hoping to witness a first home league win over Liverpool since 14 January 1961 - precisely 62 years ago.\nBuoyed perhaps by Mac Allister's return to the starting line-up, Brighton played with precision and fluency from the start. March's low shot was brilliantly cleared to safety by Alexander-Arnold, before Mitoma fired past the far post after breaching the Liverpool defence.\nWhile Brighton's opener came from a Liverpool error, there was nothing fortunate about the home side's second as March finished magnificently after being played in by teenager Ferguson, who delivered the latest in a string of eye-catching performances.\nBrighton have now scored in each of their last eight games in the top flight, netting 21 goals in that run.\n\"It's one of the best performances I can remember for a long time,\" March told BBC Sport. \"It's a great day and if we keep playing like that then we'll do well, that's for sure.\n\"It was just about being patient and waiting for that right pass. We play better against the big teams at home. I don't know why.\n\"I love playing for Roberto - he's great. He puts his arm around you and tells you you're a good player.

For everyone at the club, it is not easy under these circumstances,\" said the 23-year-old.\n\"A lot of things changed this year. We have so many injuries.

The boys have worked hard.\"\nThe west London club have also been boosted by the arrival of Ukraine forward Mykhailo Mudryk, who was paraded on the pitch at half-time after confirmation of his transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk.\n\"He is a young player with exciting quality in the final third,\" added Potter. \"He is very fast and direct and I think the crowd will like him.\"\nEagles on the slide\nPalace have just one win in seven games in all competitions since the post-World Cup resumption, with manager Patrick Vieira admitting there was a \"challenging mood\" around the club before this game.\nVieira could not fault his players' commitment at Stamford Bridge, but will rue a lapse in concentration for Havertz's goal and a lack of cutting edge up front.\nTyrick Mitchell and Jeffrey Schlupp forced Kepa into two smart stops during the first half but the visitors faded as an attacking threat after the break.\nTheir only other opportunity of note was a long-range effort from Doucoure that was tipped over by the Chelsea goalkeeper late on.\n\"This was a performance where I am really pleased with the attitude and discipline,\" Vieira told BBC Sport. \"We played a really good game of football and to leave with nothing is hard for us but this is a period where we are.\n\"We did enough to score goals. The game could have finished 2-2 but we shouldn't have lost the game, we shouldn't have conceded on a set-piece.\"\nBlues pay tribute to Vialli\nThere were emotional scenes before kick-off as Chelsea paid tribute to their former player and manager Gianluca Vialli in their first home game since his death at the age of 58 earlier this month.\nChelsea's players warmed-up wearing training kit with 'Vialli 9' on the back and also stepped out on to the pitch wearing Chelsea kits bearing his name.\nTwo huge banners in tribute to the Italian were unfurled at either end of Stamford Bridge, before a number of his former team-mates joined the current players in the centre circle for a minute's applause before kick-off."

Crazy for me.\n\"It's a foul as clear as day, Ivan Toney locks his arm in and pulls Marcos Senesi down. It's never a penalty.\n\"We need to work hard, there are little things that can go your way or not. We've suffered some injuries, we're weaker than we'd like to be. We've got to keep working.\"\nBournemouth, who are 17th and one point clear of the relegation zone, have now lost six games in a row since O'Neil was appointed permanent manager during the World Cup.\nThey have only won two of their past 13 in all competitions and one of their past 10 in the league.\nThose results have seen pressure build on O'Neil, who started the weekend as third favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, behind Everton's Frank Lampard and Chelsea's Graham Potter.\nDespite that, O'Neil said: \"I'm not interested. I'm working as always to win the next game.\"\nFollow reaction as Brentford beat Bournemouth\nVisit our Brentford page\nGo straight to all the best AFC Bournemouth content\nToney delivers for Brentford\nThis was the first time Toney had played in 2023 after suffering a knee injury in their victory over West Ham that concluded 2022.\nHis run in behind won the penalty with Senasi wrapping his arm under Toney's, which the Brentford striker then effectively trapped, before falling backwards onto the floor.\nJarrod Gillett had little hesitation in awarding the spot-kick, and Toney took two steps forward before side-footing the ball into the side netting, just above the reach of Neto.\nIt means he has scored four goals in his last five Premier League games, and Brentford will be hoping any ban that may come from a Football Association charge for alleged breaches of betting rules is not too substantial as they potentially push for a place in Europe.\nOverall, it was a relatively flat Brentford performance, until Dasilva burst forward and crossed for Jensen to curl home, with the win meaning the Bees have claimed 19 points from 30 available at home this season.\nAsked about potentially qualifying for Europe, Brentford boss Thomas Frank told Sky Sports: \"It is important we have dreams. Everyone needs dreams and ambitions.\n\"[Manchester United manager] Erik ten Hag said something about Alex Ferguson, who said the season starts in April. If we think too far ahead we will have a problem.\n\"It is important to celebrate our wins but after we have to work very hard and see where we will end.\"\nBournemouth lack edge again\nThere is an uncertainty about the managerial situation at Bournemouth and that won't put O'Neil at ease, especially with the club now on their longest winless run since 1983.\nSince O'Neil's appointment, the American businessman Bill Foley has taken over the club, and fans are yet to see how patient he is.\nInvestment in the playing squad was seemingly guaranteed when he took over, with Foley insisting the Cherries \"will not be relegated\" this season.\nThey are yet to make any signings in the January transfer window and saw relegation rivals Wolves, Southampton and Nottingham Forest all win on Saturday.\nThis was another performance of endeavour, suggesting the players are still behind O'Neil but they lacked a spark in the attacking areas, with Siriki Dembele's driven effort just one of two shots on target.\nDoubts will be creeping in on the south coast. The investment needs to arrive soon if Foley's bold claim is going to be true come May.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He deserves that and the team deserve it. It capped off a really good day.\"\nIt caps a memorable few days for Forest after their penalty shootout win against Wolves sent them through to the EFL Cup semi-finals.\nThe only concern was a muscle injury to goalkeeper Dean Henderson late on as he took a goal-kick, with Cooper later revealing it \"doesn't look good\".\nForest had used all their substitutes so could not bring on a replacement, but Henderson was able to continue as they saw out the game.\nFoxes post-match slump continues\nThe jubilant scenes among the Forest supporters were in sharp contrast to the furious reaction of the visiting fans at the final whistle, who made their displeasure at the performance clear.\nAfter reviving their season with a run of five wins from six before the World Cup, Leicester's form has collapsed since the resumption and they have dropped perilously close to the bottom three to pile the pressure on manager Brendan Rodgers.\nIn a game of few chances, the Foxes will rue that early miss by Barnes, who also spurned another fine opportunity at the start of the second when he was played in by Youri Tielemans.\nBut after falling behind shortly after, what little attacking threat Leicester had fizzled away and they rarely looked like getting back into the game, managing just one shot on target throughout the whole 90 minutes.\n\"In the second half we weren't good, I thought in the first half we were the better team but didn't take our chances,\" Rodgers told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"In fairness to Brennan Johnson, he finished his chances really well. He scored his two chances and we weren't able to.\n\"We are doing our very best but we have just not been good enough. We have to do our best and we will keep fighting.\n\"On a personal level, I know the game. I came in to do my very best and that's all I will ever do.

A win would have significantly relieved that pressure as they could have leapt up to 14th, but as it is they remain deep in trouble near the foot of the table.\nThe players clearly care and showed fight and determination, particularly in the first half, and they did have chances to get a second themselves, notably through Alex Iwobi and Calvert-Lewin.\nBut as the game wore on desperation set in and the lack of quality told. After full-time a sit-in protest was held by a number of supporters as they once again showed their frustration at the board.\nSaints on the up\nA week ago, Southampton's situation looked more dire than Everton's. They had slumped to the bottom of the table and had experienced no new manager bounce under Nathan Jones.\nBut this has been a huge few days for the club as they built on their victory against Manchester City to secure a win that gives them real hope of moving out of the relegation zone.\nBrazilian defender Lyanco was a key player in the win against City and he was solid once again in this game to frustrate Everton and while they did not show masses of quality themselves, Ward-Prowse is a deadly set-piece taker capable of winning any match, as it proved at Goodison Park.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He deserves that and the team deserve it. It capped off a really good day.\"\nIt caps a memorable few days for Forest after their penalty shootout win against Wolves sent them through to the EFL Cup semi-finals.\nThe only concern was a muscle injury to goalkeeper Dean Henderson late on as he took a goal-kick, with Cooper later revealing it \"doesn't look good\".\nForest had used all their substitutes so could not bring on a replacement, but Henderson was able to continue as they saw out the game.\nFoxes post-match slump continues\nThe jubilant scenes among the Forest supporters were in sharp contrast to the furious reaction of the visiting fans at the final whistle, who made their displeasure at the performance clear.\nAfter reviving their season with a run of five wins from six before the World Cup, Leicester's form has collapsed since the resumption and they have dropped perilously close to the bottom three to pile the pressure on manager Brendan Rodgers.\nIn a game of few chances, the Foxes will rue that early miss by Barnes, who also spurned another fine opportunity at the start of the second when he was played in by Youri Tielemans.\nBut after falling behind shortly after, what little attacking threat Leicester had fizzled away and they rarely looked like getting back into the game, managing just one shot on target throughout the whole 90 minutes.\n\"In the second half we weren't good, I thought in the first half we were the better team but didn't take our chances,\" Rodgers told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"In fairness to Brennan Johnson, he finished his chances really well. He scored his two chances and we weren't able to.\n\"We are doing our very best but we have just not been good enough. We have to do our best and we will keep fighting.\n\"On a personal level, I know the game. I came in to do my very best and that's all I will ever do.

Now we have to play another 20-21 games and we have to stay focused on those games.\n\"We want to work harder to achieve our target.\"\nDe Zerbi's side dominated the first half but failed to convert their pressure into goals, Trent Alexander-Arnold blocking March's effort near the goal-line and the lively Mitoma poking wide from a tight angle.\nBrighton thought they had won a penalty shortly before the break when March went to ground in the area under Alisson's challenge, but referee Darren England overturned his initial decision to award a spot-kick after consulting with VAR.\nIt mattered little, however, as March netted his third and fourth goals of the campaign before Welbeck struck to lift Brighton up to seventh - two places and two points above their opponents.\nKlopp 'very concerned' after 'worst' Liverpool game\nReaction to Brighton's win over Liverpool and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nVisit our Brighton & Hove Albion page\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nHapless Liverpool well beaten\nDefensive frailties and a lack of physicality have proved Liverpool's undoing in recent weeks, with Jurgen Klopp's side conceding poor goals in defeat at Brentford in the Premier League and a draw at home to Wolves in the FA Cup last weekend.\nThe visitors, lining up in a 4-3-1-2 formation spearheaded by Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah, managed to keep free-flowing Brighton at bay in the first half but created next to nothing themselves and were fortunate to go into half-time on level terms.\nMitoma, in sparkling form for Brighton of late, caused Alexander-Arnold and Matip countless problems, with Salah - or any other Reds player for that matter - failing to offer any protection down their right flank.\nLiverpool survived a major let-off when Brighton were awarded a penalty for a foul on March by Alisson, only for VAR to rule that the winger had strayed offside from Adam Lallana's pass.\nBut the visitors' luck ran out in the second half as March scored twice in the space of seven minutes to put Brighton on course to a fifth win in seven top-flight games.\nGakpo had a close-range effort saved by Robert Sanchez late on, but Welbeck delivered the final blow with a strike that combined skill and audacity in equal measure.\nSeagulls going from strength to strength\nMac Allister was handed his first start since helping Argentina to World Cup glory in December, as Brighton made two changes to the team that thrashed Everton in their last league match.\nThe midfielder paraded his World Cup winners' medal before kick-off and was given a rousing reception by the Seagulls supporters, who were hoping to witness a first home league win over Liverpool since 14 January 1961 - precisely 62 years ago.\nBuoyed perhaps by Mac Allister's return to the starting line-up, Brighton played with precision and fluency from the start. March's low shot was brilliantly cleared to safety by Alexander-Arnold, before Mitoma fired past the far post after breaching the Liverpool defence.\nWhile Brighton's opener came from a Liverpool error, there was nothing fortunate about the home side's second as March finished magnificently after being played in by teenager Ferguson, who delivered the latest in a string of eye-catching performances.\nBrighton have now scored in each of their last eight games in the top flight, netting 21 goals in that run.\n\"It's one of the best performances I can remember for a long time,\" March told BBC Sport. \"It's a great day and if we keep playing like that then we'll do well, that's for sure.\n\"It was just about being patient and waiting for that right pass. We play better against the big teams at home. I don't know why.\n\"I love playing for Roberto - he's great. He puts his arm around you and tells you you're a good player.

Currently, they are ineffective from an attacking perspective.\nBowen surged to the byline towards the end of the first half and Soucek made a trademark burst into the box, but the end product of the industry was an easy catch for Wolves keeper Jose Sa.\nBy the end of October last season, Michail Antonio had scored seven goals for West Ham. He has scored 11 in 62 games since. Although he tried to unsettle Wolves' central defensive pair of Nathan Collins and Maximilian Kilman, he never managed it.\nSaid Benrahma did bring a low save out of Sa but even with fellow substitute Gianluca Scamacca joining Antonio in the two-man frontline many Hammers fans have been calling for, it was not until the final five minutes that West Ham built up any attacking momentum.\nScamacca headed a far-post opportunity wide but there appeared to be a lack of belief among the West Ham players which was certainly shared by many fans at the end.\nWolves on the march under Lopetegui\nLopetegui would not have put his reputation on the line in a Premier League relegation battle without the promise of some firepower being added to his existing squad.\nTwo new signings were involved on Saturday, with the promise of a third arriving in the form of PSG winger Pablo Sarabia.\nWolves on verge of Sarabia deal\nThe late introduction of Mario Lemina for his debut brought stability to Wolves in central midfield, but by then Lopetegui's first transfer window recruit, Atletico Madrid forward Matheus Cunha, had already made an outstanding contribution.\nCunha may not have scored but Wolves have been crying out for an effective forward with the Brazilian's pace.\nBy moving into wide areas, Cunha allowed the talented Wolves midfielders to take up positions of danger centrally. Skipper Ruben Neves threatened on a couple of occasions before the interval and also struck the bar after it, by which time Wolves were on top.\nLopetegui will clearly keep pushing, on and off the pitch but, after such a miserable few months, Molineux is alive with optimism again.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

A win would have significantly relieved that pressure as they could have leapt up to 14th, but as it is they remain deep in trouble near the foot of the table.\nThe players clearly care and showed fight and determination, particularly in the first half, and they did have chances to get a second themselves, notably through Alex Iwobi and Calvert-Lewin.\nBut as the game wore on desperation set in and the lack of quality told. After full-time a sit-in protest was held by a number of supporters as they once again showed their frustration at the board.\nSaints on the up\nA week ago, Southampton's situation looked more dire than Everton's. They had slumped to the bottom of the table and had experienced no new manager bounce under Nathan Jones.\nBut this has been a huge few days for the club as they built on their victory against Manchester City to secure a win that gives them real hope of moving out of the relegation zone.\nBrazilian defender Lyanco was a key player in the win against City and he was solid once again in this game to frustrate Everton and while they did not show masses of quality themselves, Ward-Prowse is a deadly set-piece taker capable of winning any match, as it proved at Goodison Park.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Currently, they are ineffective from an attacking perspective.\nBowen surged to the byline towards the end of the first half and Soucek made a trademark burst into the box, but the end product of the industry was an easy catch for Wolves keeper Jose Sa.\nBy the end of October last season, Michail Antonio had scored seven goals for West Ham. He has scored 11 in 62 games since. Although he tried to unsettle Wolves' central defensive pair of Nathan Collins and Maximilian Kilman, he never managed it.\nSaid Benrahma did bring a low save out of Sa but even with fellow substitute Gianluca Scamacca joining Antonio in the two-man frontline many Hammers fans have been calling for, it was not until the final five minutes that West Ham built up any attacking momentum.\nScamacca headed a far-post opportunity wide but there appeared to be a lack of belief among the West Ham players which was certainly shared by many fans at the end.\nWolves on the march under Lopetegui\nLopetegui would not have put his reputation on the line in a Premier League relegation battle without the promise of some firepower being added to his existing squad.\nTwo new signings were involved on Saturday, with the promise of a third arriving in the form of PSG winger Pablo Sarabia.\nWolves on verge of Sarabia deal\nThe late introduction of Mario Lemina for his debut brought stability to Wolves in central midfield, but by then Lopetegui's first transfer window recruit, Atletico Madrid forward Matheus Cunha, had already made an outstanding contribution.\nCunha may not have scored but Wolves have been crying out for an effective forward with the Brazilian's pace.\nBy moving into wide areas, Cunha allowed the talented Wolves midfielders to take up positions of danger centrally. Skipper Ruben Neves threatened on a couple of occasions before the interval and also struck the bar after it, by which time Wolves were on top.\nLopetegui will clearly keep pushing, on and off the pitch but, after such a miserable few months, Molineux is alive with optimism again.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It is a really positive sign for me. It hurts to lose but a really positive performance.\n\"I've tried hard to create a process and understanding of how we want to play football. I am really satisfied to now see it start to come together.\"\nMarsch, who took over last February, sees his side remain two points above the drop zone.\n\"We have to stay focused on our process and not get stressed out by the table. I want us to stay laser focused on us,\" he said.\nBailey had a hand in both goals with the Jamaican winger finishing off a counter-attack after a great run by Boubacar Kamara in just the third minute to put the hosts ahead.\nThat was Villa's only shot in the first half, with Leeds having two penalty appeals rejected, a Rodrigo goal disallowed for offside and missing big chances.\nVilla debutant Alex Moreno denied Rodrigo with a goalline clearance and keeper Emiliano Martinez pulled off a wonderful reaction stop to deny Jack Harrison from close range.\nUnai Emery's hosts were better in the second half and they got the goal to make them more comfortable - thanks to the video assistant referee.\nBailey's shot was saved by Illan Meslier with Buendia heading the rebound over the grounded goalkeeper.\nThe goal was ruled out for offside but the VAR told referee Michael Oliver that Buendia was clearly onside - and it was given.\nLeeds were given hope in the final 10 minutes though when Wilfried Gnonto cut the ball back for Bamford, making his return after two and a half months out with a groin injury, to slam home.\nBut they could not find an equaliser and remain only two points above the relegation zone, with Villa eight points further up the table in 11th.\nIt was not a perfect night for Villa, who lost left-back Lucas Digne and striker Ollie Watkins to injury in the first half.\nFollow reaction to the game here\nHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance?

It was difficult for us to play through the press.\n\"It was important to score the second goal because they were playing well to try and score and they did.\n\"It is no surprise for me that they came back.

Rodrigo, on the ground, hooked in the rebound - but he had been offside initially so the goal did not count.\nThe second half was much more even but the chances kept coming for Leeds.

Crazy for me.\n\"It's a foul as clear as day, Ivan Toney locks his arm in and pulls Marcos Senesi down. It's never a penalty.\n\"We need to work hard, there are little things that can go your way or not. We've suffered some injuries, we're weaker than we'd like to be. We've got to keep working.\"\nBournemouth, who are 17th and one point clear of the relegation zone, have now lost six games in a row since O'Neil was appointed permanent manager during the World Cup.\nThey have only won two of their past 13 in all competitions and one of their past 10 in the league.\nThose results have seen pressure build on O'Neil, who started the weekend as third favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, behind Everton's Frank Lampard and Chelsea's Graham Potter.\nDespite that, O'Neil said: \"I'm not interested. I'm working as always to win the next game.\"\nFollow reaction as Brentford beat Bournemouth\nVisit our Brentford page\nGo straight to all the best AFC Bournemouth content\nToney delivers for Brentford\nThis was the first time Toney had played in 2023 after suffering a knee injury in their victory over West Ham that concluded 2022.\nHis run in behind won the penalty with Senasi wrapping his arm under Toney's, which the Brentford striker then effectively trapped, before falling backwards onto the floor.\nJarrod Gillett had little hesitation in awarding the spot-kick, and Toney took two steps forward before side-footing the ball into the side netting, just above the reach of Neto.\nIt means he has scored four goals in his last five Premier League games, and Brentford will be hoping any ban that may come from a Football Association charge for alleged breaches of betting rules is not too substantial as they potentially push for a place in Europe.\nOverall, it was a relatively flat Brentford performance, until Dasilva burst forward and crossed for Jensen to curl home, with the win meaning the Bees have claimed 19 points from 30 available at home this season.\nAsked about potentially qualifying for Europe, Brentford boss Thomas Frank told Sky Sports: \"It is important we have dreams. Everyone needs dreams and ambitions.\n\"[Manchester United manager] Erik ten Hag said something about Alex Ferguson, who said the season starts in April. If we think too far ahead we will have a problem.\n\"It is important to celebrate our wins but after we have to work very hard and see where we will end.\"\nBournemouth lack edge again\nThere is an uncertainty about the managerial situation at Bournemouth and that won't put O'Neil at ease, especially with the club now on their longest winless run since 1983.\nSince O'Neil's appointment, the American businessman Bill Foley has taken over the club, and fans are yet to see how patient he is.\nInvestment in the playing squad was seemingly guaranteed when he took over, with Foley insisting the Cherries \"will not be relegated\" this season.\nThey are yet to make any signings in the January transfer window and saw relegation rivals Wolves, Southampton and Nottingham Forest all win on Saturday.\nThis was another performance of endeavour, suggesting the players are still behind O'Neil but they lacked a spark in the attacking areas, with Siriki Dembele's driven effort just one of two shots on target.\nDoubts will be creeping in on the south coast. The investment needs to arrive soon if Foley's bold claim is going to be true come May.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Keeper Ramsdale was outstanding and his defenders prepared to throw themselves in front of everything to protect the lead.\nThere was some ill-feeling and ugly scenes at the end when Ramsdale and Richarlison had a flare-up, before a Spurs fan appeared to aim a kick at the England keeper.\nArsenal's players were eventually dragged away to enjoy their thoroughly-deserved celebrations with their own ecstatic supporters.\nSpurs fall short again\nSpurs may have created chances and moments of anxiety for Arsenal, especially in the second half, but this was a sobering game for Conte and his players as they looked well off the pace until it was too late.\nThey were trailing once again at half time for the ninth time this season, the seventh in the Premier League, after a first period in which their mediocrity was a sharp contrast to the excellence of their rivals.\nSpurs have made a habit of slow starts and occasionally been able to dig themselves out of the hole, but they left themselves too much to do against this super-confident Arsenal outfit.\nKane was attempting to equal Jimmy Greaves' record of 266 goals for Spurs, but found Ramsdale at his best. At the other end, though, Lloris produced yet another of those errors that happen far too often to a goalkeeper of his reputation.\nSaka's cross took a deflection of Sessegnon but the French keeper had to do so much better than just let the ball drop behind him into his own net.\nIt summed up Spurs' first-half display and they remain in fifth place, five points behind Manchester United in the Champions League places having played a game more.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Chelsea's display? Send us your comments here\nLiverpool lack intensity\nThe quality of this game was reflected in the subdued atmosphere at Anfield, with the final whistle greeted with near silence apart from some very mild applause.\nLiverpool have made their reputation and based their success under manager Jurgen Klopp not simply on world-class talent but on a searing intensity that has seen teams simply blown away.\nThey currently look a shadow of that side in every respect - admittedly deprived of attacking talent such as Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino - and there were very few alarms for Chelsea and no serious work for keeper Kepa.\n\"We had good spells but couldn't keep it up,\" Klopp told BT Sport.\n\"We have to be ready for little steps and this is a little step. A clean sheet against Chelsea, we didn't create a lot of chances and they had some as well.\n\"In the end, I'm OK with 0-0 because you have to accept these steps. We can build on that.\"\nLiverpool's new signing Gakpo seems to be in a settling-in period, which is perfectly understandable, and he struggled to make an impact apart from one shot on the turn that brought a comfortable save from Kepa in front of The Kop.\nKlopp's side are now nine points off the Champions League places and it is clear they need to find that missing spark - and quickly - if they are to get anywhere near the top four.\nChelsea happier with draw\nChelsea's new manager Graham Potter has had a tough start to life at Stamford Bridge, with poor results coming as the club continue to embark on a remarkable transfer spree.\nAnd this is why Potter and Chelsea will take this point, even though they will know they had chances to make it three against a Liverpool defence that continues to look vulnerable, especially without Virgil van Dijk.\n\"I thought the performance was good,\" Potter told BT Sport. \"Happy with the team, the energy, what we tried to do. At Anfield, it is always tough. It is a clean sheet and a point, we move forward.\n\"Overall, a positive day, apart from the fact we wanted three points.\"\nThere was a big bright spot for Chelsea in the cameo from Mudryk, newly arrived from Shakhtar Donetsk but very quick - literally - to adjust to life in the Premier League when he was introduced after 55 minutes.\nHe provoked panic instantly in the veteran James Milner, who was clearly unable to cope with his pace and received a yellow card for a desperate foul before he was substituted.\nMudryk had a weaving run into the penalty area which ended with a shot into the side-netting and he was unlucky on two occasions when he stole in unnoticed at the far post.\nPotter added: \"He's not played football for a while, he's been on a mid-season break. We had to manage his minutes, but you can see his quality.\"\nNew defender Badiashile also created a good impression although he should have scored with a first-half header that was saved by Liverpool keeper Alisson.\nChelsea will regret not taking some of the opportunities they had when Liverpool's defence was stretched, but this is a time when they will accept small mercies and a point at Anfield - even with their opponents in their current reduced state - is always acceptable.\nVisit our Liverpool page\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Then we know we will have a chance to score and have players who can do that.\n\"It was a really important win for us, especially after the last couple of games, to get back to winning ways.\"\nBoss Antonio Conte, whose future is uncertain, said: \"I had a good answer from my players.

Send us your views here\nFulham had plenty of chances to score before Kane's opener with Hugo Lloris keeping out Bobby Decordova-Reid's long-range drive and Harrison Reed's snap-shot.\nBut this is now a second defeat in a row and a missed chance to go above Spurs into fifth place.\nThe game had kicked off 18 minutes late following travel problems for fans in the area and then issues with referee Paul Tierney's communication devices.\nBig night for Kane and Spurs\nIt has felt inevitable for a long time that Kane would become Spurs' top scorer if he did not move to another club first.\nHis 199th Premier League goal for Spurs in exactly 300 games means he has matched that 266-goal Greaves record, which stood for 53 years.\nIt was an expert Kane strike, taking Son Heung-min's pass with his back to goal, turning a defender and then picking his spot from outside the box.\nSpurs have started so many games slowly this season, and this match was no exception. They did not get going until the 30th minute and could easily have trailed before Kane's opener.\nThe second half was better, though, and Kane headed at Leno and then hammered a shot wide late on.\nLloris, who conceded six goals in his past two games - including his own goal against Arsenal - kept a much-needed clean sheet with five saves.\nGo straight to all the best Fulham content\nVisit our Tottenham page\nFulham still flying despite loss\nConsecutive defeats for surprise European chasers Fulham have come after they won five in a row. They should not be concerned, though, as those losses were against two of the only six teams in the country above them.\nMarco Silva's side were unlucky to lose to Newcastle and were narrowly edged out here by one of the greatest strikers in English football history.\nAs well as saved first-half chances for Decordova-Reid, Reed and Willian, Aleksandar Mitrovic headed on to the roof of the net and Manor Solomon's curling effort was tipped wide by Lloris.\nThey had a good crack at it in six minutes of injury time but fell just short.\n\"Our goal is clear from the first moment and people have said we were favourites to go down again,\" said Silva. \"We are here to fight and staying in the Premier League is what we want to do.

He is a top bloke from the times I've been with him, but I have to think about my position because me winning one game doesn't mean everything is fine.\"\nReaction to West Ham v Everton and all the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate West Ham's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here\nUnder-fire Everton owner Farhad Moshiri was attending his first game in 14 months, alongside the directors who missed last week's home defeat by Southampton because of what Everton said was a \"real and credible\" threat to their safety, in a show of support for Lampard and defiance of his critics.\nBut his return didn't bring Everton any luck. They have now gone 10 games without a win in all competitions and have picked up a single point - at Manchester City - in a run of seven games that has included five defeats against teams around them in the relegation battle.\nThe final whistle brought more boos from the Everton contingent and also banners being raised proclaiming 'Sack the Board' and 'No Communication, No Plan, No Vision'.\nBowen's double the difference\nManagers are forever talking about the fine margins that make the difference between success and failure.\nBowen's opener could not have been finer. On first glance, it appeared he was offside as he advanced on to Kurt Zouma's header to knock the ball past Jordan Pickford. But VAR spotted James Tarkowski's leg was playing the England man on by about an inch.\nIf trials agreed by the International Football Association Board are successful, next season the supporters inside the ground may get an actual explanation. Instead, they had to make do with referee Stuart Atwell pointing to the centre circle.\nHaving gone 12 games without a goal, Bowen's next arrived seven minutes later as Tarkowski dived into a tackle on Michail Antonio in a position of little danger, allowing the West Ham forward to run into the box and deliver a low cross which was driven home from close range.\nHad Alex Iwobi pulled one back before the break with a shot that was going in until it deflected off Declan Rice, then on to a post, Everton might have found a way back into the contest.\nBut, having established a crucial advantage, West Ham were not in the mood to let it go.\n\"The only difference between this and the other performances was scoring two goals,\" said Moyes.\n\"We have had a couple of extraordinary years and we are all disappointed that we haven't hit that height this year, but we need time for some players to settle in. Hopefully we can build that team and are on the right track now.\"\nMoshiri in the spotlight\nThe big question for Everton is what does Moshiri do now?\nAfter spending so long not watching his team in the flesh, this provided him with the evidence for where his tenure - and an outlay in excess of \u00a3500m - has left them.\nAlthough they dominated for an extended period at the start of the second half, Everton lacked the guile to prise open a determined home defence. Danny Ings' introduction for his debut 20 minutes from time must have been particularly painful for Lampard as the striker was someone he was trying to attract to Goodison Park before he moved to West Ham for an initial \u00a312m on Friday.\nIndeed, it was West Ham who came closest to adding to their lead as Pickford turned Emerson's shot on to the bar, and Rice rolled an effort marginally wide of the far post.\nMoshiri was sat on the same row as chairman Bill Kenwright, chief executive Denise Barrett-Baxendale and between football director Kevin Thelwell and director Graeme Sharp.\nKenwright was shown on his own near the end, but it is Moshiri who must now decide whether Lampard will remain in his job, the former West Ham player taunted with a \"sacked in the morning\" jibe from the home fans.\nWest Ham say farewell to David Gold\nThe result was at least fitting on the day West Ham paid tribute to joint chairman David Gold, who died on 4 January.\nBorn in the shadow of Upton Park, a lifelong fan of the club and a player in his schooldays, Gold was viewed as the least problematic of an ownership group many fans do not like.\nThe stadium was full and paid a respectful tribute to Gold before the game, with sporting director Mark Noble laying a wreath on behalf of the club before kick-off, flanked by Gold's daughters, Jacqueline and Vanessa.\nA video of Gold's journey from childhood poverty - \"I only wanted to own a bike\" - to football club owner was greeted with warm applause.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Send us your views here\nMagpies remarkable run goes on\nWhen Newcastle lost 2-1 at Liverpool on 31 August, even their optimistic fans could barely have dreamed they would enter February with that as their only league defeat.\nThis point at Palace saw them beat their record of 14 top-flight games without defeat - achieved in 1950 and 2011 (both times across two seasons).\nTheir run of keeping first-half clean sheets goes on even longer. Eddie Howe's side are now the first team in more than 20 years - since Liverpool in 2002 - to go 16 Premier League games without conceding in the opening period.\nEvidence pointed to this being a goalless draw. It was 0-0 between the sides at St James' Park in September and November, that time a Carabao Cup tie the Magpies won on penalties.\nThey had enough chances to win this one, but this is now their third goalless draw in four league games.\nJoelinton's three first-half efforts saved by Guaita were all fairly tame. The Spaniard also kept out headers from Wilson and substitute Isak, and Botman powered one of his own wide.\nMiguel Almiron volleyed an early chance into the side-netting, and Dan Burn and Botman were also denied by the Palace keeper.\n\"I'm really pleased with the team today,\" Howe told BBC Sport. \"We were ourselves and we had chances, we just didn't take them.\n\"There were a lot of half-chance moments and presentable opportunities - a lot of moments where we didn't quite get our final ball right.\n\"We have high expectations of ourselves.

The 17-year-old is now Palace's youngest Premier League player.\nTheir best chances in the first half came in quick succession. Odsonne Edouard had a shot blocked wide and, from the following corner, Chris Richards headed over.\nMateta's powerful shot inside the box was their only effort on target in the game.\nThey will hope Zaha's injury, pulling up as he chased a ball, is not serious. He is Palace's top scorer in all competitions, on six goals, which sums up their difficulties.\n\"When Wilfried comes off from injuries, it can only be not good news because he always wants to carry on and stay on the field,\" Vieira said.\n\"I'm trying to improve the squad.

That is five more than Luis Suarez managed in 2013-14, the previous highest figure at this stage in the season.\nThe Norwegian striker's current total would have been enough to earn him the Golden Boot in more than half of the 30 campaigns since the English top flight was renamed in 1992.\nHe has also already scored as many Premier League hat-tricks as Mo Salah, and a third of Sergio Aguero's record 12, which the Argentine achieved across his magnificent decade with City.\nOnly Alan Shearer has scored more Premier League hat-tricks in a single season, with five.\nHow did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Wolves' display? Send us your views here\nHaaland driving City on\nWhen Guardiola came out with his extraordinary rant after the win over Tottenham, he spoke about the difficulty of maintaining drive and determination when you are so used to winning.\nThat is why Haaland is so important to this team.\nThe Norwegian's last league title was three years ago in Austria. His last trophy was the German Cup with Borussia Dortmund in 2021.\nIf the idea of a fifth championship in six seasons fails to motivate some City players, Haaland is not among them, and his thirst for goals could be a telling factor as the second half of this season unfolds.\nGuardiola saw no point in pushing the striker, and replaced him with World Cup winner Julian Alvarez after an hour.\nMore good news for City is that Jack Grealish also seems to be finding more consistency.\nHis teasing advances from the left are more reminiscent of his Aston Villa days and would have brought him a first-half goal had Sa not made one superb save and Nathan Collins not been in the right place at the right time to head another effort off the line.\nMahrez had an effort ruled out for offside, after which City cruised home and Haaland was able to take the acclaim of the home fans at the end.\nLopetegui's Wolves stall\nThis was the first significant setback for Julen Lopetegui since he replaced Bruno Lage as Wolves boss during the World Cup.\nIf there is comfort for the former Spain and Real Madrid coach, it comes from the knowledge there are not many more demanding tests than this, even if his side only remain outside the relegation zone on goal difference.\nThe arrival of Craig Dawson for \u00a33.3m from West Ham should help shore up a hesitant defence, while a first start for Mario Lemina here, plus a debut for Pablo Sarabia, further creates a team Lopetegui can work with - especially if his other transfer window target, Flamengo's Joao Gomes, can be kept out of Lyon's clutches.\nHe clearly wants more width from Wolves' passing, although he does have a week to work on that, with his side not involved in the FA Cup fourth round next weekend.\nFebruary will then be a crucial month, with Wolves taking on two sides presently below them, Southampton and Bournemouth, in successive weeks.\nCertainly no-one could accuse Lopetegui of not being invested in his job. He was booked along with Neves for arguing over an incident when City's Rico Lewis appeared to bring down Hwang Hee-chan, when the South Korean was about to set off on a long run towards to City goal before Haaland changed the direction of the contest.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Chelsea's display? Send us your comments here\nLiverpool lack intensity\nThe quality of this game was reflected in the subdued atmosphere at Anfield, with the final whistle greeted with near silence apart from some very mild applause.\nLiverpool have made their reputation and based their success under manager Jurgen Klopp not simply on world-class talent but on a searing intensity that has seen teams simply blown away.\nThey currently look a shadow of that side in every respect - admittedly deprived of attacking talent such as Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino - and there were very few alarms for Chelsea and no serious work for keeper Kepa.\n\"We had good spells but couldn't keep it up,\" Klopp told BT Sport.\n\"We have to be ready for little steps and this is a little step. A clean sheet against Chelsea, we didn't create a lot of chances and they had some as well.\n\"In the end, I'm OK with 0-0 because you have to accept these steps. We can build on that.\"\nLiverpool's new signing Gakpo seems to be in a settling-in period, which is perfectly understandable, and he struggled to make an impact apart from one shot on the turn that brought a comfortable save from Kepa in front of The Kop.\nKlopp's side are now nine points off the Champions League places and it is clear they need to find that missing spark - and quickly - if they are to get anywhere near the top four.\nChelsea happier with draw\nChelsea's new manager Graham Potter has had a tough start to life at Stamford Bridge, with poor results coming as the club continue to embark on a remarkable transfer spree.\nAnd this is why Potter and Chelsea will take this point, even though they will know they had chances to make it three against a Liverpool defence that continues to look vulnerable, especially without Virgil van Dijk.\n\"I thought the performance was good,\" Potter told BT Sport. \"Happy with the team, the energy, what we tried to do. At Anfield, it is always tough. It is a clean sheet and a point, we move forward.\n\"Overall, a positive day, apart from the fact we wanted three points.\"\nThere was a big bright spot for Chelsea in the cameo from Mudryk, newly arrived from Shakhtar Donetsk but very quick - literally - to adjust to life in the Premier League when he was introduced after 55 minutes.\nHe provoked panic instantly in the veteran James Milner, who was clearly unable to cope with his pace and received a yellow card for a desperate foul before he was substituted.\nMudryk had a weaving run into the penalty area which ended with a shot into the side-netting and he was unlucky on two occasions when he stole in unnoticed at the far post.\nPotter added: \"He's not played football for a while, he's been on a mid-season break. We had to manage his minutes, but you can see his quality.\"\nNew defender Badiashile also created a good impression although he should have scored with a first-half header that was saved by Liverpool keeper Alisson.\nChelsea will regret not taking some of the opportunities they had when Liverpool's defence was stretched, but this is a time when they will accept small mercies and a point at Anfield - even with their opponents in their current reduced state - is always acceptable.\nVisit our Liverpool page\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Midfielder Dennis Praet fired in a cross for Jamie Vardy to get on the end of only for Sanchez to block smartly and Barnes created another chance with a counter-attack down the left, but his pass to Vardy was poor and Estupinan cleared.\nThings then started to feel all-too familiar for the Foxes when in the space of seven first-half minutes Mitoma opened the scoring for the visitors and then Praet limped off having only just returned from injury.\nAfter fighting back to take the lead, they then defended hard although they also had a let-off when Solly March, who was not quite in the same form that has seen him score four goals in his last four games, leaned back and ballooned a shot over the bar from a Mitoma cut-back.\nHowever, sitting deep for almost 30 minutes against a tenacious Brighton was always going to be a difficult ask for a side who have conceded 10 goals in their last five games.\nLeicester fans did at least have the welcome return of James Maddison, who returned to the team after spending 10 weeks out with a knee injury he picked up before the World Cup in Qatar. With 20 minutes remaining, the forward came off the bench to replace Kieran Dewsbury-Hall.\nSupporters may also have been pleased with a point against the in-form Brighton if asked at the start of the match but conceding a goal in the 89th minute delivers yet another blow to Rodgers' campaign.\n\"[It] should have been a win,\" said the Leicester boss. \"I'm obviously disappointed with that but delighted for the players in terms of the gameplan. We nullified them. I thought the players did that excellently.\n\"We were the better team in the first half, we gave away the ball cheaply and then their guy scores a fantastic goal. But the players showed great spirit to get back into it..\n\"In terms of battling performance, we are nowhere near the level where I want us to be with the ball. But what we had today was a real spirit and a mentality. I think the supporters would have seen that so we put a marker down for the rest of the season for what we have to do in terms of our fight and mentality.\"\nStay up to date with all things Leicester\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Newcastle's display? Send us your views here\nMagpies remarkable run goes on\nWhen Newcastle lost 2-1 at Liverpool on 31 August, even their optimistic fans could barely have dreamed they would enter February with that as their only league defeat.\nThis point at Palace saw them beat their record of 14 top-flight games without defeat - achieved in 1950 and 2011 (both times across two seasons).\nTheir run of keeping first-half clean sheets goes on even longer. Eddie Howe's side are now the first team in more than 20 years - since Liverpool in 2002 - to go 16 Premier League games without conceding in the opening period.\nEvidence pointed to this being a goalless draw. It was 0-0 between the sides at St James' Park in September and November, that time a Carabao Cup tie the Magpies won on penalties.\nThey had enough chances to win this one, but this is now their third goalless draw in four league games.\nJoelinton's three first-half efforts saved by Guaita were all fairly tame. The Spaniard also kept out headers from Wilson and substitute Isak, and Botman powered one of his own wide.\nMiguel Almiron volleyed an early chance into the side-netting, and Dan Burn and Botman were also denied by the Palace keeper.\n\"I'm really pleased with the team today,\" Howe told BBC Sport. \"We were ourselves and we had chances, we just didn't take them.\n\"There were a lot of half-chance moments and presentable opportunities - a lot of moments where we didn't quite get our final ball right.\n\"We have high expectations of ourselves. It was two teams trying to impose themselves and trying to win. We dominated for long spells, they defended well.\"\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\nVisit our Newcastle United page\nAnother mixed bag for Palace\nPalace are 12th, seven points clear of the relegation zone, but have only netted 18 goals in 20 Premier League games this season. Another mid-table season beckons and maybe that is fine for them.\nThe potential is there but tangible progression, not so much.\nBoss Patrick Vieira ended up making four changes from the side that drew 1-1 with Manchester United, although that quartet ended up coming on in the second half - along with late debutant David Ozoh. The 17-year-old is now Palace's youngest Premier League player.\nTheir best chances in the first half came in quick succession. Odsonne Edouard had a shot blocked wide and, from the following corner, Chris Richards headed over.\nMateta's powerful shot inside the box was their only effort on target in the game.\nThey will hope Zaha's injury, pulling up as he chased a ball, is not serious. He is Palace's top scorer in all competitions, on six goals, which sums up their difficulties.\n\"When Wilfried comes off from injuries, it can only be not good news because he always wants to carry on and stay on the field,\" Vieira said.\n\"I'm trying to improve the squad. We know the profile of the players that we want. Now it's in the hands of the club to try and make it happen. The team needs help and I hope we'll bring those players in.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He is a top bloke from the times I've been with him, but I have to think about my position because me winning one game doesn't mean everything is fine.\"\nReaction to West Ham v Everton and all the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate West Ham's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here\nUnder-fire Everton owner Farhad Moshiri was attending his first game in 14 months, alongside the directors who missed last week's home defeat by Southampton because of what Everton said was a \"real and credible\" threat to their safety, in a show of support for Lampard and defiance of his critics.\nBut his return didn't bring Everton any luck. They have now gone 10 games without a win in all competitions and have picked up a single point - at Manchester City - in a run of seven games that has included five defeats against teams around them in the relegation battle.\nThe final whistle brought more boos from the Everton contingent and also banners being raised proclaiming 'Sack the Board' and 'No Communication, No Plan, No Vision'.\nBowen's double the difference\nManagers are forever talking about the fine margins that make the difference between success and failure.\nBowen's opener could not have been finer. On first glance, it appeared he was offside as he advanced on to Kurt Zouma's header to knock the ball past Jordan Pickford. But VAR spotted James Tarkowski's leg was playing the England man on by about an inch.\nIf trials agreed by the International Football Association Board are successful, next season the supporters inside the ground may get an actual explanation. Instead, they had to make do with referee Stuart Atwell pointing to the centre circle.\nHaving gone 12 games without a goal, Bowen's next arrived seven minutes later as Tarkowski dived into a tackle on Michail Antonio in a position of little danger, allowing the West Ham forward to run into the box and deliver a low cross which was driven home from close range.\nHad Alex Iwobi pulled one back before the break with a shot that was going in until it deflected off Declan Rice, then on to a post, Everton might have found a way back into the contest.\nBut, having established a crucial advantage, West Ham were not in the mood to let it go.\n\"The only difference between this and the other performances was scoring two goals,\" said Moyes.\n\"We have had a couple of extraordinary years and we are all disappointed that we haven't hit that height this year, but we need time for some players to settle in. Hopefully we can build that team and are on the right track now.\"\nMoshiri in the spotlight\nThe big question for Everton is what does Moshiri do now?\nAfter spending so long not watching his team in the flesh, this provided him with the evidence for where his tenure - and an outlay in excess of \u00a3500m - has left them.\nAlthough they dominated for an extended period at the start of the second half, Everton lacked the guile to prise open a determined home defence. Danny Ings' introduction for his debut 20 minutes from time must have been particularly painful for Lampard as the striker was someone he was trying to attract to Goodison Park before he moved to West Ham for an initial \u00a312m on Friday.\nIndeed, it was West Ham who came closest to adding to their lead as Pickford turned Emerson's shot on to the bar, and Rice rolled an effort marginally wide of the far post.\nMoshiri was sat on the same row as chairman Bill Kenwright, chief executive Denise Barrett-Baxendale and between football director Kevin Thelwell and director Graeme Sharp.\nKenwright was shown on his own near the end, but it is Moshiri who must now decide whether Lampard will remain in his job, the former West Ham player taunted with a \"sacked in the morning\" jibe from the home fans.\nWest Ham say farewell to David Gold\nThe result was at least fitting on the day West Ham paid tribute to joint chairman David Gold, who died on 4 January.\nBorn in the shadow of Upton Park, a lifelong fan of the club and a player in his schooldays, Gold was viewed as the least problematic of an ownership group many fans do not like.\nThe stadium was full and paid a respectful tribute to Gold before the game, with sporting director Mark Noble laying a wreath on behalf of the club before kick-off, flanked by Gold's daughters, Jacqueline and Vanessa.\nA video of Gold's journey from childhood poverty - \"I only wanted to own a bike\" - to football club owner was greeted with warm applause.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nHaaland driving City on\nWhen Guardiola came out with his extraordinary rant after the win over Tottenham, he spoke about the difficulty of maintaining drive and determination when you are so used to winning.\nThat is why Haaland is so important to this team.\nThe Norwegian's last league title was three years ago in Austria. His last trophy was the German Cup with Borussia Dortmund in 2021.\nIf the idea of a fifth championship in six seasons fails to motivate some City players, Haaland is not among them, and his thirst for goals could be a telling factor as the second half of this season unfolds.\nGuardiola saw no point in pushing the striker, and replaced him with World Cup winner Julian Alvarez after an hour.\nMore good news for City is that Jack Grealish also seems to be finding more consistency.\nHis teasing advances from the left are more reminiscent of his Aston Villa days and would have brought him a first-half goal had Sa not made one superb save and Nathan Collins not been in the right place at the right time to head another effort off the line.\nMahrez had an effort ruled out for offside, after which City cruised home and Haaland was able to take the acclaim of the home fans at the end.\nLopetegui's Wolves stall\nThis was the first significant setback for Julen Lopetegui since he replaced Bruno Lage as Wolves boss during the World Cup.\nIf there is comfort for the former Spain and Real Madrid coach, it comes from the knowledge there are not many more demanding tests than this, even if his side only remain outside the relegation zone on goal difference.\nThe arrival of Craig Dawson for \u00a33.3m from West Ham should help shore up a hesitant defence, while a first start for Mario Lemina here, plus a debut for Pablo Sarabia, further creates a team Lopetegui can work with - especially if his other transfer window target, Flamengo's Joao Gomes, can be kept out of Lyon's clutches.\nHe clearly wants more width from Wolves' passing, although he does have a week to work on that, with his side not involved in the FA Cup fourth round next weekend.\nFebruary will then be a crucial month, with Wolves taking on two sides presently below them, Southampton and Bournemouth, in successive weeks.\nCertainly no-one could accuse Lopetegui of not being invested in his job. He was booked along with Neves for arguing over an incident when City's Rico Lewis appeared to bring down Hwang Hee-chan, when the South Korean was about to set off on a long run towards to City goal before Haaland changed the direction of the contest.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nSchlupp halved the deficit almost immediately and amid increasingly frantic scenes around the home area, United ended the game with four central defenders protecting their goal as Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof were added to starting pair Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane.\nRespective managers Erik ten Hag and Patrick Vieira, who started the afternoon laying wreaths in honour of the victims of the 1958 Munich air disaster, ended it ranting at fourth official Joshua Smith and then marching to the centre circle to make their points to Marriner as both argued against decisions that went against their team.\nUnited's 13th consecutive win at Old Trafford lifts them to third in the table while Palace remain 12th.\nRashford and Fred key for United\nWith Antony Martial ruled out through injury, Rashford's goals output is going to be crucial for United.\nHe now has 19 in all competitions and the England man also claimed an assist for the hosts' opener when his cross was handled by Hughes and Fernandes converted the resulting penalty.\nIf Rashford's goals are needed, and with Casemiro now missing two Premier League games within five days against Leeds and the home encounter with Leicester on 19 February, Fred is almost as important.\nThe Brazilian has tended to be held up as an example of United's profligacy in the transfer market.\nHe cost \u00a347m in 2018 but has rarely shown anything positive beyond running around furiously to no great end product.\nYet, as Ten Hag pointed out recently, the midfielder partners Casemiro for his country \"and Brazil are not a bad side\", suggesting the 29-year-old is capable of more than he has produced in his nearly five seasons in the Premier League.\nHe has looked a different player in recent times.\nFred still hustles and harries but he also links play well, is prepared to shoot from distance and, as he proved when he burst into the box and sent Wout Weghorst's cut-back to the near post narrowly wide of the Palace goal, can be a significant threat inside the area as well.\nWhen he laid on his back deep in injury time and gulped in some air, it underlined the effort Fred had put in during the desperate defending United were forced into at the end.\nPalace poor run continues\nThis was yet another day when Palace played well and ended without reward.\nVieira's side now have five points from their past eight games, form that must be overturned if they are to stay out of trouble at the bottom of the table.\nSchlupp was excellent. His goal was instinctive and he also created an opening in the first half with a neat turn into space.\nThe absence of Wilfried Zaha with a hamstring injury was not a major blow in that sense and it took a brilliant David de Gea save to deny skipper Marc Guehi and concede the corner from which Palace scored.\nHowever, while they are unquestionably a better side to watch than in Roy Hodgson's day, they are also easier to score against.\nThey have only five top-flight clean sheets all season and the room Rashford was afforded for what turned out to be the winner was poor considering how close he was to goal. Amid the fluidity of his side further forward, Vieira must not neglect the basic art of defending.\nGo straight to all the best Manchester United content\nVisit our Crystal Palace page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

He's showed fantastic humility - he's really trying to buy in to how we play and the surroundings of the club so I've only got positive things to say at the moment.\n\"We're delighted in the dressing room and he's quite composed in the corner thinking: 'I've done that before.'\"\nA reliable goalscorer is often touted as crucial in a relegation scrap - Johnson is beginning to step up to that role - but a goalkeeper to bail you out when you're not at your best is priceless.\nEven at 36, Navas looks perfectly equipped to be that man for Forest.\nLeeds rue missed chances - again - before fading\nAnother dispiriting result leaves Leeds without a Premier League since 5 November.\nEven taking into account the break for the World Cup, it is a statistic that makes for grim reading for their supporters.\nGiven the way Marsch's side started at the City Ground, it could so easily have been the day they snapped that winless streak.\nThey were bright, popping the ball around quickly and creating openings with the impressive Gnonto central to their threat.\nHowever, they were let down by an all-too-familiar failing as a number of presentable chances were passed up.\nGnonto squared for Sinisterra, who leaned back and blazed his shot over the bar. The Italian winger then cut the ball back for Bamford, who fluffed the shot; Ayling kept it alive but put his shot too close to the goalkeeper.\nThen Gnonto himself had a chance, pouncing on an error by Neco Williams, but his near-post effort was pushed away.\nAs well as Navas played, more than once Leeds really should not have given him a chance.\n\"We are struggling to turn performances into results and we've been in this place for a while,\" Marsch told BBC Sport.\n\"It's hard for me to accept and it's frustrating.

He was outstanding. We have been crying out for that balance to the team.

Maddison, making his first league start in two months, was a class act throughout and soon equalised after Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall robbed Boubacar Kamara, before Tete made his mark.\nThe Brazilian went close with two curling efforts after good runs down the right and stayed alert to round Martinez and score with style.\n\"Tete was outstanding,\" said Maddison. \"He plays on the right, which is where I've had to play, so it's nice to get some pace out there.\n\"There's a positivity around the club with some new faces and we got the points today.\n\"Getting new players in the door gives you a lift. The table doesn't lie, but we know we can inject some oomph to go on a winning run. We are capable of that.\"\nThe unfortunate own goal aside, Souttar looked an imposing presence on his Premier League bow, and third new signing Victor Kristiansen also posed a threat from left-back.\nThe new faces held firm as Villa poured forward after the break, and a first win since the World Cup has seen Leicester rise to 13th in the table, with some tough tests ahead.\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nVisit our Leicester City page\nErrors cost improving Villa\nGoing into the game, only league leaders Arsenal had won more points than Villa since the World Cup break, and Emery will be left scratching his head at how this one got away.\nIndividual errors were costly as Kamara was stripped of the ball inside his own penalty area for Maddison's equaliser after collecting a pass from his goalkeeper under pressure, before he also lost the ball cheaply in the build-up to Tete's strike.\nVilla still managed 19 shots on goal in a busy attacking display, and had Watkins converted an open goal, and had Buendia's header looped in instead of hitting the crossbar in the first half, the result could easily have been different.\nBut Praet capitalised on another error at the back to finally kill off Villa late on.\n\"We had mistakes today,\" Emery said. \"Leicester were at the bottom of the table but they have very good players and we gave them chances.\n\"We had good moments, created chances, but our mistakes were really big mistakes.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nSchlupp halved the deficit almost immediately and amid increasingly frantic scenes around the home area, United ended the game with four central defenders protecting their goal as Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof were added to starting pair Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane.\nRespective managers Erik ten Hag and Patrick Vieira, who started the afternoon laying wreaths in honour of the victims of the 1958 Munich air disaster, ended it ranting at fourth official Joshua Smith and then marching to the centre circle to make their points to Marriner as both argued against decisions that went against their team.\nUnited's 13th consecutive win at Old Trafford lifts them to third in the table while Palace remain 12th.\nRashford and Fred key for United\nWith Antony Martial ruled out through injury, Rashford's goals output is going to be crucial for United.\nHe now has 19 in all competitions and the England man also claimed an assist for the hosts' opener when his cross was handled by Hughes and Fernandes converted the resulting penalty.\nIf Rashford's goals are needed, and with Casemiro now missing two Premier League games within five days against Leeds and the home encounter with Leicester on 19 February, Fred is almost as important.\nThe Brazilian has tended to be held up as an example of United's profligacy in the transfer market.\nHe cost \u00a347m in 2018 but has rarely shown anything positive beyond running around furiously to no great end product.\nYet, as Ten Hag pointed out recently, the midfielder partners Casemiro for his country \"and Brazil are not a bad side\", suggesting the 29-year-old is capable of more than he has produced in his nearly five seasons in the Premier League.\nHe has looked a different player in recent times.\nFred still hustles and harries but he also links play well, is prepared to shoot from distance and, as he proved when he burst into the box and sent Wout Weghorst's cut-back to the near post narrowly wide of the Palace goal, can be a significant threat inside the area as well.\nWhen he laid on his back deep in injury time and gulped in some air, it underlined the effort Fred had put in during the desperate defending United were forced into at the end.\nPalace poor run continues\nThis was yet another day when Palace played well and ended without reward.\nVieira's side now have five points from their past eight games, form that must be overturned if they are to stay out of trouble at the bottom of the table.\nSchlupp was excellent. His goal was instinctive and he also created an opening in the first half with a neat turn into space.\nThe absence of Wilfried Zaha with a hamstring injury was not a major blow in that sense and it took a brilliant David de Gea save to deny skipper Marc Guehi and concede the corner from which Palace scored.\nHowever, while they are unquestionably a better side to watch than in Roy Hodgson's day, they are also easier to score against.\nThey have only five top-flight clean sheets all season and the room Rashford was afforded for what turned out to be the winner was poor considering how close he was to goal.

Send us your views here\nMitoma the hero again\nCaicedo's omission meant Brighton started a league game without either the Ecuadorian or the suspended Mac Allister for only the second time this season, the other occasion being the 4-2 defeat at home by Arsenal on 31 December.\nThe Seagulls, who were also without in-form teenager Evan Ferguson through injury, looked set to draw a blank for the first time in a Premier League game since October until Mitoma's late effort.\nThey controlled possession early on as Bournemouth set up camp inside their own half, but Undav somehow failed to put the hosts ahead with a quarter of an hour played.\nThe German striker, making only his second league start this season, intercepted Neto's misplaced pass but after Mepham blocked his initial effort, Undav proceeded to fire straight at the Bournemouth goalkeeper before shooting against the post with his second follow-up shot.\nBournemouth improved as the half wore on but Welbeck headed straight at Neto from Solly March's delivery, then steered a low Undav cross wide of the far post shortly before half-time.\nCaicedo was given a rousing reception by the Brighton supporters when he entered the fray just before the hour mark, but it was the midfielder's compatriot Estupinan who came to the home side's rescue midway through the second period by throwing himself in front of Semenyo's shot.\nBrighton's late pressure eventually told, though - Neto getting a hand to Mitoma's header but failing to stop the ball crossing the goal-line.\nImproved Bournemouth left empty handed\nBournemouth manager Gary O'Neil handed debuts to January signings Semenyo and Hamed Traore, while Dango Ouattara made his second appearance following an eye-catching Premier League introduction against Nottingham Forest a fortnight ago.\nThe trio failed to make the scoresheet but their pace, direct running and energy could prove a major asset as Bournemouth look to avoid an immediate return to the Championship this season.\nSemenyo's tremendous solo run midway through the second period deserved a better outcome - but the former Bristol City player was thwarted by Estupinan's block.\nLerma should have done better from Anthony's cross in the first half, while O'Neil will feel his team should have been awarded a penalty either side of half-time.\nEstupinan's robust challenge on Ouattara went unpunished in the first half, before Ryan Christie's cross appeared to strike the full-back on the hand in the second.\nVictories for fellow strugglers Everton, Wolves and Leicester compounded a miserable afternoon for the visitors, whose next five league games include encounters with Newcastle, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-0 Bournemouth: Kaoru Mitoma strikes late to earn victory\nBrighton manager Roberto de Zerbi described Kaoru Mitoma as a \"great player\" you can \"never substitute\" after the Japanese winger scored a late winner for the second game running to hand Brighton victory over Bournemouth.\nMitoma, whose stoppage-time goal knocked holders Liverpool out of the FA Cup last weekend, steered a header past Cherries goalkeeper Neto with three minutes remaining to spark joyous scenes among the home supporters.\nThis latest effort was Mitoma's sixth in his past nine appearances across all competitions and his seventh overall in 2022-23, making him the club's joint-top scorer alongside Alexis Mac Allister, Pascal Gross and Leandro Trossard.\n\"He has a natural quality,\" De Zerbi said of the 25-year-old.\n\"Today he didn't play a fantastic game, but when you have Mitoma on the pitch you can never substitute him because you always expect one goal.\"\nDeniz Undav should have put the home side ahead in the first half, shooting against the post from close range after being denied twice in quick succession by blocks from Chris Mepham and Neto.\nJefferson Lerma shot wide from Jaidon Anthony's cross as Bournemouth began to grow into the contest, but the hosts continued to carve out the better openings and twice went close through Danny Welbeck before half-time.\nBilly Gilmour fired into the side-netting and Cherries debutant Antoine Semenyo had a shot blocked by the retreating Pervis Estupinan in a delicately poised second half, before Mitoma's late header broke the visitors' hearts.\nDe Zerbi left Moises Caicedo out of his starting line-up after the Ecuadorian midfielder's attempts to force a move away from the club during the January transfer window.\nThe Seagulls climb to sixth, while Bournemouth are 19th after Everton's victory over Arsenal in Saturday's early game.\nReaction to Brighton v Bournemouth and Saturday's other Premier League games\nHow did you rate Brighton's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here\nMitoma the hero again\nCaicedo's omission meant Brighton started a league game without either the Ecuadorian or the suspended Mac Allister for only the second time this season, the other occasion being the 4-2 defeat at home by Arsenal on 31 December.\nThe Seagulls, who were also without in-form teenager Evan Ferguson through injury, looked set to draw a blank for the first time in a Premier League game since October until Mitoma's late effort.\nThey controlled possession early on as Bournemouth set up camp inside their own half, but Undav somehow failed to put the hosts ahead with a quarter of an hour played.\nThe German striker, making only his second league start this season, intercepted Neto's misplaced pass but after Mepham blocked his initial effort, Undav proceeded to fire straight at the Bournemouth goalkeeper before shooting against the post with his second follow-up shot.\nBournemouth improved as the half wore on but Welbeck headed straight at Neto from Solly March's delivery, then steered a low Undav cross wide of the far post shortly before half-time.\nCaicedo was given a rousing reception by the Brighton supporters when he entered the fray just before the hour mark, but it was the midfielder's compatriot Estupinan who came to the home side's rescue midway through the second period by throwing himself in front of Semenyo's shot.\nBrighton's late pressure eventually told, though - Neto getting a hand to Mitoma's header but failing to stop the ball crossing the goal-line.\nImproved Bournemouth left empty handed\nBournemouth manager Gary O'Neil handed debuts to January signings Semenyo and Hamed Traore, while Dango Ouattara made his second appearance following an eye-catching Premier League introduction against Nottingham Forest a fortnight ago.\nThe trio failed to make the scoresheet but their pace, direct running and energy could prove a major asset as Bournemouth look to avoid an immediate return to the Championship this season.\nSemenyo's tremendous solo run midway through the second period deserved a better outcome - but the former Bristol City player was thwarted by Estupinan's block.\nLerma should have done better from Anthony's cross in the first half, while O'Neil will feel his team should have been awarded a penalty either side of half-time.\nEstupinan's robust challenge on Ouattara went unpunished in the first half, before Ryan Christie's cross appeared to strike the full-back on the hand in the second.\nVictories for fellow strugglers Everton, Wolves and Leicester compounded a miserable afternoon for the visitors, whose next five league games include encounters with Newcastle, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Maddison, making his first league start in two months, was a class act throughout and soon equalised after Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall robbed Boubacar Kamara, before Tete made his mark.\nThe Brazilian went close with two curling efforts after good runs down the right and stayed alert to round Martinez and score with style.\n\"Tete was outstanding,\" said Maddison. \"He plays on the right, which is where I've had to play, so it's nice to get some pace out there.\n\"There's a positivity around the club with some new faces and we got the points today.\n\"Getting new players in the door gives you a lift.

At 1-0 we were [doing] well but we lost our confidence a bit when they scored.\"\nWith just two defeats under the former Arsenal manager, Villa are 11th and could have a European place in sight if they have a strong run-in.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

But this win - plus the manner of it and where it was achieved - made it feel much more than that.\nScratch beneath the surface and it is hard to escape the sense that this highly-charged encounter in north London might just have been the night when the momentum in the title race shifted decisively.\nArteta has 'more belief' Arsenal can win title\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nArsenal have been outstanding this season, showing steel and character to pass the sternest tests placed in front of them - Liverpool and Manchester United beaten at home, Chelsea and Tottenham overcome on their travels.\nWhen Arsenal won at Spurs on 18 January, they were eight points clear of City with both having played 18 games. They had momentum as well as a formidable advantage.\nCity, by contrast, have been short of their imperious best despite the avalanche of Erling Haaland goals - losing at home to Brentford, drawing with Everton and recently slipping up at Spurs.\nFor all that, for all the feeling that City were missing the old spark and fluency, an Arsenal stumble sees Pep Guardiola's side back in that old familiar position.\nArteta's side have claimed only one point out of the last nine, losing at Everton, drawing at home to Brentford then slipping against City. It has proved an expensive spell.\nArsenal are still right in this title race, make no mistake, but as they trooped off to sympathetic applause and City's players fist-pumped in front of their joyous fans, there was a feeling of deflation around the stadium.\nThe Gunners have been full on and thrilling to watch. City have often looked like a team in search of their usual \"X Factor.\"\nAnd yet City are now back at the summit. It will be tough for Arsenal to take.\nArsenal nursed a justifiable grievance after the 1-1 draw with Brentford here on Saturday, Ivan Toney's equaliser the result of incompetence by those running VAR.\nHere, Arsenal could not blame anyone but themselves. They were guilty of the sort of individual errors that invited City to inflict heavy punishment. They duly did and Arsenal ended up well beaten.\nTakehiro Tomiyasu did not see Kevin de Bruyne lurking when he found him with a misplaced back-pass in the first half, then Gabriel summed up a performance where Arsenal's defence often lived dangerously with a cheap concession of possession that ended with Jack Grealish restoring City's lead after Bukayo Saka had levelled from the spot.\nHaaland, whose physical presence bullied Arsenal into mistakes in the second half, added a third for his 26th goal of the season, his 32nd in all competitions, as City demonstrated the ruthlessness that marks out champions.\nThe self-styled kings of possession under Guardiola only had 36%, their lowest in a league match in his time at the club, but still recorded their most important league win this season without even being at their best.\nIndeed, City were poor in the first half, infuriating the home crowd with time-wasting that resulted in goalkeeper Ederson receiving a yellow card.\nIt was different story after the break, especially when Guardiola gave Bernardo Silva a more accustomed attacking role.\nCity grew in threat, Grealish got himself on the scoresheet while Haaland's goal - one touch with the left foot and another with the right to beat Aaron Ramsdale - ensured no late nerves for the reigning champions.\nArsenal looked callow in those closing stages, undoubtedly missing the midfield authority they lost with Thomas Partey's injury.\nCity have the psychological edge over Arsenal on many levels. After the recent FA Cup win at Etihad Stadium, this result means Arsenal have now lost their last 11 league games against City, the longest losing run against any opponent in the competition.\nGuardiola and City will feel order has been restored at the top of the table, particularly with a home game to come against Arsenal in April, while the Gunners must avoid the sinking feeling that their big chance in the title race has come and gone as they chase their first crown since 2004.\nArsenal have shown great resolve as they made their way to the top of the Premier League. They will need to show it again now, starting at Aston Villa on Saturday.\nCity, by contrast, will feel they are back in their rightful place.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The whole performance was extremely important for us because we needed to make a statement.\"\nReaction and analysis as Liverpool beat Everton\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nVisit our Everton page\nLiverpool show signs of life\nIt has been a miserable 2023 for Liverpool, encapsulated by heavy away defeats at Brentford, Brighton and Wolverhampton Wanderers, but the ease with which they were able to overcome Everton's admittedly flimsy challenge will lift the spirits.\nThis was a good night for Liverpool as manager Klopp was able to include Virgil van Dijk, Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota on the bench after injury, the latter getting a rapturous reception when he was introduced as a second-half substitute for his first action since picking up the muscle problem that forced him to miss the World Cup in Qatar.\nFirmino also got a late outing.\nAnother big plus was Gakpo's goal, a huge morale-booster for a player who has been quiet - although it would have been difficult for any new acquisition to come into such a struggling side who are ninth in the Premier League table, nine points adrift of the Champions League places.\nGakpo's confidence visibly lifted after his goal, showing assured touches and looking more at ease than at any time in his short Liverpool career.\n\"The dream is that you score in the first minute of the first game you play,\" said Gakpo. \"In the end I have had to wait a little bit but I'm really delighted that I can score this one.\"\nAnother major plus for Klopp and Liverpool was the outstanding display of 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic, who showed astonishing maturity in midfield with a comprehensive range of passing, a sure touch and a willingness to engage in the physical exchanges. It was a complete performance by the youngster.\nLiverpool were nowhere near their best - they did not have to be - but the sight of Salah on the scoresheet, goals from trademark lightning counter-attacks and a clean sheet will change the mood around Anfield considerably before a crucial visit to Newcastle United on Saturday night.\nEverton revert to type\nEverton started the Dyche era with a performance full of passion and competitive edge to stun Arsenal, but this was a reminder of why they face a serious relegation battle, and evidence that the display against the Gunners was very much the exception in this season of struggle.\nNone of the things Dyche expects from his teams was on show here. They were passive, slow and careless in possession - their major flaw once again exposed as they barely mounted a threat apart from Tarkowski's header that actually resulted in Liverpool breaking the deadlock.\nThe absence of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, injured once more after figuring for an hour against Arsenal, underscores the folly in not signing a replacement for Richarlison, an error in the summer compounded by the failure to correct it in January.\nMuch rests on the unreliable fitness of Calvert-Lewin, with Dyche having to rely on 22-year-old Ellis Simms, making only his second Premier League start. The youngster, understandably, struggled on his own up front with no service.\nEverton now have a vital home game against managerless fellow strugglers Leeds United on Saturday and Dyche will want more of what they showed against Arsenal and less of what they produced at Anfield.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

From the subsequent corner, the ball bounced off Luke Ayling and narrowly wide of the far post, with Rashford inches away from converting.\nBut in general the first period was a fiery affair lacking in clear opportunities. And it was in keeping with the mood around Elland Road that Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were the subject of ferocious, but fair, early Leeds tackles.\nAyling and Malacia also had a grappling match as the Leeds man kept hold of the ball when his opponent tried to snatch it from him to take a quick throw, and Leeds duo Junior Firpo and Weston McKennie and Manchester United's Fred were all booked as referee Paul Tierney tried to regain control.\nLeeds in danger at the bottom\nDespite the complaints of Ten Hag after the meeting between these sides on Wednesday, the visitors were once again guilty of making a sluggish start.\nThey were also fortunate not to concede early in the second half when Crysencio Summerville brought a low save out of De Gea, Jack Harrison prodded a shot narrowly wide of the near post and Ayling's effort deflected off Shaw.\nIt was the prelude to a more positive contest in the second period, with Diogo Dalot crashing a shot against the bar from the edge of the area and Ayling sending an overhead kick straight at De Gea, who also turned away a Summerville shot heading for the far corner.\nWith matches to come against fellow strugglers Everton and Southampton, Leeds badly need to identify a replacement for Marsch after hitting a brick wall in their attempts to lure Andoni Iraola from Rayo Vallecano and Carlos Corberan from West Brom.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

When the ball went in, all the things I've been dealing with came over my mind.\"\nA magnificent curling finish from former Chelsea and Arsenal winger Willian broke the deadlock in the first half, before Aleksandar Mitrovic, Bobby De Cordova-Reid and Andreas Pereira all went close to doubling the hosts' advantage.\nWillian and Pereira were also both denied by the frame of the goal not long after the restart, but Forest - who lost centre-backs Willy Boly and Scott McKenna to early injuries - improved as the second half wore on.\nSubstitutes Jonjo Shelvey and Emmanuel Dennis almost combined to bring the visitors back on level terms, but the latter sent his header straight at Bernd Leno before Solomon struck late on with a confident finish.\nSteve Cooper's side drop a place to 14th after slipping to their first league defeat of 2023, while Fulham climb above Brentford into seventh.\nReaction to Fulham v Nottingham Forest and Saturday's other Premier League games\nVisit our Fulham page\nGo straight to all the best Nottingham Forest content\nWillian wonder goal before Solomon's first strike\nFulham enjoyed a slice of good fortune with Boly and McKenna's injuries disrupting the visiting defence, but this was a display in keeping with the Cottagers' outstanding campaign so far.\nConfident and assured in possession, Silva's side deservedly ended a run of over five hours without a Premier League goal when Willian struck his third of the campaign.\nThe opportunity appeared to have gone when Mitrovic and De Cordova-Reid were both denied by last-ditch blocks, but Willian collected the ball and calmly lifted it over five Forest defenders into the top corner to break the deadlock.\nMitrovic almost ended his own five-game goal drought after taking Willian's pass in his stride and sidestepping two Forest challenges, but the striker's goal-bound shot was blocked by Keylor Navas.\nDe Cordova-Reid rattled the crossbar with a vicious right-footed strike and Pereira flashed a shot wide of the far post as Silva's team ended the first half in the ascendancy.\nThere was little change to the pattern of play in the early stages of the second period as Willian's curling shot struck the post and Pereira sent a dipping free-kick against the bar.\nBut keeper Leno had to be on his toes to deny Dennis from point-blank range as the visitors sought an equaliser.\nIf Fulham fans were wondering whether their team might rue their profligacy, Solomon calmed their nerves in the 88th minute with a powerful finish from Pereira's low cross.\nFrustration at both ends for Forest\nForest's bid to avoid an immediate return to the Championship has gathered serious momentum in recent weeks, but they suffered an early setback here as Boly and McKenna were taken off after only seven minutes - the earliest any side has ever substituted two starters in a Premier League game.\n\"I've never seen that,\" Cooper told BBC Match of the Day afterwards. \"We won't hide behind it, but for sure it was an unfortunate situation. It meant we couldn't make more changes in the second half in an attacking sense.\n\"They're both hamstrings. Scans over the next 24 to 48 hours will determine the extent.\"\nJoe Worrall and former Atletico Madrid defender Felipe came on as replacements, but Forest's makeshift defence was powerless to prevent Willian from putting the hosts in front.\nThe visitors managed just five touches in the opposition penalty area before the break, but the second-half introductions of Dennis and Shelvey looked like providing the spark Forest needed to get back in the contest.\nDennis in particular was a major threat, but the former Watford man's header - Forest's only shot on target - failed to beat Leno.\nCooper's team have found the net just three times on their travels this season and failed to score in nine of their 22 top-flight encounters - only Bournemouth and Wolves have drawn more blanks in the league.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

But this win - plus the manner of it and where it was achieved - made it feel much more than that.\nScratch beneath the surface and it is hard to escape the sense that this highly-charged encounter in north London might just have been the night when the momentum in the title race shifted decisively.\nArteta has 'more belief' Arsenal can win title\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGo straight to all the best Arsenal content\nArsenal have been outstanding this season, showing steel and character to pass the sternest tests placed in front of them - Liverpool and Manchester United beaten at home, Chelsea and Tottenham overcome on their travels.\nWhen Arsenal won at Spurs on 18 January, they were eight points clear of City with both having played 18 games. They had momentum as well as a formidable advantage.\nCity, by contrast, have been short of their imperious best despite the avalanche of Erling Haaland goals - losing at home to Brentford, drawing with Everton and recently slipping up at Spurs.\nFor all that, for all the feeling that City were missing the old spark and fluency, an Arsenal stumble sees Pep Guardiola's side back in that old familiar position.\nArteta's side have claimed only one point out of the last nine, losing at Everton, drawing at home to Brentford then slipping against City. It has proved an expensive spell.\nArsenal are still right in this title race, make no mistake, but as they trooped off to sympathetic applause and City's players fist-pumped in front of their joyous fans, there was a feeling of deflation around the stadium.\nThe Gunners have been full on and thrilling to watch. City have often looked like a team in search of their usual \"X Factor.\"\nAnd yet City are now back at the summit. It will be tough for Arsenal to take.\nArsenal nursed a justifiable grievance after the 1-1 draw with Brentford here on Saturday, Ivan Toney's equaliser the result of incompetence by those running VAR.\nHere, Arsenal could not blame anyone but themselves. They were guilty of the sort of individual errors that invited City to inflict heavy punishment. They duly did and Arsenal ended up well beaten.\nTakehiro Tomiyasu did not see Kevin de Bruyne lurking when he found him with a misplaced back-pass in the first half, then Gabriel summed up a performance where Arsenal's defence often lived dangerously with a cheap concession of possession that ended with Jack Grealish restoring City's lead after Bukayo Saka had levelled from the spot.\nHaaland, whose physical presence bullied Arsenal into mistakes in the second half, added a third for his 26th goal of the season, his 32nd in all competitions, as City demonstrated the ruthlessness that marks out champions.\nThe self-styled kings of possession under Guardiola only had 36%, their lowest in a league match in his time at the club, but still recorded their most important league win this season without even being at their best.\nIndeed, City were poor in the first half, infuriating the home crowd with time-wasting that resulted in goalkeeper Ederson receiving a yellow card.\nIt was different story after the break, especially when Guardiola gave Bernardo Silva a more accustomed attacking role.\nCity grew in threat, Grealish got himself on the scoresheet while Haaland's goal - one touch with the left foot and another with the right to beat Aaron Ramsdale - ensured no late nerves for the reigning champions.\nArsenal looked callow in those closing stages, undoubtedly missing the midfield authority they lost with Thomas Partey's injury.\nCity have the psychological edge over Arsenal on many levels. After the recent FA Cup win at Etihad Stadium, this result means Arsenal have now lost their last 11 league games against City, the longest losing run against any opponent in the competition.\nGuardiola and City will feel order has been restored at the top of the table, particularly with a home game to come against Arsenal in April, while the Gunners must avoid the sinking feeling that their big chance in the title race has come and gone as they chase their first crown since 2004.\nArsenal have shown great resolve as they made their way to the top of the Premier League. They will need to show it again now, starting at Aston Villa on Saturday.\nCity, by contrast, will feel they are back in their rightful place.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Liverpool 2-0 Everton: Reds return to winning ways after Merseyside derby triumph\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said \"it felt like us, it looked like us,\" after the Reds recorded their first Premier League win in 2023 with a comfortable Merseyside derby victory over Everton at Anfield.\nSean Dyche's reign as Everton manager got off to the perfect start with a win over league leaders Arsenal at Goodison Park, but the task he has taken on after succeeding sacked Frank Lampard was laid out before him in graphic detail as they remain rooted in the bottom three.\nEverton had actually kept Liverpool at arm's length before they were caught by a devastating counter-attack after 36 minutes, defender James Tarkowski's header hitting the post at one end before Darwin Nunez raced clear, squaring for Mohamed Salah to take advantage of goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's poor positioning with a simple finish.\nLiverpool snuffed out any hopes of an Everton recovery four minutes after the break.\nAnd it was a special moment for \u00a345m January signing Cody Gakpo, as he tapped in Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross at the far post for his first goal since arriving at Anfield from PSV Eindhoven.\n\"The result is a massive relief,\" Klopp said to BBC's Match of the Day.\n\"The better you play the more likely you will score. The whole performance was extremely important for us because we needed to make a statement.\"\nReaction and analysis as Liverpool beat Everton\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nVisit our Everton page\nLiverpool show signs of life\nIt has been a miserable 2023 for Liverpool, encapsulated by heavy away defeats at Brentford, Brighton and Wolverhampton Wanderers, but the ease with which they were able to overcome Everton's admittedly flimsy challenge will lift the spirits.\nThis was a good night for Liverpool as manager Klopp was able to include Virgil van Dijk, Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota on the bench after injury, the latter getting a rapturous reception when he was introduced as a second-half substitute for his first action since picking up the muscle problem that forced him to miss the World Cup in Qatar.\nFirmino also got a late outing.\nAnother big plus was Gakpo's goal, a huge morale-booster for a player who has been quiet - although it would have been difficult for any new acquisition to come into such a struggling side who are ninth in the Premier League table, nine points adrift of the Champions League places.\nGakpo's confidence visibly lifted after his goal, showing assured touches and looking more at ease than at any time in his short Liverpool career.\n\"The dream is that you score in the first minute of the first game you play,\" said Gakpo. \"In the end I have had to wait a little bit but I'm really delighted that I can score this one.\"\nAnother major plus for Klopp and Liverpool was the outstanding display of 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic, who showed astonishing maturity in midfield with a comprehensive range of passing, a sure touch and a willingness to engage in the physical exchanges. It was a complete performance by the youngster.\nLiverpool were nowhere near their best - they did not have to be - but the sight of Salah on the scoresheet, goals from trademark lightning counter-attacks and a clean sheet will change the mood around Anfield considerably before a crucial visit to Newcastle United on Saturday night.\nEverton revert to type\nEverton started the Dyche era with a performance full of passion and competitive edge to stun Arsenal, but this was a reminder of why they face a serious relegation battle, and evidence that the display against the Gunners was very much the exception in this season of struggle.\nNone of the things Dyche expects from his teams was on show here. They were passive, slow and careless in possession - their major flaw once again exposed as they barely mounted a threat apart from Tarkowski's header that actually resulted in Liverpool breaking the deadlock.\nThe absence of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, injured once more after figuring for an hour against Arsenal, underscores the folly in not signing a replacement for Richarlison, an error in the summer compounded by the failure to correct it in January.\nMuch rests on the unreliable fitness of Calvert-Lewin, with Dyche having to rely on 22-year-old Ellis Simms, making only his second Premier League start. The youngster, understandably, struggled on his own up front with no service.\nEverton now have a vital home game against managerless fellow strugglers Leeds United on Saturday and Dyche will want more of what they showed against Arsenal and less of what they produced at Anfield.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

From the subsequent corner, the ball bounced off Luke Ayling and narrowly wide of the far post, with Rashford inches away from converting.\nBut in general the first period was a fiery affair lacking in clear opportunities. And it was in keeping with the mood around Elland Road that Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were the subject of ferocious, but fair, early Leeds tackles.\nAyling and Malacia also had a grappling match as the Leeds man kept hold of the ball when his opponent tried to snatch it from him to take a quick throw, and Leeds duo Junior Firpo and Weston McKennie and Manchester United's Fred were all booked as referee Paul Tierney tried to regain control.\nLeeds in danger at the bottom\nDespite the complaints of Ten Hag after the meeting between these sides on Wednesday, the visitors were once again guilty of making a sluggish start.\nThey were also fortunate not to concede early in the second half when Crysencio Summerville brought a low save out of De Gea, Jack Harrison prodded a shot narrowly wide of the near post and Ayling's effort deflected off Shaw.\nIt was the prelude to a more positive contest in the second period, with Diogo Dalot crashing a shot against the bar from the edge of the area and Ayling sending an overhead kick straight at De Gea, who also turned away a Summerville shot heading for the far corner.\nWith matches to come against fellow strugglers Everton and Southampton, Leeds badly need to identify a replacement for Marsch after hitting a brick wall in their attempts to lure Andoni Iraola from Rayo Vallecano and Carlos Corberan from West Brom.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Son Heung-min, who scored a hat-trick in the reverse fixture, only had one effort himself.\nPedro Porro, their new signing at right-back, had a disappointing debut as he struggled with Barnes' pace.\nBentancur added to an already long injury list when he was hurt in a collision with Mendy and needed oxygen - although he was able to walk off with help instead of needing the stretcher that had been sent on.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Only former England captain David Beckham has managed more in the top flight, with 18.\n'Elite' Ward-Prowse closes in on Beckham record\nAdam Armstrong could have given the Saints a two-goal cushion in the second half but was denied by Arrizabalaga's outstretched leg.\nThe win gave Southampton their first league double against Chelsea in 35 years. They last achieved that feat courtesy of a 1-0 win at Stamford Bridge in 1988, a match in which a 17-year-old Alan Shearer made his league debut.\nDespite Saturday's victory, they are still bottom of the league table, while Chelsea are 10th.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He slipped and had to handle to stop Liverpool's Egypt forward from racing clear.\nIronically, Pope's replacement Martin Dubravka is cup-tied for Wembley having played for Manchester United in an earlier round, leaving former Liverpool keeper Loris Karius as the most likely contender to face Erik ten Hag's side.\nNewcastle were unable to overcome the handicap as they went down to only their second league defeat this season, the first also coming against Liverpool at Anfield in August.\nIt capped a disappointing build-up to Newcastle's first Wembley final since the FA Cup in 1999, but they still showed plenty of spirit despite their numerical disadvantage, Liverpool keeper Alisson turning Allan Saint-Maximin's shot on to the bar, while Dan Burn also rattled the woodwork with a header. The Brazilian also saved well from Miguel Almiron and Callum Wilson.\nKlopp will have left Tyneside highly satisfied after desperate away defeats at Brentford, Brighton and Wolverhampton Wanderers as Liverpool now stand only six points behind fourth-placed Newcastle with a game in hand.\nLiverpool increase pressure\nLiverpool showed signs of recovering their old menace in the comfortable 2-0 win against Everton in the Merseyside derby.\nThe trick was to follow that up against what has been a formidable Newcastle side this season given the inconsistency that has dogged the Reds' campaign.\nThis is why Klopp will be elated with the outcome, not simply because it means Newcastle will feel the threat of Liverpool moving closer to the top-four place the Toon Army also have their eyes on.\nThis was far from the perfect Liverpool performance, relying too heavily on the outstanding Alisson as their defence was opened up too often for Klopp's liking before Tuesday's last-16 Champions League meeting with holders Real Madrid at Anfield.\nThere was, however, so much to be positive about as Nunez turned his good work into a goal with a thumping finish and the improving Gakpo was on the mark again, although Liverpool might be disappointed they did not add to their goal tally.\nDiogo Jota also delivered a dangerous cameo as he moves close to full fitness after a long injury absence, while fit-again Virgil van Dijk comfortably came through his first 90 minutes since sustaining a hamstring injury.\nThis has been a very good week for Liverpool after so many disappointments this season, with successive victories providing the perfect tonic before the meeting with the side that beat them in last season's Champions League final.\nNewcastle thoughts turn to Wembley\nNewcastle's fans swallowed their disappointment at the final whistle by instantly switching attention to their big Wembley date with Manchester United.\nEven that was overshadowed by the red card that rules out keeper Pope, such an influential figure in their transformation under Eddie Howe this season. Make no mistake, this is a bitter blow to their hopes of winning the first silverware since the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.\nAnd the added worry for Howe is that Newcastle, so impressive in this campaign, have hit a dry spell at the most crucial point in their season so far, their last league win coming against Fulham in mid-January.\nNewcastle will be lifted by the return of Bruno Guimaraes at Wembley, but there was also plenty for the home fans to be encouraged by, despite the result.\nTheir side never gave up despite facing a virtually impossible task at 2-0 down and reduced to ten men, playing with character and creating chances throughout - although again there was a lack of end product.\nIt was an anti-climax given the high hopes before kick-off, but Newcastle can now fix full focus on their biggest game in years and the chance to end that 54-year trophy drought.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action live\nVisit our Newcastle United page\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They're all for it.\"\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, he added: \"There are bits of it I want to build on and hope that we take it in. The players have been challenged, now let's see who's up for the fight.\"\nSpurs condemn 'utterly reprehensible' racist abuse of Son\nTottenham, meanwhile, moved one point ahead of Newcastle, although Eddie Howe's side, beaten 2-0 at home by Liverpool on Saturday, have a game in hand.\nTottenham had assistant manager Cristian Stellini back in charge with Antonio Conte resting after his recent gallbladder surgery.\nConte was on the touchline for the recent games against Leicester and AC Milan, but subsequently said he had rushed his recovery and was not ready for a full-time return.\nTottenham v West Ham as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nVisit our Tottenham page\nGo to our West Ham content\nSpurs win after tribute to record-breaking Kane\nIn Tottenham's last home game, the 1-0 win over reigning champions Manchester City on 5 February, Kane scored his 267th Spurs goal to take him above Jimmy Greaves' total and become the club's all-time record goalscorer.\nBefore this match there was a celebration of that achievement as Kane was handed a silver boot trophy, with members of the Greaves family making the presentation.\nTottenham's fans also spelled out the word 'Harry' with an impressive Tifo before the game, with Kane's children, wearing Spurs shirts that said 'Daddy 267' on the back, joining the England captain on the pitch.\nHowever, he could not find his 268th Tottenham goal, shooting wastefully wide with only Fabianski to beat midway through the second half from his only notable chance.\nBut Kane did manage to record an assist, with his pass through to Son shortly after the South Korean, dropped for Richarlison, had come on as a substitute.\nTowards the end of the match, the home fans taunted the away supporters with chants of \"West Ham are going down\" and it was a disappointing performance from Moyes' side after they had gained decent draws against Newcastle and Chelsea in their previous two Premier League games.\nThe visitors had wasted a good chance to take the lead inside the opening minute but England forward Bowen sent a 20-yard half-volley just wide.\nBowen had a chance to make it 1-1 but was denied by Forster with what proved to be West Ham's only shot on target.\nTottenham are still in this season's Champions League but lost 1-0 away to AC Milan in Tuesday's last-16 first-leg tie and this result puts them in one of the four automatic qualifying spots for next season's tournament.\nIn the end, Spurs ran out deserved winners against West Ham as a controversial video assistant referee call did not come back to prove costly.\nThe hosts thought they should have earlier been given a 12th-minute penalty when Thilo Kehrer, standing close behind Richarlison and falling over, put his hand down and handled the ball.\nBut a decision was not given by on-field official Michael Oliver, with those in the VAR room not telling him to review the decision.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 0-1 Southampton: James Ward-Prowse free-kick deepens gloom for Graham Potter\nChelsea's poor form under manager Graham Potter continued as a trademark free-kick from James Ward-Prowse earned the Premier League's bottom club Southampton a surprise victory at Stamford Bridge.\nWard-Prowse scored the game's only goal in first-half stoppage time, sending a curling effort over the Chelsea wall and into the corner from the edge of the penalty area.\nThe result means Chelsea have now won just two games in their last 14 in all competitions.\nManagerless Southampton will hope it can kick-start their attempts to escape the relegation zone.\nThe visitors started magnificently in west London and twice went close to scoring before Ward-Prowse's strike, with Kamaldeen Sulemana shooting straight at Kepa Arrizabalaga before Kalidou Koulibaly blocked Stuart Armstrong's follow-up.\nAzpilicueta 'speaking' in hospital after head injury - Potter\nThe half-time introduction of Raheem Sterling breathed new life into the Blues' toothless forward line, but Ainsley Maitland-Niles' crucial block denied the England international an equaliser midway through the second period.\nRomain Perraud followed suit minutes later with a tremendous goalline clearance to prevent a Sterling header from ending up in the net, as Potter's team failed to score for the sixth time in 2023.\nThere was a lengthy stoppage towards the end of the second half because of an injury to Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta, who was caught in the face by Southampton substitute Sekou Mara.\nThe 33-year-old needed oxygen treatment on the pitch before being carried off on a stretcher, although he was conscious as he left the field.\nReaction to Chelsea v Southampton and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content\nVisit our Southampton page\nBlues draw yet another blank\nHaving had their deficiencies in front of goal laid bare in Wednesday's 1-0 Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea will again be wondering how they failed to find the net against a side who had managed just one clean sheet in the Premier League all season before Saturday.\nPotter handed January signing David Fofana his full debut in an attempt to inject some imagination into the Blues' faltering front line, but the 20-year-old Ivorian failed to make an impact before being hooked at half-time.\nIndeed, the home side struggled to carve out any meaningful opportunities until midway through the second half, and when they did they were thwarted by some sensational last-ditch defending from the visitors.\nSterling in particular will be scratching his head in disbelief, as Maitland-Niles, Perraud and Romeo Lavia all denied the former Liverpool and Manchester City man from point-blank range.\nLate on, Southampton goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu was also equal to Conor Gallagher's effort as the Blues' push for an equaliser proved in vain.\nThe serious-looking injury to Azpilicueta compounded a miserable afternoon for Potter, who was booed by home supporters after the full-time whistle.\nBefore kick-off, fans had given a minute's applause in memory of former Chelsea winger Christian Atsu, who was found dead almost two weeks on from the earthquake in Turkey.\nSuperb Saints secure priceless victory\nCaretaker manager Ruben Selles made no secret of his desire to become Saints' permanent boss after the club's talks with Jesse Marsch broke down in midweek, and this display will have given his hopes of succeeding Nathan Jones a huge boost.\nPressing Chelsea high up the pitch, Saints could have taken an early lead when Benoit Badiashile's poor touch gifted Sulemana a free sight at goal, but Arrizabalaga was equal to the Ghanaian's shot before Armstrong sent the follow-up straight at Koulibaly.\nPaul Onuachu also headed wide from a good position after beating Ben Chilwell to Ward-Prowse's inswinging delivery.\nIn the end, Southampton's goal came from a familiar source as Ward-Prowse curled home his 17th direct free-kick in the Premier League. Only former England captain David Beckham has managed more in the top flight, with 18.\n'Elite' Ward-Prowse closes in on Beckham record\nAdam Armstrong could have given the Saints a two-goal cushion in the second half but was denied by Arrizabalaga's outstretched leg.\nThe win gave Southampton their first league double against Chelsea in 35 years. They last achieved that feat courtesy of a 1-0 win at Stamford Bridge in 1988, a match in which a 17-year-old Alan Shearer made his league debut.\nDespite Saturday's victory, they are still bottom of the league table, while Chelsea are 10th.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nManchester City 'send message' but Arsenal 'in control' of title race\nArsenal's quest for a first league title since 2003-04 appeared to be faltering when they lost 3-1 to City on 15 February, but they have bounced back with a maximum return of six points from two testing away trips.\nGunners struggle for fluency but do enough\nArsenal's recent league wobble, which saw Arteta's side drop seven points from a possible nine, may be behind them but they struggled to hit their fluent best at King Power Stadium.\nMikel Arteta's side dominated possession in the early stages and seemed to have hit their stride when the game's first controversial moment occurred.\nTrossard's brilliant curling shot from outside the area was initially given as a goal, but referee Craig Pawson overturned it for sustained holding after consulting the video assistant referee. Arsenal's Ben White had his left arm around Ward's right as the ball came over at a corner, while White and Harvey Barnes also appeared to collide during the same incident.\nArsenal's sense of injustice increased a few minutes later when their claims for a penalty, after Bukayo Saka tangled with Harry Souttar, were waved away by Pawson.\nMartinelli grabbed his ninth goal of the league season just 51 seconds into the second half when he calmly stroked the ball past Ward, sustaining a painful blow to the right leg when Wilfred Ndidi accidentally trod on him in the process of scoring.\nSaka also had a goal ruled out when Martinelli was flagged for offside, but Arsenal struggled to impose themselves as the second half progressed.\nOleksandr Zinchenko, given the captain's armband by his club as a mark of respect in the week of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of his native Ukraine, came close to a second goal in as many games when Ward pushed away the defender's curling shot.\nAfter this win and victory at Aston Villa a week ago, Arsenal now have the chance to make the most of home advantage against opposition in the lower reaches of the table, as they face Everton on Wednesday and Bournemouth next Saturday.\nFoxes fail to make impression\nLeicester's 3-0 defeat at Manchester United last week belied the fact that they played well for periods at Old Trafford, as they attempted to build on the momentum from scoring four goals in both of their previous two games.\nBut they struggled to get going against Arsenal, with the home side and the home crowd only finally stirred into life when Dewsbury-Hall's effort had curled just wide after 72 minutes.\nThey lacked the spark that James Maddison could have brought them, the midfielder missing out after illness.\nThe defeat leaves the Foxes just three points above the relegation zone, and following their FA Cup fifth-round tie with Blackburn on Tuesday they resume league duties with a visit to bottom-of-the-table Southampton on 4 March.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 0-2 Liverpool: Reds end Newcastle run with clinical win\nLiverpool's pursuit of a top-four Premier League finish gathered further momentum at the expense of Newcastle United's similar ambitions with a crucial win at St James' Park.\nJurgen Klopp's side, who secured their first league win of 2023 in the Merseyside derby against Everton on Monday, took control with two early goals from Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo.\nNewcastle's miserable night worsened with a first-half red card for goalkeeper Nick Pope, ruling him out of next Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Manchester United at Wembley.\nNunez powered home the opener from Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass after 10 minutes, then Gakpo scored for the second successive match seven minutes later, pouncing on Mohamed Salah's piece of creation to beat Pope.\nThe Newcastle keeper then left referee Anthony Taylor with no option but to send him off after 22 minutes when he misjudged a dash from goal in an attempt to challenge Salah. He slipped and had to handle to stop Liverpool's Egypt forward from racing clear.\nIronically, Pope's replacement Martin Dubravka is cup-tied for Wembley having played for Manchester United in an earlier round, leaving former Liverpool keeper Loris Karius as the most likely contender to face Erik ten Hag's side.\nNewcastle were unable to overcome the handicap as they went down to only their second league defeat this season, the first also coming against Liverpool at Anfield in August.\nIt capped a disappointing build-up to Newcastle's first Wembley final since the FA Cup in 1999, but they still showed plenty of spirit despite their numerical disadvantage, Liverpool keeper Alisson turning Allan Saint-Maximin's shot on to the bar, while Dan Burn also rattled the woodwork with a header. The Brazilian also saved well from Miguel Almiron and Callum Wilson.\nKlopp will have left Tyneside highly satisfied after desperate away defeats at Brentford, Brighton and Wolverhampton Wanderers as Liverpool now stand only six points behind fourth-placed Newcastle with a game in hand.\nLiverpool increase pressure\nLiverpool showed signs of recovering their old menace in the comfortable 2-0 win against Everton in the Merseyside derby.\nThe trick was to follow that up against what has been a formidable Newcastle side this season given the inconsistency that has dogged the Reds' campaign.\nThis is why Klopp will be elated with the outcome, not simply because it means Newcastle will feel the threat of Liverpool moving closer to the top-four place the Toon Army also have their eyes on.\nThis was far from the perfect Liverpool performance, relying too heavily on the outstanding Alisson as their defence was opened up too often for Klopp's liking before Tuesday's last-16 Champions League meeting with holders Real Madrid at Anfield.\nThere was, however, so much to be positive about as Nunez turned his good work into a goal with a thumping finish and the improving Gakpo was on the mark again, although Liverpool might be disappointed they did not add to their goal tally.\nDiogo Jota also delivered a dangerous cameo as he moves close to full fitness after a long injury absence, while fit-again Virgil van Dijk comfortably came through his first 90 minutes since sustaining a hamstring injury.\nThis has been a very good week for Liverpool after so many disappointments this season, with successive victories providing the perfect tonic before the meeting with the side that beat them in last season's Champions League final.\nNewcastle thoughts turn to Wembley\nNewcastle's fans swallowed their disappointment at the final whistle by instantly switching attention to their big Wembley date with Manchester United.\nEven that was overshadowed by the red card that rules out keeper Pope, such an influential figure in their transformation under Eddie Howe this season. Make no mistake, this is a bitter blow to their hopes of winning the first silverware since the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.\nAnd the added worry for Howe is that Newcastle, so impressive in this campaign, have hit a dry spell at the most crucial point in their season so far, their last league win coming against Fulham in mid-January.\nNewcastle will be lifted by the return of Bruno Guimaraes at Wembley, but there was also plenty for the home fans to be encouraged by, despite the result.\nTheir side never gave up despite facing a virtually impossible task at 2-0 down and reduced to ten men, playing with character and creating chances throughout - although again there was a lack of end product.\nIt was an anti-climax given the high hopes before kick-off, but Newcastle can now fix full focus on their biggest game in years and the chance to end that 54-year trophy drought.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action live\nVisit our Newcastle United page\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Then you have to react.\n\"I was not worried but of course then you watch how the boys react - and the reaction was really good.\"\nLiverpool fans may have feared this was going to be the defining moment of the game but Van Dijk intervened soon after with the goal his side's play just about warranted.\nWolves defended stoutly and with organisation but were again toothless in front of goal, hamstrung by the absence of Matheus Cunha. The Brazil striker failed a late fitness test following an ankle injury picked up at Fulham on Friday.\nHis replacement in the starting XI was midfielder Joao Moutinho as manager Julen Lopetegui reverted to a three-man midfield with the Portuguese veteran sitting alongside Mario Lemina and Ruben Neves.\nIt effectively stifled Liverpool for some time, but Wolves may well have to offer a bit more than just discipline in the coming weeks to ensure their Premier League status for 2023-24.\n\"It was frustrating because we didn't get anything - but we didn't deserve to get anything,\" Lopetegui said.\n\"Maybe in the first half but in the second half we didn't keep the rhythm and when they scored it was more difficult of course.\n\"We lost one match - it's a pity, but we have to change our mindset very fast as in three days we have another important match [at home to Tottenham].

The flag went up for offside after he drove past Jordan Pickford but the decision was overturned after a VAR check.\nEverton had no answers and Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard wrapped up their third successive league victory when he side-footed home Leandro Trossard's cross after 71 minutes.\nIt was now simply a question of how many Arsenal would score to improve their goal difference, Martinelli adding his second and the Gunners' fourth from Eddie Nketiah's cross ten minutes from time.\n'Thrashing of Everton confirms Arsenal are in this title race to stay'\nSaka Arsenal's star once more\nMartinelli once again demonstrated his rich promise with two crisp finishes but Saka was the star of the show, giving a glorious illustration of his significance to this Arsenal side.\nHe became the sixth-youngest player in Premier League history, at 21, to reach 50 goals and assists as he ensured the frustration that threatened Arsenal was wiped away in the crucial minutes before half-time.\nSaka gave Pickford no chance when he lashed a powerful drive past the England goalkeeper at his near post, then his speed of thought and action robbed Gueye to play in Martinelli.

The lively Brenden Aaronson pulled one shot wide, with Jack Harrison curling another off target.\nThe one true piece of attacking verve came from Firpo, whose adventurous run and shot gives Leeds a first win in the league since 5 November and takes them to 22 points, a point and a position above 18th-placed Everton.\nDefeat for Saints - their first under caretaker boss Ruben Selles - means they stay bottom, four points from safety.\nFollow live text commentary of Saturday's Premier League games, including Leeds v Southampton\nHow did you rate Leeds' performance?

Tonight and in the days that follow, he faces a big challenge to dust off his players and lift their mood for the challenge ahead.\nLeicester are up next for Saints in another battle near the bottom.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The striker found Bowen with a raking pass and sprinted into the area to slide in and connect with the winger's ball across the face of goal.\nMinutes later he was again in the right place to bundle in Said Benrahma's ball and all but secure a win that was rubberstamped when Rice bent in a beautiful strike from the edge of the area.\nAntonio, without a league goal since October, then popped up with a thumping header as Forest capitulated, allowing Moyes to rightly celebrate becoming only the third manager to win 250 Premier League games.\n\"It's great to have 250 wins but it would have been better if I'd only had 275 games,\" Moyes told Match of the Day.\n\"But 250 good Saturday nights out of a thousand isn't too bad.\n\"I want to look at the teams above us.

It looks like we lost the game - we didn't.\n\"We've spoiled ourselves with a lot of things, but we cannot suffer because of our own history. That would really be a joke.\n\"This will not be the season in the history books that people want to look at again and again and again.\n\"There will not be big movies about it, but we have to go through it anyway.\"\nRelive Saturday's live action\nHow did you rate Crystal Palace's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Liverpool's display?\nSloppy Reds a shadow of former selves\n\"It's clear that we have to do something in the summer. For now, we just have to go through this.\"\nIf the pre-match words from Klopp were intended to motivate his players, a poor first-half showing suggested merely 'getting through' the rest of the season may well be the limit of Liverpool's remaining ambitions.\nLiverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold twice allowed Palace's misfiring attackers in on goal with elementary errors while Joel Matip also sliced the ball horribly to an opponent when under no pressure.\nAlexander-Arnold, while not alone in his indifferent performance, lost possession 20 times in a first 45 minutes at Selhurst Park that left much to be desired.\nAt the other end Jota, in his first start since October following a long injury lay-off, did at least test Vicente Guaita before heading against the post from an improbable angle.\nLiverpool improved after the half-time introduction of Harvey Elliott and Salah was unlucky to see a fine curling strike come back off the crossbar.\nCody Gakpo dinked a shot narrowly wide after being put through by Salah but that was Liverpool's final thrust as Palace ended the match on top.\nPalace still searching for win\nWithout a win in eight games since New Year's Eve, Palace have stalled in the Premier League and did not have a single shot on target against Liverpool.\nBadly missing the spark of the injured Wilfried Zaha, the hosts saw Mateta waste their best chance when he scooped against the bar after one of Alexander-Arnold's errors.\nCaptain Marc Guehi also headed a good opportunity wide before an improved showing in the final 20 minutes roused their famously vociferous support.\nA minute's applause in the 77th minute marked this week's death of BBC legend John Motson, whose final Match of the Day commentary took place at Selhurst Park in 2018.\nThe point means Palace will remain wary of getting sucked into a relegation battle, with tough-looking matches against champions Manchester City, rivals Brighton and leaders Arsenal coming up in March.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The lively Brenden Aaronson pulled one shot wide, with Jack Harrison curling another off target.\nThe one true piece of attacking verve came from Firpo, whose adventurous run and shot gives Leeds a first win in the league since 5 November and takes them to 22 points, a point and a position above 18th-placed Everton.\nDefeat for Saints - their first under caretaker boss Ruben Selles - means they stay bottom, four points from safety.\nFollow live text commentary of Saturday's Premier League games, including Leeds v Southampton\nHow did you rate Leeds' performance?

Arsenal's Ben White had his left arm around Ward's right as the ball came over at a corner, while White and Harvey Barnes also appeared to collide during the same incident.\nArsenal's sense of injustice increased a few minutes later when their claims for a penalty, after Bukayo Saka tangled with Harry Souttar, were waved away by Pawson.\nMartinelli grabbed his ninth goal of the league season just 51 seconds into the second half when he calmly stroked the ball past Ward, sustaining a painful blow to the right leg when Wilfred Ndidi accidentally trod on him in the process of scoring.\nSaka also had a goal ruled out when Martinelli was flagged for offside, but Arsenal struggled to impose themselves as the second half progressed.\nOleksandr Zinchenko, given the captain's armband by his club as a mark of respect in the week of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of his native Ukraine, came close to a second goal in as many games when Ward pushed away the defender's curling shot.\nAfter this win and victory at Aston Villa a week ago, Arsenal now have the chance to make the most of home advantage against opposition in the lower reaches of the table, as they face Everton on Wednesday and Bournemouth next Saturday.\nFoxes fail to make impression\nLeicester's 3-0 defeat at Manchester United last week belied the fact that they played well for periods at Old Trafford, as they attempted to build on the momentum from scoring four goals in both of their previous two games.\nBut they struggled to get going against Arsenal, with the home side and the home crowd only finally stirred into life when Dewsbury-Hall's effort had curled just wide after 72 minutes.\nThey lacked the spark that James Maddison could have brought them, the midfielder missing out after illness.\nThe defeat leaves the Foxes just three points above the relegation zone, and following their FA Cup fifth-round tie with Blackburn on Tuesday they resume league duties with a visit to bottom-of-the-table Southampton on 4 March.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Then you have to react.\n\"I was not worried but of course then you watch how the boys react - and the reaction was really good.\"\nLiverpool fans may have feared this was going to be the defining moment of the game but Van Dijk intervened soon after with the goal his side's play just about warranted.\nWolves defended stoutly and with organisation but were again toothless in front of goal, hamstrung by the absence of Matheus Cunha. The Brazil striker failed a late fitness test following an ankle injury picked up at Fulham on Friday.\nHis replacement in the starting XI was midfielder Joao Moutinho as manager Julen Lopetegui reverted to a three-man midfield with the Portuguese veteran sitting alongside Mario Lemina and Ruben Neves.\nIt effectively stifled Liverpool for some time, but Wolves may well have to offer a bit more than just discipline in the coming weeks to ensure their Premier League status for 2023-24.\n\"It was frustrating because we didn't get anything - but we didn't deserve to get anything,\" Lopetegui said.\n\"Maybe in the first half but in the second half we didn't keep the rhythm and when they scored it was more difficult of course.\n\"We lost one match - it's a pity, but we have to change our mindset very fast as in three days we have another important match [at home to Tottenham]. But this wasn't a good match for us.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

United are five points adrift of leaders Arsenal, although the Gunners have played a game fewer.\nFoxes rue missed chances\nThis was a case of what might have been for Leicester.\nBrendan Rodgers' side came into the game following a thumping 4-1 victory over Spurs last Saturday but will rue the failure to take their opportunities this time.\nDe Gea denied Barnes and Iheanacho to claim a 180th clean sheet for the Red Devils, drawing alongside Peter Schmeichel's club record.\nLeicester's January signing Tete flashed a shot wide of the far post and James Maddison dragged an effort off target as the Foxes went home empty-handed.\nThe hosts could have had a man sent off when Marcel Sabitzer caught defender Wout Faes on the knee with his studs, but neither the referee nor VAR took any action.\nLeicester will look to get back to winning ways but face another big test, hosting top of the table Arsenal on Saturday (kick-off 15:00 GMT).\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"

The goal came from lovely movement deep on the left from Schade and the link-up in midfield was excellent.\nBut without Ivan Toney up front, they lacked the necessary focal point and they couldn't build on such a good foundation.\nYoane Wissa missed a good chance before half-time and wasn't able to capitalise on winning the ball high a couple of times, while Bryan Mbeumo couldn't get into the game.\nWith Toney changing agents this week amid speculation linking him with a move, perhaps this was a warning shot to Frank that more firepower could be required before the transfer window shuts next week.\nPalace battle after flat start\nRoy Hodgson's men are also in dire need of a striker after another rather toothless display overall, but the way they grew into the game as it went on shows their Premier League nous.\nIt was a frustrating afternoon for Eze who continues to be Palace's shining light since Wilfried Zaha departed in the summer. Michael Olise and Matheus Franca remain out injured.\nInterest from Manchester City in Eze will do little to quell fears around their attack and. on a personal note, there were some nice moments from him as Palace improved. But Hodgson has already spoken about not wanting to rely on him to inspire them.\nIt was telling that Flekken wasn't tested at all until Edouard's free-kick which preceded his excellent double save.\nPalace continue to look bright on the counter-attack and more than competitive in midfield but they could be in for a long season if they don't begin to create and take more chances.\nReaction to Brentford v Crystal Palace, plus the rest of Saturday's action\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance?

We didn't do that well enough from the start,\" Fulham boss Silva told BBC Sport.\n\"It was a reaction that I wanted but that's how we should have started. He [Manor Solomon] needs to keep doing what he's doing. He doesn't have 90 minutes in his legs yet.

Have your say here.\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here.\nNelson colossal as Arsenal snatch victory\nNelson had played just 64 minutes of Premier League football this season - having struggled with thigh problems - before being thrown on as a second-half substitute by Mikel Arteta here.\nYet the homegrown talent was the unexpected hero, collecting a half-cleared corner outside the area and bending a superb strike beyond Bournemouth keeper Neto.\nThe outpouring of emotion that followed was immense; the Arsenal bench cleared as virtually every player and member of staff rushed to celebrate with the match-winner.\nNelson had earlier, with practically his first Premier League touch of 2023, provided the assist for White to equalise with his first Arsenal goal.\nWhite, brought on as a half-time substitute after Takehiro Tomiyasu endured a torrid 45 minutes, struck Nelson's deep cross first time and his shot was palmed away from behind the line by Neto, with referee Christopher Kavanagh giving it via goalline technology.\nWhat is remarkable is that Nelson, had everything gone to plan for Arsenal, would have been very unlikely to reach the pitch. He replaced Emile Smith Rowe, himself a sub for Leandro Trossard, who suffered a first half injury.\nHowever it is with unexpected twists, remarkable moments and incredible goals that titles are often won.\nBilling's rocket start in vain for Cherries\nArteta would have wanted his side to make a fast start in order to restore their advantage over City. He got the exact opposite.\nFrom the kick-off, Joe Rothwell fed a pass wide to Dango Ouattara, whose low ball across the box was dummied by Dominic Solanke and missed by Gabriel, who allowed it beneath his studs. Billing escaped William Saliba's lax marking, and finished under Aaron Ramsdale.\nWith the form which earned Gary O'Neil the permanent manager's seat a distant memory, and now just one win in their last 12 games, a win - or even a point - would have provided a real boost for Bournemouth in their bid to escape relegation.\nHowever, like Arsenal, their defence is their weakness. Nelson's strike was the 35th goal they have conceded in away Premier League matches this season - a division high.\nThe greater damage however could be psychological, with players, fans and O'Neil all left in despair by the late winner.\nFor a long time, Bournemouth defended their very early lead with stubbornness and co-ordination, marshalled well by goalkeeper-captain Neto, who made a terrific double save from Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka just minutes after Billing's opener.\nBournemouth were happy to attack on the break, and should have gone two ahead before half-time, Ramsdale making a superb spreading save to deny Dango Ouattara as the visitors countered from an Arsenal corner.\nHowever they dropped deeper as the game progressed - until the decisive blow in the final seconds.\nPartey gets the late party started\nWhile Arsenal continue to lead the pack in their pursuit of a first Premier League title in 19 years, they also have clear defensive frailties - they now have just three clean sheets in their past 18 home league games.\nArteta may have thought the return of Partey to central midfield, his first start in three weeks, would have given a defensive boost. But the Ghanaian, playing in front of his national team manager Chris Hughton, was at fault for the Bournemouth second.\nPartey lost his man Senesi from a 57th-minute corner, allowing the Italian defender a free near-post header past Ramsdale.\nHe started to make amends with Arsenal's first goal, volleying home from six yards - before Nelson took over.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Pain for Manchester United.\nMan Utd 'eaten alive' & Fernandes a 'disgrace' - pundits react\nReaction from Anfield as Liverpool thrash Man Utd\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n'We lost our heads' - Ten Hag\nFootball Daily podcast: It's seven heaven for Liverpool!\nUnited lost by the same margin to Blackburn Rovers in 1926, to Aston Villa in 1930 and to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1931.\nNone of those will be mentioned in the same breath as this truly remarkable game because of who inflicted it and where.\nThis is why this win was celebrated so wildly by Liverpool's baying fans. This is why Manchester United will be so badly wounded.\nThis will be a day that will be remembered forever by everyone who witnessed it at Anfield - even those United supporters who will try to blank it from their memory but will find it impossible - and far beyond.\nLiverpool have been scratching for the old certainties this season. The intensity. The passion. The ruthlessness. The controlled fury.\nUnfortunately for United, it all came flooding back in a game that will go down in history. It certainly put the Red Devils' renaissance, shown by the EFL Cup win against Newcastle United at Wembley, on temporary hold.\nMohamed Salah's two goals made him Liverpool's record Premier League scorer with 129, overtaking Robbie Fowler despite playing 61 fewer games.\nSalah's record shows the seismic impact he has had from pretty much the first day he arrived at Liverpool from Roma in June 2017 - and yet here he also took his place in what Klopp is building for the future.\nThe Egyptian netted two goals, almost expected given the fact he is also Liverpool's record scorer against Manchester United with 12.\nBut of great significance was the impact of two newcomers brought in as Klopp renews the attack that has served him so superbly - Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo.\nThis was the sight of an Anfield evolution as the pair gave a tantalising glimpse of the future.\nSalah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino formed one of the most potent tridents in world football in Klopp's first great team but the winds of change have been blowing.\nMane made his exit to Bayern Munich in the summer while Firmino announced on Friday that he would be leaving Liverpool at the end of the season.\nIndeed, it was a sign of Liverpool's perfect scriptwriting on Sunday that the Brazilian emerged as a substitute to a rapturous reception and provided the perfect finale to this landmark game with the goal that made it 7-0 in front of the Kop in the closing moments.\nAlongside those goals from Liverpool's old guard came two each from Gakpo and Nunez that hinted at the potency and promise within the next incarnation of Klopp's forward line.\nGakpo was a target for United manager Erik ten Hag before Liverpool stepped in to snatch him away from PSV Eindhoven in January - and here you could see what the attraction was.\nHe provided a smooth finish from Andrew Robertson's perfect pass to open up what had been, as remarkable as it sounds, a tight game for 43 minutes.\nGakpo scored Liverpool's third with a delicate flourish after brilliant work by Salah, before he was joined on the scoresheet by Nunez, who is now getting the goals his industry has deserved.\nNunez diverted Harvey Elliott's driven cross past United keeper David de Gea to put Liverpool 2-0 up then scored with another superb header from Jordan Henderson's ball in for the fifth.\nGakpo and Nunez are still early works in progress but they possess goals, variety and flexibility. Throw in the enduring, world-class Salah and this is another threatening Liverpool strikeforce in the making.\nIn the wider context, Klopp's side are now an ominous presence to Tottenham and Newcastle United in the fight for a top-four place.\nLiverpool are only three points behind Spurs, who lost at Wolves on Saturday, while Newcastle look to be fading after a fine first few months of the season.\nKlopp flagged up just how big this week was in shaping those ambitions and it has brought a deserved home win against Wolves before United were completely overwhelmed.\nHe said: \"It was the push we wanted. It puts us in the right direction. Everyone has to know we are still around.\n\"It wasn't the case for a while but this was a proper show of what we can be and what we have to be from now on.\"\nIt was after a 4-0 loss at Liverpool in April that then Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick announced: \"They are six years ahead of us.\"\nUnited's steps to recovery this season suggested the gap had been closed to an extent - but when Liverpool get it right, as they did here, it still resembles a chasm.\nOur coverage of Liverpool is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Liverpool - go straight to all the best content"

It's a great building block to carry on the journey with.\"\nIn an electrifying contest, Demarai Gray put Everton ahead from the penalty spot following Jonjo Shelvey's trip on Dwight McNeil.\nBut Forest were soon level. Toffees keeper Jordan Pickford parried out Morgan Gibbs-White's shot and Johnson coolly slotted in at the near post.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure restored Everton's lead by nodding in from close range before half-time, but Johnson's delightful curler into the top corner with 13 minutes remaining earned a point for the hosts.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nEverton's away blues continue\nHaving seen fellow strugglers Bournemouth, West Ham and Leeds all lose on Saturday, Everton had an opportunity to move up to 16th in the table, but they left a rowdy City Ground frustrated.\nAnd after losing their past three away games without scoring, the Toffees did show some progress.\nGray notched his fourth league goal of the season to become his club's top scorer this campaign, while Doucoure's header ensured they avoided going a club-record 14 consecutive games without scoring more than one goal.\nAnd McNeil came close to adding a third before the interval but his long-range drive was brilliantly tipped over the crossbar by Keylor Navas.\nBut their inability to win away from Goodison Park is costing them dear. Johnson's late equaliser means Everton still have just one league victory on their travels this season, at Southampton on 1 October.\nHome comforts key for Forest survival\nForest have a similarly poor away record, but a record of just three home defeats is helping keep them out of the relegation zone.\nAnd they had top scorer Johnson to thank for extending their unbeaten league run at the City Ground to nine matches.\nHis first goal was an opportunistic effort, as he reacted quickest to slot in at the near post after Pickford was unable to push Gibbs-White's drive away from the danger area.\nHis second was sublime. The ball fell to him in the box and he took a touch before caressing a delightful shot into the top corner\nThe draw means they have collected 20 of their 26 points in front of their own boisterous fans and that form at home could prove crucial in the run-in.\nForest boss Steve Cooper was unhappy with the performance of referee David Brooks, who he felt should have awarded a foul on Gibbs-White in the build-up to Everton's second goal.\nCooper said: \"I am disappointed with the referee but we'll reflect on it. I thought he got lots of decisions wrong.\n\"He will know that and he will probably have to explain his performance as well. It's a pity things like that ended up having an impact on the game.\n\"You want to win or lose with what the opponent does - not the officials.

I always want to aim as high as possible but it is important to not get too carried away.\n\"We are in a good place and it is all about continuing.\"\nGo to all the best Brentford content\nSign up for Bees news notifications\nDisappointing night for Fulham\nFulham still have European aspirations of their own as they have been a revelation under the guidance of Marco Silva since their return to the Premier League, but they ended well beaten by their London rivals.\nVinicius' late bundled goal gave the scoreline a flattering appearance for Fulham as it came with virtually the last kick of the game.\nSilva's big players Aleksandar Mitrovic and Willian were unable to exert any influence, snuffed out by Brentford's defending, and both endured a frustrating evening.\nThere was hope when the prolific Solomon reacted first to Pereira's shot hitting the woodwork but Brentford soon re-asserted their authority.\nFulham remain in a superb seventh place despite this setback and must now regroup as they face Premier League leaders Arsenal at Craven Cottage on Sunday before an FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport after the game, Silva said: \"Disappointing result of course, we wanted to fight for the three points.\n\"We know it was a derby, we knew the type of game they were going to play and they are strong at that type of game - a lot of challenges, a lot of duels, strong running in behind and we started sloppy.\n\"It was too sloppy. We didn't start aggressively enough, not brave enough and not with the quality we should have done. I am going to analyse it with the players and show them why things happen. We knew before how we should have started and we didn't start in that way.\"\nLatest Fulham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Fulham news notifications\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Traore's pace was particularly troublesome for the tiring Spurs defence as Wolves attacked down the wings.\nBut Wolves were rewarded for their endeavour with Traore's strike moving them up the table.\nGo straight to our Wolverhampton Wanderers page\nConte return will be a 'massive boost' - what the managers say\nTottenham assistant head coach Cristian Stellini: \"Antonio [Conte's return] will be a massive boost for us from tomorrow until the end of the season.\n\"It is important that Antonio is back.

It's a great building block to carry on the journey with.\"\nIn an electrifying contest, Demarai Gray put Everton ahead from the penalty spot following Jonjo Shelvey's trip on Dwight McNeil.\nBut Forest were soon level. Toffees keeper Jordan Pickford parried out Morgan Gibbs-White's shot and Johnson coolly slotted in at the near post.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure restored Everton's lead by nodding in from close range before half-time, but Johnson's delightful curler into the top corner with 13 minutes remaining earned a point for the hosts.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nEverton's away blues continue\nHaving seen fellow strugglers Bournemouth, West Ham and Leeds all lose on Saturday, Everton had an opportunity to move up to 16th in the table, but they left a rowdy City Ground frustrated.\nAnd after losing their past three away games without scoring, the Toffees did show some progress.\nGray notched his fourth league goal of the season to become his club's top scorer this campaign, while Doucoure's header ensured they avoided going a club-record 14 consecutive games without scoring more than one goal.\nAnd McNeil came close to adding a third before the interval but his long-range drive was brilliantly tipped over the crossbar by Keylor Navas.\nBut their inability to win away from Goodison Park is costing them dear. Johnson's late equaliser means Everton still have just one league victory on their travels this season, at Southampton on 1 October.\nHome comforts key for Forest survival\nForest have a similarly poor away record, but a record of just three home defeats is helping keep them out of the relegation zone.\nAnd they had top scorer Johnson to thank for extending their unbeaten league run at the City Ground to nine matches.\nHis first goal was an opportunistic effort, as he reacted quickest to slot in at the near post after Pickford was unable to push Gibbs-White's drive away from the danger area.\nHis second was sublime. The ball fell to him in the box and he took a touch before caressing a delightful shot into the top corner\nThe draw means they have collected 20 of their 26 points in front of their own boisterous fans and that form at home could prove crucial in the run-in.\nForest boss Steve Cooper was unhappy with the performance of referee David Brooks, who he felt should have awarded a foul on Gibbs-White in the build-up to Everton's second goal.\nCooper said: \"I am disappointed with the referee but we'll reflect on it. I thought he got lots of decisions wrong.\n\"He will know that and he will probably have to explain his performance as well. It's a pity things like that ended up having an impact on the game.\n\"You want to win or lose with what the opponent does - not the officials.

Have your say\nHave your say on Newcastle's display\nFoden the star of the show for City\nCity made hard work of this game at times, especially after half-time when some sloppy passing gave Newcastle the impetus to come forward and threaten an equaliser.\nBut they still showed flashes of their best attacking form, with Ilkay Gundogan and Haaland both just off target with headers before the break.\nFoden was the star of the show, however, with some silky touches out on the right flank showing his current mood, as well as the stylish way he took his goal.\nOverall it was a job well done for Pep Guardiola's side, with the bonus of a welcome clean sheet - Ederson's 100th in the Premier League - after a run of league games where defensive errors always seemed to result in them conceding a goal.\nNewcastle need to find a cutting edge\nNewcastle's spirit was admirable but their lack of goals remains a concern - they have now managed only three goals in eight league games in 2023, which is a big reason why they have not won any of the past five of them.\nBut there were signs of life in their attack here, starting in the first half when Callum Wilson and Sean Longstaff both had good chances - Wilson miskicked from just eight yards out, while Longstaff took too long to shoot, allowing Nathan Ake across to block.\nThe Magpies were even more of a threat when Allan Saint-Maximin, Joe Willock and Isak were all introduced at the same time, just after the hour mark, but they could not make the most of the period of pressure that followed.\nSilva's strike underlined how finishing was the biggest difference between the two sides on the day, and Newcastle will have to find their cutting edge if they are going to stay in the hunt for a Champions League spot.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Pain for Manchester United.\nMan Utd 'eaten alive' & Fernandes a 'disgrace' - pundits react\nReaction from Anfield as Liverpool thrash Man Utd\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n'We lost our heads' - Ten Hag\nFootball Daily podcast: It's seven heaven for Liverpool!\nUnited lost by the same margin to Blackburn Rovers in 1926, to Aston Villa in 1930 and to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1931.\nNone of those will be mentioned in the same breath as this truly remarkable game because of who inflicted it and where.\nThis is why this win was celebrated so wildly by Liverpool's baying fans. This is why Manchester United will be so badly wounded.\nThis will be a day that will be remembered forever by everyone who witnessed it at Anfield - even those United supporters who will try to blank it from their memory but will find it impossible - and far beyond.\nLiverpool have been scratching for the old certainties this season. The intensity. The passion. The ruthlessness. The controlled fury.\nUnfortunately for United, it all came flooding back in a game that will go down in history. It certainly put the Red Devils' renaissance, shown by the EFL Cup win against Newcastle United at Wembley, on temporary hold.\nMohamed Salah's two goals made him Liverpool's record Premier League scorer with 129, overtaking Robbie Fowler despite playing 61 fewer games.\nSalah's record shows the seismic impact he has had from pretty much the first day he arrived at Liverpool from Roma in June 2017 - and yet here he also took his place in what Klopp is building for the future.\nThe Egyptian netted two goals, almost expected given the fact he is also Liverpool's record scorer against Manchester United with 12.\nBut of great significance was the impact of two newcomers brought in as Klopp renews the attack that has served him so superbly - Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo.\nThis was the sight of an Anfield evolution as the pair gave a tantalising glimpse of the future.\nSalah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino formed one of the most potent tridents in world football in Klopp's first great team but the winds of change have been blowing.\nMane made his exit to Bayern Munich in the summer while Firmino announced on Friday that he would be leaving Liverpool at the end of the season.\nIndeed, it was a sign of Liverpool's perfect scriptwriting on Sunday that the Brazilian emerged as a substitute to a rapturous reception and provided the perfect finale to this landmark game with the goal that made it 7-0 in front of the Kop in the closing moments.\nAlongside those goals from Liverpool's old guard came two each from Gakpo and Nunez that hinted at the potency and promise within the next incarnation of Klopp's forward line.\nGakpo was a target for United manager Erik ten Hag before Liverpool stepped in to snatch him away from PSV Eindhoven in January - and here you could see what the attraction was.\nHe provided a smooth finish from Andrew Robertson's perfect pass to open up what had been, as remarkable as it sounds, a tight game for 43 minutes.\nGakpo scored Liverpool's third with a delicate flourish after brilliant work by Salah, before he was joined on the scoresheet by Nunez, who is now getting the goals his industry has deserved.\nNunez diverted Harvey Elliott's driven cross past United keeper David de Gea to put Liverpool 2-0 up then scored with another superb header from Jordan Henderson's ball in for the fifth.\nGakpo and Nunez are still early works in progress but they possess goals, variety and flexibility. Throw in the enduring, world-class Salah and this is another threatening Liverpool strikeforce in the making.\nIn the wider context, Klopp's side are now an ominous presence to Tottenham and Newcastle United in the fight for a top-four place.\nLiverpool are only three points behind Spurs, who lost at Wolves on Saturday, while Newcastle look to be fading after a fine first few months of the season.\nKlopp flagged up just how big this week was in shaping those ambitions and it has brought a deserved home win against Wolves before United were completely overwhelmed.\nHe said: \"It was the push we wanted. It puts us in the right direction. Everyone has to know we are still around.\n\"It wasn't the case for a while but this was a proper show of what we can be and what we have to be from now on.\"\nIt was after a 4-0 loss at Liverpool in April that then Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick announced: \"They are six years ahead of us.\"\nUnited's steps to recovery this season suggested the gap had been closed to an extent - but when Liverpool get it right, as they did here, it still resembles a chasm.\nOur coverage of Liverpool is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Liverpool - go straight to all the best content",

Have your say here.\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here.\nNelson colossal as Arsenal snatch victory\nNelson had played just 64 minutes of Premier League football this season - having struggled with thigh problems - before being thrown on as a second-half substitute by Mikel Arteta here.\nYet the homegrown talent was the unexpected hero, collecting a half-cleared corner outside the area and bending a superb strike beyond Bournemouth keeper Neto.\nThe outpouring of emotion that followed was immense; the Arsenal bench cleared as virtually every player and member of staff rushed to celebrate with the match-winner.\nNelson had earlier, with practically his first Premier League touch of 2023, provided the assist for White to equalise with his first Arsenal goal.\nWhite, brought on as a half-time substitute after Takehiro Tomiyasu endured a torrid 45 minutes, struck Nelson's deep cross first time and his shot was palmed away from behind the line by Neto, with referee Christopher Kavanagh giving it via goalline technology.\nWhat is remarkable is that Nelson, had everything gone to plan for Arsenal, would have been very unlikely to reach the pitch. He replaced Emile Smith Rowe, himself a sub for Leandro Trossard, who suffered a first half injury.\nHowever it is with unexpected twists, remarkable moments and incredible goals that titles are often won.\nBilling's rocket start in vain for Cherries\nArteta would have wanted his side to make a fast start in order to restore their advantage over City. He got the exact opposite.\nFrom the kick-off, Joe Rothwell fed a pass wide to Dango Ouattara, whose low ball across the box was dummied by Dominic Solanke and missed by Gabriel, who allowed it beneath his studs. Billing escaped William Saliba's lax marking, and finished under Aaron Ramsdale.\nWith the form which earned Gary O'Neil the permanent manager's seat a distant memory, and now just one win in their last 12 games, a win - or even a point - would have provided a real boost for Bournemouth in their bid to escape relegation.\nHowever, like Arsenal, their defence is their weakness. Nelson's strike was the 35th goal they have conceded in away Premier League matches this season - a division high.\nThe greater damage however could be psychological, with players, fans and O'Neil all left in despair by the late winner.\nFor a long time, Bournemouth defended their very early lead with stubbornness and co-ordination, marshalled well by goalkeeper-captain Neto, who made a terrific double save from Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka just minutes after Billing's opener.\nBournemouth were happy to attack on the break, and should have gone two ahead before half-time, Ramsdale making a superb spreading save to deny Dango Ouattara as the visitors countered from an Arsenal corner.\nHowever they dropped deeper as the game progressed - until the decisive blow in the final seconds.\nPartey gets the late party started\nWhile Arsenal continue to lead the pack in their pursuit of a first Premier League title in 19 years, they also have clear defensive frailties - they now have just three clean sheets in their past 18 home league games.\nArteta may have thought the return of Partey to central midfield, his first start in three weeks, would have given a defensive boost. But the Ghanaian, playing in front of his national team manager Chris Hughton, was at fault for the Bournemouth second.\nPartey lost his man Senesi from a 57th-minute corner, allowing the Italian defender a free near-post header past Ramsdale.\nHe started to make amends with Arsenal's first goal, volleying home from six yards - before Nelson took over.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say\nHave your say on Newcastle's display\nFoden the star of the show for City\nCity made hard work of this game at times, especially after half-time when some sloppy passing gave Newcastle the impetus to come forward and threaten an equaliser.\nBut they still showed flashes of their best attacking form, with Ilkay Gundogan and Haaland both just off target with headers before the break.\nFoden was the star of the show, however, with some silky touches out on the right flank showing his current mood, as well as the stylish way he took his goal.\nOverall it was a job well done for Pep Guardiola's side, with the bonus of a welcome clean sheet - Ederson's 100th in the Premier League - after a run of league games where defensive errors always seemed to result in them conceding a goal.\nNewcastle need to find a cutting edge\nNewcastle's spirit was admirable but their lack of goals remains a concern - they have now managed only three goals in eight league games in 2023, which is a big reason why they have not won any of the past five of them.\nBut there were signs of life in their attack here, starting in the first half when Callum Wilson and Sean Longstaff both had good chances - Wilson miskicked from just eight yards out, while Longstaff took too long to shoot, allowing Nathan Ake across to block.\nThe Magpies were even more of a threat when Allan Saint-Maximin, Joe Willock and Isak were all introduced at the same time, just after the hour mark, but they could not make the most of the period of pressure that followed.\nSilva's strike underlined how finishing was the biggest difference between the two sides on the day, and Newcastle will have to find their cutting edge if they are going to stay in the hunt for a Champions League spot.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Send us your views here\nTottenham's disappointing week continues\nTottenham had been looking to send a message of immediate improvement after being knocked out of the FA Cup by Championship promotion chasers Sheffield United on Wednesday.\nThey took the game to the hosts early on and Dejan Kulusevski's curling effort forced Jose Sa into a good save but despite playing with a high intensity, only six of their 21 shots hit the target.\nIn what was assistant head coach Cristian Stellini's final game in charge before Antonio Conte's return from gall bladder surgery, there were familiar inconsistencies.\nTottenham are four points ahead of fifth-place Newcastle United, who were beaten by Manchester City on Saturday but have two games in hand.\nAll the Tottenham news and views in one place\nRelegation worries eased\nWolves were in the relegation zone when Julen Lopetegui took over as manager in November but this victory, their first over a team in the top four this season, has pushed them into mid-table and six points clear of the drop zone.\nThey failed to produce any shots in the first half, but were much improved after the break.\nCaptain Neves was inspirational, linking play in the final third and testing Forster, while Matheus Cunha hit the side-netting when through on goal.\nLopetegui's second-half introduction of Traore and Joao Moutinho added another dimension to their front line.

Tough but fair.\n\"It shows, he had played over 500 games in big leagues and never been sent off. Now it has happened twice.\"\nTen Hag complained about the lack of consistency in the use of VAR, noting the referee was not sent to the monitor to review controversial incidents in Saturday's game between Leicester and Chelsea.\nDespite having a man advantage for almost an hour and managing 17 shots, Southampton were unable to capitalise and remain bottom of the Premier League.\nEven before Casemiro's early exit, David de Gea needed to make a brilliant reaction save to turn away Theo Walcott's close-range header.\nDe Gea then produced a one-handed save after the break when Walcott ran clear of the home defence, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line when Scott McTominay turned a Kyle Walker-Peters cross towards his own goal. In addition, James Ward-Prowse's free-kick skimmed of the top of the bar and Walker-Peters also hit a post with an angled drive.\nUnited had some dangerous moments themselves, with captain Bruno Fernandes' goalbound effort tipped on to the inside of a post by Gavin Bazunu.\nThe result consolidated United's top-four position, whilst Southampton are effectively three points from safety given their goal difference, with 12 games of the campaign remaining.\nGo straight to all the best Manchester United content\nVisit our Southampton page\nSouthampton show improvement\nDespite their position in the table, Southampton's form is good.\nThey have now picked up seven points from four games since Nathan Jones was sacked on 12 February.\nIt represents their most productive run since August and Wednesday's rearranged game with Brentford does offer the opportunity for Ruben Selles' side to climb out of the relegation zone for the first time since the end of October.\nNevertheless, their goalscoring is a concern - in only one league match since August have they scored more than once. They had the chances to improve that statistic at Old Trafford but couldn't make them count.\nCasemiro's ill discipline\nCasemiro has been one of the key reasons behind United's improvement this season.\nBut the positivity around the Brazilian is in danger of being undermined by his disciplinary record.\nSent off against Crystal Palace last month for grabbing Will Hughes round the neck following a mass confrontation, his latest red card was also triggered by the intervention of VAR.\nCasemiro did play the top of the ball first but Taylor decided the tackle was dangerous.\nTen Hag said Casemiro was emotional in the dressing room afterwards.\n\"He is disappointed,\" Ten Hag said.\nUnless United manage a successful appeal, the four-match suspension would rule him out of next week's FA Cup quarter-final with Fulham, plus the three Premier League games that follow.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

There are strong signs that the mentality is growing.\"\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nBattling Toffees given hope\nDyche said \"every\" league game is now a must-win as he looks to preserve Everton's top-flight status.\nBut after seeing Bournemouth beat Liverpool earlier on Saturday, then Nottingham Forest, Leicester and Leeds all dropping points around them, the Toffees needed a win.\nA gritty, battling performance allowed them to hold on to McNeil's first-minute goal to collect their third 1-0 victory in seven games since Dyche's appointment in January.\nAfter 26 games this season Everton had 22 points, identical to the same stage under Frank Lampard last term when the former Chelsea boss guided them to safety.\nFive victories in their remaining games was sufficient on that occasion, and now they have real hope of doing the same under the ex-Burnley manager - with Dyche's former Clarets player McNeil the match-winner at Goodison Park.\nEverton should have been out of sight but Michael Keane headed wide when the goal was gaping after beating David Raya to the ball, while Amadou Onana screwed over from eight yards with the goal at his mercy.\nThe lively Gray - who was unlucky to have a goal chalked off - saw a low shot saved by Raya and the Brentford goalkeeper also kept out Alex Iwobi's close-range effort from the resulting corner.\n\"The win was satisfying for different reasons,\" said Dyche. \"The first half we were very good, you could arguably say we should have gone more in front - we were effective.\n\"In the second half they were a team 12 unbeaten, a good outfit that has matured and they came back into it.\n\"It was good play from them. They ask questions of you with some very good players. It gets nervy but we gave them too many turnovers with the ball. You have to find ways of winning Premier League matches.\"\nThomas Frank's side last lost in the Premier League back in October but were second best for large periods as their run came to an end.\nStriker Ivan Toney was well shackled by Everton's centre-halves, while Rico Henry had a header blocked on the line by Seamus Coleman.\nWith the visitors in desperate search of an equaliser keeper Raya trotted upfield in injury time, but sent a free header from 10 yards past the post.\nFrank said: \"I don't know how many teams in the last five years have gone 12 unbeaten in the Premier League, apart from Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\"But that is the past and for the history books.

Their wait for a shot on target will now extend to a fourth game after setting a competition record since Opta began recording such data in 2003-04.\nThey were handed a rare first-half opening when Olise dispossessed Foden in midfield and set Wilfried Zaha away, while substitute Eberechi Eze saw an attempt blocked amid a late search for an equaliser.\nPalace's five points in 2023 is the lowest in the division, and just four points separate Vieira's misfiring side from the relegation places before difficult trips to Brighton and then Arsenal.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

When it's a one-goal lead, it's very delicate. It should have been more at half-time.\n\"Wolves came back into the game, but the character shown by the group to go again and get the winning goal is a great feeling for us.\"\nAfter a quiet start, their opener arrived when Kieran Trippier's dangerous free kick was met by Isak, who edged clear of his marker and buried a powerful header into the corner.\nThat sparked Newcastle into life and they came close to a second goal when Bruno Guimaraes hit the bar with a header from close range after Dan Burn had helped Trippier's corner back into the six-yard box.\nTrippier was guilty of a defensive error to allow Wolves to level in the second half when he slipped and collided with Pope as he attempted a clearance, the ball falling at the feet of Hwang, who tapped into an open net seconds after coming on to the pitch.\nAfter Almiron restored Newcastle's lead, Sven Botman came close to a third in stoppage time when he blazed wide from six yards after some wonderful interplay between the Paraguayan and Guimaraes.\nWolves rue non-penalty call\nThough Newcastle deserved their victory, Wolves will feel the decisive moment of the match went against them when it was still goalless.\nPope miscontrolled a back pass that was intercepted by Jimenez and the Mexico striker appeared to be bodychecked by the England goalkeeper as he attempted to run on to the ball.\nReferee Madley, who was a considerable distance away, waved away their appeals and the video assistant referee did not ask the official to take a second look on the monitor.\n\"For me, we should have had a penalty. We are very unlucky with the referee,\" Lopetegui told Sky Sports.\n\"In the second half, we improved a lot.

They are still only 10th but now sit just two points off a potential European place.\nThey led from their first major chance when Chilwell met Kalidou Koulibaly's cross to smash home, a goal he celebrated against his former employers.\nIt could have been even better with Felix clipping a shot past Danny Ward which hit the post, then finding the net from Ruben Loftus-Cheek's cross. With everyone back at the centre circle ready to restart, it was ruled out by the VAR because Felix was offside.\nHavertz did put them back into the lead with a clever finish from Fernandez's ball.\nThe \u00a389m Ukraine forward Mudryk sped away from Leicester's defence to slot in but he was ruled outside. Not long after he had his first assist in English football as Havertz crossed from the right and Mudryk headed down for Kovacic to lash in.\nThe goal was checked by the VAR for a potential Havertz offside but the goal was given.\nPressure grows on Rodgers?\nLeicester's season is ridiculously streaky. They started the season terribly and then went on a great run before the World Cup. Then they lost their first four Premier League games after the break, before going three unbeaten and now losing four in a row (five including the FA Cup defeat by Blackburn).\nThis latest decline has taken them to within touching distance of the relegation zone and they were booed off at full-time.\nFive losses in a row is their worst run since November to December 2014. They have suffered 16 Premier League defeats in a season for only the second time - the most Rodgers has ever lost in a league season in his managerial career.\nNot taking chances has been one of their issues this season - and they had 17 shots here (to Chelsea's 12), but only netted once.\nJames Maddison was one of their star performers again with five shots, two on target, and three chances created. But none ended up in the net.\nHe should have had an assist when his free-kick landed on the head of Daniel Amartey in front of an open goal but the defender somehow missed.\nDewsbury-Hall cracked a deflected shot off the angle of bar and post from 25 yards out.\nThe chances continued in the second half with Harry Souttar having an effort cleared off the line by Conor Gallagher and Dewsbury-Hall mis-kicking when he had an easy chance from six yards out.\nTheir misery was compounded when Faes lunged in on Carney Chukwuemeka and was shown his second yellow card.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Arsenal provided the answer at Craven Cottage with their fifth successive Premier League win.\nFulham in danger of fading\nMarco Silva's Fulham have been an outstanding addition to the top flight this season - a surprise package given they were rated as relegation favourites by many.\nHere, however, they were well short of the standards they have set and this comprehensive defeat capped a disappointing week after losing the west London derby at Brentford on Monday.\nThere were mitigating circumstances with two of their most influential performers missing, Willian ruled out with a back muscle injury and Joao Palhinha suspended. The goals have also dried up for main marksman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has 11 this season, but last scored in January.\nAfter a below-par display, Fulham only came to life after the break when the game was effectively over.\nCurrently in eighth place, they have done so well to put themselves in contention for European football next season.\nSilva's main task now is to ensure the conclusion to this campaign does not drift away into anti-climax.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

It is confidence.\n\"We showed the character and personality and played some really good football at times.

He showed he has talent.\"\nPalace pay for profligacy\nHaving pressed and pressurised Brighton into several early mistakes, the visitors could and should have been well ahead by the time March opened the scoring in the 15th minute.\nZaha's wriggling run through the home defence caused Seagulls goalkeeper Jason Steele to readjust hastily to prevent an opening-minute goal for the visitors.\nBut their was a distinct lack of conviction shown with the chances then presented to French forward Edouard - who headed wide under no pressure - and Olise's attempt that Steele saved with the winger converging on goal.\nJoachim Andersen's tame effort and substitute Naouirou Ahamada's late miss - dragging a shot wide with the full goal to aim at - summed up a miserable night for Palace in attack.\nBrighton continue their charge\nWhile this was far from Brighton at their brilliant best, they still got the job done in a manner that their fans have become accustomed to - by attempting to dominate possession.\nA sign of the Seagulls' progress in recent weeks can be seen by the attitude in the stands, with draws at Leeds and in the reverse fixture against Palace now viewed as dropped points.\nAnd had they not had a goal incorrectly ruled out by VAR for offside at Selhurst Park last month, their European hopes would be even greater.\nAs it was, De Zerbi was able to rest Adam Webster and Evan Ferguson for the majority of the contest and still see his side eke out a valuable three points courtesy of March, who is enjoying his best goalscoring return in a season.\nThe 28-year-old, who also scored in last weekend's draw at Leeds, provided a useful nudge to Gareth Southgate, who names his latest England squad on Thursday.\n\"Every English player wants to work towards playing for their national team,\" March said.\n\"It would be an honour but I have to keep doing what I am doing and let's see what happens.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment."

Still we are there,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports.\n\"Here in the typical winter game, a difficult one, we were there all the time and then we won it.\n\"Now we have to do absolutely everything and next Tuesday and Saturday.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here\n\"After the matches we lost to Arsenal and Leicester, the reaction has been fantastic. Today is maybe the best 90 minutes we played here since I arrived,\" Emery told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We controlled the game with the ball. We conceded some chances to them, but I think it is normal because they are in a good moment. I'm happy today and I want to share it with the players and supporters.\n\"We have to rest a little bit but now we have a big challenge because we are slowly going up. We are looking up. It's important to have big ambitions and face big challenges. We have Chelsea in two weeks and we have to try and be consistent.\n\"Next step is top 10, but if we are ambitious you want to get to something more and look at the teams in the European positions. Of course it is not in our hands to take a European place, but we have to try. We have to take this new challenge.\"\nVilla were on top from the start and, after Luiz put them in front, they had numerous chances to extend the lead.\nOllie Watkins had the best of the opportunities when he was put through by Buendia, only for his dinked effort to be kept out by Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto.\nThe hosts might also have had a penalty six minutes before the break when Ramsey's goalbound shot was deflected over the bar by the hand of Stephens, but the video assistant referee turned down Villa's appeals.\nBournemouth's limited threat came through the pace of their front three. However, Dominic Solanke, now without a goal in 10 league matches, lacked conviction when clean through and his hesitation allowed Mings to get back and make the block.\nDefeat left Gary O'Neil's side a point from safety, but there was a major highlight as David Brooks came on to make his first appearance since being diagnosed with cancer in 2021 - 534 days since his last game.\nVilla continue to make progress under Emery\nWhen Emery took charge in October, Villa were below Bournemouth in the table. Victory on Saturday means they are now 14 points ahead of them and they looked the superior side throughout.\nEven before going in front, Villa looked to have the measure of Bournemouth, with Buendia, flanked by Ramsey and Bailey, finding space between midfield and defence and looking to feed Watkins.\nAfter the goal, VIlla eased off and allowed Bournemouth back into it, but a couple of scares midway through the half shook them out of their slumber and by the break they were in the ascendancy once more.\nChances were more scarce early in the second period, but Villa always maintained control of the game as Luiz and John McGinn patrolled the middle of the park, and the hosts always looked the more likely to find the game's second goal.\nRamsey eventually provided it and Villa were able to express themselves for the final 10 minutes, creating chances at will as Watkins came close again and Mings spurned a glorious chance, shooting straight at Neto from seven yards out having been left all alone at the far post.\nWith 11 games to go and only four points separating sixth and 11th in the table, Villa have the chance to make it an exciting end to the season and push for an unlikely European spot.\nBlunt Bournemouth struggle again on road\nAfter the high of toppling Liverpool a week ago, it was back to reality for Bournemouth as they succumbed to a ninth defeat in 10 away games in all competitions.\nThe manner in which Villa were able to cut through them will be a concern for O'Neil and the Cherries have now kept only one clean sheet in 24 league away games.\nBournemouth's best spell came after the opening goal as they managed to get players close to Buendia and frustrate the Villa creator.\nHowever, Villa adjusted, Bournemouth did not and the Argentine was soon collecting the ball in vast areas of space again - and if it was not him, then it was Bailey, Ramsey or left-back Alex Moreno exposing the gaps.\nJust as concerning was the lack of threat at the other end. Against Liverpool and Arsenal, Bournemouth were always dangerous on the break.\nThey were again here but, with Villa also at their best on the counter, such chances were harder to come by, especially after going behind so early.\nTasked with trying to break down a set Villa backline, Bournemouth rarely troubled Emi Martinez in the home goal as they suffered another disappointing day on the road.\nVisit our Aston Villa page\nMore Bournemouth content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Arsenal provided the answer at Craven Cottage with their fifth successive Premier League win.\nFulham in danger of fading\nMarco Silva's Fulham have been an outstanding addition to the top flight this season - a surprise package given they were rated as relegation favourites by many.\nHere, however, they were well short of the standards they have set and this comprehensive defeat capped a disappointing week after losing the west London derby at Brentford on Monday.\nThere were mitigating circumstances with two of their most influential performers missing, Willian ruled out with a back muscle injury and Joao Palhinha suspended. The goals have also dried up for main marksman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has 11 this season, but last scored in January.\nAfter a below-par display, Fulham only came to life after the break when the game was effectively over.\nCurrently in eighth place, they have done so well to put themselves in contention for European football next season.\nSilva's main task now is to ensure the conclusion to this campaign does not drift away into anti-climax.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Arsenal 4-1 Crystal Palace: 'Fearless Gunners have a beautiful attitude' - Martin Keown analysis\nI loved hearing Bukayo Saka say Arsenal don't fear anyone when we asked him what he thinks about the Gunners' title run-in on MOTD2.\nIt's a beautiful attitude for any side to have, and it's especially important in the situation that Saka and his team-mates are in now, eight points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table with 10 games to go.\nI know from my own experiences as an Arsenal player that when you reach this stage of the season with a chance of winning the Premier League, then your eyes are drawn straight to the fixture list. The finish line is in sight and you kind of go into countdown mode, working through your remaining games.\nWhen we spoke to him after the Gunners beat Crystal Palace on Sunday, we asked Saka about their remaining fixtures - but he threw it back at me and asked me what I thought.\nI said there were a lot of tough games coming up, especially away from home. They are probably going to have to win at Anfield and St James' Park, and their trip to the Etihad is obviously massive, so there is no time to relax, even with the points cushion they have got. They have to keep going until it is done.\nHe was like, 'Yeah I'll take that answer', and I am not surprised that he is thinking the same way we did when we won the title under Arsene Wenger in 1998 and 2002, after fierce battles with Manchester United each time.\nArteta urges Arsenal to maintain mindset\nAll the latest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news notifications\nWinning run reminds me of past glories\nArsenal will have to hold off City's challenge to take their crown, and everyone can see that Pep Guardiola's side are beginning to click and move up a gear. Erling Haaland is a goal machine, and he isn't missing at the moment.\nI have heard some absurd things about Haaland and how he is somehow making City weaker, even as recently as their draw with RB Leipzig at the end of last month. But I've not heard anyone suggest that this week. We've all seen how deadly he is.\nIt is obvious why he is doing so well - because City have so many intelligent players that they were always going to find a way to feed him. But so far, whatever City have done, Arsenal have found an answer, firstly to maintain their advantage and now extend it.\nCity went top when they beat the Gunners at Emirates Stadium five weeks ago but Arsenal have hit back with six successive league wins, which is just an incredible response.\nIt reminds me of when we won 12 successive games under Wenger from the start of February to clinch the title in 2002, and also the 10 wins in a row from March onwards that took us to glory in 1998.\nWe came from behind then, but this situation is really no different despite Arsenal having the advantage this time. It still feels like they are going to have to win all of their games, apart from their trip to City.\nAgain, that reminds me of 2002, when we beat our nearest rivals United at Old Trafford in the penultimate game to clinch the title. Our thinking beforehand was that we just needed to not lose, and we could wrap it up at the weekend. But Sylvain Wiltord's goal meant we went one better and actually won it there.\nYou wouldn't dare to dream that Arsenal could do that at the Etihad. But, as Saka told us, they believe they can beat anyone. And on their day I think they can, which is what has helped to get them into this amazing position in the first place.\nIt is going to be fascinating to see how the title race unfolds from here, but I would say Arsenal have done all they can do until now.\nThere is still so much work left, but they have got the points in bag to build up this lead and City will have to deal with some fixture congestion in order to catch them while they try to win the Champions League and FA Cup too. Basically, this lead might still not be enough, but Arsenal have put the defending champions under the maximum possible amount of pressure.\nSaka keeps delivering goals and assists\nCompared with some of Arsenal's forthcoming games, beating Palace at home was probably seen as being relatively simple. But that has not been the case against the Eagles in recent years - they hadn't lost on any of their previous four visits to the Emirates.\nThis time was different, and as well as the result, Arsenal's performance was the perfect way for them to sign off for the international break.\nI made a point of praising Gabriel Martinelli when I spoke about the game on MOTD2 because he missed a penalty in the shootout against Sporting Lisbon in midweek but did not show any kind of hangover from that Europa League defeat.\nMartinelli started the game so well, and was a real driving force with his determination down the left-hand side. In front of goal, he just gets better and better, and I think of him as a natural finisher when he gets into those central areas like he did to score the opener against Palace.\nAnother Arsenal player who had some disappointment this week was Ben White, who wasn't named in the England squad, and he played like he had a point to prove.\nWhite's link-up play with Saka down the right is sensational and there always seems to be a chance at the end of it too.\nSaka gives so much to this team that I was joking with him afterwards that Gareth Southgate should give him a rest in these next two England games. We don't want him injured now.\nHe has started every league game this season and, whether it is a goal or an assist, he keeps on delivering. Every Arsenal fan is hoping for more of the same in the final two months of the campaign.\nHow Arsenal are kings of the capital\nIt has gone under the radar a bit, but there is another reason why beating Palace is something for Arsenal to shout about.\nThey became the first side in 135 years of English Football League history to win nine London derbies in a single league season. So far they have only dropped points in one, in last month's draw against Brentford, which is some record.\nYes, there are more derbies than usual this year, but you cannot underestimate how difficult those games are. That makes things harder for Arsenal, not easier.\nI know from playing in them that it is not just the north London derby with Tottenham that is fiercely contested. You have local rivals from the east, west and south of the city too.\nIt means a hell of a lot for them to beat you, and they are always waiting for their opportunity, especially in a season like this where Arsenal are getting lots of plaudits.\nThis season, almost a third of Arsenal's league games - 12 out of the 38 - are derbies, which is a huge chunk. It makes it relentless, because there is always one on the horizon - in fact, there are two still to go.\nSo it's not just, say, the Liverpool and City fixtures that stand out for me as being tough in Arsenal's run-in. The games against Chelsea and West Ham will be horrible too.\nNeither of those teams are having great seasons, but they know they could stop Arsenal from winning the title. Whatever else they are playing for, that is all the incentive they need.\nMartin Keown was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nOur coverage of the Gunners is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Arsenal - go straight to all the best content",

There was no intent from the Spaniard, but Salisbury wasted little time in brandishing the red card after being told to review the tackle on his monitor.\nUnused substitute Matheus Nunes was also shown a red card deep into second-half stoppage time after remonstrating with the officials in the aftermath of Rodrigo's late goal.\nAfter conceding four for the first time since October, Wolves' meeting with Nottingham Forest after the international break now takes on added importance.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It is confidence.\n\"We showed the character and personality and played some really good football at times. When you look at those aspects, it's positive.\n\"But the most important is to score and we have to keep being positive and change our mindset, especially the front players. The players need to understand those opportunities are important.\"\nBrighton news and fan views\nGo straight to all the best Palace content\nWhile Wilfried Zaha, Odsonne Edouard and Michael Olise were unable to make an early breakthrough for the Eagles, Solly March's goal proved decisive, with the winger clinically finishing into the bottom left corner from Kaoru Mitoma's incisive pass.\nRoberto de Zerbi's side always looked the more accomplished after that and move level on 42 points with sixth-placed Liverpool, while they are six behind Tottenham in fourth, with two games in hand.\nThe result will only deepen concerns at Palace, who sit 12th in the table but just three points above the bottom three.\nHowever, Vieira had few complaints about the performance of goalkeeper Joe Whitworth on his Palace debut - a memorable night for the 19-year-old as he deputised for the injured Vicente Guaita.\nThe teenager, who grew up as an Eagles supporter and was also a club ball boy, was given little chance by March's unerring finish but kept his side in the game after the break by superbly saving Pervis Estupinan's low shot and an Alexis Mac Allister header.\n\"There was no doubt about his confidence,\" Vieira added.\n\"He is a confident young player who knows the club up and down. He showed he has talent.\"\nPalace pay for profligacy\nHaving pressed and pressurised Brighton into several early mistakes, the visitors could and should have been well ahead by the time March opened the scoring in the 15th minute.\nZaha's wriggling run through the home defence caused Seagulls goalkeeper Jason Steele to readjust hastily to prevent an opening-minute goal for the visitors.\nBut their was a distinct lack of conviction shown with the chances then presented to French forward Edouard - who headed wide under no pressure - and Olise's attempt that Steele saved with the winger converging on goal.\nJoachim Andersen's tame effort and substitute Naouirou Ahamada's late miss - dragging a shot wide with the full goal to aim at - summed up a miserable night for Palace in attack.\nBrighton continue their charge\nWhile this was far from Brighton at their brilliant best, they still got the job done in a manner that their fans have become accustomed to - by attempting to dominate possession.\nA sign of the Seagulls' progress in recent weeks can be seen by the attitude in the stands, with draws at Leeds and in the reverse fixture against Palace now viewed as dropped points.\nAnd had they not had a goal incorrectly ruled out by VAR for offside at Selhurst Park last month, their European hopes would be even greater.\nAs it was, De Zerbi was able to rest Adam Webster and Evan Ferguson for the majority of the contest and still see his side eke out a valuable three points courtesy of March, who is enjoying his best goalscoring return in a season.\nThe 28-year-old, who also scored in last weekend's draw at Leeds, provided a useful nudge to Gareth Southgate, who names his latest England squad on Thursday.\n\"Every English player wants to work towards playing for their national team,\" March said.\n\"It would be an honour but I have to keep doing what I am doing and let's see what happens.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Arsenal 4-1 Crystal Palace: 'Fearless Gunners have a beautiful attitude' - Martin Keown analysis\nI loved hearing Bukayo Saka say Arsenal don't fear anyone when we asked him what he thinks about the Gunners' title run-in on MOTD2.\nIt's a beautiful attitude for any side to have, and it's especially important in the situation that Saka and his team-mates are in now, eight points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table with 10 games to go.\nI know from my own experiences as an Arsenal player that when you reach this stage of the season with a chance of winning the Premier League, then your eyes are drawn straight to the fixture list. The finish line is in sight and you kind of go into countdown mode, working through your remaining games.\nWhen we spoke to him after the Gunners beat Crystal Palace on Sunday, we asked Saka about their remaining fixtures - but he threw it back at me and asked me what I thought.\nI said there were a lot of tough games coming up, especially away from home. They are probably going to have to win at Anfield and St James' Park, and their trip to the Etihad is obviously massive, so there is no time to relax, even with the points cushion they have got. They have to keep going until it is done.\nHe was like, 'Yeah I'll take that answer', and I am not surprised that he is thinking the same way we did when we won the title under Arsene Wenger in 1998 and 2002, after fierce battles with Manchester United each time.\nArteta urges Arsenal to maintain mindset\nAll the latest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news notifications\nWinning run reminds me of past glories\nArsenal will have to hold off City's challenge to take their crown, and everyone can see that Pep Guardiola's side are beginning to click and move up a gear. Erling Haaland is a goal machine, and he isn't missing at the moment.\nI have heard some absurd things about Haaland and how he is somehow making City weaker, even as recently as their draw with RB Leipzig at the end of last month. But I've not heard anyone suggest that this week. We've all seen how deadly he is.\nIt is obvious why he is doing so well - because City have so many intelligent players that they were always going to find a way to feed him. But so far, whatever City have done, Arsenal have found an answer, firstly to maintain their advantage and now extend it.\nCity went top when they beat the Gunners at Emirates Stadium five weeks ago but Arsenal have hit back with six successive league wins, which is just an incredible response.\nIt reminds me of when we won 12 successive games under Wenger from the start of February to clinch the title in 2002, and also the 10 wins in a row from March onwards that took us to glory in 1998.\nWe came from behind then, but this situation is really no different despite Arsenal having the advantage this time. It still feels like they are going to have to win all of their games, apart from their trip to City.\nAgain, that reminds me of 2002, when we beat our nearest rivals United at Old Trafford in the penultimate game to clinch the title. Our thinking beforehand was that we just needed to not lose, and we could wrap it up at the weekend. But Sylvain Wiltord's goal meant we went one better and actually won it there.\nYou wouldn't dare to dream that Arsenal could do that at the Etihad. But, as Saka told us, they believe they can beat anyone. And on their day I think they can, which is what has helped to get them into this amazing position in the first place.\nIt is going to be fascinating to see how the title race unfolds from here, but I would say Arsenal have done all they can do until now.\nThere is still so much work left, but they have got the points in bag to build up this lead and City will have to deal with some fixture congestion in order to catch them while they try to win the Champions League and FA Cup too. Basically, this lead might still not be enough, but Arsenal have put the defending champions under the maximum possible amount of pressure.\nSaka keeps delivering goals and assists\nCompared with some of Arsenal's forthcoming games, beating Palace at home was probably seen as being relatively simple. But that has not been the case against the Eagles in recent years - they hadn't lost on any of their previous four visits to the Emirates.\nThis time was different, and as well as the result, Arsenal's performance was the perfect way for them to sign off for the international break.\nI made a point of praising Gabriel Martinelli when I spoke about the game on MOTD2 because he missed a penalty in the shootout against Sporting Lisbon in midweek but did not show any kind of hangover from that Europa League defeat.\nMartinelli started the game so well, and was a real driving force with his determination down the left-hand side. In front of goal, he just gets better and better, and I think of him as a natural finisher when he gets into those central areas like he did to score the opener against Palace.\nAnother Arsenal player who had some disappointment this week was Ben White, who wasn't named in the England squad, and he played like he had a point to prove.\nWhite's link-up play with Saka down the right is sensational and there always seems to be a chance at the end of it too.\nSaka gives so much to this team that I was joking with him afterwards that Gareth Southgate should give him a rest in these next two England games. We don't want him injured now.\nHe has started every league game this season and, whether it is a goal or an assist, he keeps on delivering. Every Arsenal fan is hoping for more of the same in the final two months of the campaign.\nHow Arsenal are kings of the capital\nIt has gone under the radar a bit, but there is another reason why beating Palace is something for Arsenal to shout about.\nThey became the first side in 135 years of English Football League history to win nine London derbies in a single league season. So far they have only dropped points in one, in last month's draw against Brentford, which is some record.\nYes, there are more derbies than usual this year, but you cannot underestimate how difficult those games are. That makes things harder for Arsenal, not easier.\nI know from playing in them that it is not just the north London derby with Tottenham that is fiercely contested. You have local rivals from the east, west and south of the city too.\nIt means a hell of a lot for them to beat you, and they are always waiting for their opportunity, especially in a season like this where Arsenal are getting lots of plaudits.\nThis season, almost a third of Arsenal's league games - 12 out of the 38 - are derbies, which is a huge chunk. It makes it relentless, because there is always one on the horizon - in fact, there are two still to go.\nSo it's not just, say, the Liverpool and City fixtures that stand out for me as being tough in Arsenal's run-in. The games against Chelsea and West Ham will be horrible too.\nNeither of those teams are having great seasons, but they know they could stop Arsenal from winning the title. Whatever else they are playing for, that is all the incentive they need.\nMartin Keown was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nOur coverage of the Gunners is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nEverything Arsenal - go straight to all the best content",

There was no intent from the Spaniard, but Salisbury wasted little time in brandishing the red card after being told to review the tackle on his monitor.\nUnused substitute Matheus Nunes was also shown a red card deep into second-half stoppage time after remonstrating with the officials in the aftermath of Rodrigo's late goal.\nAfter conceding four for the first time since October, Wolves' meeting with Nottingham Forest after the international break now takes on added importance.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Victory on Saturday means they are now 14 points ahead of them and they looked the superior side throughout.\nEven before going in front, Villa looked to have the measure of Bournemouth, with Buendia, flanked by Ramsey and Bailey, finding space between midfield and defence and looking to feed Watkins.\nAfter the goal, VIlla eased off and allowed Bournemouth back into it, but a couple of scares midway through the half shook them out of their slumber and by the break they were in the ascendancy once more.\nChances were more scarce early in the second period, but Villa always maintained control of the game as Luiz and John McGinn patrolled the middle of the park, and the hosts always looked the more likely to find the game's second goal.\nRamsey eventually provided it and Villa were able to express themselves for the final 10 minutes, creating chances at will as Watkins came close again and Mings spurned a glorious chance, shooting straight at Neto from seven yards out having been left all alone at the far post.\nWith 11 games to go and only four points separating sixth and 11th in the table, Villa have the chance to make it an exciting end to the season and push for an unlikely European spot.\nBlunt Bournemouth struggle again on road\nAfter the high of toppling Liverpool a week ago, it was back to reality for Bournemouth as they succumbed to a ninth defeat in 10 away games in all competitions.\nThe manner in which Villa were able to cut through them will be a concern for O'Neil and the Cherries have now kept only one clean sheet in 24 league away games.\nBournemouth's best spell came after the opening goal as they managed to get players close to Buendia and frustrate the Villa creator.\nHowever, Villa adjusted, Bournemouth did not and the Argentine was soon collecting the ball in vast areas of space again - and if it was not him, then it was Bailey, Ramsey or left-back Alex Moreno exposing the gaps.\nJust as concerning was the lack of threat at the other end. Against Liverpool and Arsenal, Bournemouth were always dangerous on the break.\nThey were again here but, with Villa also at their best on the counter, such chances were harder to come by, especially after going behind so early.\nTasked with trying to break down a set Villa backline, Bournemouth rarely troubled Emi Martinez in the home goal as they suffered another disappointing day on the road.\nVisit our Aston Villa page\nMore Bournemouth content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Tough but fair.\n\"It shows, he had played over 500 games in big leagues and never been sent off. Now it has happened twice.\"\nTen Hag complained about the lack of consistency in the use of VAR, noting the referee was not sent to the monitor to review controversial incidents in Saturday's game between Leicester and Chelsea.\nDespite having a man advantage for almost an hour and managing 17 shots, Southampton were unable to capitalise and remain bottom of the Premier League.\nEven before Casemiro's early exit, David de Gea needed to make a brilliant reaction save to turn away Theo Walcott's close-range header.\nDe Gea then produced a one-handed save after the break when Walcott ran clear of the home defence, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line when Scott McTominay turned a Kyle Walker-Peters cross towards his own goal. In addition, James Ward-Prowse's free-kick skimmed of the top of the bar and Walker-Peters also hit a post with an angled drive.\nUnited had some dangerous moments themselves, with captain Bruno Fernandes' goalbound effort tipped on to the inside of a post by Gavin Bazunu.\nThe result consolidated United's top-four position, whilst Southampton are effectively three points from safety given their goal difference, with 12 games of the campaign remaining.\nGo straight to all the best Manchester United content\nVisit our Southampton page\nSouthampton show improvement\nDespite their position in the table, Southampton's form is good.\nThey have now picked up seven points from four games since Nathan Jones was sacked on 12 February.\nIt represents their most productive run since August and Wednesday's rearranged game with Brentford does offer the opportunity for Ruben Selles' side to climb out of the relegation zone for the first time since the end of October.\nNevertheless, their goalscoring is a concern - in only one league match since August have they scored more than once. They had the chances to improve that statistic at Old Trafford but couldn't make them count.\nCasemiro's ill discipline\nCasemiro has been one of the key reasons behind United's improvement this season.\nBut the positivity around the Brazilian is in danger of being undermined by his disciplinary record.\nSent off against Crystal Palace last month for grabbing Will Hughes round the neck following a mass confrontation, his latest red card was also triggered by the intervention of VAR.\nCasemiro did play the top of the ball first but Taylor decided the tackle was dangerous.\nTen Hag said Casemiro was emotional in the dressing room afterwards.\n\"He is disappointed,\" Ten Hag said.\nUnless United manage a successful appeal, the four-match suspension would rule him out of next week's FA Cup quarter-final with Fulham, plus the three Premier League games that follow.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nThe Bees were back in front within 90 seconds as Bryan Mbeumo flicked the ball to Ivan Toney and the England striker lashed in his 17th league goal of the campaign.\nRoberto de Zerbi's Seagulls equalised on 28 minutes as Solly March lifted a cross to the back post where Danny Welbeck nodded in from close range.\nAfter an exciting but frenetic first 45 minutes, the second half began in much the same way as Brentford went in front for the third time when Pinnock arrived unmarked at the far post to stab in Mbeumo's free-kick.\nBrighton poured forward in search of a third equaliser with Lewis Dunk heading over their best opportunity before the goal finally came via the spot.\nThe home side felt they should have had another penalty in stoppage time when March's cross struck the arm of Hickey but this time the video assistant referee did not intervene and the teams were left to settle for a point apiece.\nFrustration for Brighton despite late equaliser\nBrighton had to be patient in the second half and, while they were eventually rewarded with a last-gasp equaliser, they will be frustrated not to have taken all three points.\nThey caused problems for the Brentford defence from the first whistle with Mitoma - either with the ball at his feet or running in behind - a constant threat.\nThe Japanese attacker scored his 10th goal of the season to draw Brighton level at 1-1, but his strike was sandwiched between two slack pieces of Seagulls defending.\nJansson was able to get free far too easily to head home Brentford's opener and losing one header midway inside their own half, from their own throw-in, was all it took for the Bees to open them up for the second.\nBrighton drew level again before the break, but De Zerbi must have warned his side to cut out the defensive lapses during his half-time team talk. However, less than four minutes into the second half, Pinnock was able to stroll in to finish without challenge from another Brentford set piece.\nPerhaps it goes to show how impressive Brighton have been this season that, even after a late leveller against another team battling to qualify for Europe, there will still be disappointment.\nGoing forward they remain as exciting as ever and a Champions League place is still within reach, but they will need to eradicate sloppy defending to achieve that dream.\nBrentford denied victory but European hopes still alive\nOn the balance of play, Brighton were well worth at least a point but having come so close to victory, Brentford will also feel disappointed.\nThe visitors had to ride their luck, especially in the first half, in the face of relentless waves of Brighton attack.\nBut while the hosts will rue their missed chances, Brentford were clinical in front of goal.\nThey were content to let the Seagulls have the bulk of possession but were quick to pounce on any loose touches or stray passes and spring into attack on the counter.\nIn the second half, they defended their lead well for long spells and even after conceding the equaliser, they looked as likely as Brighton to snatch a winner in injury time.\nA draw lifts the Bees up to seventh and with 10 games remaining they remain firmly in the fight to qualify for European football next season.\nGo to our Brighton & Hove Albion content\nVisit our Brentford page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They are so far away from where we have seen, they were hopeless today.\"\n'Lucky City weren't in a greedy mood'\nThis was Liverpool's ninth Premier League loss of 2022-23 and their eighth on the road, their most in a single season since 2014-15 and as many as they had lost away from Anfield in the past three campaigns combined.\nLast season they were fighting on all four fronts until the end, missing out on the league title to City by one point and losing the Champions League final to Real Madrid, but this campaign has been markedly different.\nKlopp said his side's poor performances have been happening \"too often\" this season and the display in Manchester epitomised their troubles.\n\"Conceding two quick goals broke everything down,\" Klopp told BBC Sport.\n\"The goals, how we conceded them, it's difficult to accept - we didn't put in a challenge for either. That's absolutely not acceptable to be honest.\n\"City were completely in control after that and we were open and they could do whatever they wanted. That they only scored one more goal is well, thank you. It could've been different and that's really bad news for us.\n\"We were lucky they weren't in a greedy mood. Apart from that, there is nothing good to say about this game.\"\nLiverpool are unable to win any silverware this term - and are now facing an uphill battle to finish in the top four, sitting seven points behind Tottenham with a game in hand.\n\"Liverpool seem to have lost that mojo, it is hard to say why,\" Ferdinand said on BT Sport.\n\"I would be fearful about the top four as a Liverpool fan. It is worrying times for Klopp and his team.\"\nFormer Reds forward Peter Crouch said on BT Sport: \"If you look at the top-four spots they are off it. It seems bizarre where they are. We saw a gulf between the two teams and it is not the first time.\n\"It is not just a one-off, it has been a disappointing season.\"\nFormer Wales defender Ashley Williams agreed with Crouch's assessment, saying on Final Score it was \"strange\" to see Liverpool struggle.\n\"It's not working like that well-oiled machine any more. They've got to do something big in this next week if they want to make that top four,\" he said.\nThe Reds face Chelsea on Tuesday in a crucial game for their top-four hopes, before hosting league leaders Arsenal on Sunday, 9 April.\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\n'One of the best performances in my seven years'\nEven without star man Erling Haaland, City were a class above Liverpool, particularly in the second half.\nGrealish was instrumental in City's attack and also made a crucial block at 1-0 as Salah raced through, with the winger saying he feels \"back to my normal self\" after a difficult first season with the Blues.\n\"I feel fit and back to confidence,\" he said. \"Scoring and getting the assist I'm buzzing. We were excellent today especially in the second half.\"\nCity boss Pep Guardiola agreed, saying this was the Grealish that City \"thought could help us\", but adding that all his players were \"exceptional\" in the victory.\n\"From minute one to minute 93 was a perfect performance,\" Guardiola told BT Sport.\n\"Even though we conceded a goal we played really well. One of the best performances in my seven years.\"\nShearer told Match of the Day: \"There were so many impressive performances but the best player on the park was Jack Grealish. He is playing with such confidence and a belief in his own ability.\n\"Liverpool couldn't handle him at all. He was magnificent in everything he did. He gave Trent Alexander-Arnold a torrid time, Trent didn't know what day it was. He couldn't cope with him. You are seeing a player happy with his game and is one of the most important players.\"\n'Do you think it's a lack of respect?'\nGuardiola denied he disrespected Liverpool after celebrating wildly in front of substitutes Kostas Tsimikas and Arthur Melo during the victory at the Etihad.\nThe home side were trailing to Salah's opener when a quick, sweeping move from right to left set up Alvarez to equalise from close range.\nIt prompted Guardiola to erupt with multiple double fist pumps in his technical area at exactly the moment Tsimikas was walking past, and the City boss back-pedalled to keep ahead of the left-back to continue his celebrations.\nHe then extended that to on-loan Juventus midfielder Arthur, shaking the player's hand and engaging the Brazilian in conversation.\nBT Sport pundit Ferdinand said he \"doesn't know how Tsimikas hasn't pushed... Guardiola out of the way\" but the City boss insists he meant no offence.\n\"I was happy and I said how nice our goal was. That's all,\" Guardiola said. When asked if it was an attempt at humour he replied: \"Of course. Come on.\"\nBut when it was suggested to Guardiola his actions could be construed as provocative, he added: \"Nah, come on. I'm so sorry.\n\"Speak with Tsimikas, speak with the others. Ask him if I lack respect. I celebrate the goal with my son on that floor (the tier above).\n\"And I said, 'The goal was nice, isn't it'. That's all. I'm so sorry. Do you think it's a lack of respect? Ah OK, sorry.

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Brentford's display? Send us your views here\nThe Bees were back in front within 90 seconds as Bryan Mbeumo flicked the ball to Ivan Toney and the England striker lashed in his 17th league goal of the campaign.\nRoberto de Zerbi's Seagulls equalised on 28 minutes as Solly March lifted a cross to the back post where Danny Welbeck nodded in from close range.\nAfter an exciting but frenetic first 45 minutes, the second half began in much the same way as Brentford went in front for the third time when Pinnock arrived unmarked at the far post to stab in Mbeumo's free-kick.\nBrighton poured forward in search of a third equaliser with Lewis Dunk heading over their best opportunity before the goal finally came via the spot.\nThe home side felt they should have had another penalty in stoppage time when March's cross struck the arm of Hickey but this time the video assistant referee did not intervene and the teams were left to settle for a point apiece.\nFrustration for Brighton despite late equaliser\nBrighton had to be patient in the second half and, while they were eventually rewarded with a last-gasp equaliser, they will be frustrated not to have taken all three points.\nThey caused problems for the Brentford defence from the first whistle with Mitoma - either with the ball at his feet or running in behind - a constant threat.\nThe Japanese attacker scored his 10th goal of the season to draw Brighton level at 1-1, but his strike was sandwiched between two slack pieces of Seagulls defending.\nJansson was able to get free far too easily to head home Brentford's opener and losing one header midway inside their own half, from their own throw-in, was all it took for the Bees to open them up for the second.\nBrighton drew level again before the break, but De Zerbi must have warned his side to cut out the defensive lapses during his half-time team talk. However, less than four minutes into the second half, Pinnock was able to stroll in to finish without challenge from another Brentford set piece.\nPerhaps it goes to show how impressive Brighton have been this season that, even after a late leveller against another team battling to qualify for Europe, there will still be disappointment.\nGoing forward they remain as exciting as ever and a Champions League place is still within reach, but they will need to eradicate sloppy defending to achieve that dream.\nBrentford denied victory but European hopes still alive\nOn the balance of play, Brighton were well worth at least a point but having come so close to victory, Brentford will also feel disappointed.\nThe visitors had to ride their luck, especially in the first half, in the face of relentless waves of Brighton attack.\nBut while the hosts will rue their missed chances, Brentford were clinical in front of goal.\nThey were content to let the Seagulls have the bulk of possession but were quick to pounce on any loose touches or stray passes and spring into attack on the counter.\nIn the second half, they defended their lead well for long spells and even after conceding the equaliser, they looked as likely as Brighton to snatch a winner in injury time.\nA draw lifts the Bees up to seventh and with 10 games remaining they remain firmly in the fight to qualify for European football next season.\nGo to our Brighton & Hove Albion content\nVisit our Brentford page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Ruben Selles, meanwhile, faces a difficult week, knowing six of the other eight teams in the relegation fight play at least once - and many twice - before his Southampton side play again.\nReaction from West Ham-Southampton, plus Sunday's Premier League latest\nVisit our West Ham page\nGo straight to all the best Southampton content\nSaints' struggles continue\nThe brutal truth is Southampton's record since Ralph Hasenhuttl's dismissal on 7 November is worse than it had been beforehand.\nHaving already dispensed with the Austrian's replacement, Nathan Jones, it would appear the Saints board have little option other than to stick with Selles, who has secured some eye-catching results without getting Southampton to a point where they could have genuine hopes of getting away from trouble.\nThey remain in the unenviable position of knowing that, realistically, they will remain in the bottom three even if they win their next game - which is against in-form Manchester City on 8 April (17:30 BST) - and they have played more matches than the six teams immediately above them.\nJames Ward-Prowse remains their talisman and he did provide the cross Onuachu headed against the bar but West Ham prevented the midfielder getting a sight of goal, either in free play or, crucially, from a set-piece.\nLavia might have caught Fabianski out with his low shot into a crowded penalty area but the veteran keeper, returning after a fractured cheekbone, readjusted his position and made the save.\nIn addition to facing City, Southampton have trips to Arsenal and Newcastle before the month is out, which, on this evidence, will not make any supporter feel optimistic about escaping from their present predicament.\nAguerd and Zouma combination key to Hammers win\nWhile it could be argued the table was distorted at kick-off given West Ham had at least one game in hand on all their relegation rivals and two on a couple, they have yet to mount a sustained revival and remain in peril of a unique double - a European trophy and relegation.\nReasons for the Hammers being in that position are not obvious. However, one is probably the inability to get Kurt Zouma and Aguerd in the same starting line-up with anything like the regularity that manager David Moyes would have wanted.\nAguerd was injured in pre-season and did not make his Premier League debut until November - as a replacement for Zouma, who had just got injured.\nIt meant this was only the third time they had been paired together in the top flight. West Ham have secured seven points from those games and kept two clean sheets.\nHere, the pair combined well and ensured Southampton could not exert pressure around the box.\nAguerd's first Hammers goal was the added extra.\nIn a crowded penalty area, the Moroccan was one of the few Hammers players onside as Kehrer floated his free-kick into the box.\nIt took video assistant referee Peter Bankes a long time to make absolutely sure but West Ham will not mind that now.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Send us your comments here\nWhat did you make of Tottenham's performance? Have your say here\nKane in the thick of the action\nFor the best part of an hour this was an insipid contest as both sides struggled to create any clear-cut opportunities in the final third.\nBut Kane was at the thick of the action when he challenged Demarai Gray on the halfway line, an incident to which Doucoure took exception.\nPushes were exchanged before the Everton midfielder put his hand into the face of Kane, who went tumbling to the turf and referee David Coote brandished a straight red.\nKane received lengthy treatment from the physio but the Everton bench were clearly unhappy at his reaction to the incident.\nThe England captain shrugged off the incident to open the scoring 10 minutes later from penalty spot, sending international team-mate Jordan Pickford the wrong way to register his 15th league goal against Everton.\nKane could have netted in the opening period but a spin and shot was blocked on the line by Keane, while he also sent a free header wide.\nSon Heung-min, roundly jeered throughout for inflicting a serious ankle injury on Andre Gomes here four years ago, had the best opportunity in the first half but shot straight at Pickford.\nThe result takes Tottenham into the Champions League places with nine games to play, but Stellini's side have now failed to win their last six games away from home.\nFormer Clarets proving critical\nThis was an important game for Everton after seeing fellow strugglers West Ham and Bournemouth win at the weekend and Nottingham Forest claim a point.\nGray curled narrowly over in the second minute and Doucoure sent a free header over as they pressed for an opener.\nIdrissa Gueye missed a glaring opportunity in the second half when he fired over from the edge of the area and he also had a strike superbly tipped over the crossbar by the returning Hugo Lloris.\nUltimately it took Keane's stunning goal to rescue something from the game, the draw pulling Everton level with West Ham, Bournemouth and Forest on 27 points in the congested bottom half of the table.\nWithout a recognised centre forward - Dominic Calvert-Lewin remains out injured - Dyche is now regularly lying on his former Burnley players for points, with Keane's strike coming after winning goals from fellow ex-Clarets James Tarkowski and Dwight McNeil in recent home victories.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

This was not one of them.\nIf those past meetings reflected their elevated status as two of the prime forces in the Premier League, Champions League, the FA Cup and League Cup, this drab affair encapsulated their current standings of eighth and 11th in the table.\nLiverpool hold managerless Chelsea in drab draw\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content\nVisit our Liverpool page\nIt is now seven hours and 45 minutes since the last goal between these two teams, taking in the League Cup and FA Cup finals last season that were both won on penalties by Liverpool. As they ran dry of ideas, inspiration and intensity at Stamford Bridge, you suspect it could have been at least another seven hours 45 minutes before any deadlock was broken here.\nIndeed, as this game descended into a morass of mediocrity after an entertaining opening phase, the placings of Liverpool in eighth and Chelsea three places below almost qualified as flattery.\nChelsea, as so often in the past, are in a period of instability following the sacking of manager Graham Potter, with coach Bruno Saltor in the dugout while owner Todd Boehly and his Clearlake group seek their third manager of the season.\nIt led to an odd atmosphere around Stamford Bridge. One that mixed the early enthusiasm that often accompanies the dismissal of an unpopular manager with the feeling that Chelsea's season is now in a holding pattern awaiting the new arrival and the upcoming Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.\nChelsea's immediate need, alongside the appointment of a new manager, is goals because for all the \u00a3600m lashed out by Boehly and co. since they succeeded Roman Abramovich, this appears to be the one commodity that is beyond the simple use of the chequebook.\nIt was a flaw that undermined Potter and it was ingloriously on show against Liverpool as Joao Felix showed great skill but a tendency to hold on to the ball too long, Kai Havertz could not find the finishing touch while Mateo Kovacic allowed Ibrahima Konate to sweep his first-half effort off the line before sending a second-half chance way over the top with just Alisson to beat.\nChelsea's season is at least still alive, although who is in the technical area and who will score the goals against Real Madrid remains to be seen.\nIt will be quite a task for Saltor to try to outwit the old master and one of Potter's long-ago predecessors Carlo Ancelotti, but Chelsea insist their process will be exhaustive as they pursue a manager of proven pedigree.\nAs for Liverpool, the top four is their only target after that relentless chase for a historic quadruple last season, which brought the FA Cup and League Cup but disappointment in the Premier League and Champions League.\nJurgen Klopp made six changes to freshen up his side after the heavy beating at Manchester City, with Virgil van Dijk ill and Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson on the bench.\nAnd while the result was an improvement, the overall Liverpool performance was deadly dull, lacking in intensity and threat apart from five minutes at the end of the first half.\nThe team that has flooded home and abroad with goals in recent years has scored just one in four games since that astonishing 7-0 demolition of Manchester United at Anfield - and that in a 4-1 defeat at Etihad Stadium.\nLiverpool hardly looked like getting one here and if anyone deserved to win the game it was Chelsea. They had the ball in the net in each half but Reece James' powerful first-half drive was ruled out by VAR for offside while Havertz suffered a similar fate with a second-half handball ruling.\nKlopp and Liverpool now face a serious fight to make that top-four place, surely the minimum requirement at the start of this season, one almost taken for granted given their past deeds and successes. They are seven points off the top four and in poor form.\nLiverpool will need to move their game on to another level fast to get anywhere near that group - starting with Sunday's game against league leaders Arsenal at Anfield.\nKlopp's verdict?\n\"I saw a couple of 0-0s against Chelsea over the last few years. The cup finals last season are two of the best games I've seen. Tonight was different.\"\nYou said it, Jurgen.

We have many more players across the squad who can score.\"\nOnly Napoli's Victor Osimhen has more league goals in Europe's top five leagues since the World Cup than Rashford, who has scored 10 winners in the Premier League this season, the most by a Manchester United player in a campaign since Wayne Rooney in 2009-10.\nHis latest took United back above Tottenham in the race to qualify for the Champions League, and was the response Ten Hag demanded following Sunday's defeat at Newcastle.\nBrentford, who are chasing European qualification, lost for only the second time in 17 Premier League matches.\nScott McTominay and Antony went close before Rashford finished from close range, with a headed assist by Marcel Sabitzer, after the Bees failed to deal properly with a corner.\nBrentford, flat for large parts of the first half, were much better after half-time and United were relieved to hear the final whistle.\nHome goalkeeper David de Gea needed treatment after making a crucial save to keep out substitute Kevin Schade.\nUnited are level on 53 points with third-placed Newcastle - and three ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham, who have played one more game than their rivals.\nBrentford stay ninth - three points behind sixth-placed Brighton, having played two more games than the Seagulls.\nReaction from Manchester United-Brentford\nFootball Daily podcast: Waltzing Wilson, Moyes misery & Lampard to Chelsea?\nGo straight to all the best Manchester United content\nVisit our Brentford page\nNervy Man Utd secure the points\nManchester United had a eight-point cushion on fifth spot after defeating Leicester on 19 February but Sunday's defeat - coupled with Tottenham's draw at Everton on Monday - left them outside the top four for the first time since December.\nManager Ten Hag recalled Jadon Sancho in an attempt to provide the team with more energy yet United were hanging on towards the end against a Brentford side that grew in confidence.\nSabitzer tested David Raya after half-time while Fred blazed another opportunity over the bar but United were forced to endure several nervous moments before full-time after failing to add to their tally.\nDe Gea's save from Schade was a huge moment in the game, the Spaniard keeping his composure to thwart the Brentford player who was clean through with only the keeper to beat.\nQuestions will remain about United's over-reliance on Rashford for goals but Ten Hag will hope United will build on their first Premier League win since winning the Carabao Cup.\n\"It's not acceptable what we did on Sunday,\" added Ten Hag. \"Today, that was the performance I expect and demand.\"\nSeason to remember for Bees\nBrentford have spent the past few months making a mockery of second-season syndrome.\nHaving finished 13th last season following promotion from the Championship, the Bees are just three points away from equalling last season's tally of 46 points - which secured them 13th spot - despite defeat at Old Trafford.\nThey followed up their 4-0 thrashing of United in London on 13 August with statement wins over Manchester City and Liverpool and they so nearly came close to snatching a point here only for De Gea to produce the save of the game.\nThomas Frank's side entertain in-form Newcastle - 5-1 winners at West Ham - next but it is a testimony to the efforts over the past eight months that they are still in with an outside chance of Europe at the business end of the season.\n\"It's a good picture of how far we have come that we're sitting here disappointed we've not got anything out of the game,\" said Frank.\n\"We're just disappointed that we didn't get anything of it.

The resulting corner was half-cleared and Allan Saint-Maximin's cross found Wilson unmarked 12 yards out to head in - and the lapses steadily got worse for the home defence.\nThe second saw a single Fabian Schar long ball beat the whole backline, with Zouma failing to track the run of Joelinton while Emerson did not step up with his fellow defenders to play the Brazilian offside.\nJoelinton rounded Fabianski to score and though the goal was initially flagged offside it was allowed following a VAR check.\nWest Ham briefly woke up and pulled one back when Nick Pope was caught under a Bowen corner, allowing Zouma to powerfully head in and give some hope to the home fans.\nBut seconds into the second half Aguerd dawdled on a rolled ball from Fabianski, allowing Jacob Murphy to steal the ball and square for a Wilson tap-in.\nThe defensive shambles coup de grace was saved for the fourth as the Polish keeper rushed out of his goal and miscontrolled a long ball, allowing Isak to lob into an empty net.\nBy the final whistle London Stadium was half-empty, with Moyes left looking nervously over his shoulder.\nChris Sutton's full predictions v A Town Called Malice star Jack Rowan\nNewcastle stay on top-four course\nWilson must love playing against West Ham - not only has he now scored 12 in his last 13 games against the Londoners, he continues to get one over on his podcast co-host.\nOn the Footballers' Football Podcast, Wilson promised Michail Antonio he would do the Macarena in celebration should he score - and he was as good as his word for the opener.\nNewcastle are often dancing after they face West Ham - this was their 11th away Premier League win over the Hammers, their joint-most against a single team in the division alongside Spurs.\nThis was a fourth straight league win for Howe's side - the second time this season they have gone on such a run - and one which puts them firmly in the Champions League qualification driving seat.\nThey did have to dig deep in the first half, Pope making a good save from a Lucas Paqueta free-kick shortly before a superb last-ditch tackle by Sven Botman denied Antonio.\nBut West Ham's farcical defending made the second 45 minutes much more comfortable for Newcastle, rounded off by Joelinton sprinting clear of the defence and firing low into the bottom corner past Fabianski.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Ruben Selles, meanwhile, faces a difficult week, knowing six of the other eight teams in the relegation fight play at least once - and many twice - before his Southampton side play again.\nReaction from West Ham-Southampton, plus Sunday's Premier League latest\nVisit our West Ham page\nGo straight to all the best Southampton content\nSaints' struggles continue\nThe brutal truth is Southampton's record since Ralph Hasenhuttl's dismissal on 7 November is worse than it had been beforehand.\nHaving already dispensed with the Austrian's replacement, Nathan Jones, it would appear the Saints board have little option other than to stick with Selles, who has secured some eye-catching results without getting Southampton to a point where they could have genuine hopes of getting away from trouble.\nThey remain in the unenviable position of knowing that, realistically, they will remain in the bottom three even if they win their next game - which is against in-form Manchester City on 8 April (17:30 BST) - and they have played more matches than the six teams immediately above them.\nJames Ward-Prowse remains their talisman and he did provide the cross Onuachu headed against the bar but West Ham prevented the midfielder getting a sight of goal, either in free play or, crucially, from a set-piece.\nLavia might have caught Fabianski out with his low shot into a crowded penalty area but the veteran keeper, returning after a fractured cheekbone, readjusted his position and made the save.\nIn addition to facing City, Southampton have trips to Arsenal and Newcastle before the month is out, which, on this evidence, will not make any supporter feel optimistic about escaping from their present predicament.\nAguerd and Zouma combination key to Hammers win\nWhile it could be argued the table was distorted at kick-off given West Ham had at least one game in hand on all their relegation rivals and two on a couple, they have yet to mount a sustained revival and remain in peril of a unique double - a European trophy and relegation.\nReasons for the Hammers being in that position are not obvious. However, one is probably the inability to get Kurt Zouma and Aguerd in the same starting line-up with anything like the regularity that manager David Moyes would have wanted.\nAguerd was injured in pre-season and did not make his Premier League debut until November - as a replacement for Zouma, who had just got injured.\nIt meant this was only the third time they had been paired together in the top flight. West Ham have secured seven points from those games and kept two clean sheets.\nHere, the pair combined well and ensured Southampton could not exert pressure around the box.\nAguerd's first Hammers goal was the added extra.\nIn a crowded penalty area, the Moroccan was one of the few Hammers players onside as Kehrer floated his free-kick into the box.\nIt took video assistant referee Peter Bankes a long time to make absolutely sure but West Ham will not mind that now.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They are so far away from where we have seen, they were hopeless today.\"\n'Lucky City weren't in a greedy mood'\nThis was Liverpool's ninth Premier League loss of 2022-23 and their eighth on the road, their most in a single season since 2014-15 and as many as they had lost away from Anfield in the past three campaigns combined.\nLast season they were fighting on all four fronts until the end, missing out on the league title to City by one point and losing the Champions League final to Real Madrid, but this campaign has been markedly different.\nKlopp said his side's poor performances have been happening \"too often\" this season and the display in Manchester epitomised their troubles.\n\"Conceding two quick goals broke everything down,\" Klopp told BBC Sport.\n\"The goals, how we conceded them, it's difficult to accept - we didn't put in a challenge for either. That's absolutely not acceptable to be honest.\n\"City were completely in control after that and we were open and they could do whatever they wanted. That they only scored one more goal is well, thank you. It could've been different and that's really bad news for us.\n\"We were lucky they weren't in a greedy mood. Apart from that, there is nothing good to say about this game.\"\nLiverpool are unable to win any silverware this term - and are now facing an uphill battle to finish in the top four, sitting seven points behind Tottenham with a game in hand.\n\"Liverpool seem to have lost that mojo, it is hard to say why,\" Ferdinand said on BT Sport.\n\"I would be fearful about the top four as a Liverpool fan. It is worrying times for Klopp and his team.\"\nFormer Reds forward Peter Crouch said on BT Sport: \"If you look at the top-four spots they are off it. It seems bizarre where they are. We saw a gulf between the two teams and it is not the first time.\n\"It is not just a one-off, it has been a disappointing season.\"\nFormer Wales defender Ashley Williams agreed with Crouch's assessment, saying on Final Score it was \"strange\" to see Liverpool struggle.\n\"It's not working like that well-oiled machine any more. They've got to do something big in this next week if they want to make that top four,\" he said.\nThe Reds face Chelsea on Tuesday in a crucial game for their top-four hopes, before hosting league leaders Arsenal on Sunday, 9 April.\nGo straight to all the best Liverpool content\n'One of the best performances in my seven years'\nEven without star man Erling Haaland, City were a class above Liverpool, particularly in the second half.\nGrealish was instrumental in City's attack and also made a crucial block at 1-0 as Salah raced through, with the winger saying he feels \"back to my normal self\" after a difficult first season with the Blues.\n\"I feel fit and back to confidence,\" he said. \"Scoring and getting the assist I'm buzzing. We were excellent today especially in the second half.\"\nCity boss Pep Guardiola agreed, saying this was the Grealish that City \"thought could help us\", but adding that all his players were \"exceptional\" in the victory.\n\"From minute one to minute 93 was a perfect performance,\" Guardiola told BT Sport.\n\"Even though we conceded a goal we played really well. One of the best performances in my seven years.\"\nShearer told Match of the Day: \"There were so many impressive performances but the best player on the park was Jack Grealish. He is playing with such confidence and a belief in his own ability.\n\"Liverpool couldn't handle him at all. He was magnificent in everything he did. He gave Trent Alexander-Arnold a torrid time, Trent didn't know what day it was. He couldn't cope with him. You are seeing a player happy with his game and is one of the most important players.\"\n'Do you think it's a lack of respect?'\nGuardiola denied he disrespected Liverpool after celebrating wildly in front of substitutes Kostas Tsimikas and Arthur Melo during the victory at the Etihad.\nThe home side were trailing to Salah's opener when a quick, sweeping move from right to left set up Alvarez to equalise from close range.\nIt prompted Guardiola to erupt with multiple double fist pumps in his technical area at exactly the moment Tsimikas was walking past, and the City boss back-pedalled to keep ahead of the left-back to continue his celebrations.\nHe then extended that to on-loan Juventus midfielder Arthur, shaking the player's hand and engaging the Brazilian in conversation.\nBT Sport pundit Ferdinand said he \"doesn't know how Tsimikas hasn't pushed... Guardiola out of the way\" but the City boss insists he meant no offence.\n\"I was happy and I said how nice our goal was. That's all,\" Guardiola said. When asked if it was an attempt at humour he replied: \"Of course. Come on.\"\nBut when it was suggested to Guardiola his actions could be construed as provocative, he added: \"Nah, come on. I'm so sorry.\n\"Speak with Tsimikas, speak with the others. Ask him if I lack respect. I celebrate the goal with my son on that floor (the tier above).\n\"And I said, 'The goal was nice, isn't it'. That's all. I'm so sorry. Do you think it's a lack of respect? Ah OK, sorry.

This was not one of them.\nIf those past meetings reflected their elevated status as two of the prime forces in the Premier League, Champions League, the FA Cup and League Cup, this drab affair encapsulated their current standings of eighth and 11th in the table.\nLiverpool hold managerless Chelsea in drab draw\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content\nVisit our Liverpool page\nIt is now seven hours and 45 minutes since the last goal between these two teams, taking in the League Cup and FA Cup finals last season that were both won on penalties by Liverpool. As they ran dry of ideas, inspiration and intensity at Stamford Bridge, you suspect it could have been at least another seven hours 45 minutes before any deadlock was broken here.\nIndeed, as this game descended into a morass of mediocrity after an entertaining opening phase, the placings of Liverpool in eighth and Chelsea three places below almost qualified as flattery.\nChelsea, as so often in the past, are in a period of instability following the sacking of manager Graham Potter, with coach Bruno Saltor in the dugout while owner Todd Boehly and his Clearlake group seek their third manager of the season.\nIt led to an odd atmosphere around Stamford Bridge. One that mixed the early enthusiasm that often accompanies the dismissal of an unpopular manager with the feeling that Chelsea's season is now in a holding pattern awaiting the new arrival and the upcoming Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.\nChelsea's immediate need, alongside the appointment of a new manager, is goals because for all the \u00a3600m lashed out by Boehly and co. since they succeeded Roman Abramovich, this appears to be the one commodity that is beyond the simple use of the chequebook.\nIt was a flaw that undermined Potter and it was ingloriously on show against Liverpool as Joao Felix showed great skill but a tendency to hold on to the ball too long, Kai Havertz could not find the finishing touch while Mateo Kovacic allowed Ibrahima Konate to sweep his first-half effort off the line before sending a second-half chance way over the top with just Alisson to beat.\nChelsea's season is at least still alive, although who is in the technical area and who will score the goals against Real Madrid remains to be seen.\nIt will be quite a task for Saltor to try to outwit the old master and one of Potter's long-ago predecessors Carlo Ancelotti, but Chelsea insist their process will be exhaustive as they pursue a manager of proven pedigree.\nAs for Liverpool, the top four is their only target after that relentless chase for a historic quadruple last season, which brought the FA Cup and League Cup but disappointment in the Premier League and Champions League.\nJurgen Klopp made six changes to freshen up his side after the heavy beating at Manchester City, with Virgil van Dijk ill and Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson on the bench.\nAnd while the result was an improvement, the overall Liverpool performance was deadly dull, lacking in intensity and threat apart from five minutes at the end of the first half.\nThe team that has flooded home and abroad with goals in recent years has scored just one in four games since that astonishing 7-0 demolition of Manchester United at Anfield - and that in a 4-1 defeat at Etihad Stadium.\nLiverpool hardly looked like getting one here and if anyone deserved to win the game it was Chelsea. They had the ball in the net in each half but Reece James' powerful first-half drive was ruled out by VAR for offside while Havertz suffered a similar fate with a second-half handball ruling.\nKlopp and Liverpool now face a serious fight to make that top-four place, surely the minimum requirement at the start of this season, one almost taken for granted given their past deeds and successes. They are seven points off the top four and in poor form.\nLiverpool will need to move their game on to another level fast to get anywhere near that group - starting with Sunday's game against league leaders Arsenal at Anfield.\nKlopp's verdict?\n\"I saw a couple of 0-0s against Chelsea over the last few years. The cup finals last season are two of the best games I've seen. Tonight was different.\"\nYou said it, Jurgen.

With his back to Bazunu, the prolific 22-year-old guided the ball back across goal with his outstretched left leg to make it a remarkable 44 goals in 38 games in all competitions since joining last summer.\nGrealish, now oozing confidence, has also hit his best form in a City shirt at a timely moment with the England international directly involved in 10 goals in 15 league games since the World Cup break.\nCity have typically finished their campaigns in scintillating form to win four of the past five Premier League titles and, once again, they appear to be hitting top gear as they attempt to chase down Arsenal.\nThey extended their best winning run in the league this season to five matches, with the latest ensuring Guardiola's side go into the home first leg of their Champions League quarter-final against German champions Bayern Munich on Tuesday full of confidence.\nStruggling Saints in serious danger\nIn contrast to City's run, Southampton are now five games without victory, with this loss following defeat in a key relegation clash at West Ham.\nUnable to produce another shock against City, their situation is beginning to look dire with eight games remaining.\nSelles, the club's third manager this season, has been unable to build on a promising start to his tenure which brought two wins in his first three league games after replacing the sacked Nathan Jones.\nIf they are to survive, statistics suggest it will fall to captain and top scorer James Ward-Prowse to inspire a revival. However, club-record signing Kamaldeen Sulemana hinted against City he may have a part to play.\nAmid a dominant start by the visitors, which had seen Bazunu produce a fine save to deny Grealish inside five minutes, the lively Sulemana displayed his pace on the counter-attack but failed to test Ederson following a poor touch under pressure from Nathan Ake.\nMara's consolation arrived too late to inspire a meaningful fightback, with Saints equalling their record of 19 defeats in one Premier League season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

But apart from that, it was a combination of good positioning, agility and alertness that denied the hosts.\nAny criticism of his failure to keep out United's opener was picky in the extreme. The home side smoothly moved the ball across the field from their left and once the Everton defence failed to clear as the ball bobbled around Rashford on the edge of the area, they were on the back foot as Jadon Sancho fed a superb pass to McTominay, who finished first time from close range.\nAnd there was little Pickford could do to prevent United's second either as Rashford squared to an unmarked Martial, who, within 10 minutes of his introduction, had scored more Premier League goals in this game than Wout Weghorst has managed in his entire loan spell at United, emphasising why Ten Hag is so keen to have the Frenchman fit.\nUnfortunate miss for much-improved Wan-Bissaka\nIt is unfortunate for Wan-Bissaka that his performance will be remembered for his terrible miss because much of what he did was excellent.\nThe 25-year-old has not found it easy since his \u00a350m move from Crystal Palace in 2019, nor has it been forgotten United said they assessed the relative merits of 804 right-backs before identifying the Londoner as their preferred choice.\nAs recently as the World Cup break, it had appeared Wan-Bissaka had a limited future at Old Trafford and the likelihood is the club would have sold him for the right offer.\nBut from the restart Wan-Bissaka has looked like a different player.\nThe mere fact he was in the penalty area to miss his chance suggested an attacking responsibility he has not routinely been given.\nThe fact he has never scored a professional goal in front of supporters may go some way to explaining his failure in front of a packed and expectant Stretford End.\nWhile not entirely comfortable in possession at times, he does seem more comfortable in taking the ball and rotating it and he is being trusted with the right-back, midfield pivot combination Pep Guardiola has decided Kyle Walker is unable to carry out at Manchester City.\nFollow live text coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nVisit our Manchester United page\nGo straight to all the best Everton content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Maddison looked to make amends for his error but a fierce drive was tipped over by Neto.\nThe seismic triumph for the Cherries moved them up to 15th place and three points clear of the drop zone, while Leicester remain firmly in trouble, one place above the bottom and two points from safety.\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRare away triumph for Cherries\nBoth of these sides started the day in the bottom three and a relegation 'six pointer' went deservedly the way of Gary O'Neil's men.\nThe south coast side were sharper to the ball and peppered Iversen's goal and although they only scored one, they came away with all three crucial points.\nBournemouth's form on the road has been rotten, losing eight of their last nine on their travels before this game, but victory saw them keep just their second clean sheet in 25 away games.\nThey were given a gift for the only goal of the game, when Maddison's blind pass got nowhere near Iversen, allowing Billing to intercept and score his seventh league goal of the season.\nThe reliance on the Dane is evident, as either he or Solanke have scored or provided the assist for 11 of Bournemouth's last 13 goals away from home.\nThe visiting supporters in their corner of the King Power serenaded the players with chants of 'The reds are staying up' at full-time, and they have given themselves real hope of doing just that.\nWretched Leicester jeered off\nThis was a dismal showing from Leicester, who are bang in bother at the wrong end of the division and staring at relegation back to the Championship.\nThat would have been unthinkable when they shocked the footballing world by winning the Premier League title seven years ago, but they now have a monumental task to preserve their top-flight status.\nThey sacked manager Brendan Rodgers last Sunday but have lost both games under interim Sadler, and suffered a fourth consecutive home defeat as supporters loudly jeered the side at both half-time and the final whistle.\nLeicester's miserable run has seen them collect just eight points since Christmas, the worst total in the league, and a leaky defence has now gone 15 matches without a clean sheet.\nMaddison's mistake proved fatal on this occasion and he was unable to conjure any magic to salvage anything from the game, while substitute Kelechi Iheanacho stabbed a shot from six yards out straight at Neto.\nReports suggest former Leeds manager Jesse Marsch will be appointed soon, but on this evidence the American will have an enormous task on his hands to save the side if he does come in.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

With his back to Bazunu, the prolific 22-year-old guided the ball back across goal with his outstretched left leg to make it a remarkable 44 goals in 38 games in all competitions since joining last summer.\nGrealish, now oozing confidence, has also hit his best form in a City shirt at a timely moment with the England international directly involved in 10 goals in 15 league games since the World Cup break.\nCity have typically finished their campaigns in scintillating form to win four of the past five Premier League titles and, once again, they appear to be hitting top gear as they attempt to chase down Arsenal.\nThey extended their best winning run in the league this season to five matches, with the latest ensuring Guardiola's side go into the home first leg of their Champions League quarter-final against German champions Bayern Munich on Tuesday full of confidence.\nStruggling Saints in serious danger\nIn contrast to City's run, Southampton are now five games without victory, with this loss following defeat in a key relegation clash at West Ham.\nUnable to produce another shock against City, their situation is beginning to look dire with eight games remaining.\nSelles, the club's third manager this season, has been unable to build on a promising start to his tenure which brought two wins in his first three league games after replacing the sacked Nathan Jones.\nIf they are to survive, statistics suggest it will fall to captain and top scorer James Ward-Prowse to inspire a revival. However, club-record signing Kamaldeen Sulemana hinted against City he may have a part to play.\nAmid a dominant start by the visitors, which had seen Bazunu produce a fine save to deny Grealish inside five minutes, the lively Sulemana displayed his pace on the counter-attack but failed to test Ederson following a poor touch under pressure from Nathan Ake.\nMara's consolation arrived too late to inspire a meaningful fightback, with Saints equalling their record of 19 defeats in one Premier League season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Maddison looked to make amends for his error but a fierce drive was tipped over by Neto.\nThe seismic triumph for the Cherries moved them up to 15th place and three points clear of the drop zone, while Leicester remain firmly in trouble, one place above the bottom and two points from safety.\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRare away triumph for Cherries\nBoth of these sides started the day in the bottom three and a relegation 'six pointer' went deservedly the way of Gary O'Neil's men.\nThe south coast side were sharper to the ball and peppered Iversen's goal and although they only scored one, they came away with all three crucial points.\nBournemouth's form on the road has been rotten, losing eight of their last nine on their travels before this game, but victory saw them keep just their second clean sheet in 25 away games.\nThey were given a gift for the only goal of the game, when Maddison's blind pass got nowhere near Iversen, allowing Billing to intercept and score his seventh league goal of the season.\nThe reliance on the Dane is evident, as either he or Solanke have scored or provided the assist for 11 of Bournemouth's last 13 goals away from home.\nThe visiting supporters in their corner of the King Power serenaded the players with chants of 'The reds are staying up' at full-time, and they have given themselves real hope of doing just that.\nWretched Leicester jeered off\nThis was a dismal showing from Leicester, who are bang in bother at the wrong end of the division and staring at relegation back to the Championship.\nThat would have been unthinkable when they shocked the footballing world by winning the Premier League title seven years ago, but they now have a monumental task to preserve their top-flight status.\nThey sacked manager Brendan Rodgers last Sunday but have lost both games under interim Sadler, and suffered a fourth consecutive home defeat as supporters loudly jeered the side at both half-time and the final whistle.\nLeicester's miserable run has seen them collect just eight points since Christmas, the worst total in the league, and a leaky defence has now gone 15 matches without a clean sheet.\nMaddison's mistake proved fatal on this occasion and he was unable to conjure any magic to salvage anything from the game, while substitute Kelechi Iheanacho stabbed a shot from six yards out straight at Neto.\nReports suggest former Leeds manager Jesse Marsch will be appointed soon, but on this evidence the American will have an enormous task on his hands to save the side if he does come in.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Forest's display? Send us your views here\nVilla's fortunes continue to improve\nEmery has masterminded a complete turnaround of Villa's fortunes since taking the reins in October.\nThey had won just two of their opening 11 matches before the Spaniard's arrival but are now firmly in the mix at the top end of the table.\nThey struggled to cause any real issues in the scrappy first half, Alex Moreno's frequent forays down the wing one of their few bright attacking sparks.\nTheir confidence was much-improved after Traore's goal, though, and their performance finally sprung into life.\nEmi Buendia came inches away from extending the hosts' advantage after Moreno charged past the defence but the Argentine sliced just wide of the near post.\nWatkins' goal added to his own fine run of form, netting his ninth in 11 games.\nEmery told BBC Sport: \"Ollie is working very well and his commitment with the team is very important.\n\"When he's scoring we're very happy for him. He's helping with his quality. Everybody is supporting him, trying to assist him, like today how Jacob Ramsey decided to assist him.\n\"Ollie is scoring and for him, [it's] very good.\"\nVilla have already surpassed last season's points tally and Emery will be hoping his side can maintain the pressure on the league's top sides throughout the run-in.\nGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content\nForest drop into relegation zone\nForest are in freefall, with Steve Cooper's side now without a win in nine Premier League matches.\nSome confidence will have been generated by the fact they shut out high-flying Villa in the first half, but they could not keep up the pace for the full 90 minutes.\nThey showed some moments of life, Brennan Johnson's footwork on the right in particular causing problems for the hosts, while Shelvey provided some promising deliveries.\nBut they only managed two shots on target as they fell to a potentially damaging defeat for their manager.\nForest owner Evangelos Marinakis backed Cooper's position as manager earlier this week but said that \"results and performances must improve immediately\".\nSuch improvements were nowhere to be seen at Villa Park, and their dire form means the pressure will continue to mount on the Forest boss.\nForest fans chanted Cooper's name in support of the manager as the teams came out for the game.\n\"That's the bit that hurts the most, that we and I are desperate to do well for the supporters and the club,\" he told BBC Sport after the game.\n\"It makes these moments and these mistakes and these goals even more costly and even more hurtful.\n\"I repeat what I've said, we can blame nobody but ourselves because of the mistakes we made.\"\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

But apart from that, it was a combination of good positioning, agility and alertness that denied the hosts.\nAny criticism of his failure to keep out United's opener was picky in the extreme. The home side smoothly moved the ball across the field from their left and once the Everton defence failed to clear as the ball bobbled around Rashford on the edge of the area, they were on the back foot as Jadon Sancho fed a superb pass to McTominay, who finished first time from close range.\nAnd there was little Pickford could do to prevent United's second either as Rashford squared to an unmarked Martial, who, within 10 minutes of his introduction, had scored more Premier League goals in this game than Wout Weghorst has managed in his entire loan spell at United, emphasising why Ten Hag is so keen to have the Frenchman fit.\nUnfortunate miss for much-improved Wan-Bissaka\nIt is unfortunate for Wan-Bissaka that his performance will be remembered for his terrible miss because much of what he did was excellent.\nThe 25-year-old has not found it easy since his \u00a350m move from Crystal Palace in 2019, nor has it been forgotten United said they assessed the relative merits of 804 right-backs before identifying the Londoner as their preferred choice.\nAs recently as the World Cup break, it had appeared Wan-Bissaka had a limited future at Old Trafford and the likelihood is the club would have sold him for the right offer.\nBut from the restart Wan-Bissaka has looked like a different player.\nThe mere fact he was in the penalty area to miss his chance suggested an attacking responsibility he has not routinely been given.\nThe fact he has never scored a professional goal in front of supporters may go some way to explaining his failure in front of a packed and expectant Stretford End.\nWhile not entirely comfortable in possession at times, he does seem more comfortable in taking the ball and rotating it and he is being trusted with the right-back, midfield pivot combination Pep Guardiola has decided Kyle Walker is unable to carry out at Manchester City.\nFollow live text coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nVisit our Manchester United page\nGo straight to all the best Everton content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

They are wobbling in their bid to become English champions for the 14th time and the first since Arsene Wenger's 'Invincibles' went a league season without losing in 2003-04.\nFor the opening half-hour Arsenal's football was a joy to watch as they overpowered West Ham and looked to have wrapped up the three points with relative ease, with Jesus scoring his fourth goal in three matches before Odegaard added a second three minutes later.\nThomas Partey then sloppily lost possession to Declan Rice and that led to the penalty which gave West Ham hope and changed the course of the match.\nHowever, even after Bowen's equaliser, Arsenal still had opportunities to get a winning goal.\nJesus narrowly missed getting a touch on Kieran Tierney's cross before two chances in the last three minutes, but Saka headed wide before Rob Holding's header was saved by ex-Gunner Lukasz Fabianski.\nSlow starters West Ham show great character\nThis was West Ham's fifth match of nine in a congested April schedule and manager David Moyes made eight changes to the side that began Thursday's 1-1 draw at Gent in the first leg of their Europa Conference League quarter-final.\nFor Moyes it remains a tough task trying to balance their primary target of staying in the top flight but also progressing in European competition.\nBut the Scot, who appointed Arteta as his captain when the pair were together at Everton, will have been furious at yet another poor start in a home league match.\nIn their most recent game at London Stadium they fell 2-0 behind inside 13 minutes on their way to their heaviest defeat of the season, a 5-1 thrashing by Newcastle.\nThe home fans would have been fearing another heavy loss, but West Ham showed great character after conceding twice so early on.\nBenrahma's penalty changed the mood at the stadium, with Antonio then having a header pushed over by Aaron Ramsdale and Paqueta firing over the bar as West Ham enjoyed their best spell at the end of the first half.\nSaka's missed penalty lifted the atmosphere further, before Bowen's excellently taken volley gave West Ham fans hopes of a victory that looked impossible after 10 minutes.\nThis is West Ham's 11th successive season in the top flight. They have eight matches to save themselves and, despite this excellent point, remain in relegation trouble.\nAntonio's 81st-minute header nearly snatched an incredible victory in a thrilling London derby, but bounced off the crossbar.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here\nWhat did you think of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nClinical Eze seals victory\nJust like in their 5-1 win over Leeds last weekend, Crystal Palace were off the pace in the first half.\nCheick Doucoure fired over the bar after two minutes, but the away side did not have a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nHowever, the Eagles held firm defensively and went on to produce a clinical display in the second half.\nEze has now scored seven Premier League goals this season, more than any other Crystal Palace player.\n\"He had a very good second half,\" added Hodgson. \"Once we managed to find him in those positions where we found him against Leeds, he dealt with the ball very well when it came in, he was turning his opponent and had the pace and the strength to get away.\"\nPalace remain 12th, and their fears of relegation are fading after another impressive performance on the road.\nSpirited display not enough for Southampton\nSouthampton's chances of beating the drop have been dealt a blow by a second consecutive home defeat.\nThe Saints were the better team in the first half, creating numerous openings while they were in the ascendancy. Sulemana headed over from close range, as well as having a tame effort following a clever one-two with Theo Walcott.\nJoe Aribo, making his first Premier League start since New Year's Eve, missed a glorious chance when he blasted over the bar despite being unmarked in the box.\nThe home crowd also saw Walcott shoot just over the bar as Southampton's lack of clinical finishing was laid bare.\nEven after falling behind, Ruben Selles' side were left to rue missed opportunities.\nCarlos Alcaraz was left frustrated after squandering two chances in two minutes. First, he was inches away when he shot from the edge of the box and it hit the inside of the post. Another chance came when Palace failed to deal with a cross and Alcaraz pounced, only to volley it over the bar from close range.\n\"It is hurting already,\" said interim Saints boss Selles. \"We came here with the best of intentions to put in a good performance. I think we showed our personality in parts of the game, the way that we want to play and we did not get what we want, so it is hard.\n\"Seven games to go and it is starting to be more difficult for us.\n\"We competed in a lot of parts in the game and not getting any points today puts us in a difficult situation - nothing too different from before, but just less games to play.\"\nSouthampton have now gone six games without victory, and have suffered 10 home defeats in the Premier League this season, equalling their most losses on home soil in a single campaign.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Fulham's display? Send us your views here\n\"The mentality has been really good and there has been a shift since I've been here,\" Dyche told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We don't want it to revert back to that feeling from before we got here, and there was a sign of that today - people dipping too quickly. We want that bravery to take games on.\n\"I reminded the players that no one gives you anything, don't think they will because they won't.\n\"We should react to that a lot better and we have done generally. But these are important times so we've got to make sure we correct that very quickly.\"\nFulham could have scored more before Everton belatedly - and briefly - stirred again and attempted to rally late on.\nHowever, Marco Silva's side held on comfortably and the result leaves Everton in 17th, above the drop zone only on goal difference.\nNo home comforts for Everton\nSince Dyche's appointment, it is Everton's home form that has given them hope in their battle against relegation with wins over Arsenal, Leeds and Brentford as well as a last-gasp draw against Tottenham.\nThose points may be vital come the end of the season, but aside from 15 minutes either side of half-time, there was little of the fight or intensity that led to those results as they succumbed to a Fulham side sat comfortably in midtable and in the midst of their worst run of the season.\nNeither side offered much in a scrappy beginning but it was Fulham who provided the greater threat in the lead up to their opening goal.\nThe Blues took the knock well and should have been level through Neal Maupay, making a rare start, but the striker's close-range header was kept out by Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno - albeit replays showed it may have been offside in any case.\nThe equaliser did come three minutes later, McNeil collecting James Garner's pass, slipping past Reed and arrowing the shot into the bottom corner to rouse a sunbathed Goodison Park.\nIn the 10 minutes before the break, it was all Everton and Maupay had the chance to put them in front after a one-two with McNeil, only to be thwarted by Leno again.\nA bright start to the second half, in which McNeil's mishit cross hit the outside of the post, kept the home crowd's decibel level up but the energy of both fans and home players evaporated after Wilson's goal.\n\"We've had some tough knocks and come back against Chelsea and Tottenham but they're different games and a different feel in the stadium,\" Dyche said.\n\"These are the clinchers, these are the ones where we've got to change the mentality.\n\"We've been working hard - and the players have been delivering - to change that cycle. We stepped away from that today so we need to get a grip of that this week and go down to Crystal Palace with the right frame of mind.\"\nHaving fought back once, Everton seemed to lack the belief that they could do so again. James got Fulham's third and even with more than 20 minutes to go, both sides seemed sure the game was over as a contest.\nWith seven games to go, Dyche's side cannot afford to repeat the sort of listless performance they delivered for much of this game - and certainly not at home.\nFulham break losing streak\nAfter such a positive season, it had been a tough few weeks for Fulham with five defeats on the bounce, including a very public implosion at Manchester United that left them without top-scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic for eight matches.\nThat run may have seen them slip out of contention for European qualification but it is hard to think that there is anyone associated with the west London club who would not have been thrilled with the prospect of sitting pretty in 10th at this stage of the campaign.\nNevertheless, losing can be a tough habit to break and in ending their winless streak, Fulham took a big step towards ensuring such an encouraging season does not end with a whimper.\nCottagers manager Silva was sat in the stands as he completed his touchline ban to see his current side outplay his former team for long spells.\n\"Many, many positives to take from the game. We were clearly the best team on the pitch,\" Silva told Match of the Day.\n\"We came from a bad run and, of course, we had to show the personality and character to turn things again.\n\"We changed some things, played with a different profile of striker and Daniel James played a very good game. The players deserve all the credit for the win.\n\"We have to be really proud of our season so far. Bad spells can happen for a club like us in the Premier League but, of course, we don't want it but it's part of the process and we have to keep working really hard.\n\"We have 42 points, by the end of February we had 39, it's a big achievement for this football club and we have to keep going.\"\nReed buzzed around relentlessly in midfield alongside Joao Palhinha while further forward Willian, seemingly always in space, threatened throughout, James was a constant nuisance to the Everton defence and, buoyed by his goal, Wilson's quality was clear as Fulham overwhelmed their hosts at times in the second half.\nIn this most enjoyable of seasons for Fulham, this was an afternoon to savour in the Merseyside sunshine.\nGo straight to all the best Everton content\nVisit our Fulham page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We have to play with the right mentality and be stable in the bad moments that we will have - and go for it.\"\nThen on 26 April comes the huge clash against Arsenal, which could potentially be a title-decider at Etihad Stadium, with the visitors aiming to end their long top-flight trophy wait and stop their opponents from claiming three in a row.\nLeading City's charge is irrepressible frontman Haaland, who continues to wreak havoc with his goalscoring, taking his tally to 47 in 40 games in all competitions.\nHis spot-kick and cheeky finish from Kevin de Bruyne's pass extended his total to 32 in the top flight, drawing alongside Mohamed Salah's record in a 38-game season with eight games still to play.\nThe former Borussia Dortmund striker's goals put his side 3-0 up after they were set on their way by Stones' fabulous first-time finish from the edge of the box.\nWith the points all-but secure, both players were withdrawn at half-time and the team could not find more goals as Leicester dug in.\nFoxes slump to another loss\nThis was attack against defence, and was not the start former Aston Villa boss Smith would have wished for, having taken charge of Leicester until the end of the campaign.\nA dreadful season shows few signs of improvement, with the Foxes having collected one point from their last nine games. They have earned just eight points since Christmas, the fewest by a top-flight side during that period.\nHome goalkeeper Ederson was a virtual bystander for the entire contest, but made a sharp stop to deny James Maddison after substitute Iheanacho had stabbed in from close range.\nThe Nigerian striker also struck the post in the 90th minute, which would have set up a nervy finish, but ultimately they were well beaten.\nStriker Jamie Vardy made his 300th Premier League appearance, but the 36-year-old was given no supply and could not add to the eight goals he has scored against Manchester City before being replaced at the break.\nYouri Tielemans returned to the side after six weeks out with an ankle injury and defender Caglar Soyuncu made just his third league appearance of the campaign after falling out of favour under Brendan Rodgers.\nAlthough they curtailed a horror start, Leicester slumped to their 20th league defeat of the season, the same number as bottom-of-the-table Southampton.\nSmith, however, believes that his players will be able to avoid the drop.\n\"I was having a nice break and watching the Masters last week but it's nice to be back in it,\" he said.\n\"I believe we have the players and more importantly Craig [Shakespeare] and JT [John Terry] believe we have the players that can get us out of this.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here\nWhat did you think of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nClinical Eze seals victory\nJust like in their 5-1 win over Leeds last weekend, Crystal Palace were off the pace in the first half.\nCheick Doucoure fired over the bar after two minutes, but the away side did not have a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nHowever, the Eagles held firm defensively and went on to produce a clinical display in the second half.\nEze has now scored seven Premier League goals this season, more than any other Crystal Palace player.\n\"He had a very good second half,\" added Hodgson. \"Once we managed to find him in those positions where we found him against Leeds, he dealt with the ball very well when it came in, he was turning his opponent and had the pace and the strength to get away.\"\nPalace remain 12th, and their fears of relegation are fading after another impressive performance on the road.\nSpirited display not enough for Southampton\nSouthampton's chances of beating the drop have been dealt a blow by a second consecutive home defeat.\nThe Saints were the better team in the first half, creating numerous openings while they were in the ascendancy. Sulemana headed over from close range, as well as having a tame effort following a clever one-two with Theo Walcott.\nJoe Aribo, making his first Premier League start since New Year's Eve, missed a glorious chance when he blasted over the bar despite being unmarked in the box.\nThe home crowd also saw Walcott shoot just over the bar as Southampton's lack of clinical finishing was laid bare.\nEven after falling behind, Ruben Selles' side were left to rue missed opportunities.\nCarlos Alcaraz was left frustrated after squandering two chances in two minutes. First, he was inches away when he shot from the edge of the box and it hit the inside of the post. Another chance came when Palace failed to deal with a cross and Alcaraz pounced, only to volley it over the bar from close range.\n\"It is hurting already,\" said interim Saints boss Selles. \"We came here with the best of intentions to put in a good performance. I think we showed our personality in parts of the game, the way that we want to play and we did not get what we want, so it is hard.\n\"Seven games to go and it is starting to be more difficult for us.\n\"We competed in a lot of parts in the game and not getting any points today puts us in a difficult situation - nothing too different from before, but just less games to play.\"\nSouthampton have now gone six games without victory, and have suffered 10 home defeats in the Premier League this season, equalling their most losses on home soil in a single campaign.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Fulham's display? Send us your views here\n\"The mentality has been really good and there has been a shift since I've been here,\" Dyche told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We don't want it to revert back to that feeling from before we got here, and there was a sign of that today - people dipping too quickly. We want that bravery to take games on.\n\"I reminded the players that no one gives you anything, don't think they will because they won't.\n\"We should react to that a lot better and we have done generally. But these are important times so we've got to make sure we correct that very quickly.\"\nFulham could have scored more before Everton belatedly - and briefly - stirred again and attempted to rally late on.\nHowever, Marco Silva's side held on comfortably and the result leaves Everton in 17th, above the drop zone only on goal difference.\nNo home comforts for Everton\nSince Dyche's appointment, it is Everton's home form that has given them hope in their battle against relegation with wins over Arsenal, Leeds and Brentford as well as a last-gasp draw against Tottenham.\nThose points may be vital come the end of the season, but aside from 15 minutes either side of half-time, there was little of the fight or intensity that led to those results as they succumbed to a Fulham side sat comfortably in midtable and in the midst of their worst run of the season.\nNeither side offered much in a scrappy beginning but it was Fulham who provided the greater threat in the lead up to their opening goal.\nThe Blues took the knock well and should have been level through Neal Maupay, making a rare start, but the striker's close-range header was kept out by Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno - albeit replays showed it may have been offside in any case.\nThe equaliser did come three minutes later, McNeil collecting James Garner's pass, slipping past Reed and arrowing the shot into the bottom corner to rouse a sunbathed Goodison Park.\nIn the 10 minutes before the break, it was all Everton and Maupay had the chance to put them in front after a one-two with McNeil, only to be thwarted by Leno again.\nA bright start to the second half, in which McNeil's mishit cross hit the outside of the post, kept the home crowd's decibel level up but the energy of both fans and home players evaporated after Wilson's goal.\n\"We've had some tough knocks and come back against Chelsea and Tottenham but they're different games and a different feel in the stadium,\" Dyche said.\n\"These are the clinchers, these are the ones where we've got to change the mentality.\n\"We've been working hard - and the players have been delivering - to change that cycle. We stepped away from that today so we need to get a grip of that this week and go down to Crystal Palace with the right frame of mind.\"\nHaving fought back once, Everton seemed to lack the belief that they could do so again. James got Fulham's third and even with more than 20 minutes to go, both sides seemed sure the game was over as a contest.\nWith seven games to go, Dyche's side cannot afford to repeat the sort of listless performance they delivered for much of this game - and certainly not at home.\nFulham break losing streak\nAfter such a positive season, it had been a tough few weeks for Fulham with five defeats on the bounce, including a very public implosion at Manchester United that left them without top-scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic for eight matches.\nThat run may have seen them slip out of contention for European qualification but it is hard to think that there is anyone associated with the west London club who would not have been thrilled with the prospect of sitting pretty in 10th at this stage of the campaign.\nNevertheless, losing can be a tough habit to break and in ending their winless streak, Fulham took a big step towards ensuring such an encouraging season does not end with a whimper.\nCottagers manager Silva was sat in the stands as he completed his touchline ban to see his current side outplay his former team for long spells.\n\"Many, many positives to take from the game. We were clearly the best team on the pitch,\" Silva told Match of the Day.\n\"We came from a bad run and, of course, we had to show the personality and character to turn things again.\n\"We changed some things, played with a different profile of striker and Daniel James played a very good game. The players deserve all the credit for the win.\n\"We have to be really proud of our season so far. Bad spells can happen for a club like us in the Premier League but, of course, we don't want it but it's part of the process and we have to keep working really hard.\n\"We have 42 points, by the end of February we had 39, it's a big achievement for this football club and we have to keep going.\"\nReed buzzed around relentlessly in midfield alongside Joao Palhinha while further forward Willian, seemingly always in space, threatened throughout, James was a constant nuisance to the Everton defence and, buoyed by his goal, Wilson's quality was clear as Fulham overwhelmed their hosts at times in the second half.\nIn this most enjoyable of seasons for Fulham, this was an afternoon to savour in the Merseyside sunshine.\nGo straight to all the best Everton content\nVisit our Fulham page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The next was to get in the top half - we are,\" Emery told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We are being very demanding to add a new target to be in the top six, but we are going to face the teams that are now fighting for that.\n\"We believe, with our supporters, that we can do that.\"\nVilla could have been 3-0 ahead inside the opening quarter of an hour but were twice denied by the frame of the goal, while Watkins also drew a fine save from Pope not long after Ramsey's opener.\nAfter being denied by the England keeper yet again three minutes into the second half, Watkins thought he had finally made the scoresheet on the hour-mark when he was ruled narrowly offside by the video assistant referee.\nWith England manager Gareth Southgate watching on in the stands, 27-year-old Watkins added gloss to a perfect Villa performance with two clinical second-half finishes, lifting his league tally for the season to 14.\nRemarkably, 11 of those goals have come in his past 12 top-flight appearances.\nSobering afternoon for Newcastle\nRegardless of whether they achieve Champions League qualification, Newcastle have had a magnificent campaign, but they were comfortably second best here.\nThey recovered from a slow start at Brentford last weekend to claim a fifth league win in succession, but they rarely threatened to get back in the game after Ramsey's opener and could have lost by a much bigger margin.\nThey struggled to cope with the pace of the sensational Watkins, who was making darting runs between Trippier and Fabian Schar at every opportunity.\nCallum Wilson and the fit-again Miguel Almiron were brought on 11 minutes into the second half, but they had little impact as Villa continued to create the better openings.\nWilson almost got on the end of a teasing Isak cross but was narrowly offside in any case, while Almiron struck the side-netting from a tight angle on his first appearance since mid-March.\nNewcastle will need to produce a vastly improved performance when fellow Champions League aspirants Tottenham visit St James' Park on 23 April.\n\"We were off our best levels today, right from the start,\" Howe told Match of the Day. \"Aston Villa are a good team and we never got going.\n\"We've been consistently excellent this season.

They are wobbling in their bid to become English champions for the 14th time and the first since Arsene Wenger's 'Invincibles' went a league season without losing in 2003-04.\nFor the opening half-hour Arsenal's football was a joy to watch as they overpowered West Ham and looked to have wrapped up the three points with relative ease, with Jesus scoring his fourth goal in three matches before Odegaard added a second three minutes later.\nThomas Partey then sloppily lost possession to Declan Rice and that led to the penalty which gave West Ham hope and changed the course of the match.\nHowever, even after Bowen's equaliser, Arsenal still had opportunities to get a winning goal.\nJesus narrowly missed getting a touch on Kieran Tierney's cross before two chances in the last three minutes, but Saka headed wide before Rob Holding's header was saved by ex-Gunner Lukasz Fabianski.\nSlow starters West Ham show great character\nThis was West Ham's fifth match of nine in a congested April schedule and manager David Moyes made eight changes to the side that began Thursday's 1-1 draw at Gent in the first leg of their Europa Conference League quarter-final.\nFor Moyes it remains a tough task trying to balance their primary target of staying in the top flight but also progressing in European competition.\nBut the Scot, who appointed Arteta as his captain when the pair were together at Everton, will have been furious at yet another poor start in a home league match.\nIn their most recent game at London Stadium they fell 2-0 behind inside 13 minutes on their way to their heaviest defeat of the season, a 5-1 thrashing by Newcastle.\nThe home fans would have been fearing another heavy loss, but West Ham showed great character after conceding twice so early on.\nBenrahma's penalty changed the mood at the stadium, with Antonio then having a header pushed over by Aaron Ramsdale and Paqueta firing over the bar as West Ham enjoyed their best spell at the end of the first half.\nSaka's missed penalty lifted the atmosphere further, before Bowen's excellently taken volley gave West Ham fans hopes of a victory that looked impossible after 10 minutes.\nThis is West Ham's 11th successive season in the top flight. They have eight matches to save themselves and, despite this excellent point, remain in relegation trouble.\nAntonio's 81st-minute header nearly snatched an incredible victory in a thrilling London derby, but bounced off the crossbar.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Wolves' display? Send us your views here\nIt was a more even contest after the break but the home side always looked the more likely and found the decisive goal thanks to some nice interplay down the left to free Victor Kristiansen and the full-back's cut-back was smartly finished by Castagne.\nJulen Lopetegui's Wolves came close to an equaliser when Ruben Neves' free-kick was tipped over the bar by Leicester keeper Daniel Iversen but the Foxes held on for a precious win.\nLeicester are up to 17th after ending a run of nine game without a win, while Wolves stay 13th, six points clear of the drop zone.\nLeicester give fans something to shout about\nThe noise from the home fans at the King Power at full-time was proof Smith had delivered on his promise before the game to give them something to shout about.\nIt was a different sort of noise half an hour into the game as the crowd voiced their frustrations at a nervy showing from the hosts, who were without James Maddison due to a sickness bug.\nThere had been few signs of such tension in the opening five minutes as Leicester moved the ball quickly and should have gone in front when Vardy, released down the left channel by Iheanacho, opted to pass with only Sa to beat and Tete's shot was blocked by Toti.\nWolves soon settled, though, and Leicester, perhaps spooked as much by the nature of it as much as the goal itself, appeared to lose all confidence.\nBut a swift counter-attack and Sa's inadvertent trip of Vardy changed the game - even if it did likely result in the striker's half-time substitution.\nIheanacho made no mistake from the spot and suddenly Leicester's belief returned.\nThey were nearly in front at half-time but Sa clawed Iheanacho's curling effort away and recovered quickly to thwart Patson Daka on the follow-up.\nSa had to be alert to save from Daka again in the second half before Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall blazed the rebound over.\nThere was a sharpness to some of Leicester's play that had deserted them for much of the opening 45 minutes and that was in evidence with the winning goal as Daka and Boubakary Soumare combined to set Kristiansen away to set up Castagne.\nWith six games to go and their top-flight status on the line, results are far more important than performances but Leicester's showing from the equaliser onwards will give Smith hope his team can keep the supporters shouting all their way to safety in the coming weeks.\nWolves miss opportunity to leave relegation battle behind them\nBack-to-back wins had given Wolves a reasonable cushion over the sides in the bottom three and a third victory on the bounce would have put them on the brink of safety.\nFor much of the first half, they looked on track to do just that as they swarmed all over Leicester following Cunha's opener.\nThe smart pressing that created the goal was repeated countless times but despite winning the ball back in promising areas, Wolves were unable to force a second goal and kill the game off.\nAfter centre-back Craig Dawson lashed two left-footed efforts just wide, Cunha came closest to doing so when he received a clever pass from Matheus Nunes, only for Wout Faes to get across to make a vital block.\nSa's clumsy challenge allowed Leicester the opportunity to level and shifted the momentum in the game, and although Wolves still provided a threat on the break, they were unable to fashion any clear-cut chances.\nAlthough Lopetegui insists his side have a lot of work still to do, Wolves remain well-placed to secure their place in the Premier League next season in the next few weeks.\nBut this will feel like a missed opportunity to get a whole lot closer to achieving that aim.\nGo straight to all the best Leicester City content\nVisit our Wolves page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We can play better.\"\nHow Saturday's Premier League action unfolded\nGo straight to the best Brentford content\nVisit our Aston Villa page\nBees squander chances on dominant afternoon\nThe hosts were the better side from the outset but struggled to find a cutting edge after goalkeeper David Raya was forced into early action by Villa's Emi Buendia.\nShortly before the break the visitors almost struck with the best move of the half, John McGinn combining with Ollie Watkins but seeing his curling effort narrowly miss the target.\nVilla suffered a setback at the interval when World Cup-winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was forced off through illness, with Robin Olsen coming on in his place.\nAnd Brentford should have taken the lead shortly afterwards when Kevin Schade fired wide with the goal gaping having rounded Olsen, who had spilled his initial header.\nThe chances kept coming for Brentford, with Bryan Mbeumo in particular giving Alex Moreno a difficult afternoon down the flank and Schade's constant runs in behind causing problems.\nAnd the pressure eventually told as Toney, so often the man to make the difference for the Bees, did so again.\nThe England striker met Mbeumo's cross at the back post to finish emphatically and briefly reignite the club's charge for European football, which Brentford boss Thomas Frank had played down before kick-off.\nWith three minutes of normal time remaining, however, with Brentford scrambling in defence, Luiz fired home to break their hearts and secure a vital point in Villa's push for a top-four finish.\nThomas Frank was \"proud\" of his team's performance but frustrated by the late goal.\n\"There should only be one winner of this game,\" he said. \"We were close to a complete performance.\n\"Before their goal they only had that 'chance-ish' with Ramsey. They had three or four shots or ricochets before they scored. Before that they had zip, nothing.\n\"When you're only 1-0 up that can happen and the opponents get a goal.\n\"I'm so proud of the team, proud of the players. That's football.\"\nLuiz goal masks tough day for Watkins\nThere are not many strikers enjoying themselves more than Watkins right now, the 27-year-old having come into this game on the back of 11 goals in 12 games.\nWatkins is harbouring realistic England ambitions after emerging as the driving force behind the incredible resurgence under Emery, which brought Villa five straight Premier League wins for the first time since 1998 before this result.\nBut this was a disappointing afternoon for Watkins on his his first return to Brentford, where he scored 49 goals in three years.\nThe Villa striker simply could not get into the game, and while Toney, a direct rival for a spot in Gareth Southgate's England squad, made the most of his chance when it came, there was nothing for Watkins to feed off.\nLuiz's strike kickstarted a late rally during which Villa's recent character was evident again, but overall they looked toothless.\nWith tough fixtures to come, Villa need to get Watkins back firing quickly if they are to maintain their unlikely push for European football next season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Wolves' display? Send us your views here\nIt was a more even contest after the break but the home side always looked the more likely and found the decisive goal thanks to some nice interplay down the left to free Victor Kristiansen and the full-back's cut-back was smartly finished by Castagne.\nJulen Lopetegui's Wolves came close to an equaliser when Ruben Neves' free-kick was tipped over the bar by Leicester keeper Daniel Iversen but the Foxes held on for a precious win.\nLeicester are up to 17th after ending a run of nine game without a win, while Wolves stay 13th, six points clear of the drop zone.\nLeicester give fans something to shout about\nThe noise from the home fans at the King Power at full-time was proof Smith had delivered on his promise before the game to give them something to shout about.\nIt was a different sort of noise half an hour into the game as the crowd voiced their frustrations at a nervy showing from the hosts, who were without James Maddison due to a sickness bug.\nThere had been few signs of such tension in the opening five minutes as Leicester moved the ball quickly and should have gone in front when Vardy, released down the left channel by Iheanacho, opted to pass with only Sa to beat and Tete's shot was blocked by Toti.\nWolves soon settled, though, and Leicester, perhaps spooked as much by the nature of it as much as the goal itself, appeared to lose all confidence.\nBut a swift counter-attack and Sa's inadvertent trip of Vardy changed the game - even if it did likely result in the striker's half-time substitution.\nIheanacho made no mistake from the spot and suddenly Leicester's belief returned.\nThey were nearly in front at half-time but Sa clawed Iheanacho's curling effort away and recovered quickly to thwart Patson Daka on the follow-up.\nSa had to be alert to save from Daka again in the second half before Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall blazed the rebound over.\nThere was a sharpness to some of Leicester's play that had deserted them for much of the opening 45 minutes and that was in evidence with the winning goal as Daka and Boubakary Soumare combined to set Kristiansen away to set up Castagne.\nWith six games to go and their top-flight status on the line, results are far more important than performances but Leicester's showing from the equaliser onwards will give Smith hope his team can keep the supporters shouting all their way to safety in the coming weeks.\nWolves miss opportunity to leave relegation battle behind them\nBack-to-back wins had given Wolves a reasonable cushion over the sides in the bottom three and a third victory on the bounce would have put them on the brink of safety.\nFor much of the first half, they looked on track to do just that as they swarmed all over Leicester following Cunha's opener.\nThe smart pressing that created the goal was repeated countless times but despite winning the ball back in promising areas, Wolves were unable to force a second goal and kill the game off.\nAfter centre-back Craig Dawson lashed two left-footed efforts just wide, Cunha came closest to doing so when he received a clever pass from Matheus Nunes, only for Wout Faes to get across to make a vital block.\nSa's clumsy challenge allowed Leicester the opportunity to level and shifted the momentum in the game, and although Wolves still provided a threat on the break, they were unable to fashion any clear-cut chances.\nAlthough Lopetegui insists his side have a lot of work still to do, Wolves remain well-placed to secure their place in the Premier League next season in the next few weeks.\nBut this will feel like a missed opportunity to get a whole lot closer to achieving that aim.\nGo straight to all the best Leicester City content\nVisit our Wolves page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It was a very difficult time,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"We didn't create big chances but we were defending well. Our reaction in the last 15 minutes was very good.

They had three or four shots or ricochets before they scored. Before that they had zip, nothing.\n\"When you're only 1-0 up that can happen and the opponents get a goal.\n\"I'm so proud of the team, proud of the players. That's football.\"\nLuiz goal masks tough day for Watkins\nThere are not many strikers enjoying themselves more than Watkins right now, the 27-year-old having come into this game on the back of 11 goals in 12 games.\nWatkins is harbouring realistic England ambitions after emerging as the driving force behind the incredible resurgence under Emery, which brought Villa five straight Premier League wins for the first time since 1998 before this result.\nBut this was a disappointing afternoon for Watkins on his his first return to Brentford, where he scored 49 goals in three years.\nThe Villa striker simply could not get into the game, and while Toney, a direct rival for a spot in Gareth Southgate's England squad, made the most of his chance when it came, there was nothing for Watkins to feed off.\nLuiz's strike kickstarted a late rally during which Villa's recent character was evident again, but overall they looked toothless.\nWith tough fixtures to come, Villa need to get Watkins back firing quickly if they are to maintain their unlikely push for European football next season.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We have to play with the right mentality and be stable in the bad moments that we will have - and go for it.\"\nThen on 26 April comes the huge clash against Arsenal, which could potentially be a title-decider at Etihad Stadium, with the visitors aiming to end their long top-flight trophy wait and stop their opponents from claiming three in a row.\nLeading City's charge is irrepressible frontman Haaland, who continues to wreak havoc with his goalscoring, taking his tally to 47 in 40 games in all competitions.\nHis spot-kick and cheeky finish from Kevin de Bruyne's pass extended his total to 32 in the top flight, drawing alongside Mohamed Salah's record in a 38-game season with eight games still to play.\nThe former Borussia Dortmund striker's goals put his side 3-0 up after they were set on their way by Stones' fabulous first-time finish from the edge of the box.\nWith the points all-but secure, both players were withdrawn at half-time and the team could not find more goals as Leicester dug in.\nFoxes slump to another loss\nThis was attack against defence, and was not the start former Aston Villa boss Smith would have wished for, having taken charge of Leicester until the end of the campaign.\nA dreadful season shows few signs of improvement, with the Foxes having collected one point from their last nine games. They have earned just eight points since Christmas, the fewest by a top-flight side during that period.\nHome goalkeeper Ederson was a virtual bystander for the entire contest, but made a sharp stop to deny James Maddison after substitute Iheanacho had stabbed in from close range.\nThe Nigerian striker also struck the post in the 90th minute, which would have set up a nervy finish, but ultimately they were well beaten.\nStriker Jamie Vardy made his 300th Premier League appearance, but the 36-year-old was given no supply and could not add to the eight goals he has scored against Manchester City before being replaced at the break.\nYouri Tielemans returned to the side after six weeks out with an ankle injury and defender Caglar Soyuncu made just his third league appearance of the campaign after falling out of favour under Brendan Rodgers.\nAlthough they curtailed a horror start, Leicester slumped to their 20th league defeat of the season, the same number as bottom-of-the-table Southampton.\nSmith, however, believes that his players will be able to avoid the drop.\n\"I was having a nice break and watching the Masters last week but it's nice to be back in it,\" he said.\n\"I believe we have the players and more importantly Craig [Shakespeare] and JT [John Terry] believe we have the players that can get us out of this.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk denied Antonio a certain goal from close range with a crucial interception following Said Benrahma's angled ball.\nThe resulting corner did fall to Antonio but the Jamaica striker could only glance his header off target.\nIn the second half, Matip, who started in place of the injured Ibrahima Konate, had an effort blocked on the line by Lukasz Fabianski but then scored shortly afterwards with a powerful header when unmarked from a corner.\nWest Ham had opportunities to score an equaliser, but Tomas Soucek headed over and Bowen had a low strike saved as Liverpool held on for their third win in a row.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The Japan star failed to covert and the miss ultimately proved pivotal.\nAs for Buonanotte, amid a belief that Alejandro Garnacho will snub the FA Cup final to report for World Under-20 Championship duty with Argentina next month, it will be interesting to see what choice the Brighton youngster makes.\nVisit our Nottingham Forest page\nGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

And, despite the loss, there was still cause for optimism.\nDefensively, the closest Wolves came to opening them up was in the second minute when Diego Costa found space in the box and Johnstone turned his shot behind for the corner that led to Andersen's unfortunate own goal.\nFrom that point until Johnstone's late error, they never looked like conceding.\n\"I always believed the equalising goal was there,\" Hodgson said. \"Credit to Wolves, they defended well. The second goal was one of those cold showers you have to accept from time to time.\"\nGoing forward, they will be disappointed not to have created more but they forced Wolves back for much of the second half.\nEze and Michael Olise, alongside the tireless Jordan Ayew, provided a threat but on this occasion, the final ball was just lacking.\n\"Nobody could suggest the players' mindset is that we're safe,\" the Palace boss added. \"I thought it was a very energetic, intense performance. On a normal day they would have got a result. We have five more games - I want to see exactly what we did today.\"\nVisit our Wolves page\nGo straight to the best Crystal Palace content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

The Japan star failed to covert and the miss ultimately proved pivotal.\nAs for Buonanotte, amid a belief that Alejandro Garnacho will snub the FA Cup final to report for World Under-20 Championship duty with Argentina next month, it will be interesting to see what choice the Brighton youngster makes.\nVisit our Nottingham Forest page\nGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

However, his willingness to play through pain is admirable.\nAnyone who saw him limping away from a first-half collision in the FA Cup semi-final with Brighton was surprised he remained on the pitch into extra-time.\nThat he should start two Premier League games in the week after that says much for the 28-year-old's resolve.\nFernandes' 11th goal of the season underlined his desire.\nHe anticipated the ball could run loose as soon as Rashford went for goal - and when Martinez pushed it straight to the area Fernandes was running into, he was quicker to react than Alex Moreno and finished from an acute angle.\n\"He's so tough,\" United boss Erik ten Hag said. \"A couple of weeks ago there were questions about his captaincy.\n\"It's crazy because he's such a big leader - by example. He gives so much energy to the team besides his smartness.\n\"But also his determination, his passion and his resilience, so I think we as a team are so happy.\n\"We need such players if you want to win games, if you want to win trophies.\"\nVilla have rare off-day\nThe defeat is a blow to Villa's European aspirations, although given their final three opponents of the campaign are Tottenham, Liverpool and Brighton they remain very much in charge of their own destiny.\nHowever, to even be talking in those terms is testament to the impact Unai Emery has had since his arrival at the club in November.\nThis was one of those rare days in recent times when Emery's side failed to generate pressure around their opponents' box or build up any decent momentum.\nOne second-half effort from Jacob Ramsey was on target when it was blocked by Victor Lindelof, although whether it would have tested David de Gea is another matter.\nJohn McGinn had a speculative effort from the edge of the area shortly afterwards which rolled harmlessly wide.\nThe visitors had a couple of scrambles around the home box in the latter stages without threatening to breach De Gea's defences, although after eight wins and two draws they can be excused one off-day.\nUnited fans protest before game\nThe prelude to the game was marked by a loud and colourful protest against the Glazer family by some United supporters.\nFans began to gather in the city centre three hours before kick-off and while the overwhelming majority were in their seats by kick-off, hundreds continue to protest outside the directors' box, forcing United to close various entrances for security reasons.\nDerby defender Curtis Davies was among those caught up in the protests, meaning he was delayed getting to his BBC Radio Five commentary position.\nFriday evening marked the deadline for bids to buy United, amid suggestions co-chairmen Joel and Avram Glazer may choose to remain at the club in some capacity.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

After keeping out a fierce strike from Marc Roca, the former Fiorentina keeper made a fine double save to deny Robin Koch and then Gnonto.\nSubstitute Antoine Semenyo's first Bournemouth goal sealed the win in stoppage time as his shot squirmed under Meslier.\nDefeat leaves Javi Gracia's side in 16th, just a point above the relegation zone and regardless of the result between Leicester and Everton. Only goal difference will keep them out of the bottom three by Monday night.\nMeanwhile, Gary O'Neil's Bournemouth are up to 13th, 10 points clear of the drop zone.\nLeeds facing daunting run with survival on the line\nWith games against Leicester and Bournemouth, this was seen as a pivotal few days in Leeds' fight against relegation.\nTaking just one point from those fixtures leaves them perilously close to the relegation places and with an unenviable run of games to close out the season.\nNext up is a trip to table-topping Manchester City before they welcome Eddie Howe's in-form Newcastle to Elland Road.\nWest Ham away follows before a home game with Tottenham on the final day.\nIt is a far from straightforward stretch for any side, let alone one that has collected just a solitary point from their last five games and conceded 18 goals in the process.\nLeeds have four games to try and save themselves but having shown a worrying combination of shaky at the back and profligate up top at the Vitality, it is looking increasingly likely that they will need favours from elsewhere to stay up.\nBournemouth celebrate all but securing safety\nAfter victory at Southampton on Thursday, O'Neil refused to accept that his side were safe.\nThree days on and a beaming Bournemouth boss joined the Cherries' celebrations at the final whistle, suggesting an additional three points had been enough to change his thinking.\nHis side opened the scoring against the run of play but from then on they were deserving of their win.\nIt completes a marvellous turnaround for Bournemouth after former boss Scott Parker seemed resigned to relegation after a 9-0 defeat at Liverpool in August.\nUnder O'Neil, though, the Cherries have shown huge resilience and played some lovely football along the way.\nAgainst Leeds, Lerma finished with aplomb for both his goals, Solanke also took his well and led the line superbly, while Dango Ouattara was a constant threat down the right.\nFew would have thought it after that thrashing at Anfield but, with four games remaining, Bournemouth fans can look forward to another season in the top flight.\nRelive Bournemouth v Leeds and all of Sunday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Bournemouth's performance?

He is now suffering serious reputational damage.\nRaheem Sterling's struggles are symbolic of how Boehly's big-money buys have failed to deliver and it was no surprise when he was substituted.\nChelsea, now languishing in 12th place, are a team seemingly lacking any structure or gameplan.\nAnd supporters who hoped the chance to dent Arsenal's title challenge in a London derby might finally fire up their under-performing stars were left feeling betrayed by another dreadful showing.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

After keeping out a fierce strike from Marc Roca, the former Fiorentina keeper made a fine double save to deny Robin Koch and then Gnonto.\nSubstitute Antoine Semenyo's first Bournemouth goal sealed the win in stoppage time as his shot squirmed under Meslier.\nDefeat leaves Javi Gracia's side in 16th, just a point above the relegation zone and regardless of the result between Leicester and Everton. Only goal difference will keep them out of the bottom three by Monday night.\nMeanwhile, Gary O'Neil's Bournemouth are up to 13th, 10 points clear of the drop zone.\nLeeds facing daunting run with survival on the line\nWith games against Leicester and Bournemouth, this was seen as a pivotal few days in Leeds' fight against relegation.\nTaking just one point from those fixtures leaves them perilously close to the relegation places and with an unenviable run of games to close out the season.\nNext up is a trip to table-topping Manchester City before they welcome Eddie Howe's in-form Newcastle to Elland Road.\nWest Ham away follows before a home game with Tottenham on the final day.\nIt is a far from straightforward stretch for any side, let alone one that has collected just a solitary point from their last five games and conceded 18 goals in the process.\nLeeds have four games to try and save themselves but having shown a worrying combination of shaky at the back and profligate up top at the Vitality, it is looking increasingly likely that they will need favours from elsewhere to stay up.\nBournemouth celebrate all but securing safety\nAfter victory at Southampton on Thursday, O'Neil refused to accept that his side were safe.\nThree days on and a beaming Bournemouth boss joined the Cherries' celebrations at the final whistle, suggesting an additional three points had been enough to change his thinking.\nHis side opened the scoring against the run of play but from then on they were deserving of their win.\nIt completes a marvellous turnaround for Bournemouth after former boss Scott Parker seemed resigned to relegation after a 9-0 defeat at Liverpool in August.\nUnder O'Neil, though, the Cherries have shown huge resilience and played some lovely football along the way.\nAgainst Leeds, Lerma finished with aplomb for both his goals, Solanke also took his well and led the line superbly, while Dango Ouattara was a constant threat down the right.\nFew would have thought it after that thrashing at Anfield but, with four games remaining, Bournemouth fans can look forward to another season in the top flight.\nRelive Bournemouth v Leeds and all of Sunday's Premier League action\nHow did you rate Bournemouth's performance?

I'm still waiting for that clear-cut image. It's a massive call in this time of the season,\" he said.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Forest's display? Send us your views here\nAfter beating Brighton at home on Wednesday, Forest looked well on course for a second win in four days and earn a rare away victory.\nBut, with all their nearest rivals yet to play this weekend, they remain in 17th place and just a point ahead of third-bottom Leicester.\n\"It is a sense of massive disappointment - one that got away,\" added Cooper.\n\"It was always going to be a tiring week with three games and there were a lot of tired legs on the pitch. It was a game of fine margins.\n\"We felt in a comfortable position - Brentford weren't creating a lot of chances. The two goals we've given away are really disappointing and it has cost us the game.\n\"No problem of the effort of the players but you've got to do everything right until the end of the game.\"\nForest denied breathing space from bottom three\nWith none of the other sides in the tightly packed bottom five playing on Saturday, Forest had an excellent opportunity to put pressure on their rivals.\nFor a long period after Danilo's opening goal, and with Brentford providing little threat, it looked as though Cooper's team were going to move four points clear of the bottom three.\nForest's survival hopes were given a significant boost when they fought back to beat a Brighton side chasing European qualification at a raucous City Ground on Wednesday.\nLifting them out of the relegation zone, the win took Forest to 30 points - with 24 of those earned in front of their own fans.\nThe challenge has been transferring their ability to pick up points at home into doing the same on the road.\nBut, after defending well for most of the match, they were denied even a point at a time when each one is so precious.\nForest had to wait 23 years for their return to the Premier League and are hoping to avoid an immediate exit.\nCooper's task after this dispiriting defeat is to rally his players again, knowing their next game at home against Southampton on 8 May is likely to have a huge impact on their survival hopes.\nBrentford still 'giving themselves chance' of European football\nBrentford have continued to defy the odds and expectations in their second season in the Premier League, having already surpassed their points tally in an impressive debut campaign.\nAnything less than a win against Forest would have all but ended the Bees' push for Europe.\nWhile it still appears they have too much ground to make up, with the sides above them having played fewer games, Brentford maintained the pressure on the likes of Brighton, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Tottenham.\n\"We didn't play our best. Sometimes you have to find a way to win and we did it ugly today,\" said Brentford skipper Toney, who became the first Bees player since Dave McCulloch in 1937-38 to score 20 top-flight league goals in a season.\n\"I think Forest are a great side, dug in well and if they stick at it they give themselves a chance of staying in the league.\n\"It's still possible [for European football] but we have to focus on ourselves and give ourselves a chance.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

He is now suffering serious reputational damage.\nRaheem Sterling's struggles are symbolic of how Boehly's big-money buys have failed to deliver and it was no surprise when he was substituted.\nChelsea, now languishing in 12th place, are a team seemingly lacking any structure or gameplan.\nAnd supporters who hoped the chance to dent Arsenal's title challenge in a London derby might finally fire up their under-performing stars were left feeling betrayed by another dreadful showing.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

If Brighton win all their games, they are ahead of us. That's the situation. We just have to win our games and see where it takes us.\n\"At the moment I'm happy with our direction.

Kaoru Mitoma shot straight at David de Gea when clean through, and missed another good chance after the break, while Danny Welbeck was also off target with another presentable opening.\nThe Seagulls turned up the pressure in stoppage time, De Gea saving superbly from Mac Allister and Pervis Etupinan before they finally made the breakthrough.\nBrighton v Manchester United - as it happened\nGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion content\nVisit our Manchester United page\nSuperb Brighton aim for Europe\nBrighton's thrilling attacking style under manager Roberto de Zerbi has got their fans dreaming of European football next season and the scenes of celebration at the final whistle reflected the belief and optimism surging through the club.\nOn this evidence, if Brighton do reach Europe, they will be a wonderfully entertaining addition.\nThey showed they have recovered from losing to United at Wembley by refusing to take a backward step, hunting down their tiring opponents in the game's later stages.\nBrighton play with a pace and intensity that is pure theatre at times and in the end it just proved too much for United, although this game was settled on the fine margin of that late penalty.\nArgentina World Cup winner Mac Allister ignored the noise and pressure to beat De Gea convincingly and send the Brighton fans wild. How they enjoyed De Zerbi leading his triumphant players on a lap of honour at the final whistle.\nFor all Brighton's excellence, they still relied heavily on goalkeeper Steele, who was outstanding when called upon.\nBrighton have struggling Everton at home next and in this mood and form, will feel capable of beating anyone.\nMan Utd away day blues continue\nManchester United are still in a good position to qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the top four but there is no doubt an indifferent away record is putting them under pressure.\nThis defeat was their seventh in 17 games, winning seven and drawing three, and for all they made Steele work, the traffic flowed nearly all one way towards their goal as the clock ticked down.\nShaw looked a very guilty man as Brighton manager De Zerbi and his entire backroom staff demanded a penalty in the closing seconds, the inevitable confirmed after VAR invited referee Andre Marriner to visit the screen.\nUnited had their chances but found Steele in top form, their problems coming as they appeared to run out of steam in the second half.\nMartial missed one of those opportunities but otherwise gave a lifeless, lacklustre performance and it was no surprise when he was eventually substituted.\nUnited now travel to West Ham United on Sunday and will know their margin for error has been reduced by this defeat.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

I'm still waiting for that clear-cut image. It's a massive call in this time of the season,\" he said.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nHow did you rate Brentford's performance? Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Forest's display? Send us your views here\nAfter beating Brighton at home on Wednesday, Forest looked well on course for a second win in four days and earn a rare away victory.\nBut, with all their nearest rivals yet to play this weekend, they remain in 17th place and just a point ahead of third-bottom Leicester.\n\"It is a sense of massive disappointment - one that got away,\" added Cooper.\n\"It was always going to be a tiring week with three games and there were a lot of tired legs on the pitch. It was a game of fine margins.\n\"We felt in a comfortable position - Brentford weren't creating a lot of chances. The two goals we've given away are really disappointing and it has cost us the game.\n\"No problem of the effort of the players but you've got to do everything right until the end of the game.\"\nForest denied breathing space from bottom three\nWith none of the other sides in the tightly packed bottom five playing on Saturday, Forest had an excellent opportunity to put pressure on their rivals.\nFor a long period after Danilo's opening goal, and with Brentford providing little threat, it looked as though Cooper's team were going to move four points clear of the bottom three.\nForest's survival hopes were given a significant boost when they fought back to beat a Brighton side chasing European qualification at a raucous City Ground on Wednesday.\nLifting them out of the relegation zone, the win took Forest to 30 points - with 24 of those earned in front of their own fans.\nThe challenge has been transferring their ability to pick up points at home into doing the same on the road.\nBut, after defending well for most of the match, they were denied even a point at a time when each one is so precious.\nForest had to wait 23 years for their return to the Premier League and are hoping to avoid an immediate exit.\nCooper's task after this dispiriting defeat is to rally his players again, knowing their next game at home against Southampton on 8 May is likely to have a huge impact on their survival hopes.\nBrentford still 'giving themselves chance' of European football\nBrentford have continued to defy the odds and expectations in their second season in the Premier League, having already surpassed their points tally in an impressive debut campaign.\nAnything less than a win against Forest would have all but ended the Bees' push for Europe.\nWhile it still appears they have too much ground to make up, with the sides above them having played fewer games, Brentford maintained the pressure on the likes of Brighton, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Tottenham.\n\"We didn't play our best. Sometimes you have to find a way to win and we did it ugly today,\" said Brentford skipper Toney, who became the first Bees player since Dave McCulloch in 1937-38 to score 20 top-flight league goals in a season.\n\"I think Forest are a great side, dug in well and if they stick at it they give themselves a chance of staying in the league.\n\"It's still possible [for European football] but we have to focus on ourselves and give ourselves a chance.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Even Erling Haaland, for once, failed to score - his best effort came back off the post.\nTheir best chance to wrap the game up came with six minutes to go, when Pascal Struijk fouled Phil Foden inside the area and referee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot.\nRegular penalty-taker Haaland passed up the chance to take it and add to his 51-goal tally for the season, but saw Gundogan miss out on a hat-trick when he sent his effort against the post.\nThat gave Leeds hope and, only 58 seconds later, they were somehow back in the game. Manuel Akanji failed to deal with a long ball and substitute Rodrigo beat Ederson with a low finish.\nTheir noisy supporters roared them forward in search of an unlikely equaliser but City were not in the mood to let the three points slip.\nPep Guardiola's side march on, with the next step in their Treble bid coming against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Tuesday, in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.\nThey now have four Premier League games left and for the first time this season have a significant lead over second-placed Arsenal, who travel to third-placed Newcastle on Sunday.\nLeeds and Allardyce, meanwhile, only have a grim fight against relegation ahead.\nWith three games left, they remain out of the relegation zone on goal difference - but they will have to show far more attacking intent in the next few weeks if they are to avoid the drop.\n'This is business' - Guardiola unhappy with Man City penalty despite win\nSport pays coronation tribute to King Charles III\nGundogan shows his value to Man City\nGundogan's contract ends in the summer, and it is games like this that show how foolish it would be for City to allow him to leave after seven years at Etihad Stadium.\nThe 32-year-old Germany midfielder is far less flamboyant than some of his City team-mates but his knack for finding space or timing his run to make or score a goal remains an important weapon.\nHe made the difference here, even if he should probably leave the spot-kicks to Haaland in future.\nUntil the late drama that followed Gundogan's miss, this was exactly the kind of stroll that City wanted before they face Real in a tie that will define their season.\nGuardiola made seven changes from the team that beat West Ham on Wednesday, many of them with Madrid in mind, but there was no sign of any loss of rhythm.\nThe biggest concern will be an injury to left-back Nathan Ake, who was forced off in the second half and must be a doubt for Tuesday.\nLeeds have something to build on\nAllardyce's comments at his unveiling in midweek, when he claimed to be the equal of any manager in the Premier League, succeeded in taking the pressure off his players before kick-off, but he could do little more to help them once the game began.\nAs anticipated, his plan to stop City involved defending deep and in numbers. Initially it worked, but with Leeds so timid, it seemed only a matter of time before the leaders found a way through, which they duly did.\nAt 2-0, it felt like damage-limitation was Allardyce's main goal and, on that front at least, this was mission accomplished - his side did not ship chances or goals in anything like the same numbers as they have in recent weeks.\nTheir late rally was something of an unexpected and, probably, undeserved bonus. But, far from being battered, as many people expected, this was a performance to build on - and even Allardyce said \"we take some hope from it\".\n\"We now need to build on that and try to get a result,\" he added. \"I was slightly fearful, but we sorted it out for the second half.\n\"When you see Manchester City running down the clock for four minutes at the end, you know you have given yourself a chance.

Martinelli also struck the bar after the break.\nArsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale also produced vital stops from Joe Willock and Fabian Schar, with Alexander Isak heading against the post, before The Gunners broke clear to wrap up the three points - Schar turning Martinelli's cross into his own net in the 71st minute.\nArsenal show their strength\nThis was a huge examination of all the improvements Arsenal have made this season as they walked into the St James' Park hothouse, with expectations high for Newcastle United as they chase Champions League football.\nThe game began in a wall of sound with Newcastle intent on overpowering Arsenal in a frantic start that had the Gunners in retreat.\nFor all the premature talk of \"chokers\" when Arsenal went four league games without a win, they showed there are new reserves of character and resilience to go with all the natural talent they possess.\nAnd no-one exemplifies it more than captain Odegaard, who continued his outstanding season with the crucial first goal, another one of those sweet strikes that have become his trademark.\nArsenal's big concern was that they might pay for their failure to take one of several gilt-edged opportunities in the first half, but they were able to close out this crucial win after Schar's own goal.\nAnd Arsenal showed they have added another side to the game with their attempts to slow the game down to break up Newcastle's rhythm and momentum.\nIt enraged the home fans and Newcastle manager Eddie Howe's assistant Jason Tindall in particular, but it is a tactic the Magpies have used themselves this season when it has suited them.\nArsenal are still second favourites as they pursue their first title since 2003/2004 but they demonstrated again they are determined to take the race all the way.\nFollow Newcastle's match with Arsenal live\nGo straight to all the best Newcastle content\nVisit our Arsenal page\nNewcastle still on course\nNewcastle United's fans could not hide their disappointment at the final whistle as all their efforts to dent Arsenal's title challenge and lift their own Champions League aspirations came to nothing.\nIt removes some of the margin for error as they chase a place in the top four, but the manner in which they ran Arsenal so close and made the margins so fine was an example of their progress this season.\nWho knows what might have happened had Murphy's shot in the opening minutes gone in instead of bouncing back off the woodwork? But in the end Arsenal had the better chances and claimed the three points.\nThe Toon Army is alive with self-belief and optimism, even cheering their side loudly after the final whistle as manager Howe took his players on a lap around the pitch.\nIsak showed what a quality acquisition he has been, but there was no joy for key midfield man Bruno Guimaraes who did not have one of his better days.\nNewcastle stay third, three points ahead of Liverpool in fifth, the good news for Howe and his players being that they remain firmly in control of their own destiny.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Aston Villa's display? Send us your views here\nWolves bounce back from Brighton debacle\nBefore the game, Lopetegui said his players would need to deliver a near-perfect performance to match an Aston Villa side enjoying a new lease of life under Unai Emery.\nWhile the hosts' display was far from error free, the result was the ideal antidote to last Saturday's humbling defeat by Brighton at Amex Stadium and all but confirms their place in the top flight next season.\nWolves' high press forced an early corner from which Toti rose above Jacob Ramsey to break the deadlock, while a combination of dogged defending and inspired goalkeeping kept Villa at bay at the other end.\nThe home side did have opportunities to double their lead, Matheus Cunha firing over the bar from Diego Costa's knockdown before the former Chelsea striker shot straight at Martinez not long after half-time.\nMatheus Nunes perhaps should have given Wolves a two-goal cushion from Pedro Neto's low cross, but he failed to connect with his compatriot's delivery.\nWolves have now registered seven wins from their nine Premier League fixtures at Molineux in 2023 - only Manchester City and Manchester United have a better record on home soil.\nThey last recorded four consecutive top-flight home wins in April 1975.\nVilla fading after excellent run\nAston Villa's momentum under Emery has stalled recently, with Saturday's defeat coming six days after a 1-0 reverse to Manchester United at Old Trafford.\nHowever, with games against fellow European hopefuls Tottenham, Liverpool and Brighton to come, Villa's hopes of securing continental football next season remain very much alive.\nAfter falling behind to Wolves' first real attack of the match, Sa produced a marvellous one-handed save to prevent a Buendia half-volley from nestling in the bottom corner.\nTop scorer Watkins, who is now without a goal in four matches, powered a header straight at Sa from Ramsey's delivery, while Craig Dawson's last-ditch tackle prevented the lively Buendia from getting a shot away after skipping past Max Kilman.\nEmery handed Bertrand Traore his first league start in 16 months at Molineux but it failed to pay off, the former Chelsea and Lyon forward surrendering possession cheaply on several occasions before being hooked at half-time for fit-again Leon Bailey.\nMings squandered the visitors' best chance in the second half, escaping the attention of the Wolves defence but firing Luiz's free-kick high over the bar from an excellent position.\nHaving scored in 20 previous league games under Emery, Villa have now failed to find the net in back-to-back fixtures under the Spaniard.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Now they must win all three remaining games and hope either Forest don't pick up another point, or Everton fail to get more than one, otherwise they will be back in the Championship for the first time since 2012.\nIn contrast, Forest have their fate in their own hands.\nTaiwo Awoniyi scored his first double for the club in the space of three first-half minutes, profiting first from Danilo's superb cross-field pass that allowed Brennan Johnson to set him up to volley home from close range after a goalmouth scramble.\nCarlos Alcaraz pulled one back for Southampton, only for Morgan Gibbs-White to restore the home side's two-goal cushion from the penalty spot a minute before the break.\nAfter Lyanco's header had given Southampton fresh hope at 3-2, Gibbs-White was then instrumental in Forest's fourth.\nThe England Under-21 international had the awareness to flick Johnson's cross into an unmarked Danilo's path for a cool finish, rather than go for goal himself.\nJames Ward-Prowse's injury-time penalty ensured nerves were being shredded right to the very last seconds of a staggering day of Premier League action.\nAt kick-off, both these sides occupied the bottom two places and ended with Forest scrambling up to 16th - three points clear of third-bottom Leicester - and with rising hopes of preserving their top-flight status.\nHow 'spellbinding' day at bottom unfolded\nSouthampton's slide towards the Championship\nThis is Southampton's 11th consecutive Premier League season - while West Ham can match that, only the 'big six' and Everton have been in longer; all nine clubs were given 'long-term shareholder' status in Project Big Picture.\nThis was the plan to reshape English football, formulated by the biggest clubs in the autumn of 2020, but disappeared amid the European Super League row that followed.\nSaints were never actually told of the plan before it was launched but, at the time, they did appear to be one of those clubs who could survive quite easily - even if the days of Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman, which saw the club into Europe, had disappeared.\nBut ownership issues and poor recruitment have dragged them down and, this season, they have made a complete mess on the management side.\nRalph Hasenhuttl's dismissal just before the World Cup came after a run of one win in nine games. His replacement, Nathan Jones, lasted only 95 days before he was sacked and Ruben Selles was given the job until the end of the season.\nHowever, after winning two of his first three matches in charge, Selles has not presided over another victory.\nTheir only point in the past seven games came at Arsenal on 21 April, when Southampton held a two-goal advantage entering the final five minutes.\nThey have not kept a clean sheet since 12 March and the manner in which Forest got their goals in such a crucial game was symptomatic of a team who are just not good enough.\nForest's second came when Alcaraz gifted possession to the hosts 30 yards from his own goal.\nThe third was when Ainsley Maitland-Niles slipped inside his own box and rather than temper what he was going to do, tried to execute a clearance anyway and only succeeded in kicking Johnson on the back of his leg.\nGiven they had trailed by two goals at half-time in 32 Premier League games and lost the lot since 2016, hopes were not high of a comeback.\nThat they came so close was to their credit.\nHad it not been for a couple of brave Keylor Navas punches under pressure when Southampton were only one down, or that a Forest player managed to get on the end of a corner in the 101st minute of a contest extended by two long video assistant referee (VAR) checks near the end, they might have got a draw.\nInstead it was another loss and, nearly, the end of their time as a top-flight club.\nForest fans are their 12th man\nForest couldn't have chosen a better time to complete successive home wins for the first time this season.\nTheir past 12 points have all come at the City Ground and 15 out of 16 since their only away win, at Southampton, in January.\nThe importance of the fans to their club's season cannot be understated. Manager Steve Cooper mentions it in nearly every lot of programme notes. While not particularly intimidating for the opposition, it is manic in favour of the hosts.\nAt the final whistle the noise was intense. The Queen anthem Don't Stop Me Now was greeted with scarf-twirling electricity after Cooper and his players had been given a jubilant send-off.\nOf course, it takes more than an atmosphere to keep a team up and there is plenty of jeopardy in the games that follow against Chelsea, Arsenal and Crystal Palace.\nGibbs-White, though, is starting to show why Forest spent \u00a342.5m on him with consistently good performances.\nAnd while Awoniyi's six goals is hardly evidence of a free-scoring frontman, the confidence gained from his first-half efforts bodes well for the next few weeks and can only help Forest in the battles ahead.\nTake a look at our Nottingham Forest content\nSee all the latest Southampton content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

This was a big game for us and we were not at it,\" Maddison told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We didn't start the game well enough. We need to do the basics well.\"\nFulham opened the scoring through a Willian free-kick before strikes from Carlos Vinicius and Tom Cairney powered them into a 3-0 half-time lead.\nCairney added another after the restart before Harvey Barnes pulled a goal back for the visitors, who then saw Jamie Vardy miss a penalty in the 66th minute.\nWillian re-established Fulham's four-goal lead with another fine strike before Maddison netted Leicester's second with a spot-kick and Barnes scored a late third.\n\"We were not hungry enough to want to win the game,\" said Maddison.\n\"It is tough. No easy game in the Premier League - it is a cliche but so true. We will keep fighting. We will keep trying to put it right.\"\nMaddison later sought to clarify his post-match comments on social media, saying: \"When I say not hungry enough I mean aggressive and on the front foot in duels, not us wanting to win or realising the importance.\n\"We were not good enough today and we've only got ourselves to blame and apologise for that.

We have been fairly resolute in the five games we've had with the exception of Everton.\"\nThe Foxes fell behind in the 10th minute when keeper Daniel Iversen misjudged Willian's wide free-kick and the ball bounced underneath him before nestling in the bottom corner.\nVinicius' goal finished off a fine counter-attacking move before Cairney scored on just his third league start of the season with an impressive curling finish.\nTrailing by three goals at the break, Leicester were booed off by the visiting fans and the mood only got bleaker when Cairney added Fulham's fourth in the 51st minute.\nHowever, Barnes gave his side a glimmer of hope, before Vardy was caught by Bernd Leno midway through the second half - but when the striker missed the resulting spot-kick, any thoughts of an unlikely comeback ended.\nFulham soon added a fifth against a porous defence, with Leicester having now failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their past 20 games, an unwanted Premier League record.\nThere were ironic jeers when Maddison found the bottom corner from the spot in the 81st minute after he had been caught by Joao Palhinha in the box.\nBarnes' 89th-minute strike made the scoreline look more respectable, but in truth the Foxes never looked like securing anything from the match.\nSuperb Fulham equal club record\nInspired by their impressive first-half showing, Fulham have equalled a club record of 14 wins in a single Premier League season.\n\"We clearly deserved the three points and it should have been much more comfortable,\" Fulham boss Marco Silva told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Great team performance. Great moments of football, great goals. The way we played from the first minute was really good.\"\nThere was a party atmosphere at a sun-kissed Craven Cottage as Silva's side bounced back from narrow defeats by Aston Villa, Manchester City and Liverpool.\nThe Cottagers completed a top-flight double over Leicester for the first time since 2004, thanks mainly to the excellent attacking work of Willian and Cairney.\nFulham remain 10th, two points behind west London rivals Brentford.\nThey need five points from their final three games to equal their record top-flight points tally of 53, from the 2008-09 season.\nFulham face Southampton away in their next match on Saturday before taking on Crystal Palace and Manchester United, while Leicester host Liverpool next Monday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It's understandable that as a group finding rhythm and confidence can be difficult.\n\"This is a first step, it won't be plain sailing but there is talent there and the players need to come together to get us to where we want to be.\n\"We came in off the back of a tough run, it's been a tough year and there is a lot work to do. But the performance and the result in isolation are really good, we deserved to win the game. It's a nice step forward for the lads.\"\nRelief for Lampard but more big tests await Chelsea\nChelsea's recent record made for grim reading, with defeats to Real Madrid in both legs of their Champions League quarter-final to go alongside the losses in the league and just two goals scored in those six outings under Lampard.\nBut Lampard's tweaks to the side that had gone 3-0 behind after just 34 minutes against Arsenal paid off, with Gallagher looking lively throughout after his deft, glancing header diverted N'Golo Kante's fine cross from the right in the ninth minute.\nMadueke found the side netting in the first half, as well as posing problems for Bournemouth when cutting inside from the left with some fine runs.\nBadiashile, another of Lampard's changes from midweek, also impressed in giving Chelsea a much more solid feel at the back and he thoroughly deserved his first goal since his arrival from Monaco in January with a poke from close range to Hatem Ziyech's free-kick.\nFelix finished off a cute exchange of passes with Sterling, on as a substitute in the second half, to give a comfortable-looking gloss to the scoreline.\nBut even after the relief of his first win, Lampard knows he still faces a tricky end to the season.\nChelsea face relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest next, before a daunting final trio of games against clubs currently in the positions Chelsea fans would expect to be contesting: Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United.\nCherries miss chance to secure Premier League status\nThomas Tuchel was still Chelsea's manager when Gary O'Neil replaced Scott Parker in late August in the wake of the Cherries' disastrous 9-0 loss at Liverpool, but while the German lasted only just over a week more, O'Neil has repaid the faith shown in him despite some dips in form since his appointment.\nA run of six wins in nine games prior to Chelsea's visit has lifted Bournemouth from the very foot of the table in early March to the cusp of safety, and even this defeat still leaves them nine points clear of Leicester, Leeds and Forest below them.\nAstute business in January has been key to their revival under O'Neil with Vina, on loan from AS Roma, grabbing his second goal inside a month after an excellent move that also involved the impressive Ryan Christie.\nCutting in from the left and quickly exchanging passes with Christie and Dominic Solanke, Vina then opened up his body and curled the ball high past Kepa Arrizabalaga for a brilliant equaliser.\nVina should arguably have had another in the second half, but Kepa was equal to the Uruguay international's near-post shot to his right.\nOuattara, who had also arrived in January on a permanent deal from Lorient, should have hit the target with his header from inside the six-yard area and the impressive Burkina Faso midfielder's miss proved vital when Chelsea subsequently stretched away.",

His replacement, Nathan Jones, lasted only 95 days before he was sacked and Ruben Selles was given the job until the end of the season.\nHowever, after winning two of his first three matches in charge, Selles has not presided over another victory.\nTheir only point in the past seven games came at Arsenal on 21 April, when Southampton held a two-goal advantage entering the final five minutes.\nThey have not kept a clean sheet since 12 March and the manner in which Forest got their goals in such a crucial game was symptomatic of a team who are just not good enough.\nForest's second came when Alcaraz gifted possession to the hosts 30 yards from his own goal.\nThe third was when Ainsley Maitland-Niles slipped inside his own box and rather than temper what he was going to do, tried to execute a clearance anyway and only succeeded in kicking Johnson on the back of his leg.\nGiven they had trailed by two goals at half-time in 32 Premier League games and lost the lot since 2016, hopes were not high of a comeback.\nThat they came so close was to their credit.\nHad it not been for a couple of brave Keylor Navas punches under pressure when Southampton were only one down, or that a Forest player managed to get on the end of a corner in the 101st minute of a contest extended by two long video assistant referee (VAR) checks near the end, they might have got a draw.\nInstead it was another loss and, nearly, the end of their time as a top-flight club.\nForest fans are their 12th man\nForest couldn't have chosen a better time to complete successive home wins for the first time this season.\nTheir past 12 points have all come at the City Ground and 15 out of 16 since their only away win, at Southampton, in January.\nThe importance of the fans to their club's season cannot be understated. Manager Steve Cooper mentions it in nearly every lot of programme notes. While not particularly intimidating for the opposition, it is manic in favour of the hosts.\nAt the final whistle the noise was intense. The Queen anthem Don't Stop Me Now was greeted with scarf-twirling electricity after Cooper and his players had been given a jubilant send-off.\nOf course, it takes more than an atmosphere to keep a team up and there is plenty of jeopardy in the games that follow against Chelsea, Arsenal and Crystal Palace.\nGibbs-White, though, is starting to show why Forest spent \u00a342.5m on him with consistently good performances.\nAnd while Awoniyi's six goals is hardly evidence of a free-scoring frontman, the confidence gained from his first-half efforts bodes well for the next few weeks and can only help Forest in the battles ahead.\nTake a look at our Nottingham Forest content\nSee all the latest Southampton content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Have your say here\nWhat did you make of Crystal Palace's display? Send us your views here\nKane drives Spurs on to much-needed win\nBoth teams were involved in seven-goal thrillers last weekend but with contrasting fortunes. Palace's deserved 4-3 win over West Ham and Spurs' loss to Liverpool by the same score were indicative of their respective late-season trajectories.\nWhile Hodgson has efficiently guided Palace to near-certain safety since the 75-year-old returned to management in March, Spurs' bid for a top-four finish has faltered amid a run of one win in seven league games.\nDespite an admirable fightback from 3-0 down at Anfield before a 94th-minute sucker-punch, interim boss Mason had once again seen his side - league-leaders for goals conceded in the opening 15 minutes of matches - punished for a costly slow start.\nBut Spurs ensured they would not make the same mistake and a rare clean sheet - their first in the competition since February - provided the foundation for victory over in-form opposition.\nRomero's header represented Spurs' best opportunity before Kane drifted the ball out to Porro and then met the wing-back's cross at the far post for his 26th league goal of the season with the final action of the first half.\nThat is a tally which would have secured the Premier League's Golden Boot in each of the past four seasons, but instead leaves him nine goals behind Manchester City talisman Erling Haaland this term.\nThe goal, in which Kane demonstrated both his key role in build-up play and lethal ability inside the penalty area, served as the latest reminder of the England captain's crucial role in this Spurs side before an expected summer of intense speculation surrounding his future as he enters the final 12 months of his contract.\nAlthough Son was prevented from sealing the points by the outstretched arms of Johnstone, Mason will be pleased with the determination shown by his side to see out the closing stages as Palace were forced to leave empty-handed.\nGo straight to all the best Tottenham content\nVisit our Crystal Palace page\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 1-3 Chelsea: Late goals give Blues first win under Frank Lampard\nTwo late goals against Bournemouth finally gave Frank Lampard his first win since his return as Chelsea's interim manager.\nThe Blues had lost all four Premier League games since Lampard's return in April, but had led through Conor Gallagher's early header.\nMatias Vina levelled for Bournemouth, but Benoit Badiashile and Joao Felix struck inside the last 10 minutes.\nRelegation remains a possibility for the Cherries with three games left, while Chelsea are 11th in the table.\nBournemouth's best spell came early in the second half when Vina missed a chance for a second and Dango Ouattara headed over from close range, but Gary O'Neil's side still have a good chance of avoiding a quick return to the Championship with games against Crystal Palace, Manchester United and Everton to come.\nThey are currently nine points clear of the bottom three, although some teams still have four matches to play.\nWith Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Raheem Sterling among five players left out from the side that had lost 3-1 at Arsenal in their previous outing, Chelsea were much improved with 21-year-old Noni Madueke a particular threat on the right-hand side.\nReaction to Bournemouth v Chelsea and all Saturday's other Premier League games\nHave your say about Bournemouth\nHow did you rate Chelsea's performance?\nLampard had opted to bring in Gallagher as well as Badiashile, Trevoh Chalobah, Mykhailo Mudryk and Kai Havertz, and he said shaping a side from a large squad after a poor run has been difficult.\n\"There are a few players finding their feet,\" Lampard said.\n\"Typically at Chelsea, one or two have fed into the group and now we have more. It's understandable that as a group finding rhythm and confidence can be difficult.\n\"This is a first step, it won't be plain sailing but there is talent there and the players need to come together to get us to where we want to be.\n\"We came in off the back of a tough run, it's been a tough year and there is a lot work to do. But the performance and the result in isolation are really good, we deserved to win the game. It's a nice step forward for the lads.\"\nRelief for Lampard but more big tests await Chelsea\nChelsea's recent record made for grim reading, with defeats to Real Madrid in both legs of their Champions League quarter-final to go alongside the losses in the league and just two goals scored in those six outings under Lampard.\nBut Lampard's tweaks to the side that had gone 3-0 behind after just 34 minutes against Arsenal paid off, with Gallagher looking lively throughout after his deft, glancing header diverted N'Golo Kante's fine cross from the right in the ninth minute.\nMadueke found the side netting in the first half, as well as posing problems for Bournemouth when cutting inside from the left with some fine runs.\nBadiashile, another of Lampard's changes from midweek, also impressed in giving Chelsea a much more solid feel at the back and he thoroughly deserved his first goal since his arrival from Monaco in January with a poke from close range to Hatem Ziyech's free-kick.\nFelix finished off a cute exchange of passes with Sterling, on as a substitute in the second half, to give a comfortable-looking gloss to the scoreline.\nBut even after the relief of his first win, Lampard knows he still faces a tricky end to the season.\nChelsea face relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest next, before a daunting final trio of games against clubs currently in the positions Chelsea fans would expect to be contesting: Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United.\nCherries miss chance to secure Premier League status\nThomas Tuchel was still Chelsea's manager when Gary O'Neil replaced Scott Parker in late August in the wake of the Cherries' disastrous 9-0 loss at Liverpool, but while the German lasted only just over a week more, O'Neil has repaid the faith shown in him despite some dips in form since his appointment.\nA run of six wins in nine games prior to Chelsea's visit has lifted Bournemouth from the very foot of the table in early March to the cusp of safety, and even this defeat still leaves them nine points clear of Leicester, Leeds and Forest below them.\nAstute business in January has been key to their revival under O'Neil with Vina, on loan from AS Roma, grabbing his second goal inside a month after an excellent move that also involved the impressive Ryan Christie.\nCutting in from the left and quickly exchanging passes with Christie and Dominic Solanke, Vina then opened up his body and curled the ball high past Kepa Arrizabalaga for a brilliant equaliser.\nVina should arguably have had another in the second half, but Kepa was equal to the Uruguay international's near-post shot to his right.\nOuattara, who had also arrived in January on a permanent deal from Lorient, should have hit the target with his header from inside the six-yard area and the impressive Burkina Faso midfielder's miss proved vital when Chelsea subsequently stretched away."

They're very high, feeling the feel-good factor. But it's only another step.\n\"I said that after Arsenal, and sometimes people forget that. There's three more big steps we've got to take.\"\nEverton had also briefly jumped above Nottingham Forest too but Steve Cooper's side defeated bottom club Southampton 4-3 later on Monday.\nBrighton remain seventh, seven points behind fifth-placed Liverpool, with two games in hand.\nHow 'spellbinding' day at bottom unfolded\nGo straight to all the best Brighton content\nMore Everton news\nToffees find clinical edge in sensational fashion\nMany Everton fans travelled down to the south coast more in hope than expectation on the back of a seven-game run without a win.\nThey had also been hammered 4-1 by Brighton at Goodison in January when the Toffees' players completely fell apart. And prior to kick-off you would have had to trawl down to the eighth tier of English football to find a club with fewer league goals than Everton's 27 this season.\nHowever, they found their clinical edge in sensational fashion as their supporters joyously celebrated in the stands.\nCalvert-Lewin's turn away from Dunk set the tone in the build-up to the first goal, with the England forward delivering a fine display in only his fourth start in three months.\nThere were numerous others that excelled including Doucoure, who was out of favour before Dyche's arrival, and scored twice for the first time in the English top flight.\nAside from his two goals, the second of which involved wonderful composure, McNeil, who covered more ground than any other visiting player (12.76km) also made telling contributions when tracking back to help out his defence.\nNathan Patterson also largely nullified the threat of Kaoru Mitoma, while James Tarkowski and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford both made important interventions to keep the hosts at bay.\nPickford notably denied Republic of Ireland forward Ferguson on three occasions, brilliantly touching a header on to the post, athletically getting his fingertips to a rasping drive that clipped the crossbar on its way to safety and then saving by his left post late on.\nEverton host league leaders Manchester City next, on Sunday at 14:00 BST, which possibly makes this victory even more important.\nLacklustre Brighton pay the price\nAfter lapping up the euphoria of their late win over Manchester United on Thursday, this marked a significant setback for a Brighton side with their sights on European football next season.\nSeagulls boss De Zerbi cut a frustrated figure throughout the first half in which his normally fluent side simply imploded.\n\"We made a mistake in our mentality,\" said the Italian. \"We arrived second in every situation, especially in the first half. It was too easy. We made too many mistakes. If we want to achieve our target, we can't make these mistakes.\"\nDunk was clumsily caught the wrong side of Calvert-Lewin for the opening goal and his central defensive partner Adam Webster was at fault for the second - losing the ball high in the Everton half.\nSteele's poor positioning cost them a third goal as the ball flicked off his heel and even Everton's fourth saw McNeil afforded the freedom of the Amex Stadium, to dance past the goalkeeper and raise his arms aloft before prodding the ball over the line.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Man City 2-1 Leeds: Ilkay Gundogan scores twice to send Premier League leaders four points clear\nManchester City moved four points clear at the top of the Premier League by surviving a late scare to beat a Leeds side playing under new manager Sam Allardyce for the first time.\nTwo fine first-half goals by Ilkay Gundogan had done the damage for City, who appeared utterly dominant as they headed towards their 10th straight league win.\nGundogan's first neat finish, which came after Riyad Mahrez found him in space on the edge of the area, was into the bottom left-hand corner of Joel Robles' goal.\nHis second, again with Mahrez the provider, was identical apart from that he found the opposite corner of the net.\nCity were in full control but could not find a third goal to finish Leeds off after the break. Even Erling Haaland, for once, failed to score - his best effort came back off the post.\nTheir best chance to wrap the game up came with six minutes to go, when Pascal Struijk fouled Phil Foden inside the area and referee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot.\nRegular penalty-taker Haaland passed up the chance to take it and add to his 51-goal tally for the season, but saw Gundogan miss out on a hat-trick when he sent his effort against the post.\nThat gave Leeds hope and, only 58 seconds later, they were somehow back in the game. Manuel Akanji failed to deal with a long ball and substitute Rodrigo beat Ederson with a low finish.\nTheir noisy supporters roared them forward in search of an unlikely equaliser but City were not in the mood to let the three points slip.\nPep Guardiola's side march on, with the next step in their Treble bid coming against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Tuesday, in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.\nThey now have four Premier League games left and for the first time this season have a significant lead over second-placed Arsenal, who travel to third-placed Newcastle on Sunday.\nLeeds and Allardyce, meanwhile, only have a grim fight against relegation ahead.\nWith three games left, they remain out of the relegation zone on goal difference - but they will have to show far more attacking intent in the next few weeks if they are to avoid the drop.\n'This is business' - Guardiola unhappy with Man City penalty despite win\nSport pays coronation tribute to King Charles III\nGundogan shows his value to Man City\nGundogan's contract ends in the summer, and it is games like this that show how foolish it would be for City to allow him to leave after seven years at Etihad Stadium.\nThe 32-year-old Germany midfielder is far less flamboyant than some of his City team-mates but his knack for finding space or timing his run to make or score a goal remains an important weapon.\nHe made the difference here, even if he should probably leave the spot-kicks to Haaland in future.\nUntil the late drama that followed Gundogan's miss, this was exactly the kind of stroll that City wanted before they face Real in a tie that will define their season.\nGuardiola made seven changes from the team that beat West Ham on Wednesday, many of them with Madrid in mind, but there was no sign of any loss of rhythm.\nThe biggest concern will be an injury to left-back Nathan Ake, who was forced off in the second half and must be a doubt for Tuesday.\nLeeds have something to build on\nAllardyce's comments at his unveiling in midweek, when he claimed to be the equal of any manager in the Premier League, succeeded in taking the pressure off his players before kick-off, but he could do little more to help them once the game began.\nAs anticipated, his plan to stop City involved defending deep and in numbers. Initially it worked, but with Leeds so timid, it seemed only a matter of time before the leaders found a way through, which they duly did.\nAt 2-0, it felt like damage-limitation was Allardyce's main goal and, on that front at least, this was mission accomplished - his side did not ship chances or goals in anything like the same numbers as they have in recent weeks.\nTheir late rally was something of an unexpected and, probably, undeserved bonus. But, far from being battered, as many people expected, this was a performance to build on - and even Allardyce said \"we take some hope from it\".\n\"We now need to build on that and try to get a result,\" he added. \"I was slightly fearful, but we sorted it out for the second half.\n\"When you see Manchester City running down the clock for four minutes at the end, you know you have given yourself a chance. We did right until the end, but it didn't quite happen.\"\nHis first home game in charge will be against Newcastle on 13 May.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Martinelli also struck the bar after the break.\nArsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale also produced vital stops from Joe Willock and Fabian Schar, with Alexander Isak heading against the post, before The Gunners broke clear to wrap up the three points - Schar turning Martinelli's cross into his own net in the 71st minute.\nArsenal show their strength\nThis was a huge examination of all the improvements Arsenal have made this season as they walked into the St James' Park hothouse, with expectations high for Newcastle United as they chase Champions League football.\nThe game began in a wall of sound with Newcastle intent on overpowering Arsenal in a frantic start that had the Gunners in retreat.\nFor all the premature talk of \"chokers\" when Arsenal went four league games without a win, they showed there are new reserves of character and resilience to go with all the natural talent they possess.\nAnd no-one exemplifies it more than captain Odegaard, who continued his outstanding season with the crucial first goal, another one of those sweet strikes that have become his trademark.\nArsenal's big concern was that they might pay for their failure to take one of several gilt-edged opportunities in the first half, but they were able to close out this crucial win after Schar's own goal.\nAnd Arsenal showed they have added another side to the game with their attempts to slow the game down to break up Newcastle's rhythm and momentum.\nIt enraged the home fans and Newcastle manager Eddie Howe's assistant Jason Tindall in particular, but it is a tactic the Magpies have used themselves this season when it has suited them.\nArsenal are still second favourites as they pursue their first title since 2003/2004 but they demonstrated again they are determined to take the race all the way.\nFollow Newcastle's match with Arsenal live\nGo straight to all the best Newcastle content\nVisit our Arsenal page\nNewcastle still on course\nNewcastle United's fans could not hide their disappointment at the final whistle as all their efforts to dent Arsenal's title challenge and lift their own Champions League aspirations came to nothing.\nIt removes some of the margin for error as they chase a place in the top four, but the manner in which they ran Arsenal so close and made the margins so fine was an example of their progress this season.\nWho knows what might have happened had Murphy's shot in the opening minutes gone in instead of bouncing back off the woodwork? But in the end Arsenal had the better chances and claimed the three points.\nThe Toon Army is alive with self-belief and optimism, even cheering their side loudly after the final whistle as manager Howe took his players on a lap around the pitch.\nIsak showed what a quality acquisition he has been, but there was no joy for key midfield man Bruno Guimaraes who did not have one of his better days.\nNewcastle stay third, three points ahead of Liverpool in fifth, the good news for Howe and his players being that they remain firmly in control of their own destiny.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They're very high, feeling the feel-good factor. But it's only another step.\n\"I said that after Arsenal, and sometimes people forget that. There's three more big steps we've got to take.\"\nEverton had also briefly jumped above Nottingham Forest too but Steve Cooper's side defeated bottom club Southampton 4-3 later on Monday.\nBrighton remain seventh, seven points behind fifth-placed Liverpool, with two games in hand.\nHow 'spellbinding' day at bottom unfolded\nGo straight to all the best Brighton content\nMore Everton news\nToffees find clinical edge in sensational fashion\nMany Everton fans travelled down to the south coast more in hope than expectation on the back of a seven-game run without a win.\nThey had also been hammered 4-1 by Brighton at Goodison in January when the Toffees' players completely fell apart. And prior to kick-off you would have had to trawl down to the eighth tier of English football to find a club with fewer league goals than Everton's 27 this season.\nHowever, they found their clinical edge in sensational fashion as their supporters joyously celebrated in the stands.\nCalvert-Lewin's turn away from Dunk set the tone in the build-up to the first goal, with the England forward delivering a fine display in only his fourth start in three months.\nThere were numerous others that excelled including Doucoure, who was out of favour before Dyche's arrival, and scored twice for the first time in the English top flight.\nAside from his two goals, the second of which involved wonderful composure, McNeil, who covered more ground than any other visiting player (12.76km) also made telling contributions when tracking back to help out his defence.\nNathan Patterson also largely nullified the threat of Kaoru Mitoma, while James Tarkowski and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford both made important interventions to keep the hosts at bay.\nPickford notably denied Republic of Ireland forward Ferguson on three occasions, brilliantly touching a header on to the post, athletically getting his fingertips to a rasping drive that clipped the crossbar on its way to safety and then saving by his left post late on.\nEverton host league leaders Manchester City next, on Sunday at 14:00 BST, which possibly makes this victory even more important.\nLacklustre Brighton pay the price\nAfter lapping up the euphoria of their late win over Manchester United on Thursday, this marked a significant setback for a Brighton side with their sights on European football next season.\nSeagulls boss De Zerbi cut a frustrated figure throughout the first half in which his normally fluent side simply imploded.\n\"We made a mistake in our mentality,\" said the Italian. \"We arrived second in every situation, especially in the first half. It was too easy. We made too many mistakes. If we want to achieve our target, we can't make these mistakes.\"\nDunk was clumsily caught the wrong side of Calvert-Lewin for the opening goal and his central defensive partner Adam Webster was at fault for the second - losing the ball high in the Everton half.\nSteele's poor positioning cost them a third goal as the ball flicked off his heel and even Everton's fourth saw McNeil afforded the freedom of the Amex Stadium, to dance past the goalkeeper and raise his arms aloft before prodding the ball over the line.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

This was a big game for us and we were not at it,\" Maddison told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We didn't start the game well enough. We need to do the basics well.\"\nFulham opened the scoring through a Willian free-kick before strikes from Carlos Vinicius and Tom Cairney powered them into a 3-0 half-time lead.\nCairney added another after the restart before Harvey Barnes pulled a goal back for the visitors, who then saw Jamie Vardy miss a penalty in the 66th minute.\nWillian re-established Fulham's four-goal lead with another fine strike before Maddison netted Leicester's second with a spot-kick and Barnes scored a late third.\n\"We were not hungry enough to want to win the game,\" said Maddison.\n\"It is tough. No easy game in the Premier League - it is a cliche but so true. We will keep fighting. We will keep trying to put it right.\"\nMaddison later sought to clarify his post-match comments on social media, saying: \"When I say not hungry enough I mean aggressive and on the front foot in duels, not us wanting to win or realising the importance.\n\"We were not good enough today and we've only got ourselves to blame and apologise for that.

We have been fairly resolute in the five games we've had with the exception of Everton.\"\nThe Foxes fell behind in the 10th minute when keeper Daniel Iversen misjudged Willian's wide free-kick and the ball bounced underneath him before nestling in the bottom corner.\nVinicius' goal finished off a fine counter-attacking move before Cairney scored on just his third league start of the season with an impressive curling finish.\nTrailing by three goals at the break, Leicester were booed off by the visiting fans and the mood only got bleaker when Cairney added Fulham's fourth in the 51st minute.\nHowever, Barnes gave his side a glimmer of hope, before Vardy was caught by Bernd Leno midway through the second half - but when the striker missed the resulting spot-kick, any thoughts of an unlikely comeback ended.\nFulham soon added a fifth against a porous defence, with Leicester having now failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their past 20 games, an unwanted Premier League record.\nThere were ironic jeers when Maddison found the bottom corner from the spot in the 81st minute after he had been caught by Joao Palhinha in the box.\nBarnes' 89th-minute strike made the scoreline look more respectable, but in truth the Foxes never looked like securing anything from the match.\nSuperb Fulham equal club record\nInspired by their impressive first-half showing, Fulham have equalled a club record of 14 wins in a single Premier League season.\n\"We clearly deserved the three points and it should have been much more comfortable,\" Fulham boss Marco Silva told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Great team performance. Great moments of football, great goals. The way we played from the first minute was really good.\"\nThere was a party atmosphere at a sun-kissed Craven Cottage as Silva's side bounced back from narrow defeats by Aston Villa, Manchester City and Liverpool.\nThe Cottagers completed a top-flight double over Leicester for the first time since 2004, thanks mainly to the excellent attacking work of Willian and Cairney.\nFulham remain 10th, two points behind west London rivals Brentford.\nThey need five points from their final three games to equal their record top-flight points tally of 53, from the 2008-09 season.\nFulham face Southampton away in their next match on Saturday before taking on Crystal Palace and Manchester United, while Leicester host Liverpool next Monday.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

They were eight points clear of City at the top after 18 games but their pursuit is running out of steam after a highly damaging defeat at the business end of the season.\nManchester City's comfortable win at Everton earlier on Sunday opened up a four-point gap at the top but this time Arsenal were unable to respond to the pressure heaped on them by Pep Guardiola's Treble-chasing team.\nThere was still almost 40 minutes left when Enciso opened the scoring and Arteta sent on Eddie Nketiah and Emile Smith Rowe to try and salvage a point.\nBut the Arsenal boss, who was shown a yellow card by referee Andy Madley, saw his side concede two further goals while the home side failed to score for the first time since 4 February on their way to a comprehensive defeat.\n\"We knew the challenge we had, it was very different to the one we had at Newcastle,\" Arteta told Match of the Day, referencing a 2-0 win.\n\"I was stood here and very proud of what we did last week but today we have to apologise to our people.

We were completely dominant in all aspects. We should have scored at least two more goals.\n\"It is very promising to see that performance without Ivan Toney.\"\nMoyes gambles and West Ham fall flat\nBefore kick-off, Moyes said his selection was made with \"one eye on Thursday\" but added \"it is about picking up points\".\nHis side never looked like picking up anything from this game.\nThey were sloppy in possession and showed a lack of energy, certainly until they went two goals behind.\nIngs saw an effort saved moments the Hammers went two down, and they may well bemoan the decision to disallow his goal, with the ball hitting Divin Mubama's hand after Benrahma's cross hit the post.\nIt has been a frustrating campaign for West Ham but with another season of Premier League football practically guaranteed and a first major trophy in 43 years still available, it could turn into a successful one.\nThey may have to do both without Michail Antonio, who was absent with a calf injury, with Moyes saying \"he couldn't say much more than that\".\nTalking to BBC Match of the Day, Moyes said: \"We weren't at our best. The first goal took the wind out of us. We've only got ourselves to blame.\n\"The players are goosed at the moment. I wanted to give some other players an opportunity to show and the players a chance to rest. It was always going to be needed at some stage along the line.\"\nMoyes added he was \"incredibly surprised\" Ings' goal was ruled out, adding: \"It is certainly not deliberate handball. I thought it hit his shoulder and I don't think it is conclusive that it was handball.\n\"We've had some ridiculously bad decisions in recent games.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Under him I do my best to positively affect the games.\"\nThere was little riding on this match between sides 12th and 14th, safe from Premier League relegation.\nHowever, that did not stop Eze showing again why, when fully fit, he is one of the division's brightest midfielders.\n\"Ebs is quality,\" Palace defender Joel Ward said. \"It's incredible what he does on the ball - the way he glides over the pitch is mesmerising.\n\"He's taking over control of midfield too, and linking up well with the front guys. His future will be very bright.\"\nVictory ensured Palace completed the league double over Bournemouth, having won 2-0 at Vitality Stadium on 31 December.\nThat proved to be their final win under Vieira, who was dismissed after they failed to win any of their subsequent 12 top-flight matches.\nIt was a run which threatened the Eagles' Premier League status, however their descent was halted by the appointment of Hodgson and five wins from their past eight games.\nThe question is now whether the 75-year-old, contracted to the end of the season, will extend his second spell at Selhurst Park.\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\nVisit our Bournemouth page\nEze shines again for Palace without threat of drop\nA few weeks ago this game could have been earmarked as a relegation six-pointer. Instead, it was a low-stakes end-of-season meeting between two sides with their top-flight status secure.\nJoachim Andersen however appeared unaware Palace have little left to fight for, as he evaded a first-half red card following a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) check after catching Jefferson Lerma in the face.\n\"Andersen punched Lerma in the face - Jefferson has a broken nose,\" Bournemouth manager Gary O'Neil told Match of the Day.\n\"It's difficult on the pitch to see that, but I have no idea how VAR can give it as check complete.\"\nPalace roused themselves earlier, the quick and skilful wing play of Olise and Wilfried Zaha providing Bournemouth with plenty of problems, before Eze opened the scoring four minutes before the break.\nZaha spun inside, found Andre Ayew who teed up Eze six yards out for the midfielder to slam past Neto.\nThe second goal was even better. Olise earned his 10th Premier League assist of the season - a new record for a Palace player - as he played a lovely ball to Eze on the left who controlled, cut inside and thumped into the top-right corner.\n\"They make my life easier - I give them the ball and they do their magic,\" Ward said of Palace's attackers. \"The world is Michael's oyster, he is going to set the bar so high and go on to special things.\"\nWard was also full of praise for Hodgson as the inspiration for Palace's good form. \"One of the things is familiarity, the message he brings is clarity to players on the pitch, and freedom to the lads to express themselves which we keep it solid at the back,\" he said.\n\"With Ebs, Michael, Wilf up front, we can hurt teams.\"\nFinal bow for Zaha amid injury fears?\nA worry from this game for Palace is that Zaha could have played his final match for the club after being forced off in the second half with what looked like a hamstring injury.\nThe Ivorian winger's contract expires this summer, and the Selhurst Park crowd gave him an ovation as he left the pitch, in case this was Zaha's 457th and final Palace appearance.\n\"Zaha felt his hamstring which is worrying, but we won't know how serious [it is] until he has the scan,\" Hodgson told Match of the Day. \"Hopefully it will only take a few days rather than a couple of weeks.\"\nBournemouth meanwhile have conceded 69 Premier League goals in 2022-23, just one short of their highest figure in 2018-19.\nO'Neil has ensured Bournemouth survive this season in relative comfort, but has plenty of work ahead to solve their defensive issues and admitted his team were second best here.\n\"We were well beaten by the better side today. If we are not at our level this happens to you in Premier League games,\" he told Match of the Day. \"We dropped levels all over the pitch - it was a really disappointing afternoon.\"\nCertainly he will be glad to see the back of Palace for some time - this was Bournemouth's fifth consecutive Premier League defeat against the Eagles.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The former Bristol City shotstopper, who joined the club in January, looked assured on his Wolves and Premier League debut, and made two good saves in the second half to deny Jadon Sancho and Antony.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Under him I do my best to positively affect the games.\"\nThere was little riding on this match between sides 12th and 14th, safe from Premier League relegation.\nHowever, that did not stop Eze showing again why, when fully fit, he is one of the division's brightest midfielders.\n\"Ebs is quality,\" Palace defender Joel Ward said. \"It's incredible what he does on the ball - the way he glides over the pitch is mesmerising.\n\"He's taking over control of midfield too, and linking up well with the front guys. His future will be very bright.\"\nVictory ensured Palace completed the league double over Bournemouth, having won 2-0 at Vitality Stadium on 31 December.\nThat proved to be their final win under Vieira, who was dismissed after they failed to win any of their subsequent 12 top-flight matches.\nIt was a run which threatened the Eagles' Premier League status, however their descent was halted by the appointment of Hodgson and five wins from their past eight games.\nThe question is now whether the 75-year-old, contracted to the end of the season, will extend his second spell at Selhurst Park.\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\nVisit our Bournemouth page\nEze shines again for Palace without threat of drop\nA few weeks ago this game could have been earmarked as a relegation six-pointer. Instead, it was a low-stakes end-of-season meeting between two sides with their top-flight status secure.\nJoachim Andersen however appeared unaware Palace have little left to fight for, as he evaded a first-half red card following a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) check after catching Jefferson Lerma in the face.\n\"Andersen punched Lerma in the face - Jefferson has a broken nose,\" Bournemouth manager Gary O'Neil told Match of the Day.\n\"It's difficult on the pitch to see that, but I have no idea how VAR can give it as check complete.\"\nPalace roused themselves earlier, the quick and skilful wing play of Olise and Wilfried Zaha providing Bournemouth with plenty of problems, before Eze opened the scoring four minutes before the break.\nZaha spun inside, found Andre Ayew who teed up Eze six yards out for the midfielder to slam past Neto.\nThe second goal was even better. Olise earned his 10th Premier League assist of the season - a new record for a Palace player - as he played a lovely ball to Eze on the left who controlled, cut inside and thumped into the top-right corner.\n\"They make my life easier - I give them the ball and they do their magic,\" Ward said of Palace's attackers. \"The world is Michael's oyster, he is going to set the bar so high and go on to special things.\"\nWard was also full of praise for Hodgson as the inspiration for Palace's good form. \"One of the things is familiarity, the message he brings is clarity to players on the pitch, and freedom to the lads to express themselves which we keep it solid at the back,\" he said.\n\"With Ebs, Michael, Wilf up front, we can hurt teams.\"\nFinal bow for Zaha amid injury fears?\nA worry from this game for Palace is that Zaha could have played his final match for the club after being forced off in the second half with what looked like a hamstring injury.\nThe Ivorian winger's contract expires this summer, and the Selhurst Park crowd gave him an ovation as he left the pitch, in case this was Zaha's 457th and final Palace appearance.\n\"Zaha felt his hamstring which is worrying, but we won't know how serious [it is] until he has the scan,\" Hodgson told Match of the Day. \"Hopefully it will only take a few days rather than a couple of weeks.\"\nBournemouth meanwhile have conceded 69 Premier League goals in 2022-23, just one short of their highest figure in 2018-19.\nO'Neil has ensured Bournemouth survive this season in relative comfort, but has plenty of work ahead to solve their defensive issues and admitted his team were second best here.\n\"We were well beaten by the better side today. If we are not at our level this happens to you in Premier League games,\" he told Match of the Day. \"We dropped levels all over the pitch - it was a really disappointing afternoon.\"\nCertainly he will be glad to see the back of Palace for some time - this was Bournemouth's fifth consecutive Premier League defeat against the Eagles.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nMan Utd moving closer to Champions League return\nAfter beating Aston Villa in their last game at Old Trafford, Manchester United's place in the top four at the end of the season looked a formality as they were seven points above fifth-placed Liverpool with a game in hand.\nBut the Red Devils have been much less effective on the road than at home this season and the losses to Brighton and West Ham before Saturday's game opened the door for Jurgen Klopp's side to try to sneak in.\nRegardless, Manchester United knew three wins from their final four games would seal a top-four spot and against a Wolves side who had recently secured Premier League safety, this will have been a game they would have felt confident of winning.\nOddly, the hosts played much of the game lacking the urgency of a side who still had plenty to play for and while they dominated play and created chances, they did not often work Bentley in the Wolves goal.\nAntony, in particular, was wasteful with several chances and often chose to shoot when a team-mate was better placed, although crucially did make the right choice for the opener when he set up Martial for a simple finish.\nWhile it took until the 94th minute for the hosts to get a second, the scoreline was far more reflective of Manchester United's dominance as they put the pressure back on Liverpool in the race for the top four.\nGo straight to all the best Manchester United content\nVisit our Wolves page\nBentley impresses for already-safe Wolves\nWolves were bottom of the Premier League on Christmas Day, so it is testament to Julen Lopetegui's ability that he had guided them to safety with three games remaining.\nConsequently, they spent much of this game playing every bit like a side with nothing to play for as David de Gea finished the game without making a meaningful save.\nBut the big positive for the visitors was the performance of Bentley in their goal. The former Bristol City shotstopper, who joined the club in January, looked assured on his Wolves and Premier League debut, and made two good saves in the second half to deny Jadon Sancho and Antony.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

We need two more victories to be champions. Step by step recovery,\" said Guardiola.\nCity's slick operators had not managed to create a chance until captain Gundogan, on his 300th appearance for the club, controlled a pass from Riyad Mahrez and hooked in a delightful finish with his back to goal, as well as converting a stunning free-kick.\nIn between, striker Haaland had only touched the ball twice before nodding in his 52nd goal of an astonishing campaign, as he continues to chase down Everton great Dixie Dean's record of 63 in a single campaign.\nA spectacular scissor kick went awry in the second half, but the damage had long been done and the Norwegian has potentially six games remaining to break Dean's record, which has remained untouched for 96 years.\nCalvert-Lewin concerns?\nEverton's stunning 5-1 victory at Brighton on Monday took Sean Dyche's side out of the drop zone and raised optimism for another season in the top flight.\nBut they may fall back down on Monday evening should 19th-placed Leicester manage to spring a surprise victory on top-four-chasing Liverpool.\nThe Toffees faithful face a nervous end to another miserable campaign, with games remaining against Wolves at Molineux next Saturday before rounding off the season at Goodison Park against Bournemouth.\nThe defeat by City marks Everton's 10th Premier League loss at home, setting a new club record, while they have netted just 15 times on their own turf, the fewest in the league.\nAnother major concern will be the half-time withdrawal of striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who impressed in the opening 45 minutes but was replaced by Neal Maupay - a striker with one goal to his past 39 appearances.\nDyche said afterwards Calvert-Lewin had been taken off at the break after complaining of a tight groin muscle.\nThe Toffees boss added: \"There were some good performances today but City find that way. You'd be amazed if they don't win the league.

When they score two quick goals you feel bad, but we believed in ourselves and got the point,\" said the 25-year-old.\n\"We now have two finals to go, the next one is Arsenal and from there we will see what happens.\"\nForest, who had taken just six away points from a possible 51 this season before the Chelsea game, face the title-chasing Gunners at home next Saturday before travelling to Crystal Palace on the final day.\nThe draw leaves Chelsea, now winless in seven home games in all competitions, in 11th and with the prospect of playing three of the top four within a week - Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United - to end their miserable season.\nRe-live coverage of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content\nVisit our Nottingham Forest page\nChelsea must find right blend\nChelsea's season has had little riding on it for more than a month now, since the awful run of results during the end of Graham Potter's reign and the beginning of Lampard's caretaker tenure.\nA mid-table position for a squad that has had multi-million pound investment in the past two transfer windows is massive under-achievement by any measure.\nThe draw against Forest was symptomatic of a chaotic season characterised by disjointed performances from a collection of highly priced players yet to be moulded into a winning blend.\nBut while few of the \u00a3550m worth of signings made under the Todd Boehly regime have yet proved an unqualified success, the Blues have unquestionably acquired a squad of serious talent with significant potential.\nThe influx of players has meant that in a first season to forget under new ownership, the Blues have given starts to 31 players in the top flight, the most of any club, and have made a league-high 128 changes to their starting line-up.\nYet more recruits might therefore seem like unwise further excess, but despite their outlay, the squad still has weaknesses.\nA true defensive midfielder to partner Argentina conductor Enzo Fernandez would provide much-needed balance while a goalkeeper who imbues the defence with confidence rather than uncertainty would add stability at the back that was notably missing whenever Forest crossed the ball.\nThe need for a goalscorer - Chelsea have scored only 36 times in the league this season - to add incisiveness was again demonstrated against Forest, as Lampard pointedly noted.\n\"We were too slow in the first half at the top end. Too sideways and safe. That's intrinsic in us - a lot of passes but not passes to break lines and threaten,\" he said.\n\"We need players who are willing and hungry to get in the box. Tactics are irrelevant if you don't do it with pace. The difference with forward passes and forward runs was there to see.\n\"It doesn't count for much if you are not clinical.

They were eight points clear of City at the top after 18 games but their pursuit is running out of steam after a highly damaging defeat at the business end of the season.\nManchester City's comfortable win at Everton earlier on Sunday opened up a four-point gap at the top but this time Arsenal were unable to respond to the pressure heaped on them by Pep Guardiola's Treble-chasing team.\nThere was still almost 40 minutes left when Enciso opened the scoring and Arteta sent on Eddie Nketiah and Emile Smith Rowe to try and salvage a point.\nBut the Arsenal boss, who was shown a yellow card by referee Andy Madley, saw his side concede two further goals while the home side failed to score for the first time since 4 February on their way to a comprehensive defeat.\n\"We knew the challenge we had, it was very different to the one we had at Newcastle,\" Arteta told Match of the Day, referencing a 2-0 win.\n\"I was stood here and very proud of what we did last week but today we have to apologise to our people. We have to move on very quickly and not keep that feeling for a long time.\"\nBrighton's incredible season far from over\nThis was another statement win in what looks like being a history-defining season for Brighton, who bounced back from a crushing 5-1 home defeat by Everton to produce one of their best performances of the season.\nThey were at their clinical best as Arsenal were beaten at the Emirates for only the second time in the league.\nRoberto De Zerbi has called on his players to \"write club history\" by qualifying for Europe for the first time.\n\"It's not enough to qualify for the Europa League,\" said De Zerbi. \"We have four games and they're all tough games. We have 58 points and that's not enough. We have to win other games and the first game will be in Newcastle [on Thursday].\n\"I enjoy working with the players. I am very lucky to be their coach and I am happy they enjoy working with me.\n\"That's a great satisfaction for me, but I prefer to speak about everything at the end of the season because we want to achieve something historic for the fans and for the club.\"\nTwo wins from the last four games - Newcastle (away), Southampton (home), Manchester City (home), Aston Villa (away) - will be enough to see the Seagulls confirm their place in next season's Europa League.\nAgainst Arsenal, Brighton were at their attacking best, registering six chances on target and scoring from half of them.\n\"The manager showed us a Michael Jordan video, to show us how he motivated himself for each game,\" goalscorer Undav told Sky Sports.\n\"It was the right choice to show us the video and we showed today how mentally strong we are.\"\nAs Arsenal's players looked desolate at the final whistle, Brighton's triumphantly marched over to where their travelling fans were gathered to show their appreciation.\nThis incredible season for the Seagulls, which has included an FA Cup semi-final and league doubles over Manchester United and Chelsea, is far from over.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We were completely dominant in all aspects. We should have scored at least two more goals.\n\"It is very promising to see that performance without Ivan Toney.\"\nMoyes gambles and West Ham fall flat\nBefore kick-off, Moyes said his selection was made with \"one eye on Thursday\" but added \"it is about picking up points\".\nHis side never looked like picking up anything from this game.\nThey were sloppy in possession and showed a lack of energy, certainly until they went two goals behind.\nIngs saw an effort saved moments the Hammers went two down, and they may well bemoan the decision to disallow his goal, with the ball hitting Divin Mubama's hand after Benrahma's cross hit the post.\nIt has been a frustrating campaign for West Ham but with another season of Premier League football practically guaranteed and a first major trophy in 43 years still available, it could turn into a successful one.\nThey may have to do both without Michail Antonio, who was absent with a calf injury, with Moyes saying \"he couldn't say much more than that\".\nTalking to BBC Match of the Day, Moyes said: \"We weren't at our best. The first goal took the wind out of us. We've only got ourselves to blame.\n\"The players are goosed at the moment. I wanted to give some other players an opportunity to show and the players a chance to rest. It was always going to be needed at some stage along the line.\"\nMoyes added he was \"incredibly surprised\" Ings' goal was ruled out, adding: \"It is certainly not deliberate handball.

Send us your views here\nWill Leeds regret spot-kick woe?\nLeeds United's supporters showed appreciation for their side's efforts as they took loud acclaim at the final whistle following a game that was desperately low on quality but high on tension.\nSam Allardyce has stated his aim to get to the final game of the season at home to Tottenham with a chance of survival and the point earned by Kristensen's leveller keeps them on track for that.\nLeeds, however, will surely look back at Bamford's poor first-half penalty as a pivotal moment when they might have put themselves on the way to three points rather eventually happily settling for one.\nThey were one up and exerting a measure of domination on a Newcastle side who were struggling to settle inside a fevered Elland Road when Joelinton's clumsy tackle on Firpo was rightly penalised.\nBamford, guilty of an awful injury-time miss in the recent home draw against Leicester City, never looked confident and keeper Nick Pope was able to make a comfortable save.\nThere was a collective groan around Elland Road when Maximilian Wober's equally poor challenge on Alexander Isak gave Callum Wilson the chance to equalise, the striker then leaving Leeds looking at a potentially decisive loss when he added a second from the spot.\nWith Newcastle seemingly cruising, Leeds showed the character and resilience they will need to survive to equalise - and the reaction at the final whistle suggests that they felt this was one point gained rather than two lost.\nOnly time will tell, however, just how important than Bamford miss was.\nDisappointing Newcastle miss chance\nNewcastle United must have thought they were on course to take full advantage of the reprieve offered up by Bamford's penalty failure when Wilson put them ahead in the second half despite an indifferent team performance.\nHowe's side were nowhere near their best and paid for a below-par effort when Kristensen's shot took a big deflection off Trippier to leave keeper Nick Pope flat-footed and give Leeds a point.\nIt is a result that edged Newcastle close to their target of a top-four finish and Champions League qualification - but this was a flat display.\nLeeds looked there for the taking when Newcastle went ahead, and that was reflected in the atmosphere - the sound and fury of the home support in the early stages quietened down, almost in an acceptance of their fate.\nNewcastle, though, lacked spark and failed to finish Leeds off, leaving the door open as victory slipped away.\nThey now have two home games, against Brighton and troubled Leicester City, to try to clinch a place in next season's Champions League.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We will enjoy tonight but we are focused on our next match,\" said Howe, who has been reluctant to discuss his side's top-four chances.\n\"We were just pleased with the performance, to beat a side of their quality. We are not looking too far ahead.\n\"When it's done, I'll talk about it for fun if you want.\"\nNewcastle news and fan views in one place\nSign up for Newcastle notifications\nNewcastle took the lead when Brighton forward Deniz Undav flicked Kieran Trippier's corner into his own net, before the Magpies skipper picked out Dan Burn from a free-kick to head in the second.\nMiguel Almiron was denied a third for Newcastle at the start of the second half by Brighton keeper Jason Steele's smart stop and, just 45 seconds later, Undav slotted in at the right end to give the visitors hope.\nSuddenly, after being in complete control for 50 minutes, Newcastle had to dig in.\nBut the home team managed the game professionally and eased any lingering tension through Callum Wilson's composed late finish.\nThe mood turned even more celebratory when Bruno Guimaraes emphatically converted Wilson's pass in injury time.\nThe win puts Newcastle on the cusp of a return to the Champions League for the first time since they were knocked out at the qualifying stage in 2003-04.\nEddie Howe's side, who consolidated third position in the table, know one win in their final two games will secure a top-four finish.\nThe Magpies are three points clear of fourth-placed Manchester United, who have played a game fewer, and four ahead of fifth-placed Liverpool, who also have two games left.\nBrighton remain sixth and qualifying for the Europa League - which would be their first taste of European competition - remains in their own hands with three matches left.\nNewcastle on verge of getting Champions League party started\nWhile the Saudi-backed consortium which bought Newcastle in late 2021 brought optimism and excitement about the club's future, few expected a team in a relegation battle at the time of the takeover to be contending for Champions League qualification this season.\nHowe said before Brighton's visit that he would have \"snapped the hand off\" someone offering him the prospect of a top-four finish at the start of the season.\nWhat was then a fanciful thought is now so close to becoming a reality.\nNewcastle's rapid improvement has been down to Howe's management and astute signings, with strong home form providing the bedrock of their success.\nThe Magpies had only lost two league games at St James' Park this season before Thursday's crucial fixture, and knew victory against the Seagulls and another home win against Leicester on Monday would seal their place among Europe's elite next season.\nHowe's team started positively, playing with energy and purpose, and fully deserved their 2-0 half-time lead.\nThe atmosphere among the home fans turned slightly tenser when Brighton halved the deficit, but the noise increased to thunderous levels again after the two late goals removed any lingering doubts.\nParty time had arrived. The beaming smiles from the faces in the stands, matched by those on the Newcastle players at the full-time, was an indication the city is confident of welcoming Europe's elite again next season.\nUncharacteristically sloppy Brighton still have Europe in sight\nLike Newcastle, Brighton have also enjoyed a spectacular season which has seen them exceed fans' expectations as they challenge for European qualification.\nFears of the Seagulls' progress stalling when head coach Graham Potter left for Chelsea in September have proven unfounded.\nRoberto de Zerbi has built on the platform created by his predecessor, instilling a vibrant attacking style which has taken Brighton to the brink of the highest top-flight finish in their 121-year history.\nVictory at Newcastle would have ensured they would finish higher than last season's ninth place, but achieving that notable landmark remains on hold after a poor first half proved costly.\nUncharacteristic sloppiness when playing out from the back invited Newcastle pressure and, although De Zerbi's side improved after the break, they never seriously threatened an equaliser.\nBrighton were without some key players through injury, and rested others including Argentina midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, in what was their seventh match in 26 days.\n\"We are not in the best condition to play so many games in a row. I think we deserved to lose the game,\" said De Zerbi, whose team play their final three games in the space of seven days.\nDespite this defeat, Brighton know they remain well placed to secure European qualification.\nA home game against already-relegated Southampton on Sunday offers an opportunity to move closer to achieving that goal.\n\"It was a tough night and the first half killed us,\" said Brighton skipper Lewis Dunk.\n\"We've got three games left and we've got to move on.

When they score two quick goals you feel bad, but we believed in ourselves and got the point,\" said the 25-year-old.\n\"We now have two finals to go, the next one is Arsenal and from there we will see what happens.\"\nForest, who had taken just six away points from a possible 51 this season before the Chelsea game, face the title-chasing Gunners at home next Saturday before travelling to Crystal Palace on the final day.\nThe draw leaves Chelsea, now winless in seven home games in all competitions, in 11th and with the prospect of playing three of the top four within a week - Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United - to end their miserable season.\nRe-live coverage of Saturday's Premier League games\nGo straight to all the best Chelsea content\nVisit our Nottingham Forest page\nChelsea must find right blend\nChelsea's season has had little riding on it for more than a month now, since the awful run of results during the end of Graham Potter's reign and the beginning of Lampard's caretaker tenure.\nA mid-table position for a squad that has had multi-million pound investment in the past two transfer windows is massive under-achievement by any measure.\nThe draw against Forest was symptomatic of a chaotic season characterised by disjointed performances from a collection of highly priced players yet to be moulded into a winning blend.\nBut while few of the \u00a3550m worth of signings made under the Todd Boehly regime have yet proved an unqualified success, the Blues have unquestionably acquired a squad of serious talent with significant potential.\nThe influx of players has meant that in a first season to forget under new ownership, the Blues have given starts to 31 players in the top flight, the most of any club, and have made a league-high 128 changes to their starting line-up.\nYet more recruits might therefore seem like unwise further excess, but despite their outlay, the squad still has weaknesses.\nA true defensive midfielder to partner Argentina conductor Enzo Fernandez would provide much-needed balance while a goalkeeper who imbues the defence with confidence rather than uncertainty would add stability at the back that was notably missing whenever Forest crossed the ball.\nThe need for a goalscorer - Chelsea have scored only 36 times in the league this season - to add incisiveness was again demonstrated against Forest, as Lampard pointedly noted.\n\"We were too slow in the first half at the top end. Too sideways and safe. That's intrinsic in us - a lot of passes but not passes to break lines and threaten,\" he said.\n\"We need players who are willing and hungry to get in the box. Tactics are irrelevant if you don't do it with pace. The difference with forward passes and forward runs was there to see.\n\"It doesn't count for much if you are not clinical. Raheem was clinical, some players are developing that a bit.\"\nThe return of Romelu Lukaku from his loan at Inter Milan may save Chelsea's new manager another newcomer to integrate.\nThe identity of that new boss has yet to be confirmed, although former Tottenham Hotspur head coach Mauricio Pochettino has been heavily linked with the position.\nWhat is clear is that the appointment must have the charisma and nous to manage such a large number of superstar players while striking the right alchemy between them.\nLoyalty to Cooper close to reaping reward\nThe wisdom of Forest's decision to stick with Cooper when all around them at the bottom were changing managers - sometimes more than once - will be determined with the outcome of their final two fixtures.\nBefore the Chelsea game, they had won two of their past three matches - but that was after going 11 without a victory, a period when the Forest board must have been tempted to make a change as all four clubs below them had.\nCooper has found a golden touch at just the right time. Forest have been lamentable in London this season, losing all five previous league visits to the capital by a 16-2 aggregate.\nBut he turned that form around by frustrating Chelsea, helped by a change in personnel and formation; defender Joe Worrall was recalled in place of forward Brennan Johnson and they switched to a back five.\nHis reward was defensive resolve combined with an ability - especially through the aerial prowess of Awoniyi - to capitalise on the weak points of the hosts.\nOne more victory, or even two draws, might be enough to preserve their top-flight status and reward the Forest board for sticking with their man.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

We will enjoy tonight but we are focused on our next match,\" said Howe, who has been reluctant to discuss his side's top-four chances.\n\"We were just pleased with the performance, to beat a side of their quality. We are not looking too far ahead.\n\"When it's done, I'll talk about it for fun if you want.\"\nNewcastle news and fan views in one place\nSign up for Newcastle notifications\nNewcastle took the lead when Brighton forward Deniz Undav flicked Kieran Trippier's corner into his own net, before the Magpies skipper picked out Dan Burn from a free-kick to head in the second.\nMiguel Almiron was denied a third for Newcastle at the start of the second half by Brighton keeper Jason Steele's smart stop and, just 45 seconds later, Undav slotted in at the right end to give the visitors hope.\nSuddenly, after being in complete control for 50 minutes, Newcastle had to dig in.\nBut the home team managed the game professionally and eased any lingering tension through Callum Wilson's composed late finish.\nThe mood turned even more celebratory when Bruno Guimaraes emphatically converted Wilson's pass in injury time.\nThe win puts Newcastle on the cusp of a return to the Champions League for the first time since they were knocked out at the qualifying stage in 2003-04.\nEddie Howe's side, who consolidated third position in the table, know one win in their final two games will secure a top-four finish.\nThe Magpies are three points clear of fourth-placed Manchester United, who have played a game fewer, and four ahead of fifth-placed Liverpool, who also have two games left.\nBrighton remain sixth and qualifying for the Europa League - which would be their first taste of European competition - remains in their own hands with three matches left.\nNewcastle on verge of getting Champions League party started\nWhile the Saudi-backed consortium which bought Newcastle in late 2021 brought optimism and excitement about the club's future, few expected a team in a relegation battle at the time of the takeover to be contending for Champions League qualification this season.\nHowe said before Brighton's visit that he would have \"snapped the hand off\" someone offering him the prospect of a top-four finish at the start of the season.\nWhat was then a fanciful thought is now so close to becoming a reality.\nNewcastle's rapid improvement has been down to Howe's management and astute signings, with strong home form providing the bedrock of their success.\nThe Magpies had only lost two league games at St James' Park this season before Thursday's crucial fixture, and knew victory against the Seagulls and another home win against Leicester on Monday would seal their place among Europe's elite next season.\nHowe's team started positively, playing with energy and purpose, and fully deserved their 2-0 half-time lead.\nThe atmosphere among the home fans turned slightly tenser when Brighton halved the deficit, but the noise increased to thunderous levels again after the two late goals removed any lingering doubts.\nParty time had arrived. The beaming smiles from the faces in the stands, matched by those on the Newcastle players at the full-time, was an indication the city is confident of welcoming Europe's elite again next season.\nUncharacteristically sloppy Brighton still have Europe in sight\nLike Newcastle, Brighton have also enjoyed a spectacular season which has seen them exceed fans' expectations as they challenge for European qualification.\nFears of the Seagulls' progress stalling when head coach Graham Potter left for Chelsea in September have proven unfounded.\nRoberto de Zerbi has built on the platform created by his predecessor, instilling a vibrant attacking style which has taken Brighton to the brink of the highest top-flight finish in their 121-year history.\nVictory at Newcastle would have ensured they would finish higher than last season's ninth place, but achieving that notable landmark remains on hold after a poor first half proved costly.\nUncharacteristic sloppiness when playing out from the back invited Newcastle pressure and, although De Zerbi's side improved after the break, they never seriously threatened an equaliser.\nBrighton were without some key players through injury, and rested others including Argentina midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, in what was their seventh match in 26 days.\n\"We are not in the best condition to play so many games in a row. I think we deserved to lose the game,\" said De Zerbi, whose team play their final three games in the space of seven days.\nDespite this defeat, Brighton know they remain well placed to secure European qualification.\nA home game against already-relegated Southampton on Sunday offers an opportunity to move closer to achieving that goal.\n\"It was a tough night and the first half killed us,\" said Brighton skipper Lewis Dunk.\n\"We've got three games left and we've got to move on.

It is not easy scoring goals,\" Ten Hag told BBC Sport.\n\"It was a great goal from Casemiro. We pinned them back, didn't let them breathe in the first 25 minutes.\n\"I don't care what happens in Liverpool, it's about us. We have to do the job.\"\nStay up to date with all things Manchester United\nCherries safe but defensive improvements needed\nMany pundits and fans had written Bournemouth off before the start of the season, tipping them to return straight back to the Championship.\nBut manager Gary O'Neil has done a fine job, meaning a relatively flat match at the Vitality did not matter as he has already seen his side move well clear of the relegation battle.\nBournemouth sit 14th in the league and face relegation-threatened Everton in their last game of the season at Goodison Park.\nThe Cherries have, however, conceded 70 Premier League goals in 2022-23, equalling their highest-ever figure from 2018-19 and O'Neil will have to solve those defensive frailties to ensure his side progress next season.\nBut they did well to limit United to just one goal on Saturday and spurned their own opportunities to level with Kieffer Moore's strike producing a fine stop from De Gea.\n\"We were good, we gave everything in a close game. We were right in it and had a big chance at the end,\" O'Neil told BBC Sport.\nWith their safety confirmed Bournemouth will now look towards building a squad that can further extend their stay in the top flight next year.\n\"I am very proud of the group, it was a big mountain we had to climb. We achieved something that not many people thought we could,\" said O'Neil.\nThe home fans also celebrated the return of Brooks to the starting 11 - for the first time in 598 days after he was diagnosed with stage two Hodgkin's lymphoma in October 2021.\n\"For his first game back after such a long time David showed some great touches. Pre-season will be big for him but I'm delighted to have him back.

Mykhaylo Mudryk failed to connect with the first. Kai Havertz headed the second wide from a central position when completely unmarked. In the second-half, Hall decided to go on his own, only for David de Gea to beat away his thunderous drive.\nA precise Enzo Fernandez through ball set up Conor Gallagher but the England man was equally profligate as he dragged his shot wide of the far post.\nChelsea are heading for their worst league finish since 1994 and the end of the campaign, and the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino, cannot come quickly enough.\nIf there is any crumb of comfort for the Chelsea fans who continued to support their team despite their present state, it comes from the knowledge that 12 months ago United were similarly shambolic, their own interim manager Ralf Rangnick having failed to restore the club's fortunes following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Crystal Palace have moved above Chelsea into 11th, although the Eagles have played two games more than their London rivals.\nHodgson's Palace strike late\nThere was a distinct end-of-season feel about the match at kick-off on a warm spring day on the banks of the River Thames, with both teams having little more than pride to play for.\nThat Palace are safe in mid-table is testament to the job done by Roy Hodgson, who has now lost just two of his nine games in charge to steer the Eagles away from danger.\nThe former England boss only signed a short-term deal until the end of the season, but would not be drawn on whether he will extend his stay ay Selhurst Park.\n\"I shall worry about that when the time comes,\" the 75-year-old told BBC Match of the Day. \"At the moment, I am just looking forward to ending the season in a good way and being grateful for the enjoyment I've had in these last two months.\"\nPalace offered little attacking threat early on, choosing to sit deep and hit on the counter - which proved devastatingly effective for the opener.\nThe lively Eberechi Eze drove the ball through to Edouard, who got in behind the Fulham backline and thumped the ball into the roof of the net from a tight angle.\nMitrovic's double then looked to have taken the game away from the visitors, who were restricted to efforts from distance from Eze and Edouard, before they levelled late from a set piece.\nA free-kick from the left cannoned off a Fulham defender and fell to Ward, whose initial effort was saved by Bernd Leno before he forced the ball home for his first goal since February 2019.\nMitrovic proves his worth\nMitrovic has now scored three goals in around 115 minutes since returning after his lengthy ban, including one as a substitute against Southampton last weekend.\nThis Saturday, he was involved in nearly all of Fulham's good play in a match that only sporadically burst to life.\nThe Cottagers had an early shout for a penalty turned down when Mitrovic tangled with Tyrick Mitchell in the area, but the same Palace defender brought down Harry Wilson seconds before the break, which allowed the former Newcastle striker to level from the spot.\nHe should have put Fulham ahead seconds after the restart when he dragged wide from 12 yards, but made no mistake when he met WIllian's near-post free-kick and sent a bullet header beyond Johnstone.\n\"I said the eight games [suspension] was exaggerated if you compare to other things that happened this season, but that's our opinion and we respect all decisions,\" Fulham boss Marco Silva told Match of the Day.\n\"Everyone knows how we missed a top goalscorer like him. He's a very important player but our group handled the situation well.\"\nDespite the disappointment of conceding a late equaliser, Fulham can reflect on a hugely satisfying first season back in the top flight, the first time they have avoided an immediate return to the Championship since 2002.\n\"It has been a brilliant season for this football club,\" added Silva. \"All the predictions said we would be first to go down. The way we started the season, we showed that was not going to happen.\n\"Now we have to look forward and analyse the season and see what we need to keep improving.\"\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nVisit our Fulham page\nGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

In reality, their relegation has seemed inevitable for some time and defeat by Brighton was a 12th top-flight game without a win.\nThe visitors looked bereft of ideas and intensity but they could have taken the lead before the Seagulls took control when Carlos Alcaraz fired wide after a brisk counter-attack.\nIt meant Brighton could make their dominance count through Ferguson's double and Elyounoussi's goal just before the hour mark was Southampton's first attempt on target.\nHowever, minutes later Theo Walcott thought he had beaten the offside trap to stun the hosts with an equaliser - with an initial burst of pace to run clear followed by the composed finish which has typified his career - but the goal was chalked off by the tightest of margins following a video assistant referee review.\nGross' goal killed Southampton's challenge and meant a fourth away game in a row in which they had conceded at least three goals, for the first time since 2012-13.\nOn a bright note for the visitors, right-back Tino Livramento made his return after 13 months out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury he sustained in the corresponding fixture last season.\nSaints will want to end their stay in the Premier League on a high against Liverpool but work will already have begun behind the scenes as they prepare to launch a promotion bid at the first time of asking, with Swansea boss Russell Martin heavily linked to lead the charge.\nSpeaking about his future, current Saints boss Ruben Selles said he \"expects respect\" from the club.\n\"If the club want to make a a decision before the end of the season, I expect some respect and communication before or I will be very disappointed,\" said Selles.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The Brazil goalkeeper also gathered a low shot from John McGinn.\nVilla may have been lucky not to go down to 10 men in the first half though, when defender Tyrone Mings caught Gakpo in the chest with a high challenge and the video assistant referee decided the yellow card awarded by the referee was sufficient punishment.\nVilla have now won just one of their last 11 games against the Reds - the famous 7-2 victory at Villa Park under Dean Smith - but this game showed the enormous progress the side has made under Emery.\nVilla ended the game with four players booked for time-wasting and Klopp said: \"The time wasting was... wow.\n\"Ten minutes [added time] was fine, but we should have an extra five minutes within the 10. Everybody is doing it.\n\"We have seen it in too many games this season, it has nothing to do with the result today, just a general football subject.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

It is not easy scoring goals,\" Ten Hag told BBC Sport.\n\"It was a great goal from Casemiro. We pinned them back, didn't let them breathe in the first 25 minutes.\n\"I don't care what happens in Liverpool, it's about us. We have to do the job.\"\nStay up to date with all things Manchester United\nCherries safe but defensive improvements needed\nMany pundits and fans had written Bournemouth off before the start of the season, tipping them to return straight back to the Championship.\nBut manager Gary O'Neil has done a fine job, meaning a relatively flat match at the Vitality did not matter as he has already seen his side move well clear of the relegation battle.\nBournemouth sit 14th in the league and face relegation-threatened Everton in their last game of the season at Goodison Park.\nThe Cherries have, however, conceded 70 Premier League goals in 2022-23, equalling their highest-ever figure from 2018-19 and O'Neil will have to solve those defensive frailties to ensure his side progress next season.\nBut they did well to limit United to just one goal on Saturday and spurned their own opportunities to level with Kieffer Moore's strike producing a fine stop from De Gea.\n\"We were good, we gave everything in a close game. We were right in it and had a big chance at the end,\" O'Neil told BBC Sport.\nWith their safety confirmed Bournemouth will now look towards building a squad that can further extend their stay in the top flight next year.\n\"I am very proud of the group, it was a big mountain we had to climb. We achieved something that not many people thought we could,\" said O'Neil.\nThe home fans also celebrated the return of Brooks to the starting 11 - for the first time in 598 days after he was diagnosed with stage two Hodgkin's lymphoma in October 2021.\n\"For his first game back after such a long time David showed some great touches. Pre-season will be big for him but I'm delighted to have him back. He will be a good option for us next season,\" said O'Neil.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Leeds' performance? Have your say here\nLeeds fail to rise to the moment\nAllardyce's typical responses to his side's shortcomings - a furious rant at Pascal Struijk for not charging forward at a second-half corner and chewing gum thrown to the ground in frustration at another attack that floundered in its infancy - made it obvious what he thought about the situation.\nAt the start of the game when West Ham - showing six changes to the team that started against AZ Alkmaar - looked lethargic and again in the middle when they went back into their shell, Leeds lacked the guile to open up David Moyes' side.\nWhen the hosts did rouse themselves, Leeds lacked the ability to keep them out.\nThe final score could have been even worse but Pablo Fornals and Rice passed up clear opportunities to score.\nLast season at Brentford they managed to save themselves despite starting the last day in the bottom three. This time - having sacked two managers in Jesse Marsch and Javi Gracia as well as football director Victor Orta in search of an escape - the chances of a successful outcome look more remote.\nRice will be tough to replace\nIn all likelihood this was Rice's last West Ham appearance at London Stadium.\nBut even if he does move in the summer, he has one big assignment left as a Hammer in Prague next month.\nHowever, as personal sign-offs go, his latest Hammers goal was a good one.\nHe proudly carried his baby son out as his personal mascot before the game and after it started, he marked the day with an excellent volleyed finish to a superb move.\nPablo Fornals helped create it with a delicate lofted pass to send Bowen running towards the goal line and the England forward lifted his cross to the far post where an unmarked Rice sent it bouncing into the net.\nRice's celebration ended with him on his knees by the corner flag as he was mobbed by his team-mates.\nQuite how West Ham intend to replace Rice, if indeed he leaves, is a summer conundrum that will not be easily solved.\nThat problem is for another day. Rice's immediate task is to emulate Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds by becoming a West Ham captain to lift a major trophy.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"

Mykhaylo Mudryk failed to connect with the first. Kai Havertz headed the second wide from a central position when completely unmarked. In the second-half, Hall decided to go on his own, only for David de Gea to beat away his thunderous drive.\nA precise Enzo Fernandez through ball set up Conor Gallagher but the England man was equally profligate as he dragged his shot wide of the far post.\nChelsea are heading for their worst league finish since 1994 and the end of the campaign, and the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino, cannot come quickly enough.\nIf there is any crumb of comfort for the Chelsea fans who continued to support their team despite their present state, it comes from the knowledge that 12 months ago United were similarly shambolic, their own interim manager Ralf Rangnick having failed to restore the club's fortunes following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

Crystal Palace have moved above Chelsea into 11th, although the Eagles have played two games more than their London rivals.\nHodgson's Palace strike late\nThere was a distinct end-of-season feel about the match at kick-off on a warm spring day on the banks of the River Thames, with both teams having little more than pride to play for.\nThat Palace are safe in mid-table is testament to the job done by Roy Hodgson, who has now lost just two of his nine games in charge to steer the Eagles away from danger.\nThe former England boss only signed a short-term deal until the end of the season, but would not be drawn on whether he will extend his stay ay Selhurst Park.\n\"I shall worry about that when the time comes,\" the 75-year-old told BBC Match of the Day. \"At the moment, I am just looking forward to ending the season in a good way and being grateful for the enjoyment I've had in these last two months.\"\nPalace offered little attacking threat early on, choosing to sit deep and hit on the counter - which proved devastatingly effective for the opener.\nThe lively Eberechi Eze drove the ball through to Edouard, who got in behind the Fulham backline and thumped the ball into the roof of the net from a tight angle.\nMitrovic's double then looked to have taken the game away from the visitors, who were restricted to efforts from distance from Eze and Edouard, before they levelled late from a set piece.\nA free-kick from the left cannoned off a Fulham defender and fell to Ward, whose initial effort was saved by Bernd Leno before he forced the ball home for his first goal since February 2019.\nMitrovic proves his worth\nMitrovic has now scored three goals in around 115 minutes since returning after his lengthy ban, including one as a substitute against Southampton last weekend.\nThis Saturday, he was involved in nearly all of Fulham's good play in a match that only sporadically burst to life.\nThe Cottagers had an early shout for a penalty turned down when Mitrovic tangled with Tyrick Mitchell in the area, but the same Palace defender brought down Harry Wilson seconds before the break, which allowed the former Newcastle striker to level from the spot.\nHe should have put Fulham ahead seconds after the restart when he dragged wide from 12 yards, but made no mistake when he met WIllian's near-post free-kick and sent a bullet header beyond Johnstone.\n\"I said the eight games [suspension] was exaggerated if you compare to other things that happened this season, but that's our opinion and we respect all decisions,\" Fulham boss Marco Silva told Match of the Day.\n\"Everyone knows how we missed a top goalscorer like him. He's a very important player but our group handled the situation well.\"\nDespite the disappointment of conceding a late equaliser, Fulham can reflect on a hugely satisfying first season back in the top flight, the first time they have avoided an immediate return to the Championship since 2002.\n\"It has been a brilliant season for this football club,\" added Silva. \"All the predictions said we would be first to go down.

Send us your views here\nHow did you rate Leeds' performance? Have your say here\nLeeds fail to rise to the moment\nAllardyce's typical responses to his side's shortcomings - a furious rant at Pascal Struijk for not charging forward at a second-half corner and chewing gum thrown to the ground in frustration at another attack that floundered in its infancy - made it obvious what he thought about the situation.\nAt the start of the game when West Ham - showing six changes to the team that started against AZ Alkmaar - looked lethargic and again in the middle when they went back into their shell, Leeds lacked the guile to open up David Moyes' side.\nWhen the hosts did rouse themselves, Leeds lacked the ability to keep them out.\nThe final score could have been even worse but Pablo Fornals and Rice passed up clear opportunities to score.\nLast season at Brentford they managed to save themselves despite starting the last day in the bottom three. This time - having sacked two managers in Jesse Marsch and Javi Gracia as well as football director Victor Orta in search of an escape - the chances of a successful outcome look more remote.\nRice will be tough to replace\nIn all likelihood this was Rice's last West Ham appearance at London Stadium.\nBut even if he does move in the summer, he has one big assignment left as a Hammer in Prague next month.\nHowever, as personal sign-offs go, his latest Hammers goal was a good one.\nHe proudly carried his baby son out as his personal mascot before the game and after it started, he marked the day with an excellent volleyed finish to a superb move.\nPablo Fornals helped create it with a delicate lofted pass to send Bowen running towards the goal line and the England forward lifted his cross to the far post where an unmarked Rice sent it bouncing into the net.\nRice's celebration ended with him on his knees by the corner flag as he was mobbed by his team-mates.\nQuite how West Ham intend to replace Rice, if indeed he leaves, is a summer conundrum that will not be easily solved.\nThat problem is for another day. Rice's immediate task is to emulate Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds by becoming a West Ham captain to lift a major trophy.\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

The Brazil goalkeeper also gathered a low shot from John McGinn.\nVilla may have been lucky not to go down to 10 men in the first half though, when defender Tyrone Mings caught Gakpo in the chest with a high challenge and the video assistant referee decided the yellow card awarded by the referee was sufficient punishment.\nVilla have now won just one of their last 11 games against the Reds - the famous 7-2 victory at Villa Park under Dean Smith - but this game showed the enormous progress the side has made under Emery.\nVilla ended the game with four players booked for time-wasting and Klopp said: \"The time wasting was... wow.\n\"Ten minutes [added time] was fine, but we should have an extra five minutes within the 10. Everybody is doing it.\n\"We have seen it in too many games this season, it has nothing to do with the result today, just a general football subject.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",

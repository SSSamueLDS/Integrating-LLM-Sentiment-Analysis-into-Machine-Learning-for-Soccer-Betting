        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 0-1 Aston Villa\nSubstitute Rudy Gestede scored on his first competitive Aston Villa outing as Bournemouth were left to rue missed chances on their Premier League debut.\nGestede, signed for \u00a36m from Blackburn, powered in a header 13 minutes after replacing fellow new boy Jordan Ayew.\nIn front of a packed and excited home crowd, Dan Gosling fired over from 12 yards, and Callum Wilson and Marc Pugh saw shots saved before the break.\nThey were costly misses as Villa struck and comfortably defended the lead.\nRead how Villa ruined Bournemouth's Premier League debut\nA 'what if' day for Bournemouth\nHaving come close to extinction as a club twice in their recent history, some Bournemouth fans will claim their side have seen more important days but there was tangible excitement at the Vitality Stadium as the club tasted Premier League football for the first time.\nTheir tiny ground should have erupted in the opening period, most notably when Pugh wasted a glorious chance on the stroke of half-time.\nThe winger smashed an effort into the ground from 12 yards, allowing Brad Guzan to save at a time which would have posed a lacklustre Villa serious questions.\nInstead, it is Eddie Howe left searching for answers. But the confidence with which his side played will give him encouragement - they held 58% of possession - ahead their next game at Anfield.\nMore threat in the final third may be a desire, but the introduction of summer signing Max Gradel from the bench shows options are available.\nSherwood gets it right\nTim Sherwood gave debuts to six summer signings as he embarks on his first full campaign in charge of a team.\nPerhaps his half-time words were behind the improvement as his side re-emerged quicker into the tackle and more threatening - notably when debutant Idrissa Gueye drew a fine save from Artur Boruc.\nSherwood has sought a presence up front to replace the 42 goals Christian Benteke contributed in his 89 league games, and in 6ft 4in Gestede, he has a player who contributed defensively from set pieces late on having already delivered the game's telling moment.\nThis was far from a free-flowing, transformed Villa, but they stuck to their task doggedly and maybe things are turning as a goal from a substitute was a luxury which did not arrive once last season but took just 72 minutes in this campaign.\nVilla must improve on consecutive finishes of 16th, 15th, 15th and 17th if Sherwood is to back up his early promise as a manager but in making decisions at key times, he showed terrific instincts on the opening day.\nWhere Villa went toe-to-toe and won\nWith half a dozen players new to the league - including the disappointing Jordan Ayew - it was perhaps understandable Villa felt their way into the fixture.\nHowe's side were threatening from the right flank in the opening period but as Gueye and left-back Jordan Amavi grew into the game, Villa's left-side stiffened up.\nThey were the most prominent away players on show, with Gueye's 74 touches only bettered by Amavi on 76 as the French full-back tackled ferociously and positioned himself well to ensure Villa won the battle down that key flank.\nManager reaction\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I felt we dominated, especially possession and chances in the first half. If you're not clinical enough in their box and a player like Gestede comes on, you're in trouble. The chances will come at a premium this year and we need to take them.\n\"It was a great day for the football club regardless of the result. It's just a shame we couldn't back it up with the result, but I thought the performance was there.\"\nAston Villa manager Tim Sherwood: \"I thought we were slow in the first period but we set out to nullify them and try to quieten this carnival atmosphere.\n\"Rudy hasn't trained an awful lot, but we knew he would give us a different dimension. We worked very hard to bring him to this football club so we're delighted - and that's a victory for the people behind the scenes at the club.\"\nMan of the match\nBrought in at a reported \u00a37.7m from Nice, Jordan Amavi should answer plenty of questions at left-back where Villa have tried out the likes of Alan Hutton and Aly Cissokho in recent times.\nAt just 21, the France Under-21s international looked comfortable in the English game and prioritised his defensive duties over surging forward, winning 10 of his 15 duels.\nThe stats you need to know\nSince the start of 2013-14, Rudy Gestede has scored 20 headed goals; five more than anyone else in the top four tiers\nBournemouth only lost one of their last 19 home league games last season but tasted defeat on their first outing their in the Premier League",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur\nManchester United held on to start their season with a lacklustre win against Tottenham thanks to Kyle Walker's early own goal.\nAfter Christian Eriksen lobbed over when clean through, United went ahead as Walker poked into his own net when attempting to tackle Wayne Rooney.\nThat led to a better spell for United, who did not have a shot on target until Ashley Young's 65th-minute effort.\nSergio Romero - one of five United debutants - saved a late Eriksen drive.\nRelive Manchester United's win over Tottenham\n, external\nLouis van Gaal celebrated his 64th birthday with a victory but his team were hanging on towards the end as Romero was twice called into action.\nTottenham - who finished fifth in the Premier League last season, six points behind United - started and ended the game strongly only three days after completing their final pre-season game against AC Milan in Germany.\nHow did United's debutants perform?\nMorgan Schneiderlin was the pick of United's new recruits, who cost a combined \u00a383.1m over the summer.\nThe defensive midfielder lined up next to Michael Carrick and looked energetic and willing to accept possession deep in United's half despite a couple of nervous moments early on.\nThe \u00a325m capture from Southampton was put under pressure by goalkeeper Romero, whose kicking lacked conviction after Spurs pressed the hosts' defence high up the pitch.\nThe Argentine international made his debut after replacing David De Gea, who boss Van Gaal said was \"not capable\" of playing amid ongoing speculation that the Spanish goalkeeper wants to join Real Madrid.\nMemphis Depay, a \u00a331m arrival from PSV Eindhoven, played behind Wayne Rooney in attack, and while the Dutch 21-year-old did have an early shot blocked, he was frustrated by his 68th-minute substitution after a display where he looked like he needed further time to gel with team-mates.\nAt right-back Matteo Darmian was solid as a replacement for the departed Rafael Da Silva and showed purpose going forward.\nBastian Schweinsteiger, who came on for Carrick after his \u00a314.4m arrival from Bayern Munich, helped see the game out with some clever touches but was booked shortly after being introduced after an hour.\nKane shows signs of promise\nDespite a gruelling summer in which he went on Spurs' post-season tour to Australia and played in the England Under-21s' ill-fated European Championship campaign, Kane looked sharp in the first half.\nHe made a great start to the game, setting up Eriksen for his side's best chance after five minutes, but a lack of support meant Spurs's top scorer from last season faded and Chris Smalling began to boss the United defence in an impressive display.\nBut the 22-year-old did show promise after questions whether he could follow up last season's superb form.\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino withdrew Nabil Bentaleb eight minutes into the second half after the 20-year-old lined up with Eric Dier in the centre of midfield and gave the ball away for the goal.\nHowever, he will have been pleased by the overall performance of his team, with \u00a312m debutant Toby Alderweireld looking strong next to fellow Belgian Jan Vertonghen in the centre of their defence.\n'Depay too eager'\nManchester United manager Louis Van Gaal: \"I said to Memphis that he doesn't have to play too eagerly and with too much passion and that counts for the whole team. But it's always the same - the first time you play at Old Trafford it's always difficult, but I liked the performance especially from Darmian.\"\nTottenahm defender Kyle Walker on his own goal: \"I tried to stick my foot in the way so that [Rooney would] kick my foot instead of the ball, so it's a bit unlucky really as I'd made up a lot of ground to get there.\"\nVan Gaal on David De Gea's future at Manchester United: \"I'm not the most important part. The most important part is the player and the club who wants to buy him. He's our best player for the past two or three years so we cannot let him go so easily. We want to sell at the same level as we pay. We want to keep him of course.\"\nPundit reaction\nFormer England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 live: \"I don't think either team we've watched looked like title contenders. We haven't seen the best of them. They look a little leggy. Tottenham need a bit of pace and with United I'm not sure about them in the centre-back position.\"\nMan of the match\nChris Smalling offered a calmness and reassurance in defence while many debutants tried too hard to impress. He benefitted from the presence of Morgan Schneiderlin in front of him.\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is the first time a Premier League season's first goal has been an own goal\nManchester United have kept a clean sheet on opening day for the first time since 2010 (3-0 v Newcastle)\nUnited have lost just one of their last 24 opening league games of the season at Old Trafford (W17 D6)\nMauricio Pochettino's Spurs are yet to score against Manchester United in three meetings\nManchester United have now won back-to-back Premier League games against Spurs, after a five game winless run (D3 L2)"

First he saw an effort blocked by Jack Colback, before another shot drifted inches wide of the post.\nSaints manager Ronald Koeman followed the match from home as he recovered from an operation on his Achilles tendon, while brother and assistant manager Erwin gave a first Premier League start in 491 days to striker Jay Rodriguez.\nRodriguez's return\nEngland striker Rodriguez was making his first Premier League start in 16 months.\nThe 26-year-old ruptured his anterior cruciate knee ligament in April 2014, only making his competitive return in the Europa League qualifying match on Thursday.\nHis lack of match action showed and he was replaced by Long on 65 minutes after just one shot, which was off target.\nSoares, the Portugal international signed for \u00a33.6m from Sporting Lisbon, impressed on his debut, showing plenty of endeavour going forward and supplying a deep cross for Pelle's goal.\nHis replacement Cuco Martina became only the second player from the Caribbean nation of Curacao to play in the Premier League after West Brom's Shelton Martis in 2009.\nNewcastle new boys impress\nWijnaldum is the most expensive signing of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley's eight-year reign and the Netherlands international looked right at home at St James' Park, looking to get forward and providing a strong driving force from midfield.\nHe capped his display with a wonderful headed goal, rising to meet Gabriel Obertan's cross to power past keeper Maarten Stekelenburg.\nCentre-back Chancel Mbemba, an \u00a38.5m signing from Anderlecht, grew into the game after being out-jumped for Pelle's opener. The DR Congo international could soon become a favourite among Newcastle fans after arriving at the match dressed in a tuxedo.\nIt was almost a nightmare debut for Newcastle's other new signing, \u00a313m Serbia striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, who was booked 22 seconds after coming on as a second-half substitute.\nMan of the Match - Georginio Wijnaldum\nManager reaction\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren: \"I went through every emotion. We played some terrific football and could have been out of sight.\nIn the end we hung on for the point and there were a lot of positives. It would have been a travesty if we had lost.\n\"In the last 15 minutes we have to be smarter, we will learn from that.\"\nOn Mitrovic's booking: \"We were quite fortunate he did not get a red there and there would have been no complaints if he did. That's what he is. He certainly doesn't hold back. He wanted to come on and impress.\"\nSouthampton assistant manager Erwin Koeman: \"We had some big chances in the last 10 minutes but you have to score to win games so it is mixed feelings that we have.\n\"It is not a bad start, but if you are professional and you get the chance to win, you have to win.\n\"Ten minutes before the end I thought OK, we are happy with a point, but if you see the last 10 minutes then we have to be disappointed.\"\nPundit reaction\nFormer Scotland winger Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 live: \"Steve McClaren will have learned a lot about his team today. For 75 minutes they were the better side but he made a few changes and he needs to work out why they did not work. But those 75 minutes were better than anything else I saw from Newcastle last season. He has something to build on here.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle ended a run of three straight defeats by Southampton.\nPelle scored only his second Premier League goal away from St Mary's for Southampton. He has scored 13 in total.\nThe Magpies have managed only one clean sheet in their last 17 top-flight clashes against Southampton.\nSouthampton have conceded exactly two goals in each of their last five away games.",

It gives us that bit of danger we need and we have so many tools to hurt teams now.\"\nHow did Lambert and Berahino combine?\nIf West Brom's summer signing Rickie Lambert and fellow striker Saido Berahino needed motivating, then the signing of Salomon Rondon for a club record of about \u00a312m prior to the match should have provided it.\nHowever, the tactic of Baggies boss Tony Pulis to play both in attack backfired as the pair struggled to make any mark on City's defence, while the visitors dominated possession.\nLambert did go close with a dipping and curling 25-yard free-kick, while Berahino had a great chance when he ran on to a cross but he mistimed a first-time shot from six yards with only Hart to beat.\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis said: \"I told the players after the game I have to take responsibility for this one. I played Saido and Rickie and that left the midfield too open. It went against the principles I have always worked to and it has given me a rude awakening.\n\"I won't be doing that against the big teams. You have to make sure you fill the midfield and don't get outnumbered. I wanted to be positive but that has taught me a lesson.\"\nMen of the match\nReaction\nManchester City captain Vincent Kompany: \"We have something to prove. Last season was below what we're used to doing. It was a good way to start the first game.\n\"We came out knowing we had a point to prove. If you'd seen the faces in training last week, I knew the team was going to be ready for this game.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It's important to start with a win. In the Premier League normally you are going to win or lose the league by one point, so it's important to start strongly.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City completed 692 passes in this game - 211 more than any other team on the opening weekend of the 2015-16 Premier League season.\nIn each of the last five seasons, the eventual Premier League champions began with a game on a Monday.\nYaya Toure has scored five goals in his last three Premier League games at The Hawthorns.\nSilva (90) and Fernandinho (89) completed more passes than any other Premier League player on the first weekend of the 2015-16 top flight campaign.\n'They were on a different planet'\nBBC Radio 5 live's Robbie Savage: \"Manchester City were on a different planet against West Brom and better than any other team after the first weekend of the Premier League. West Brom were just beaten by a better team. Every player in a City shirt performed.\n\"I just think West Brom got it tactically wrong playing two in attack. Manager Tony Pulis said you can't lose a midfield battle with City, and his side have done that.\""

But it's always the same - the first time you play at Old Trafford it's always difficult, but I liked the performance especially from Darmian.\"\nTottenahm defender Kyle Walker on his own goal: \"I tried to stick my foot in the way so that [Rooney would] kick my foot instead of the ball, so it's a bit unlucky really as I'd made up a lot of ground to get there.\"\nVan Gaal on David De Gea's future at Manchester United: \"I'm not the most important part. The most important part is the player and the club who wants to buy him. He's our best player for the past two or three years so we cannot let him go so easily. We want to sell at the same level as we pay. We want to keep him of course.\"\nPundit reaction\nFormer England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 live: \"I don't think either team we've watched looked like title contenders. We haven't seen the best of them. They look a little leggy. Tottenham need a bit of pace and with United I'm not sure about them in the centre-back position.\"\nMan of the match\nChris Smalling offered a calmness and reassurance in defence while many debutants tried too hard to impress. He benefitted from the presence of Morgan Schneiderlin in front of him.\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is the first time a Premier League season's first goal has been an own goal\nManchester United have kept a clean sheet on opening day for the first time since 2010 (3-0 v Newcastle)\nUnited have lost just one of their last 24 opening league games of the season at Old Trafford (W17 D6)\nMauricio Pochettino's Spurs are yet to score against Manchester United in three meetings\nManchester United have now won back-to-back Premier League games against Spurs, after a five game winless run (D3 L2)",

Daniel Sturridge will add to the fight for places when he returns from injury next month.\nMeanwhile, Stoke are an uncompromising outfit under Mark Hughes, with new boys Ibrahim Afellay and Marco van Ginkel giving extra class to a side who were undone by a special strike.\nIbrahim impresses and the Christian conundrum\nAfellay was brought in on a free transfer from Barcelona and looks to be a player who will excite the Britannia Stadium crowd. His neat footwork was generously applauded by the fans, while his composure on the ball and attacking prowess will give Stoke extra incentive in the final third.\nLiverpool full-backs Nathaniel Clyne and 18-year-old Joe Gomez both impressed, while the experienced James Milner and Stoke's on-loan Van Ginkel showed they are not afraid to scrap in midfield, but also looked assured in possession.\nPlaying as a lone striker, Benteke endured a poor debut, isolated on his own, often having to drop short in search of the ball. Boss Rodgers needs to work out how to best utilise the \u00a332.5m Belgian's height and aggression. The Reds put just six crosses into the box for him to feed off.\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson\nManager reaction\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"Liverpool have invested a lot of money this summer but I did not see \u00a380m worth of difference between the teams. We are at a good level without going into the transfer market too much.\n\"I do not think any team deserved the win, a draw would have been the fair result. We will get stronger and be more creative. In terms of the performance, as this is the first day of the season, I am quietly confident we can go on from this point.\"\nLiverpool manager Brendan Rodgers: \"To get the win after what happened here last season was even more important. We showed great character and determination as a team and our quality came through.\n\"I always felt last season's result at Stoke was a one-off. It was a poor day and it was important for us to come here and get a result. The players can put that behind them now and focus on moving forward.\"\nWhat former Liverpool defenders said\nMark Lawrenson on BBC Radio 5: \"It's been a very drab game. Extremely dull - it's been a bit of a dog's dinner at times - but the goal was absolutely top class. The turn on Steve Sidwell was brilliant - that gave Philippe Coutinho the space to run on goal.\"\nThe numbers game\nThree of Philippe Coutinho's four goals in 2015 have come from outside the box.\nLiverpool have only drawn a blank three times on the opening weekend of a Premier League campaign\nStoke have won just once on the opening weekend of a Premier League season in 2009-10"

We conceded a lot and we were not sharp enough.\"\nSunderland conceded two sloppy goals early on, allowing Marc Albrighton's crosses from the left to find two of the smallest players on the pitch. From then on, Leicester gained confidence and Sunderland failed to cope with the home side's quick, crisp movement.\n'The Tinkerman' returns\nClaudio Ranieri made a winning return to the Premier League, 11 years after being sacked as Chelsea manager by owner Roman Abramovich.\nThe Leicester boss, known as 'the Tinkerman' for his constant changing of his starting line-ups, was a surprise replacement for Nigel Pearson in the summer but, should his new team continue to perform with such attacking verve, his first season with the Foxes will be trouble free - although the ease in which Sunderland scored twice is a note of caution.\nRanieri described his side's performance as \"outstanding\" and, indeed, they could have scored more, with Shinji Okazaki missing one glorious chance in the second half. Mahrez, too, hit the woodwork after the break and forced a fine save Costel Pantilimon.\nThe coach chose to rely on the players who secured top-flight survival last term by winning win seven of their last nine games to finish 14th, with only one summer signing - Okazaki - in his starting line-up,\nOf the familiar Leicester faces, it was striker Vardy and winger Mahrez who particularly excelled, their creativity and pace causing Sunderland problems.\nLeicester attack down the wings\nSunderland were fragile on the right side of their defence and 42.2% of Leicester's attacks came from that flank. Marc Albrighton caused damage in the first half with his crosses from the left wing and combined well with Jeff Schlupp and Okazaki for the second goal, which Mahrez scored.\n'I told players to be warriors'\nLeicester City manager Claudio Ranieri: \"It was a very good start and I am very happy with my players in the first match, which is so important in front of our fans. I told my players to be the warriors for them.\n\"The performance was outstanding from the beginning.

We played some terrific football and could have been out of sight.\nIn the end we hung on for the point and there were a lot of positives. It would have been a travesty if we had lost.\n\"In the last 15 minutes we have to be smarter, we will learn from that.\"\nOn Mitrovic's booking: \"We were quite fortunate he did not get a red there and there would have been no complaints if he did. That's what he is. He certainly doesn't hold back. He wanted to come on and impress.\"\nSouthampton assistant manager Erwin Koeman: \"We had some big chances in the last 10 minutes but you have to score to win games so it is mixed feelings that we have.\n\"It is not a bad start, but if you are professional and you get the chance to win, you have to win.\n\"Ten minutes before the end I thought OK, we are happy with a point, but if you see the last 10 minutes then we have to be disappointed.\"\nPundit reaction\nFormer Scotland winger Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 live: \"Steve McClaren will have learned a lot about his team today. For 75 minutes they were the better side but he made a few changes and he needs to work out why they did not work. But those 75 minutes were better than anything else I saw from Newcastle last season. He has something to build on here.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle ended a run of three straight defeats by Southampton.\nPelle scored only his second Premier League goal away from St Mary's for Southampton. He has scored 13 in total.\nThe Magpies have managed only one clean sheet in their last 17 top-flight clashes against Southampton.\nSouthampton have conceded exactly two goals in each of their last five away games."

We conceded a lot and we were not sharp enough.\"\nSunderland conceded two sloppy goals early on, allowing Marc Albrighton's crosses from the left to find two of the smallest players on the pitch. From then on, Leicester gained confidence and Sunderland failed to cope with the home side's quick, crisp movement.\n'The Tinkerman' returns\nClaudio Ranieri made a winning return to the Premier League, 11 years after being sacked as Chelsea manager by owner Roman Abramovich.\nThe Leicester boss, known as 'the Tinkerman' for his constant changing of his starting line-ups, was a surprise replacement for Nigel Pearson in the summer but, should his new team continue to perform with such attacking verve, his first season with the Foxes will be trouble free - although the ease in which Sunderland scored twice is a note of caution.\nRanieri described his side's performance as \"outstanding\" and, indeed, they could have scored more, with Shinji Okazaki missing one glorious chance in the second half. Mahrez, too, hit the woodwork after the break and forced a fine save Costel Pantilimon.\nThe coach chose to rely on the players who secured top-flight survival last term by winning win seven of their last nine games to finish 14th, with only one summer signing - Okazaki - in his starting line-up,\nOf the familiar Leicester faces, it was striker Vardy and winger Mahrez who particularly excelled, their creativity and pace causing Sunderland problems.\nLeicester attack down the wings\nSunderland were fragile on the right side of their defence and 42.2% of Leicester's attacks came from that flank. Marc Albrighton caused damage in the first half with his crosses from the left wing and combined well with Jeff Schlupp and Okazaki for the second goal, which Mahrez scored.\n'I told players to be warriors'\nLeicester City manager Claudio Ranieri: \"It was a very good start and I am very happy with my players in the first match, which is so important in front of our fans. I told my players to be the warriors for them.\n\"The performance was outstanding from the beginning. Okazaki played very well but I don't like to just say that because the whole team played well.\"\nSunderland boss Dick Advocaat: \"After 10 minutes there were three crosses and three goals. At this level this cannot happen.\n\"You have to show every minute away from home and we didn't see that in the first half. We have to wait [for new players]. We struggled again. Everybody can see that we need more.\"\nLeicester winger Marc Albrighton: \"Claudio Ranieri has come in with fresh ideas to add to the way we were playing. He didn't want to change too much but he has new ideas and we are taking them on board.\"\nMan of the match\nRiyad Mahrez's pace and invention posed havoc all afternoon and the Algeria international could have had a hat-trick before receiving a deserved standing ovation from the Leicester fans as he was substituted towards the end of the match.\nThe stats you need to know\nSince the start of April, Leicester have won more points than any other Premier League side (25).\nThe Foxes have won six and lost just one of their last seven league games at the King Power Stadium.\nJamie Vardy has five goals and four assists in his last 11 league appearances.\nJermain Defoe has now scored in 15 different Premier League seasons, and has 129 goals in total.\nMarc Albrighton ended last season with three assists but already has two after the opening game of 2015-16.",

It gives us that bit of danger we need and we have so many tools to hurt teams now.\"\nHow did Lambert and Berahino combine?\nIf West Brom's summer signing Rickie Lambert and fellow striker Saido Berahino needed motivating, then the signing of Salomon Rondon for a club record of about \u00a312m prior to the match should have provided it.\nHowever, the tactic of Baggies boss Tony Pulis to play both in attack backfired as the pair struggled to make any mark on City's defence, while the visitors dominated possession.\nLambert did go close with a dipping and curling 25-yard free-kick, while Berahino had a great chance when he ran on to a cross but he mistimed a first-time shot from six yards with only Hart to beat.\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis said: \"I told the players after the game I have to take responsibility for this one. I played Saido and Rickie and that left the midfield too open. It went against the principles I have always worked to and it has given me a rude awakening.\n\"I won't be doing that against the big teams. You have to make sure you fill the midfield and don't get outnumbered. I wanted to be positive but that has taught me a lesson.\"\nMen of the match\nReaction\nManchester City captain Vincent Kompany: \"We have something to prove. Last season was below what we're used to doing. It was a good way to start the first game.\n\"We came out knowing we had a point to prove. If you'd seen the faces in training last week, I knew the team was going to be ready for this game.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It's important to start with a win. In the Premier League normally you are going to win or lose the league by one point, so it's important to start strongly.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City completed 692 passes in this game - 211 more than any other team on the opening weekend of the 2015-16 Premier League season.\nIn each of the last five seasons, the eventual Premier League champions began with a game on a Monday.\nYaya Toure has scored five goals in his last three Premier League games at The Hawthorns.\nSilva (90) and Fernandinho (89) completed more passes than any other Premier League player on the first weekend of the 2015-16 top flight campaign.\n'They were on a different planet'\nBBC Radio 5 live's Robbie Savage: \"Manchester City were on a different planet against West Brom and better than any other team after the first weekend of the Premier League. West Brom were just beaten by a better team. Every player in a City shirt performed.\n\"I just think West Brom got it tactically wrong playing two in attack.

The team was playing very, very well in the first half. In the second, in one minute, it was a penalty, red card and the goal - 2-2.\n\"If you have 10 men and are winning you can defend well and try to find a strategy but to play with 10 men and try to win the game is more difficult. I would say we were the best team with 11 players and with 10 we fought hard, some fighting at the limit of their condition.\"\nSwansea manager Garry Monk: \"I thought our performance warranted at least that point. We went for it and showed our attacking prowess.\"\nOn the red card: \"It is a goalscoring opportunity. The letter of the law is that it is a red card and we got what we deserved today.\"\nMan of the Match\nJefferson Montero was at the Copa America tournament in Chile for Ecuador during the summer and has not had a full summer's rest since 2011. You would not have known it at Stamford Bridge. The 25-year-old was at his threatening best and used his pace to cause problems. He was also not shy to test Courtois or Begovic.\nThe stats you need to know\nAndre Ayew has scored in eight of his last 14 league game (France and England), including four of his last six.\nSwansea held the lead for just 1 minute 35 seconds in this game before Federico Fernandez's own goal.\nOscar has scored three goals in his last 12 Premier League appearances - all coming versus Swansea.\nSwansea only received two Premier League penalties in 2014-15.\nThibaut Courtois is third Chelsea keeper to see be sent off in the Premier League after Frode Grodas in 1997 (v Everton) and Petr Cech (v Wigan in 2009)\nCourtois' red card was Chelsea's 70th in the Premier League, 17 of which have come under Mourinho (24%).\nBafetimbi Gomis is one of two players (along with Steven Naismith) to have scored v Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City & Man Utd over the last two Premier League seasons."

Daniel Sturridge will add to the fight for places when he returns from injury next month.\nMeanwhile, Stoke are an uncompromising outfit under Mark Hughes, with new boys Ibrahim Afellay and Marco van Ginkel giving extra class to a side who were undone by a special strike.\nIbrahim impresses and the Christian conundrum\nAfellay was brought in on a free transfer from Barcelona and looks to be a player who will excite the Britannia Stadium crowd. His neat footwork was generously applauded by the fans, while his composure on the ball and attacking prowess will give Stoke extra incentive in the final third.\nLiverpool full-backs Nathaniel Clyne and 18-year-old Joe Gomez both impressed, while the experienced James Milner and Stoke's on-loan Van Ginkel showed they are not afraid to scrap in midfield, but also looked assured in possession.\nPlaying as a lone striker, Benteke endured a poor debut, isolated on his own, often having to drop short in search of the ball. Boss Rodgers needs to work out how to best utilise the \u00a332.5m Belgian's height and aggression. The Reds put just six crosses into the box for him to feed off.\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson\nManager reaction\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"Liverpool have invested a lot of money this summer but I did not see \u00a380m worth of difference between the teams. We are at a good level without going into the transfer market too much.\n\"I do not think any team deserved the win, a draw would have been the fair result. We will get stronger and be more creative. In terms of the performance, as this is the first day of the season, I am quietly confident we can go on from this point.\"\nLiverpool manager Brendan Rodgers: \"To get the win after what happened here last season was even more important. We showed great character and determination as a team and our quality came through.\n\"I always felt last season's result at Stoke was a one-off. It was a poor day and it was important for us to come here and get a result. The players can put that behind them now and focus on moving forward.\"\nWhat former Liverpool defenders said\nMark Lawrenson on BBC Radio 5: \"It's been a very drab game. Extremely dull - it's been a bit of a dog's dinner at times - but the goal was absolutely top class. The turn on Steve Sidwell was brilliant - that gave Philippe Coutinho the space to run on goal.\"\nThe numbers game\nThree of Philippe Coutinho's four goals in 2015 have come from outside the box.\nLiverpool have only drawn a blank three times on the opening weekend of a Premier League campaign\nStoke have won just once on the opening weekend of a Premier League season in 2009-10",

But the confidence with which his side played will give him encouragement - they held 58% of possession - ahead their next game at Anfield.\nMore threat in the final third may be a desire, but the introduction of summer signing Max Gradel from the bench shows options are available.\nSherwood gets it right\nTim Sherwood gave debuts to six summer signings as he embarks on his first full campaign in charge of a team.\nPerhaps his half-time words were behind the improvement as his side re-emerged quicker into the tackle and more threatening - notably when debutant Idrissa Gueye drew a fine save from Artur Boruc.\nSherwood has sought a presence up front to replace the 42 goals Christian Benteke contributed in his 89 league games, and in 6ft 4in Gestede, he has a player who contributed defensively from set pieces late on having already delivered the game's telling moment.\nThis was far from a free-flowing, transformed Villa, but they stuck to their task doggedly and maybe things are turning as a goal from a substitute was a luxury which did not arrive once last season but took just 72 minutes in this campaign.\nVilla must improve on consecutive finishes of 16th, 15th, 15th and 17th if Sherwood is to back up his early promise as a manager but in making decisions at key times, he showed terrific instincts on the opening day.\nWhere Villa went toe-to-toe and won\nWith half a dozen players new to the league - including the disappointing Jordan Ayew - it was perhaps understandable Villa felt their way into the fixture.\nHowe's side were threatening from the right flank in the opening period but as Gueye and left-back Jordan Amavi grew into the game, Villa's left-side stiffened up.\nThey were the most prominent away players on show, with Gueye's 74 touches only bettered by Amavi on 76 as the French full-back tackled ferociously and positioned himself well to ensure Villa won the battle down that key flank.\nManager reaction\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I felt we dominated, especially possession and chances in the first half. If you're not clinical enough in their box and a player like Gestede comes on, you're in trouble. The chances will come at a premium this year and we need to take them.\n\"It was a great day for the football club regardless of the result. It's just a shame we couldn't back it up with the result, but I thought the performance was there.\"\nAston Villa manager Tim Sherwood: \"I thought we were slow in the first period but we set out to nullify them and try to quieten this carnival atmosphere.\n\"Rudy hasn't trained an awful lot, but we knew he would give us a different dimension. We worked very hard to bring him to this football club so we're delighted - and that's a victory for the people behind the scenes at the club.\"\nMan of the match\nBrought in at a reported \u00a37.7m from Nice, Jordan Amavi should answer plenty of questions at left-back where Villa have tried out the likes of Alan Hutton and Aly Cissokho in recent times.\nAt just 21, the France Under-21s international looked comfortable in the English game and prioritised his defensive duties over surging forward, winning 10 of his 15 duels.\nThe stats you need to know\nSince the start of 2013-14, Rudy Gestede has scored 20 headed goals; five more than anyone else in the top four tiers\nBournemouth only lost one of their last 19 home league games last season but tasted defeat on their first outing their in the Premier League"

It may be down to personnel missing who might give us a little cutting edge.\"\nJanuzaj forces his way into Van Gaal's plans\nVan Gaal sprung something of a surprise with his selection of Januzaj - who was not even in the match day squad for his side's 1-0 win over Tottenham in their opening game of the season - ahead of Ashley Young.\nThe youngster has been widely tipped to leave Old Trafford on loan, with Sunderland and Everton among those linked\n, external\nwith season-long deals.\nAlthough he looked a little short of fitness it was a good performance as the central playmaker in an attacking triumvirate behind Rooney.\n\"You have to wait until we have closed the transfer period,\" Van Gaal said of Januzaj's future.\n\"I am pleased with the goal because it was a wonderful goal but you have to do more than scoring a goal.\"\nMen of the match\nMuch has been made of Manchester United's need to sign a new centre-back but having restricted Aston Villa to just one shot on target in this encounter the Red Devils look tight at the back.\nDaley Blind and Chris Smalling have formed a solid pairing at the heart of the United defence and both players impressed as they snuffed out whatever threat Villa posed in the final third of the pitch.\nEngland international Smalling's commanding presence in the air and his confident reading of the game meant he probably shaded it ahead of Blind.\nReaction\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I think we played better than last week. For an away match I am very happy. We kept the ball better in the first 20 minutes, we scored a fantastic goal. After that we were a little bit nervous but in the second half we played very controlled football and could have scored more than one.\"\nAston Villa captain Micah Richards: \"If you look at our team from the beginning of last season to this season there are some really exciting players - good ball players in midfield with power and pace all over. It is exciting times, not the result we wanted but we move on.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJanuzaj's goal ended his drought of 1,169 minutes in the Premier League. It was his first since April 2014 against Newcastle.\nRooney has not scored an away goal in the Premier League since November 2014.\nMata has two assists in his last 20 Premier League appearances - both have come against Aston Villa.\nVilla have now won just one of their past 40 Premier League games against Manchester United.",

It is about him working hard and us working hard with him to improve his play in all areas.\"\nThe graphic shows Shelvey's influence in midfield after the break which helped Swansea control the game. He completed 88% of his 83 passes and ran 10.92km during the game - only fellow midfielder Jack Cork covered greater distance for the home side.\nMcClaren's misery\nNewcastle showed signs of promise in their opening draw against Southampton, with Georginio Wijnaldum the brightest of the new signings on display.\nBut the visitors were toothless for large parts at Liberty Stadium, the likes of striker Papiss Cisse almost anonymous as McClaren's side were starved of possession.\nJanmaat's red card will have irked the former England boss, as the Dutchman was guilty of an unnecessary and impulsive tug of Montero's shirt to leave Newcastle down to 10 men and facing a daunting task which they never looked like completing.\nMan of the match\nManager reaction\nSwansea manager Garry Monk: \"We dominated the whole game from start to finish. When the red card does come it impacts on the dynamic of the other team more and they sat back after that.\n\"We were very professional in the second half and made sure we won the game with a clean sheet.\"\nNewcastle head coach Steve McClaren: \"We didn't learn a lot apart from it is difficult to win with 10 men.\n\"A little bit of naivety has cost us, 10 men and your backs are against the wall. We have to dust ourselves down and concentrate on the Manchester United game next week.\"\nPundit analysis\nBBC Sport pundit Martin Keown: \"I never got to see Stanley Matthews play, but this guy Jefferson Montero has got full-backs on toast.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAndre Ayew has scored in nine of his last 15 league appearances (Ligue 1 and Premier League), including five goals in his last seven games\nBafetimbi Gomis has scored seven goals in his last eight Premier League appearances\nNewcastle have lost seven consecutive Premier League away games, equalling their record from October 1999\nThe Magpies only managed four total shots against Swansea, which is the fewest they have had in the Premier League since March 2012 against Arsenal (four)"

They were excellent for long spells.\nNew rule same old problems\nThe offside rule has been tweaked to supposedly clear up the grey area of when a player is interfering with play only for Bournemouth to find themselves the victim of a situation this was meant to avoid when Benteke scored Liverpool's winner.\nThe new rule states \"a player in an offside position shall be penalised if he clearly attempts to play a ball which is close to him when this action impacts on an opponent or makes an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball.\"\nA very offside Coutinho was clearly trying to play the ball when he stretched to Henderson's cross, just failing but then seeing the ball fall for Benteke to turn in.\nThe goal was still given and Bournemouth were left nursing a heavy sense of injustice.\nMan of the Match - Christian Benteke (Liverpool)\nManager reaction\nLiverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I haven't seen their disallowed goal or ours and the most important thing is ours stood.\n\"We said it would be a tough game. Defensively we were very good. Our play was better after the goal, I am very pleased.\n\"Christian Benteke is bedding into a new team but you could see his threat. I'm very pleased for the players, six points, two clean sheets and the team will grow.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is tough to take but we have to. We are learning tough lessons, the margins for success are small. It will be character building.\n\"I didn't say a lot to the officials. They have a hard job but I will speak to then privately. I want feedback on the decisions.\n\"We had a few chances but the big positive is overall our performance. We know if we perform like that the results and goals will come. The players are winners and this is an experience we don't want to get used to.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool remain unbeaten in all competitions against Bournemouth (W5 D2).\nSince his Liverpool debut in the Premier League, only Steven Gerrard (25) has more Premier League assists for Liverpool than Jordan Henderson (22).\nHenderson has 10 assists in the Premier League since the start of last season; more than any other English player.\nChristian Benteke's goal in this game was his 50th in English club football (all comps).\nBenteke has now scored 12 goals in his last 13 Premier League appearances.\nThis is the sixth time in Premier League history that Liverpool have won their opening two games of the season.\nLiverpool have now won four successive Premier League games played on a Monday.\nSimon Mignolet has kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League goalkeeper in 2015.\nUp next\nIt's been a good start for Liverpool - results wise - but they face their first big test of the season next Monday when they travel to Arsenal, where they lost 4-1 in April.\nFor Bournemouth it's a trip to the capital on Saturday where they will seek their first points of the season at West Ham United.\nSocial media reaction"

The 28-year-old showed beautiful technique to retain his balance and strike the ball sweetly as he controlled his fall away from goal.\nHow far did Palace push them?\nArsenal definitely rode their luck at times. Wickham was close to putting Palace ahead after the break and Jason Puncheon finished tamely when presented with a brilliant chance.\nFrancis Coquelin was perhaps fortunate to have picked up just the one yellow card before being replaced, with referee Lee Mason taking a lenient view of the Frenchman's persistent fouling.\nCech was at fault for both of West Ham's goals but there was little he could do about Palace's equaliser as Ward's driven strike was clipping the inside of post by the time he had reached the full length of this dive.\nThere were still a few nervy moments for the goalkeeper - most notably when clearing high balls as Palace looked to make the most of set pieces - but overall Arsenal looked more likely to score a third than Palace equalising for a second time.\nMan of the match: Mesut Ozil\nManager reaction\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The game changed on two incidents. We hit the post at 1-1 and you have to argue they are lucky to have 11 players. Everyone knew in the stadium Francis Coquelin should have gone.\n\"The game was very even, they play a different style. They were good, much better than against West Ham. Sharper in the mind and we still feel aggrieved we haven't come out with anything.\n\"Arsenal were a hurt animal but the early period was bad for us, we made a lot of mistakes.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Our fluency was good in the first half and our mental response was good at 1-1.\n\"It was a bit scary to look at the chances we missed - you thought we would be punished after that but we dug in and hung on in the last 10 minutes, and that too is important in the season.\n\"Alexis Sanchez has only had two weeks of training but still he had the mental resources to score us a vital goal today. We know it's not a 100%-fit Sanchez but a 100%-motivated Sanchez, and that at times can be enough.\"\nNext up\nArsenal face Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium next Monday (20:00 BST), while Palace are at home to Aston Villa on Saturday (15:00).\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal's last three Premier League clashes with Crystal Palace have all ended in 2-1 victories for the Gunners.\nGiroud has scored in each of his three Premier League appearances at Selhurst Park against Palace.\nArsenal have only kept one clean sheet in their last eight Premier League away games.\nThe Gunners enjoyed a better pass success rate and also won a higher percentage of their tackles - 85.2% to Palace's 72.2%.\nSocial media reaction",

It may be down to personnel missing who might give us a little cutting edge.\"\nJanuzaj forces his way into Van Gaal's plans\nVan Gaal sprung something of a surprise with his selection of Januzaj - who was not even in the match day squad for his side's 1-0 win over Tottenham in their opening game of the season - ahead of Ashley Young.\nThe youngster has been widely tipped to leave Old Trafford on loan, with Sunderland and Everton among those linked\n, external\nwith season-long deals.\nAlthough he looked a little short of fitness it was a good performance as the central playmaker in an attacking triumvirate behind Rooney.\n\"You have to wait until we have closed the transfer period,\" Van Gaal said of Januzaj's future.\n\"I am pleased with the goal because it was a wonderful goal but you have to do more than scoring a goal.\"\nMen of the match\nMuch has been made of Manchester United's need to sign a new centre-back but having restricted Aston Villa to just one shot on target in this encounter the Red Devils look tight at the back.\nDaley Blind and Chris Smalling have formed a solid pairing at the heart of the United defence and both players impressed as they snuffed out whatever threat Villa posed in the final third of the pitch.\nEngland international Smalling's commanding presence in the air and his confident reading of the game meant he probably shaded it ahead of Blind.\nReaction\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I think we played better than last week. For an away match I am very happy. We kept the ball better in the first 20 minutes, we scored a fantastic goal. After that we were a little bit nervous but in the second half we played very controlled football and could have scored more than one.\"\nAston Villa captain Micah Richards: \"If you look at our team from the beginning of last season to this season there are some really exciting players - good ball players in midfield with power and pace all over. It is exciting times, not the result we wanted but we move on.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJanuzaj's goal ended his drought of 1,169 minutes in the Premier League. It was his first since April 2014 against Newcastle.\nRooney has not scored an away goal in the Premier League since November 2014.\nMata has two assists in his last 20 Premier League appearances - both have come against Aston Villa.\nVilla have now won just one of their past 40 Premier League games against Manchester United."

But we restricted them to few chances. The changes made a bit of a difference. This is their cup final in a lot of respects. It was a wonderful atmosphere.\"\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"I am happy with the performance of the team. We tried to find space to attack and created chances. The players feel good and are full of confidence. They are competitive in the matches.\n\"Most important is that the fans are happy. We are working like a club, like a family.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Brom extended their unbeaten run against Watford in the league to 15 matches (W8 D7)\nThe Baggies have mustered just two shots on target from their opening two matches\nWest Brom failed to score in consecutive Premier League games under Tony Pulis for only the second time\nWatford are unbeaten in their last four Premier League games\nThis was the first top-flight meeting between these sides since December 1985",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester City 3-0 Chelsea\nManchester City laid down a significant early marker in the Premier League title race with a commanding dismissal of champions Chelsea at Etihad Stadium.\nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho's turbulent week - shaped by the controversy surrounding the demotion of medical staff Eva Carneiro and Jon Fearn - ended in misery as he saw his side outclassed by a resurgent City.\nSergio Aguero had been thwarted three times by Chelsea keeper Asmir Begovic before giving City a deserved lead just after the half-hour, an advantage they never looked like losing.\nCity's superiority was emphasised with two more late goals as captain Vincent Kompany headed in David Silva's corner and midfielder Fernandinho sent a thunderous finish past Begovic, whose excellent performance was just about the only positive for Chelsea.\nCity manager Manuel Pellegrini was left frustrated last season as his lavishly talented squad failed to live up to their potential, but all the riches were on show in front of a record crowd of 54,331 at the newly extended Etihad as they demonstrated a desire to reclaim the title Chelsea took from them last season.\nRead in-depth analysis from MOTD2's Alan Shearer on what went wrong for Chelsea\nManchester City look lean and hungry again\nSo often last season, in a lame Premier League title defence, City looked like a team resting on their laurels and lacking the hunger and desire to claim the big domestic prize.\nThe evidence so far this season, both here and in the victory at West Bromwich Albion on Monday, suggests the fires have been rekindled - and in this mood they take some stopping.\nCaptain Kompany was a dominant figure, adding another goal to his first of the season at The Hawthorns and looking to have regained much of his old authority, barely giving Chelsea's attack, led by the combustible Diego Costa, a chance.\nYaya Toure looked back to his best with Fernandinho as the perfect foil, while an attack of the world-class pair of Aguero and Silva, now augmented by \u00a349m Raheem Sterling, looks loaded with menace.\nThis was a powerful statement of intent.\nMourinho needs reinforcements\nChelsea look a long way short of the side that controlled the Premier League title race from start to finish last season - and Mourinho surely needs to get busy in the transfer market between now and deadline day.\nEverton's John Stones has been the subject of two failed bids of \u00a320m and \u00a326m - and there was enough vulnerability on show here to suggest Mourinho may try to go back to the negotiating table. The problem he has is Everton have no intention of selling their elegant young England defender.\nJohn Terry, who has been a reliable figure at the centre of the defence, was replaced at half-time, with Mourinho confirming afterwards that his captain was not carrying an injury.\nThe jury remains out on whether the on-loan Falcao is an able deputy or assistant to Costa, who has proved vulnerable to hamstring injuries. This is no fault of the Colombian and he was making his way on to the pitch as a substitute when Kompany doubled City's lead.\nNew faces may be necessary simply to freshen the squad but at least Mourinho knows he has a fine deputy in goal as Begovic produced a superb display standing in for the suspended Thibaut Courtois.\nSterling can flourish surrounded by quality\nRaheem Sterling, even at \u00a349m, is very much a work in progress and this was proved again here as moments of quality were occasionally mixed with poor end product.\nBut it can only be to his, City and England's benefit to be working in such close proximity to world-class operators like Aguero and Silva. Remember how outstanding he was playing alongside Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge at Liverpool when they almost won the league?\nSterling is in the learning process and will get the perfect education from the movement, finishing, creation and ruthlessness of Aguero and Silva.\nWhen he can add even more of his own flourishes, City will be even more of a threat than they already are.\nMan of the match: Fernandinho\nManager reaction\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to BBC Sport: \"To play against Chelsea is always very difficult - they defend with a lot of players and are fast on the counter-attack.\n\"But today we made a complete game, not only because we scored three goals but in the first 45 minutes we could have scored three more. Only the great performance of Asmir Begovic was the reason why we couldn't.\n\"We played in the way I like, to always try to score more. It was a great performance.\"\nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were the best team by far in the second half. What they did in the first we did in the second.\n\"We dominated and when they feel they are in trouble, and they felt, they changed Aguero and Sterling. They try to recover control of the game exactly when they scored the second goal.\n\"Their goalkeeper was good and we couldn't score. They were only coming up with long balls. Not one single problem in the second half; they had lots.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea defender John Terry was substituted in a Premier League game for the first time since May 2013 (v Aston Villa) and for the first time under Jose Mourinho.\nChelsea had to wait until the 70th minute for their first shot on target.\nManchester City defender Vincent Kompany has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since December 2013.\nThis is the first time under Jose Mourinho that Chelsea have conceded more than once in Manchester (v City or United).\nThe last time Chelsea failed to win their first two Premier League games was 1998-99.\nUp next\nIt doesn't get any easier for Chelsea. Their next match is away to West Bromwich Albion on 23 August. Last season they lost 3-0 at The Hawthorns.\nManchester City will attempt to make it three wins out of three when they visit Everton on 23 August.\nSocial media reaction"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Crystal Palace 1-2 Arsenal\nArsenal recovered from their opening-day defeat by West Ham to record a hard-fought victory at Crystal Palace.\nAlexis Sanchez had three shots blocked as the Gunners began aggressively before Olivier Giroud got the opener.\nThe Frenchman's superb scissor kick put away a Mesut Ozil cross but the lead lasted 12 minutes until Joel Ward's driven shot drew Palace level.\nConnor Wickham hit the post on his home debut before Damian Delaney sliced a Sanchez header into his own net.\nJordon Mutch almost inadvertently grabbed a late equaliser when the ball struck his head and went over from a corner, while Petr Cech held a Ward header in a frantic finish.\nBut despite Palace's combative display, Arsene Wenger's side ultimately deserved the three points for the quality of their movement and resilience in defence.\nRelive Arsenal's win at Crystal Palace\nAre Arsenal back on track?\nGunners boss Arsene Wenger said the way in which his side responded to the 2-0 home defeat by West Ham last Sunday would define their season.\nSanchez returned for a first start since his extended break following the Copa America and injected the Gunners with an immediate dose of urgency in attack.\nThe Chile international was a constant menace in the opening stages and his hard running set the tone, but Wenger will be more pleased by the way in which the Gunners reasserted their dominance after being pegged back.\nOzil, Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey continued to pester Palace with their crisp passing and aggressive movement and Sanchez's determination was the key factor in re-taking the lead.\nHe leaped over right-back Ward at the back post to force Delaney into the own goal, but Giroud's effort will live longer in the memory. The 28-year-old showed beautiful technique to retain his balance and strike the ball sweetly as he controlled his fall away from goal.\nHow far did Palace push them?\nArsenal definitely rode their luck at times. Wickham was close to putting Palace ahead after the break and Jason Puncheon finished tamely when presented with a brilliant chance.\nFrancis Coquelin was perhaps fortunate to have picked up just the one yellow card before being replaced, with referee Lee Mason taking a lenient view of the Frenchman's persistent fouling.\nCech was at fault for both of West Ham's goals but there was little he could do about Palace's equaliser as Ward's driven strike was clipping the inside of post by the time he had reached the full length of this dive.\nThere were still a few nervy moments for the goalkeeper - most notably when clearing high balls as Palace looked to make the most of set pieces - but overall Arsenal looked more likely to score a third than Palace equalising for a second time.\nMan of the match: Mesut Ozil\nManager reaction\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The game changed on two incidents. We hit the post at 1-1 and you have to argue they are lucky to have 11 players. Everyone knew in the stadium Francis Coquelin should have gone.\n\"The game was very even, they play a different style.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Liverpool 1-0 Bournemouth\nChristian Benteke's controversial winner on his Anfield debut ensured Liverpool maintained their 100% start to the new season with an unconvincing victory over Premier League newcomers Bournemouth.\nLiverpool's \u00a332.5m summer signing from Aston Villa turned home from close range in front of the Kop after 26 minutes - but Philippe Coutinho was clearly offside as he also tried to reach Jordan Henderson's cross.\nIt meant a second successive narrow defeat for Bournemouth, who showed plenty of confidence and promise and were also frustrated when Tommy Elphick's early header was ruled out by referee Craig Pawson for a foul on Dejan Lovren.\nRelive all the action from Anfield as it happened\nListen to BBC Radio 5 live's commentary of the winning goal\nMini Monday Night Club podcast: Post-match reaction from Anfield\nEddie Howe's side had plenty of possession but rarely troubled Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and it was Benteke who came closest to adding a second on his impressive Anfield bow when he struck the bar from close range in the last minute.\nIt was a case of job done for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers in front of watching owner John W Henry with a second win and second clean sheet of the new season.\nBig man Benteke delivers\nBenteke was Liverpool's biggest summer investment and Rodgers needs him to deliver - and fast - to ease the pain of last season.\nAnd the early signs were very promising, not just with his winning goal, but also his all-round play.\nThe giant Belgian showed his power in the air on several occasions, demonstrating a physical presence that will give a Reds side with a possession-heavy game an added dimension.\nBenteke also showed good team awareness and pace on several occasions, his link with Coutinho looked like it could be highly productive as the season progresses.\nBournemouth can take heart\nIt has been a hard landing for Bournemouth in the Premier League with defeats by Aston Villa and now Liverpool, but there is plenty for Howe to take away from this visit to one of the biggest stages in English football.\nThe Cherries may need to solve a lack of goals in coming months but they were not daunted by Liverpool or the Kop and played with a confident passing style that will certainly not look out of place in the top flight.\nIt will be a tough season for Bournemouth and that early table does not look good, but on this evidence there is not the slightest reason for despondency for Howe and his players other than in the pain of another defeat. They were excellent for long spells.\nNew rule same old problems\nThe offside rule has been tweaked to supposedly clear up the grey area of when a player is interfering with play only for Bournemouth to find themselves the victim of a situation this was meant to avoid when Benteke scored Liverpool's winner.\nThe new rule states \"a player in an offside position shall be penalised if he clearly attempts to play a ball which is close to him when this action impacts on an opponent or makes an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball.\"\nA very offside Coutinho was clearly trying to play the ball when he stretched to Henderson's cross, just failing but then seeing the ball fall for Benteke to turn in.\nThe goal was still given and Bournemouth were left nursing a heavy sense of injustice.\nMan of the Match - Christian Benteke (Liverpool)\nManager reaction\nLiverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I haven't seen their disallowed goal or ours and the most important thing is ours stood.\n\"We said it would be a tough game. Defensively we were very good. Our play was better after the goal, I am very pleased.\n\"Christian Benteke is bedding into a new team but you could see his threat. I'm very pleased for the players, six points, two clean sheets and the team will grow.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is tough to take but we have to. We are learning tough lessons, the margins for success are small. It will be character building.\n\"I didn't say a lot to the officials. They have a hard job but I will speak to then privately. I want feedback on the decisions.\n\"We had a few chances but the big positive is overall our performance. We know if we perform like that the results and goals will come. The players are winners and this is an experience we don't want to get used to.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool remain unbeaten in all competitions against Bournemouth (W5 D2).\nSince his Liverpool debut in the Premier League, only Steven Gerrard (25) has more Premier League assists for Liverpool than Jordan Henderson (22).\nHenderson has 10 assists in the Premier League since the start of last season; more than any other English player.\nChristian Benteke's goal in this game was his 50th in English club football (all comps).\nBenteke has now scored 12 goals in his last 13 Premier League appearances.\nThis is the sixth time in Premier League history that Liverpool have won their opening two games of the season.\nLiverpool have now won four successive Premier League games played on a Monday.\nSimon Mignolet has kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League goalkeeper in 2015.\nUp next\nIt's been a good start for Liverpool - results wise - but they face their first big test of the season next Monday when they travel to Arsenal, where they lost 4-1 in April.\nFor Bournemouth it's a trip to the capital on Saturday where they will seek their first points of the season at West Ham United.\nSocial media reaction"

Straight from the beginning they showed the commitment which is normal but which we have been missing.\n\"It was a clear penalty but I can still live with a 1-1 as Swansea are a good side. It was handball.\n\"We still need two or three other players.\"\nSwansea manager Garry Monk: \"We are a little disappointed in the changing room. We knew that Sunderland would put in a reaction after the criticism that they received.\n\"The first 20 minutes in the second half was total dominance. We created numerous chances and that's the thing we have to learn from as that's the period when you have to get that second goal.\n\"I can't be too disappointed as the players have put a lot of effort and quality into the game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland covered more distance than the opposition for the first time this season.\nThe Black Cats are winless in the last 18 Premier League games in which they have conceded the opening goal (D4, L14).\nThe home side managed to draw despite having just two shots on target to Swansea's nine.\nSwansea striker Gomis has netted eight times in nine league games.\nWhat the pundits said\nBBC Sport's Steve Claridge: \"At last, Sunderland have shown a bit of character and fight for their supporters. Their goal was a typical Jermain Defoe effort, through the legs of the defender and into the bottom corner.\"",

And then his second. And then a third.\nThe former England Under-21 striker scored 23 goals last season following his \u00a33m move from Coventry as the Cherries were promoted to the Premier League.\nThe 23-year-old, who only made his full Football League debut in 2013, opened the scoring from Simon Francis's cross which he met with a venomous effort. His second was another first-time punt, this time after some poor Cresswell control in the box.\nHe passed up the opportunity to complete his hat-trick late in the first half when he squared to Gradel but it came from the spot with 11 minutes left.\nDefensive errors and poor discipline cost Hammers\nWest Ham have only themselves to blame for their disappointing start to the season.\nA Europa League qualifying exit was followed by a 2-0 win over Arsenal, but back-to-back defeats by some of the Premier League's weaker teams could cause manager Slaven Bilic to worry about his side's mentality.\nCresswell was the club's player of the year in 2014 but was horribly caught out by Francis for Bournemouth's opener and then sloppily controlled the ball which gifted Wilson his second goal.\nWest Ham improved a bit after the break, leading to their comeback, but the game was beyond them when Gradel destroyed Jenkinson for pace, which led to the defender fouling him for a penalty and red card.\nAnd yet again Bilic - who accepted Jenkinson was rightly sent off - will need to reshuffle his team as a result of suspension, with the Arsenal loanee picking up their fifth red card in nine games this season.\nMan of the match: Callum Wilson\n'Hammers need better mentality'\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"It went wrong from the start. We played a very bad first half. It is very hard to explain three of their four goals - you can't make errors like that at this level. They were more lively and more aggressive but you can't make those mistakes.\n\"It's not an alarming situation but we can't continue to play without more desire. We simply need a better mentality.\"\nBournemouth forward Callum Wilson: \"It's a fantastic day on a personal note but the important thing is we got the three points.\n\"In the first two games I think there were nerves, but today I felt we showed real confidence.\n\"There's a few things we need to brush up on but it's a fantastic result and instils confidence into the team.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was a really strange game. We were in cruise control in the first half but that seemed to go out of the window after half-time when we made some strange decisions.\n\"The only disappointment at half-time was that we were not more than 2-0 up.\n\"We have been really heartened by the two previous games but when you don't win then naturally the players will question whether we are doing the right things.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nCallum Wilson has scored more away goals than any other player in the top four tiers since the start of last season (15).\nWilson is only the fifth player in Premier League history to score an away hat-trick for a newly promoted sides (after Phillips, Stewart, Earnshaw and Tchoyi).\nDarren Randolph has conceded 20 goals in his last four league appearances against Bournemouth.\nThe Cherries have won 17 penalties since the start of last season; three more than any other club in the top four tiers.",

The Algerian's goal capped another fine display on the wing and he always looked dangerous when he came inside and ran at the Tottenham defence.\nTottenham miss Christian Eriksen\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said before the game that his need for another striker to help Kane was \"obvious\".\nHe will not have seen anything against the Foxes to change that opinion, with West Brom's Saido Berahino looking like the leading contender to plug that gap.\nWhat will also concern Pochettino is his side's lack of creativity against Leicester with Christian Eriksen absent with a knee injury.\nEriksen's absence left Mousa Dembele, Nacer Chadli and Erik Lamela as the attacking trio behind Kane.\nDembele had a couple of shots from distance in the first half, Chadli set up Spurs' goal, but Lamela was again ineffective as Tottenham struggled to turn their superior possession into chances.\nMan of the match: Riyad Mahrez\nManager reaction\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"Tottenham kept possession of the ball but we created the same chances and 1-1 is the right result.\n\"I am happy, My players have a fantastic spirit. It was an outstanding goal and Riyad Mahrez is a very good player.\n\"It is important to maintain our place in the Premier League. Seven points, 33 less, that is important for us.\"\nTottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was 50/50, a very difficult game for both teams. Second half we played much better.\n\"I am disappointed with the draw. Last game against Stoke we lost a 2-0 lead and we did it again. We deserved more again but it is a shame.\n\"I am angry and disappointed, not frustrated. The mistake we made today is difficult to explain.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester City have won 29 Premier League points since 1 April; more than any other side.\nMahrez has scored six goals in his last six Premier League appearances, including four in his three PL games in 2015-16.\nSpurs' Dele Alli scored his first Premier League goal in this match and at 19 years, 132 days is the youngest player to score for Tottenham in the PL since Gareth Bale (18 years, 60 days) netted against Arsenal in September 2007."

His second was another first-time punt, this time after some poor Cresswell control in the box.\nHe passed up the opportunity to complete his hat-trick late in the first half when he squared to Gradel but it came from the spot with 11 minutes left.\nDefensive errors and poor discipline cost Hammers\nWest Ham have only themselves to blame for their disappointing start to the season.\nA Europa League qualifying exit was followed by a 2-0 win over Arsenal, but back-to-back defeats by some of the Premier League's weaker teams could cause manager Slaven Bilic to worry about his side's mentality.\nCresswell was the club's player of the year in 2014 but was horribly caught out by Francis for Bournemouth's opener and then sloppily controlled the ball which gifted Wilson his second goal.\nWest Ham improved a bit after the break, leading to their comeback, but the game was beyond them when Gradel destroyed Jenkinson for pace, which led to the defender fouling him for a penalty and red card.\nAnd yet again Bilic - who accepted Jenkinson was rightly sent off - will need to reshuffle his team as a result of suspension, with the Arsenal loanee picking up their fifth red card in nine games this season.\nMan of the match: Callum Wilson\n'Hammers need better mentality'\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"It went wrong from the start. We played a very bad first half. It is very hard to explain three of their four goals - you can't make errors like that at this level. They were more lively and more aggressive but you can't make those mistakes.\n\"It's not an alarming situation but we can't continue to play without more desire. We simply need a better mentality.\"\nBournemouth forward Callum Wilson: \"It's a fantastic day on a personal note but the important thing is we got the three points.\n\"In the first two games I think there were nerves, but today I felt we showed real confidence.\n\"There's a few things we need to brush up on but it's a fantastic result and instils confidence into the team.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was a really strange game. We were in cruise control in the first half but that seemed to go out of the window after half-time when we made some strange decisions.\n\"The only disappointment at half-time was that we were not more than 2-0 up.\n\"We have been really heartened by the two previous games but when you don't win then naturally the players will question whether we are doing the right things.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nCallum Wilson has scored more away goals than any other player in the top four tiers since the start of last season (15).\nWilson is only the fifth player in Premier League history to score an away hat-trick for a newly promoted sides (after Phillips, Stewart, Earnshaw and Tchoyi).\nDarren Randolph has conceded 20 goals in his last four league appearances against Bournemouth.\nThe Cherries have won 17 penalties since the start of last season; three more than any other club in the top four tiers."

As their regular penalty taker, he may have saved Morrison's early embarrassment, particularly as the Scottish international insisted on taking the spot kick ahead of Brunt after a lengthy discussion.\n'Transfer window very unsettling for Berahino'\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis on Saido Berahino's omission: \"I had a chat with him yesterday and it's very unsettling. He's a great lad but he is a young lad. I just cannot believe we are talking about something that is not even going to happen today affecting the kid.\n\"We should all be talking about the football. The transfer window should close and the season should start and everybody should be talking about football and not other things.\n\"We have been working hard to try and bring players in but this all could have finished three weeks ago.\"\n'People love Chelsea to lose'\nChelsea boss Jose Mourinho: \"Many people in this moment are disappointed in this result. People love Chelsea to lose a game.\n\"The performance was not dramatic, not bad but obviously four points in three matches is not enough. It's our first step, three points. There is a feeling we are fighting against a lot but today we won.\"\nRead more about Mourinho discussing Terry's red card and Pedro's debut.\nThe stats you need to know\nJohn Terry's red card was his first in the Premier League since April 2010 and his fifth overall.\nThis is the first time James Morrison has scored twice in a Premier League game. That total equals his tally from last season.\nThis is the second time in Premier League history that three Spanish players have scored for the same team in the same game since Michu, Pablo Hernandez and Angel Rangel scored for Swansea against QPR in February 2013.",

as well on visits to Burnley and Crystal Palace.\nThere was a sense that Manuel Pellegrini's team were resting on their status as reigning champions and paid the price for complacency setting in.\nIt may have been the loss of that title and the criticism that came with it but there was not a bit of complacency here as they came to Goodison Park, where they have struggled so badly in the past, and came away deserved winners.\nCity showed strength as the back when required in the face of a very good Everton challenge, with Eliaquim Mangala faring much better against Romelu Lukaku than he did last season and showing he will not step aside easily for \u00a330m new boy Nicolas Otamendi, and real class in attack.\nWith Yaya Toure rejuvenated, Silva, Sergio Aguero and Sterling have licence to be expansive and after showing they could be a force at home with their dismissal of champions Chelsea, this was a real show of strength at Goodison Park, a ground where no-one has an easy ride.\nJohn Stones shows touches of class\nJohn Stones went into this game shrouded in speculation about his Everton future with Chelsea reportedly considering a fourth bid to take the 21-year-old England defender to Stamford Bridge having had a third offer of \u00a330m turned down.\nIt is easy to see why Everton insist he will not be sold - and why Chelsea will not go away in their pursuit of a player they see as the heir apparent to John Terry at the heart of their defence.\nStones was easy on the eye, showing great composure on the ball and a willingness to mix it in the tackle that shows there is steel beneath the elegant exterior.\nHe is still progressing, however, and it showed in one of two moments when his willingness to play his way out of trouble led to an anxious moment and also when he was involved in a mix-up with young Everton team-mate Tylas Browning that led to a chance for Jesus Navas.\nStones showed enough elsewhere, though, to illustrate exactly why he is so coveted and regarded as a player with a glittering future for club and country.\nRaheem Sterling proves his worth\nSterling has hinted at why Manchester City were prepared to part with \u00a349m to bring him from Liverpool in his first two games - here he showed exactly what he can add to Manuel Pellegrini's side.\nSterling had to put up with inevitable jeers from Everton supporters as a former Liverpool player (although hardly a taste of what he will receive when he gets back to Anfield) but he played without a care in the world and was a constant threat.\nHe had a fascinating battle with Everton right-back Seamus Coleman throughout the game and both emerged with credit, Sterling playing in Silva for a shot against the post then setting up Kolarov for his goal.\nSterling showed pace, strength and industry to give City the width to get in behind Everton's defence in his before performance since his expensive switch from Liverpool.\nMan of the match: David Silva (Manchester City)\nThe Spanish magician was a constant source of danger from the first whistle with his brilliant close control and superb vision.\nSilva knits it all together for City and his link with Sterling and Sergio Aguero is rich in possibilities for City.\nHe could have had a goal but struck a post with a thunderous shot but contributed enough elsewhere to make him City's main man again.\n'Sterling gives us different pace'\nManchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"We have different pace with Sterling. It's a different way to play. It's important to have different things to do during the game. It's important to have a good squad because we play so many games in a season.\"\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"It's a little bit hard to take because I think we had very good moments. If we could get the first goal it would have changed the game. Overall I felt we didn't have that bit of luck you need in the six-yard box.\"\nWho's up next for both teams?\nManchester City will hope they can continue their perfect start to the season when they face Premier League newcomers Watford next Saturday at Etihad Stadium before they travel to Crystal Palace after the international break.\nAfter Everton have travelled to Barnsley for a second-round League Cup tie, they will face an early test against one of their potential Europe-chasing rivals at Tottenham. The Toffees then host Chelsea at Goodison after the break.\nReaction on social media",

They changed their plan and it was difficult.\n\"We had maybe two or three chances. It was difficult to create opportunities because they played well and defended with five players.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman:\n\"We played a little bit different than the first two games because we had to be defensively better. In my opinion, it always starts at the back and at least we had our first clean sheet of the season.\n\"One of the key points of last season was that we had a strong defensive organisation.\"\nSouthampton's Sadio Mane and Victor Wanyama have been linked with moves to Manchester United and Tottenham respectively but Koeman added: \"We know have to deal with speculation over our players.\n\"Again, no-one is for sale. Everyone stays at Southampton. We want to bring in another defender.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford failed to have a shot on target in this match, with all 13 of their efforts being blocked or off target.\nTroy Deeney has only scored two goals in his last 11 appearances for Watford.\nThe Saints have won just one of their last nine Premier League games (won one, drew three, lost five), but this was their first clean sheet in that run.\nWhat next?\nWatford will travel to Preston on Tuesday for a League Cup second-round match. Southampton face a trip to Denmark to play FC Midtjylland in the second leg of their Europa League qualifier on Thursday with the tie poised at 1-1."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "West Bromwich Albion 2-3 Chelsea\nJohn Terry was sent off as Pedro inspired Chelsea to a first Premier League win of the season at West Brom.\nThibaut Courtois saved James Morrison's early penalty but Pedro, who signed from Barcelona for \u00a321m this week, fired in before setting up Diego Costa.\nMorrison then atoned for his earlier error with a crisp strike before Cesar Azpilicueta made it 3-1 at the break.\nTerry saw red for a second-half foul on Salomon Rondon but Morrison's header was not enough as Chelsea hung on.\nRead in-depth analysis from MOTD2's Martin Keown on John Terry's \"worst nightmare\"\nThe result ended a poor start to the season for Chelsea, who have raised as many talking points off the field as on it following controversy surrounding the treatment of their medical staff and Terry's half-time substitution in the 3-0 loss at Manchester City last Sunday.\nAnd in another eventful game for the champions, Jose Mourinho's side will face further questions as their captain's 54th-minute dismissal gave West Brom a huge lift following a first half where Tony Pulis's team were outclassed at times.\nUnlike their previous two games Pedro provided them with enough inspiration to build the foundations for an edgy win, though they were given an early let-off after Nemanja Matic tripped Callum McManaman for the early spot-kick.\nRelive Chelsea's win over West Brom\nMan of the match Pedro inspires on debut\nAfter beating Manchester United to sign three-time Champions League winner Pedro, Chelsea benefitted from the 28-year-old's pace and incisiveness as the club's Spanish international contingent scored three times before the break.\nMourinho had criticised some of his players after earning only a point in their first two games, but Pedro gave their attacking an extra thrust, particularly on the counter attack.\nHaving already played alongside Cesc Fabregas while at Barcelona, the new recruit was heavily involved from the start, also linking well with Eden Hazard, who had his best game of the season so far after often coming inside to join-up with play.\nIt was from that combination that Pedro grabbed the opener, while his quick thinking was evident as he set up Costa for the second, the attack stemming from a West Brom corner.\nAs the game wore on, Pedro's influence faded before he was replaced six minutes from time, but it was more to do with Chelsea being reduced to 10-men after Terry's shaky start to the second half.\nFurther questions over Terry\nHaving been substituted at half-time against Manchester City last Sunday, Terry was included alongside Kurt Zouma at the heart of the central defence as Gary Cahill made way.\nBut England international Cahill was on the field by the 56th minute following Terry's dismissal where he was outpaced by West Brom's record \u00a312m signing Rondon, who was making his full debut after signing from Zenit St Petersburg.\nThe Venezuelan international had already set up Morrison's first goal before he latched onto Chris Brunt's through ball and was tugged back by 34-year-old Terry, who was sent off for the first time in the Premier League since 2010.\nDespite the Chelsea skipper's complaints, referee Mark Clattenburg appeared to make a good decision as Rondon bore down on goal with the initial contact coming outside the penalty area.\nRondon's resulting free-kick was deflected over but he made an encouraging debut.\nRondon shows promise in place of Berahino\nRondon's inclusion came after West Brom boss Tony Pulis took the decision to leave Saido Berahino out of his squad following interest from Tottenham, who are reported to have had a \u00a315m bid rejected by the Baggies.\nPulis complained before the game about the transfer window affecting players' concentration but the manager will have been buoyed by Rondon's display.\nThe former Crystal Palace and Stoke manager accepted criticism for playing with two strikers in their opening defeat by Manchester City, but he was far more cautious on this occasion and did not introduce forward Rickie Lambert until Chelsea were down to 10 men.\nHe could look back on Berahino's omission with some regret, though. As their regular penalty taker, he may have saved Morrison's early embarrassment, particularly as the Scottish international insisted on taking the spot kick ahead of Brunt after a lengthy discussion.\n'Transfer window very unsettling for Berahino'\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis on Saido Berahino's omission: \"I had a chat with him yesterday and it's very unsettling. He's a great lad but he is a young lad. I just cannot believe we are talking about something that is not even going to happen today affecting the kid.\n\"We should all be talking about the football. The transfer window should close and the season should start and everybody should be talking about football and not other things.\n\"We have been working hard to try and bring players in but this all could have finished three weeks ago.\"\n'People love Chelsea to lose'\nChelsea boss Jose Mourinho: \"Many people in this moment are disappointed in this result. People love Chelsea to lose a game.\n\"The performance was not dramatic, not bad but obviously four points in three matches is not enough. It's our first step, three points. There is a feeling we are fighting against a lot but today we won.\"\nRead more about Mourinho discussing Terry's red card and Pedro's debut.\nThe stats you need to know\nJohn Terry's red card was his first in the Premier League since April 2010 and his fifth overall.\nThis is the first time James Morrison has scored twice in a Premier League game. That total equals his tally from last season.\nThis is the second time in Premier League history that three Spanish players have scored for the same team in the same game since Michu, Pablo Hernandez and Angel Rangel scored for Swansea against QPR in February 2013."

The Algerian's goal capped another fine display on the wing and he always looked dangerous when he came inside and ran at the Tottenham defence.\nTottenham miss Christian Eriksen\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said before the game that his need for another striker to help Kane was \"obvious\".\nHe will not have seen anything against the Foxes to change that opinion, with West Brom's Saido Berahino looking like the leading contender to plug that gap.\nWhat will also concern Pochettino is his side's lack of creativity against Leicester with Christian Eriksen absent with a knee injury.\nEriksen's absence left Mousa Dembele, Nacer Chadli and Erik Lamela as the attacking trio behind Kane.\nDembele had a couple of shots from distance in the first half, Chadli set up Spurs' goal, but Lamela was again ineffective as Tottenham struggled to turn their superior possession into chances.\nMan of the match: Riyad Mahrez\nManager reaction\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"Tottenham kept possession of the ball but we created the same chances and 1-1 is the right result.\n\"I am happy, My players have a fantastic spirit. It was an outstanding goal and Riyad Mahrez is a very good player.\n\"It is important to maintain our place in the Premier League. Seven points, 33 less, that is important for us.\"\nTottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was 50/50, a very difficult game for both teams. Second half we played much better.\n\"I am disappointed with the draw. Last game against Stoke we lost a 2-0 lead and we did it again. We deserved more again but it is a shame.\n\"I am angry and disappointed, not frustrated. The mistake we made today is difficult to explain.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester City have won 29 Premier League points since 1 April; more than any other side.\nMahrez has scored six goals in his last six Premier League appearances, including four in his three PL games in 2015-16.\nSpurs' Dele Alli scored his first Premier League goal in this match and at 19 years, 132 days is the youngest player to score for Tottenham in the PL since Gareth Bale (18 years, 60 days) netted against Arsenal in September 2007.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Everton 0-2 Manchester City\nManchester City maintained their flawless start to the Premier League season to go top of the table with victory at Everton.\nAleksandar Kolarov and substitute Samir Nasri struck after the break to make it three wins from three for City, who have yet to concede a goal as they lay down another marker that they are determined to reclaim their crown from Chelsea.\nEverton, buoyed by a fine win at Southampton last weekend, gave City a real run for their money but David Silva had already hit an upright before Kolarov took advantage of poor goalkeeping from Tim Howard to take Raheem Sterling's pass and score at the near post on the hour.\nRomelu Lukaku glanced the bar with a free-kick for Everton at the end of an evenly-contested first 45 minutes but City's greater quality made the difference after the break and it was an uphill battle for Roberto Martinez's men once Kolarov had broken the deadlock.\nVincent Kompany came to City's rescue late on when he cleared Gareth Barry's header off the line and the destiny of the three points was settled when Nasri played a neat one-two with Yaya Toure to lift a finish over the advancing Howard with two minutes left.\nCity demonstrated their credentials with their comprehensive victory over champions Chelsea at Etihad Stadium last Sunday and this was just as impressive as they emerged unscathed from a potentially hazardous visit to Goodison Park.\nFollow all the match reaction\nManchester City have ominous look\nThis was the sort of game where Manchester City were so often found wanting last season, caught short on trips to Liverpool and Manchester United - as well on visits to Burnley and Crystal Palace.\nThere was a sense that Manuel Pellegrini's team were resting on their status as reigning champions and paid the price for complacency setting in.\nIt may have been the loss of that title and the criticism that came with it but there was not a bit of complacency here as they came to Goodison Park, where they have struggled so badly in the past, and came away deserved winners.\nCity showed strength as the back when required in the face of a very good Everton challenge, with Eliaquim Mangala faring much better against Romelu Lukaku than he did last season and showing he will not step aside easily for \u00a330m new boy Nicolas Otamendi, and real class in attack.\nWith Yaya Toure rejuvenated, Silva, Sergio Aguero and Sterling have licence to be expansive and after showing they could be a force at home with their dismissal of champions Chelsea, this was a real show of strength at Goodison Park, a ground where no-one has an easy ride.\nJohn Stones shows touches of class\nJohn Stones went into this game shrouded in speculation about his Everton future with Chelsea reportedly considering a fourth bid to take the 21-year-old England defender to Stamford Bridge having had a third offer of \u00a330m turned down.\nIt is easy to see why Everton insist he will not be sold - and why Chelsea will not go away in their pursuit of a player they see as the heir apparent to John Terry at the heart of their defence.\nStones was easy on the eye, showing great composure on the ball and a willingness to mix it in the tackle that shows there is steel beneath the elegant exterior.\nHe is still progressing, however, and it showed in one of two moments when his willingness to play his way out of trouble led to an anxious moment and also when he was involved in a mix-up with young Everton team-mate Tylas Browning that led to a chance for Jesus Navas.\nStones showed enough elsewhere, though, to illustrate exactly why he is so coveted and regarded as a player with a glittering future for club and country.\nRaheem Sterling proves his worth\nSterling has hinted at why Manchester City were prepared to part with \u00a349m to bring him from Liverpool in his first two games - here he showed exactly what he can add to Manuel Pellegrini's side.\nSterling had to put up with inevitable jeers from Everton supporters as a former Liverpool player (although hardly a taste of what he will receive when he gets back to Anfield) but he played without a care in the world and was a constant threat.\nHe had a fascinating battle with Everton right-back Seamus Coleman throughout the game and both emerged with credit, Sterling playing in Silva for a shot against the post then setting up Kolarov for his goal.\nSterling showed pace, strength and industry to give City the width to get in behind Everton's defence in his before performance since his expensive switch from Liverpool.\nMan of the match: David Silva (Manchester City)\nThe Spanish magician was a constant source of danger from the first whistle with his brilliant close control and superb vision.\nSilva knits it all together for City and his link with Sterling and Sergio Aguero is rich in possibilities for City.\nHe could have had a goal but struck a post with a thunderous shot but contributed enough elsewhere to make him City's main man again.\n'Sterling gives us different pace'\nManchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"We have different pace with Sterling. It's a different way to play. It's important to have different things to do during the game. It's important to have a good squad because we play so many games in a season.\"\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"It's a little bit hard to take because I think we had very good moments. If we could get the first goal it would have changed the game. Overall I felt we didn't have that bit of luck you need in the six-yard box.\"\nWho's up next for both teams?\nManchester City will hope they can continue their perfect start to the season when they face Premier League newcomers Watford next Saturday at Etihad Stadium before they travel to Crystal Palace after the international break.\nAfter Everton have travelled to Barnsley for a second-round League Cup tie, they will face an early test against one of their potential Europe-chasing rivals at Tottenham. The Toffees then host Chelsea at Goodison after the break.\nReaction on social media"

They changed their plan and it was difficult.\n\"We had maybe two or three chances. It was difficult to create opportunities because they played well and defended with five players.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman:\n\"We played a little bit different than the first two games because we had to be defensively better. In my opinion, it always starts at the back and at least we had our first clean sheet of the season.\n\"One of the key points of last season was that we had a strong defensive organisation.\"\nSouthampton's Sadio Mane and Victor Wanyama have been linked with moves to Manchester United and Tottenham respectively but Koeman added: \"We know have to deal with speculation over our players.\n\"Again, no-one is for sale. Everyone stays at Southampton. We want to bring in another defender.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford failed to have a shot on target in this match, with all 13 of their efforts being blocked or off target.\nTroy Deeney has only scored two goals in his last 11 appearances for Watford.\nThe Saints have won just one of their last nine Premier League games (won one, drew three, lost five), but this was their first clean sheet in that run.\nWhat next?\nWatford will travel to Preston on Tuesday for a League Cup second-round match.

Perhaps he just needs a break.\nTottenham have signed forward Son Heung-min from Bayer Leverkusen for \u00a322m, and remain keen on West Brom's Saido Berahino, so he might get some time out of the firing line.\nMartinez has been cute with Stones\nWhile Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal refuses to pick unsettled goalkeeper David De Gea because of concerns over his focus amid interest from Real Madrid, Stones remains a fixture in Everton's starting line-up.\nIf Everton chairman Bill Kenwright's determination not to sell the 21-year-old England international is admirable, Martinez's insistence on picking him could prove to be a canny piece of man-management.\nRather than isolate Stones and drive a wedge between the pair, Martinez has ensured their personal relationship remains unaffected.\nStones produced a composed and defensively sound performance and it certainly did not suggest a player who had his head turned.\nMan of the match - Tim Howard\nManagers' reaction\nTottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino: \"We created a lot of chances but you need to score. It was impossible today but I am happy with the performance. I am happy with Harry Kane, he had two or three clear chances but I am happy. He needs to work hard and play. A goal will come for Harry. All strikers have spells like this and only time can do it. I trust in him.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"John Stones was an immense influence on what we did defensively. The reading of the game, he looks like a player who has grown in the last few weeks under the pressure and speculation. Every single Evertonian will show that respect to him for the way he has handled the situation. You can see the signs of a future England captain.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton have failed to score in four of their last five Premier League games with Spurs\nHarry Kane has scored just two goals in his last 12 Premier League appearances\nEverton have now lost just one of their last five away league matches\nThat was only Tottenham's second clean sheet at home in the league in 2015\n'The best Spurs have been this season'\nBBC Radio London's Bradley Allen: \"Some of the Tottenham fans are right to be disappointed because that was probably the best Spurs have played so far this season. Everton were solid defensively, Tim Howard made some fine saves, and it just wasn't Spurs' evening.\"\nWhat next?\nEverton host Premier League champions Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday, 12 September where John Stones could once again be the centre of attention.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 1-2 Crystal Palace\nJose Mourinho suffered only his second defeat in his 100th home league game in charge of Chelsea as Crystal Palace claimed a shock win at Stamford Bridge.\nAfter a goalless first half in which Chelsea dominated possession, Palace took the lead when Bakary Sako drove in after Yannick Bolasie's low cross.\nChelsea responded when substitute Radamel Falcao headed in his first goal for the club.\nPalace regained the lead immediately as Joel Ward nodded in a late winner.\nRelive Crystal Palace's win at Chelsea\nReaction to this match and the rest of Saturday's action\nChelsea, the reigning Premier League champions, are now eight points behind leaders Manchester City after four games.\nThey have been far from convincing so far this season having collected just four points, with only one of those picked up on home soil.\nMourinho called the 3-0 loss to Manchester City \"a fake result\" but it is hard to argue that Palace were not good value for this win.\nAlex McCarthy produced a fine double-save to deny Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas in the first half, while Kurt Zouma had a penalty claim waved away, but otherwise the hosts were restricted to few clear-cut chances.\nInstead, Palace could have won by a bigger margin, with Bolasie missing from close range when the visitors led 1-0.\nA case for the defence?\nA major contributing factor to Chelsea's disappointing start to the season has been their defence, with the Blues having now conceded nine goals in just four games.\nThe hosts were forced into a change at centre-back because of John Terry's suspension and Gary Cahill was the player to step in and partner Kurt Zouma.\nMourinho continues to be frustrated in his pursuit of Everton defender John Stones, but it was not the middle of the defence that gave him the most cause for concern on Saturday.\nBranislav Ivanovic has struggled for form so far this term and Palace targeted the right-back, with 50% of their attacks in the first half coming down that side of the pitch.\nCrucially, Ivanovic was caught out when Sako was allowed to provide the ball for Ward to score the decisive goal.\nEagles soar again\nCrystal Palace made the short trip across London looking to record only their second league victory at Stamford Bridge - and first since 1982.\nHowever, the Eagles arrived at Chelsea boasting one of the strongest away records in the Premier League in 2015, having lost just two of their nine games on the road since Alan Pardew was appointed on 3 January, winning the rest.\nPart of the reason for Palace's impressive away form has been the expansive, attacking football Pardew has encouraged his side to play and that was certainly on show at Chelsea.\nWhile the hosts may have dominated possession, Palace were dangerous on the counter, with Sako exploiting gaps left by Ivanovic in the first half on a number of occasions.\nCreativity concern for Chelsea\nEden Hazard was a pivotal player for Chelsea last season, inspiring them to a first Premier League title in five years.\nSuch was his influence throughout 2014-15 that the Belgian has found himself a marked man in the current campaign, with as many as three players closing him down whenever he is in possession.\nChelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said recently\n, external\nthat the arrival of Pedro would help alleviate the burden on Hazard and allow him to rediscover his creative spark, but once again he failed to shine.\nPedro was Chelsea's main creative outlet and he created as many chances (five) as Hazard and Willian combined.\nWhile the Blues' defence arguably needs strengthening, their lack of bite in attack will also be a cause for concern for Mourinho.\nMan of the match - Bakary Sako\nManagers' reaction\nChelsea boss Jose Mourinho: \"We didn't deserve to lose. But Palace gave us a very difficult game. The result should be a draw, which would still be bad for us. We did enough not to lose.\"\nRead more as Mourinho discusses his team's start to the season.\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"It was a really good performance today - one of the best performances I've seen from one of my teams in terms of composure. We can frighten teams with our pace and we did that from start to finish. Our defenders had to defend really well and they did.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea's four-point total is the second lowest tally at this stage of a Premier League season by a reigning champion.\nThe Blues have conceded nine goals in four league games this season; their worst defensive record at this stage since 1971-72.\nBakary Sako has scored five goals and made four assists in his last nine league appearances (for Wolves and Crystal Palace).\nNo team has won more points than Crystal Palace away from home in the Premier League in 2015 (25 - same as Arsenal).\nWho's up next?\nAfter the international break, Mourinho takes his Chelsea side to Everton on 12 September while Crystal Palace host Manchester City on the same day."

Silva fed Sagna, whose cross was converted by Sterling six yards out.\nIt was an ominous sign for City's title rivals and Pellegrini's attacking options will only increase if, as expected, Kevin de Bruyne completes his move from Wolfsburg before the transfer window closes on Tuesday.\nThe 24-year-old Belgium midfielder, who will cost more than \u00a350m, is set to have a medical with City this weekend.\nMan of the match - Man City's Raheem Sterling\nManager reaction\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It was not frustrating in the first half. You can't expect to win the game inside 45 minutes against a team who defends well. We made some changes and we created more chances and won the game.\"\nOn goalscorer Raheem Sterling: \"Raheem played very well. It was good for him to score. He worked very hard and I'm sure he'll score more goals.\"\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We were prepared for a difficult match and we were there to resist and contain City.\n\"They have some high quality technical and physical players so it is hard to do that here but we had the feeling in the first half they had a lot of problems, we defended well and restricted the space very well.\n\"It was disappointing to concede the goal so early in the second half but the difference between us and City is high, and we gave our best. Losing here while fighting to play well is a positive thing for Watford.\"\nWhat next?\nCity will return to action after the international break with an intriguing top-of-the-table trip to Crystal Palace, who are second after their shock win over defending champions Chelsea.\nWatford will continue their hunt for a first win of the season when they host Swansea.\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have become the ninth team to win 10 or more successive Premier League games.\nWatford have won just three of their 40 Premier League away matches (W3 D7 L30).\nWatford have failed to register a shot on target in their last two Premier League games.\nMan City are unbeaten in their last 25 home Premier League games against newly promoted opposition (W23 D2 L0), with their last defeat coming against Reading in February 2007.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Swansea City 2-1 Manchester United\nSwansea City staged a stirring comeback to inflict a first defeat of the season on Manchester United.\nAfter the Swans had edged a goalless first half, United took the lead early in the second as Luke Shaw's marauding run and cross set up Juan Mata to blast in from close range.\nAndre Ayew headed the hosts level after a swift counter-attack as United conceded their first league goal of the season.\nAyew then provided a marvellous pass for Bafetimbi Gomis, whose shot squirmed under Sergio Romero to give Swansea a third straight win against United.\nHaving done the double against United for the first time last season, Garry Monk's side became only the sixth team to claim three successive league victories against the Red Devils.\nFor visiting manager Louis van Gaal, a first loss of the campaign was a miserable way to mark his 50th game in charge.\nRead in-depth analysis from MOTD2's Jason Roberts on why Wayne Rooney needs help up front for Man Utd\nUnited's defensive fragility\nWith both teams protecting unbeaten starts to the season, there was a bristling intensity to the early exchanges.\nUnited had not conceded in their opening three matches, but that record was under threat as Swansea pressed with chances for Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson.\nDaley Blind, a midfielder currently playing at centre-back, offered little resistance as Gomis skipped past him and his central defensive colleague Chris Smalling before clipping the post with a delicate low shot.\nThose fragilities were eventually exposed when Ayew and Gomis took advantage of slack marking and dubious goalkeeping to put Swansea ahead.\nMonk's masterstroke\nThere may have been a few eyebrows raised when, with his team trailing after 57 minutes, Monk replaced winger Wayne Routledge with midfielder Ki Sung-yueng.\nBut the switch to a midfield diamond was vindicated after just four minutes as Ashley Williams strode out of defence and freed Sigurdsson, whose precise cross found Ayew for Swansea's equaliser.\nThe hosts were ahead four minutes later, as Ayew's artful through-ball with the outside of his foot found Gomis, whose low finish beyond Romero sent the Liberty Stadium crowd wild and gave Monk the satisfaction of a tactical alteration paying off in style.\nVan Gaal's midfield headache\nUnited's two changes from the midweek Champions League win at Club Brugge saw Van Gaal recall two of his highest-profile summer signings, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin.\nThat pushed fellow central midfielder Ander Herrera into a more advanced role behind striker Wayne Rooney, but United struggled for fluency.\nThe one positive was another bright display from Mata but, playing in his unfavoured position wide on the right, he was substituted after 70 minutes.\nMan of the match: Andre Ayew\nPost-match reaction:\nSwansea manager Garry Monk: \"It was an amazing atmosphere. The first half, Manchester United played very well and made it very difficult for us.\n\"We showed our character. I don't think we were at our best, but we were organised and kept our shape.\n\"They were causing us problems centrally. I changed it with four midfielders inside and that allowed us to get into the game.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"We controlled the game for 85 minutes but we lost in five minutes and that cannot happen.\n\"They changed the shape and we had to be compact. We forgot that maybe because we are too dominant. We have to learn from that.\n\"First you have to create chances, with scoring goals you need luck that we don't have at the moment.\n\"I have enjoyed our football but you need the result and we lost again. All the players were very motivated to beat them.\"\nPundit analysis\nFormer Arsenal striker Ian Wright on BBC Radio 5 live: \"I haven't got a clue what Van Gaal is trying to do. What's their system? Surely Manchester United have got to play with a bit more pace and thrust and tempo. They seemed desperate.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea have won four of the last five meetings with Manchester United in all competitions, all by a 2-1 scoreline.\nManchester United's last two Premier League defeats from leading positions have both come against Swansea City.\nAndre Ayew has scored in both of his Premier League appearances at the Liberty Stadium. He also provided the assist for Gomis' strike.\nBafetimbi Gomis has scored nine goals in his last 10 Premier League games for Swansea.\nGomis is the first Swansea player to score in each of their opening four games of a Premier League season.\nGylfi Sigurdsson has provided 14 Premier League assists for Swansea; more than any other player.\nLuke Shaw provided his first Premier League assist for Manchester United in what was his 20th appearance.\nIt is only the second time in his career that Wayne Rooney has gone 10 Premier League games without a goal. The previous occasion was between August and December 2003 while at Everton. Rooney's current goal drought stands at 864 minutes.\nWhat's next?\nThe international break allows both teams to take stock. Once the Premier League returns, Manchester United take on north-west rivals Liverpool in the tea-time game on Saturday, 12 September.\nSwansea will travel away to Watford earlier in the day."

What a crowd as well. It was a harsh red card. It was more clumsy and he stood on his foot.

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Chelsea 1-2 Crystal Palace\nJose Mourinho suffered only his second defeat in his 100th home league game in charge of Chelsea as Crystal Palace claimed a shock win at Stamford Bridge.\nAfter a goalless first half in which Chelsea dominated possession, Palace took the lead when Bakary Sako drove in after Yannick Bolasie's low cross.\nChelsea responded when substitute Radamel Falcao headed in his first goal for the club.\nPalace regained the lead immediately as Joel Ward nodded in a late winner.\nRelive Crystal Palace's win at Chelsea\nReaction to this match and the rest of Saturday's action\nChelsea, the reigning Premier League champions, are now eight points behind leaders Manchester City after four games.\nThey have been far from convincing so far this season having collected just four points, with only one of those picked up on home soil.\nMourinho called the 3-0 loss to Manchester City \"a fake result\" but it is hard to argue that Palace were not good value for this win.\nAlex McCarthy produced a fine double-save to deny Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas in the first half, while Kurt Zouma had a penalty claim waved away, but otherwise the hosts were restricted to few clear-cut chances.\nInstead, Palace could have won by a bigger margin, with Bolasie missing from close range when the visitors led 1-0.\nA case for the defence?\nA major contributing factor to Chelsea's disappointing start to the season has been their defence, with the Blues having now conceded nine goals in just four games.\nThe hosts were forced into a change at centre-back because of John Terry's suspension and Gary Cahill was the player to step in and partner Kurt Zouma.\nMourinho continues to be frustrated in his pursuit of Everton defender John Stones, but it was not the middle of the defence that gave him the most cause for concern on Saturday.\nBranislav Ivanovic has struggled for form so far this term and Palace targeted the right-back, with 50% of their attacks in the first half coming down that side of the pitch.\nCrucially, Ivanovic was caught out when Sako was allowed to provide the ball for Ward to score the decisive goal.\nEagles soar again\nCrystal Palace made the short trip across London looking to record only their second league victory at Stamford Bridge - and first since 1982.\nHowever, the Eagles arrived at Chelsea boasting one of the strongest away records in the Premier League in 2015, having lost just two of their nine games on the road since Alan Pardew was appointed on 3 January, winning the rest.\nPart of the reason for Palace's impressive away form has been the expansive, attacking football Pardew has encouraged his side to play and that was certainly on show at Chelsea.\nWhile the hosts may have dominated possession, Palace were dangerous on the counter, with Sako exploiting gaps left by Ivanovic in the first half on a number of occasions.\nCreativity concern for Chelsea\nEden Hazard was a pivotal player for Chelsea last season, inspiring them to a first Premier League title in five years.\nSuch was his influence throughout 2014-15 that the Belgian has found himself a marked man in the current campaign, with as many as three players closing him down whenever he is in possession.\nChelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said recently\n, external\nthat the arrival of Pedro would help alleviate the burden on Hazard and allow him to rediscover his creative spark, but once again he failed to shine.\nPedro was Chelsea's main creative outlet and he created as many chances (five) as Hazard and Willian combined.\nWhile the Blues' defence arguably needs strengthening, their lack of bite in attack will also be a cause for concern for Mourinho.\nMan of the match - Bakary Sako\nManagers' reaction\nChelsea boss Jose Mourinho: \"We didn't deserve to lose. But Palace gave us a very difficult game. The result should be a draw, which would still be bad for us. We did enough not to lose.\"\nRead more as Mourinho discusses his team's start to the season.\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"It was a really good performance today - one of the best performances I've seen from one of my teams in terms of composure. We can frighten teams with our pace and we did that from start to finish. Our defenders had to defend really well and they did.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea's four-point total is the second lowest tally at this stage of a Premier League season by a reigning champion.\nThe Blues have conceded nine goals in four league games this season; their worst defensive record at this stage since 1971-72.\nBakary Sako has scored five goals and made four assists in his last nine league appearances (for Wolves and Crystal Palace).\nNo team has won more points than Crystal Palace away from home in the Premier League in 2015 (25 - same as Arsenal).\nWho's up next?\nAfter the international break, Mourinho takes his Chelsea side to Everton on 12 September while Crystal Palace host Manchester City on the same day.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester City 2-0 Watford\nRaheem Sterling's first goal for Manchester City ended Watford's resistance and helped his side continue their 100% winning start to the season.\nThe Hornets dug in well for the first half but the game changed 88 seconds after the interval when Sterling slotted home Bacary Sagna's cross.\nFernandinho made it 2-0 with a fierce finish from David Silva's pass.\nWatford did not manage a single shot on target as City saw out the win to move three points clear at the top.\nThe victory was City's 10th in a row, breaking a 103-year-old club record, and they are still to concede a goal in any of their four Premier League games this season.\nWatford, who had arrived at Etihad Stadium on the back of three straight draws, looked well organised as they frustrated the home side before the break but carried little threat when they tried to fight back after falling behind.\nReaction to this match and the rest of Saturday's action here\nRelive Manchester City's victory over Watford\nHornets set out to stop City\nWatford's gameplan worked superbly when the game was goalless, with City failing to find a way through the visitors in the first 45 minutes.\nThe Hornets did more than just work hard and defend in numbers, they kept City out thanks to some impressive organisation.\nTroy Deeney was nominally Watford's lone striker in their 4-2-3-1 formation but actually operated as a deep-lying right-sided midfielder, helping to shield his defence when City left-back Aleksandar Kolarov made his frequent forays forward.\nCity essentially faced two banks of five defenders, and the speed on their flanks offered by Sterling and Jesus Navas could not make a difference.\nSterling had City's best chance of the first half when his was shot turned round the post by Heurelho Gomes, but that was the only time he got a clear sight of goal.\nCity make changes to make the breakthrough\nLast season, City boss Manuel Pellegrini was accused of tactical inflexibility when his team struggled to break down down defensive-minded sides.\nBut his half-time switch made the difference on Saturday - and showed the greater depth now available in his squad.\nNavas was taken off and Silva moved over to the right, with Samir Nasri coming on to play on the left and Sterling being pushed up through the middle.\nWithin seconds, the change had an effect. Silva fed Sagna, whose cross was converted by Sterling six yards out.\nIt was an ominous sign for City's title rivals and Pellegrini's attacking options will only increase if, as expected, Kevin de Bruyne completes his move from Wolfsburg before the transfer window closes on Tuesday.\nThe 24-year-old Belgium midfielder, who will cost more than \u00a350m, is set to have a medical with City this weekend.\nMan of the match - Man City's Raheem Sterling\nManager reaction\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It was not frustrating in the first half. You can't expect to win the game inside 45 minutes against a team who defends well. We made some changes and we created more chances and won the game.\"\nOn goalscorer Raheem Sterling: \"Raheem played very well. It was good for him to score. He worked very hard and I'm sure he'll score more goals.\"\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We were prepared for a difficult match and we were there to resist and contain City.\n\"They have some high quality technical and physical players so it is hard to do that here but we had the feeling in the first half they had a lot of problems, we defended well and restricted the space very well.\n\"It was disappointing to concede the goal so early in the second half but the difference between us and City is high, and we gave our best. Losing here while fighting to play well is a positive thing for Watford.\"\nWhat next?\nCity will return to action after the international break with an intriguing top-of-the-table trip to Crystal Palace, who are second after their shock win over defending champions Chelsea.\nWatford will continue their hunt for a first win of the season when they host Swansea.\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have become the ninth team to win 10 or more successive Premier League games.\nWatford have won just three of their 40 Premier League away matches (W3 D7 L30).\nWatford have failed to register a shot on target in their last two Premier League games.\nMan City are unbeaten in their last 25 home Premier League games against newly promoted opposition (W23 D2 L0), with their last defeat coming against Reading in February 2007."

Gardner was booked for his contribution.\nIt went from bad to worse for the hosts, Adam sent off after the referee consulted his assistant following a challenge involving Dawson.\nTelevision replays showed Adam's foot made contact with Dawson's knee when the West Brom player was on the ground.\nWorrying times for Stoke\nThere was much to admire about Stoke after they were reduced to nine men.\nThey made West Brom work hard for their three points but Mark Hughes's side remain without a win this season and will be without two key players for their next game at Arsenal.\nMidfielder Xherdan Shaqiri, the Potters' star summer signing, showed his quality in spells but, whatever their feelings about the refereeing decisions, Stoke's uncertain start to the season continues.\nMan of the match - Rickie Lambert\nManagers' reaction\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes: \"I'm delighted with the performance of my team under difficult circumstances.\n\"The first red card, Ibrahim Affelay reacted to being flicked in the face. By the letter of the law, maybe they both should have been sent off.\n\"With the second one, Charlie Adam ends up standing on the lad's leg after the other player had followed through on him. I think it was harsh.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We moved the ball too slowly when they went down to nine men.\n\"We tried to open it up a bit by bringing on Rickie Lambert and Callum McManaman.\n\"To play Manchester City and Chelsea in our first two home games, it's been a tough start. For us to be sat with four points from four games is not bad. We're happy with that.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is the 10th time that a side have been reduced to nine men in the Premier League before half-time.\nThe last team to have two men sent off in the first half of a Premier League game before today was also Stoke (v Newcastle on 26 December 2013).\nSolomon Rondon scored his first Premier League goal for West Bromwich Albion with his seventh shot.\nWhat's next?\nAfter a tough start against Chelsea and Manchester City, West Brom's season is up and running.\nPulis's team will return from the international break with some winnable fixtures, Southampton the visitors on 12 September.\nBut will striker Saido Berahino, left out of the this game amid speculation linking him with a move away, still be at the club?\nTwo points from four games is not the start Stoke were looking for and it does not get any easier for the Potters.\nTheir next game is at Arsenal on 12 September.\n'Soft' dismissal?\nFormer Wales striker John Hartson on Afellay's red card on Final Score: \"There's nothing in it.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 1-1 Leicester City\nJamie Vardy's late penalty earned Leicester a draw away to Bournemouth and preserved his side's unbeaten start to the Premier League season.\nCallum Wilson's bicycle kick opened the scoring for Bournemouth after Max Gradel's deflected header fell kindly.\nThe Cherries were forced to make three substitutions through injuries as goalkeeper Artur Boruc was a spectator for much of the game.\nBut Vardy levelled after being fouled in the box with four minutes to play.\nThe 28-year-old's hard running was the brightest feature Leicester's display and he tricked Bournemouth defender Steve Cook into scything him down with some neat footwork.\nThe result means Claudio Ranieri remains unbeaten in his first four matches in charge of the Foxes, while Eddie Howe's Bournemouth go into the international break with four points from their first four games in the top flight.\nReaction to this match and the rest of Saturday's action\nRelive Bournemouth's draw with Leicester\nWhere was Riyad Mahrez?\nRiyad Mahrez had been Leicester's stand-out performer of the season so far, scoring four goals in the first three games.\nBut against Bournemouth he was taken off at half-time after a poor display. The 24-year-old was clattered into by Max Gradel almost immediately from kick-off and Ranieri said after the game the Algerian winger had struggled to recover.\nInstead it was Bournemouth who looked by far the more dangerous side in the opening 45, but in the second half they struggled to cope with the changes enforced on them by injury.\nBoruc had a quiet first half but remained alert to save from Jeff Schlupp and Danny Drinkwater before Vardy levelled from the penalty spot - despite the Polish goalkeeper getting a hand on it.\nDo England have a new number nine?\nWith England playing San Marino and Switzerland in two European Championship qualifiers next Saturday and Tuesday, it will not have escaped manager Roy Hodgson's attention that it is an Englishman who jointly leads the Premier League scoring charts.\nWilson scored a brilliant hat-trick in last weekend's 4-3 win at West Ham and got his fourth goal of the campaign to level with Mahrez after showing brilliant predatory technique to turn home Bournemouth's first-ever top flight goal at home.\nCharlie Daniels' cross from the left was met by Gradel, his header hit a Leicester back and Wilson swivelled sharply before smashing home beautifully with his back to goal.\nThe 23-year-old is not in contention for a place in Hodgson's squad but had his link-up play with summer signing Lee Tomlin been slightly more polished, he could have scored a few more.\nTomlin showed good promise in the playmaker role but Leicester's defence was solid. At times you might argue it was too solid, as first Bournemouth left-back Daniels, then his \u00a38m replacement Tyrone Mings, who came on for his Premier League debut, and lastly winger Gradel were all forced off through injury.\nMan of the match - Callum Wilson\nManager reaction\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were still dominant for long periods but I think the injuries were key in the game, particularly in our ability to change tactically, and it's not nice when you see your team-mates going of injured.\n\"They all look nasty and at the moment they are in the treatment room being assessed, although we won't know how serious they are until they get scanned.\n\"I think we've had a decent enough start in terms of performances. I'm a bit disappointed not to have got more points. I thought we could have got three today, but sometimes you have to be a grateful for a point.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We conceded the goal and until then we were playing well. After the goal we slowed down the tempo and had no great personality.\n\"There were 10 minutes when Bournemouth played very well. In the second half we put them under pressure and made some good chances. I think at the end we deserved to draw.\n\"It's important to take one point from a difficult match. We have a week now where the players go to their national team and when they come back we must re-start with the same mentality.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nVardy has three goals and an assist from his last five Premier League appearances.\nFive of the eight penalties in the top-flight this season have been won and taken by the same player, including Vardy's today.\nLeicester City have gone five away games unbeaten for the first time in the Premier League.\nBournemouth have only lost one of their last 12 home league matches (W6 D5).\nWhat next?\nBournemouth will be hopeful of picking up more points from their next three games against Norwich, Sunderland and Stoke after the international break.\nLeicester will look to keep their good run going through matches against Aston Villa and Stoke before welcoming Arsenal."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Swansea City 2-1 Manchester United\nSwansea City staged a stirring comeback to inflict a first defeat of the season on Manchester United.\nAfter the Swans had edged a goalless first half, United took the lead early in the second as Luke Shaw's marauding run and cross set up Juan Mata to blast in from close range.\nAndre Ayew headed the hosts level after a swift counter-attack as United conceded their first league goal of the season.\nAyew then provided a marvellous pass for Bafetimbi Gomis, whose shot squirmed under Sergio Romero to give Swansea a third straight win against United.\nHaving done the double against United for the first time last season, Garry Monk's side became only the sixth team to claim three successive league victories against the Red Devils.\nFor visiting manager Louis van Gaal, a first loss of the campaign was a miserable way to mark his 50th game in charge.\nRead in-depth analysis from MOTD2's Jason Roberts on why Wayne Rooney needs help up front for Man Utd\nUnited's defensive fragility\nWith both teams protecting unbeaten starts to the season, there was a bristling intensity to the early exchanges.\nUnited had not conceded in their opening three matches, but that record was under threat as Swansea pressed with chances for Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson.\nDaley Blind, a midfielder currently playing at centre-back, offered little resistance as Gomis skipped past him and his central defensive colleague Chris Smalling before clipping the post with a delicate low shot.\nThose fragilities were eventually exposed when Ayew and Gomis took advantage of slack marking and dubious goalkeeping to put Swansea ahead.\nMonk's masterstroke\nThere may have been a few eyebrows raised when, with his team trailing after 57 minutes, Monk replaced winger Wayne Routledge with midfielder Ki Sung-yueng.\nBut the switch to a midfield diamond was vindicated after just four minutes as Ashley Williams strode out of defence and freed Sigurdsson, whose precise cross found Ayew for Swansea's equaliser.\nThe hosts were ahead four minutes later, as Ayew's artful through-ball with the outside of his foot found Gomis, whose low finish beyond Romero sent the Liberty Stadium crowd wild and gave Monk the satisfaction of a tactical alteration paying off in style.\nVan Gaal's midfield headache\nUnited's two changes from the midweek Champions League win at Club Brugge saw Van Gaal recall two of his highest-profile summer signings, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin.\nThat pushed fellow central midfielder Ander Herrera into a more advanced role behind striker Wayne Rooney, but United struggled for fluency.\nThe one positive was another bright display from Mata but, playing in his unfavoured position wide on the right, he was substituted after 70 minutes.\nMan of the match: Andre Ayew\nPost-match reaction:\nSwansea manager Garry Monk: \"It was an amazing atmosphere. The first half, Manchester United played very well and made it very difficult for us.\n\"We showed our character. I don't think we were at our best, but we were organised and kept our shape.\n\"They were causing us problems centrally. I changed it with four midfielders inside and that allowed us to get into the game.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"We controlled the game for 85 minutes but we lost in five minutes and that cannot happen.\n\"They changed the shape and we had to be compact. We forgot that maybe because we are too dominant. We have to learn from that.\n\"First you have to create chances, with scoring goals you need luck that we don't have at the moment.\n\"I have enjoyed our football but you need the result and we lost again. All the players were very motivated to beat them.\"\nPundit analysis\nFormer Arsenal striker Ian Wright on BBC Radio 5 live: \"I haven't got a clue what Van Gaal is trying to do. What's their system? Surely Manchester United have got to play with a bit more pace and thrust and tempo. They seemed desperate.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea have won four of the last five meetings with Manchester United in all competitions, all by a 2-1 scoreline.\nManchester United's last two Premier League defeats from leading positions have both come against Swansea City.\nAndre Ayew has scored in both of his Premier League appearances at the Liberty Stadium. He also provided the assist for Gomis' strike.\nBafetimbi Gomis has scored nine goals in his last 10 Premier League games for Swansea.\nGomis is the first Swansea player to score in each of their opening four games of a Premier League season.\nGylfi Sigurdsson has provided 14 Premier League assists for Swansea; more than any other player.\nLuke Shaw provided his first Premier League assist for Manchester United in what was his 20th appearance.\nIt is only the second time in his career that Wayne Rooney has gone 10 Premier League games without a goal. The previous occasion was between August and December 2003 while at Everton. Rooney's current goal drought stands at 864 minutes.\nWhat's next?\nThe international break allows both teams to take stock. Once the Premier League returns, Manchester United take on north-west rivals Liverpool in the tea-time game on Saturday, 12 September.\nSwansea will travel away to Watford earlier in the day.",

We were well organised. We had a plan, but the boys perfectly did that plan. Their movement, concentration and aggression was 90% of the game.\n\"We parked the bus but we didn't put the handbrake on. There is nothing wrong with that. It means when the opponent has the ball you stop them. When needed we were there with nine men but when we had the chance we had players in their part of the pitch.\n\"With the greatest respect to the official, Mark Noble's sending off is not a red card.\"\nLiverpool boss Brendan Rodgers: \"We're disappointed with the result. We came into the game with a motivation to win but we give away a poor goal and you have to give credit to West Ham.\n\"We didn't defend moments well at all. We didn't have too many times to defend but when we did it wasn't how we've been. Offensively we weren't creative enough. We need to be much better than that.\n\"I didn't think Coutinho was a sending off and neither was the one for Noble.\"\nWhat next?\nLiverpool travel to Manchester United after the international break for a clash between two sides with top-four ambitions. United are at Swansea on Sunday and a win would leave them three points above Liverpool.\nWest Ham will hope to halt a run of two straight home defeats with a match against Newcastle at Upton Park.\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Ham's win at Liverpool ends a run of 42 league Anfield visits without a victory.\nWest Ham have been shown six red cards in 10 games this season in all competitions, compared to three in 43 last term.\nManuel Lanzini's goal is the fastest scored in the Premier League so far in 2015-16, clocking in at two minutes and 28 seconds.\nWest Ham had only 37% possession during the game and only 18% of it was spent in Liverpool's third.\nLiverpool mustered just one shot on target in this game; the third time that they have had just one shot on target at Anfield in a Premier League match since the start of last season."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 1-1 Leicester City\nJamie Vardy's late penalty earned Leicester a draw away to Bournemouth and preserved his side's unbeaten start to the Premier League season.\nCallum Wilson's bicycle kick opened the scoring for Bournemouth after Max Gradel's deflected header fell kindly.\nThe Cherries were forced to make three substitutions through injuries as goalkeeper Artur Boruc was a spectator for much of the game.\nBut Vardy levelled after being fouled in the box with four minutes to play.\nThe 28-year-old's hard running was the brightest feature Leicester's display and he tricked Bournemouth defender Steve Cook into scything him down with some neat footwork.\nThe result means Claudio Ranieri remains unbeaten in his first four matches in charge of the Foxes, while Eddie Howe's Bournemouth go into the international break with four points from their first four games in the top flight.\nReaction to this match and the rest of Saturday's action\nRelive Bournemouth's draw with Leicester\nWhere was Riyad Mahrez?\nRiyad Mahrez had been Leicester's stand-out performer of the season so far, scoring four goals in the first three games.\nBut against Bournemouth he was taken off at half-time after a poor display. The 24-year-old was clattered into by Max Gradel almost immediately from kick-off and Ranieri said after the game the Algerian winger had struggled to recover.\nInstead it was Bournemouth who looked by far the more dangerous side in the opening 45, but in the second half they struggled to cope with the changes enforced on them by injury.\nBoruc had a quiet first half but remained alert to save from Jeff Schlupp and Danny Drinkwater before Vardy levelled from the penalty spot - despite the Polish goalkeeper getting a hand on it.\nDo England have a new number nine?\nWith England playing San Marino and Switzerland in two European Championship qualifiers next Saturday and Tuesday, it will not have escaped manager Roy Hodgson's attention that it is an Englishman who jointly leads the Premier League scoring charts.\nWilson scored a brilliant hat-trick in last weekend's 4-3 win at West Ham and got his fourth goal of the campaign to level with Mahrez after showing brilliant predatory technique to turn home Bournemouth's first-ever top flight goal at home.\nCharlie Daniels' cross from the left was met by Gradel, his header hit a Leicester back and Wilson swivelled sharply before smashing home beautifully with his back to goal.\nThe 23-year-old is not in contention for a place in Hodgson's squad but had his link-up play with summer signing Lee Tomlin been slightly more polished, he could have scored a few more.\nTomlin showed good promise in the playmaker role but Leicester's defence was solid. At times you might argue it was too solid, as first Bournemouth left-back Daniels, then his \u00a38m replacement Tyrone Mings, who came on for his Premier League debut, and lastly winger Gradel were all forced off through injury.\nMan of the match - Callum Wilson\nManager reaction\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were still dominant for long periods but I think the injuries were key in the game, particularly in our ability to change tactically, and it's not nice when you see your team-mates going of injured.\n\"They all look nasty and at the moment they are in the treatment room being assessed, although we won't know how serious they are until they get scanned.\n\"I think we've had a decent enough start in terms of performances. I'm a bit disappointed not to have got more points. I thought we could have got three today, but sometimes you have to be a grateful for a point.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We conceded the goal and until then we were playing well. After the goal we slowed down the tempo and had no great personality.\n\"There were 10 minutes when Bournemouth played very well. In the second half we put them under pressure and made some good chances. I think at the end we deserved to draw.\n\"It's important to take one point from a difficult match. We have a week now where the players go to their national team and when they come back we must re-start with the same mentality.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nVardy has three goals and an assist from his last five Premier League appearances.\nFive of the eight penalties in the top-flight this season have been won and taken by the same player, including Vardy's today.\nLeicester City have gone five away games unbeaten for the first time in the Premier League.\nBournemouth have only lost one of their last 12 home league matches (W6 D5).\nWhat next?\nBournemouth will be hopeful of picking up more points from their next three games against Norwich, Sunderland and Stoke after the international break.\nLeicester will look to keep their good run going through matches against Aston Villa and Stoke before welcoming Arsenal.",

He also recalled John Mikel Obi to partner Matic and reinforce the defensive side of his midfield.\nBut the Blues were quickly two down, while keeper Asmir Begovic - in for the injured Thibaut Courtois - was regularly called upon and made several smart saves, denying Arouna Kone, James McCarthy and Romelu Lukaku.\nMourinho's side have now let in 12 goals this season.\n'Money can't buy you Stones'\nEngland international Stones handed in a transfer request\n, external\nbut Everton held on to him resulting in Toffees supporters chanting \"money can't buy you Stones\" at Chelsea to the tune of The Beatles classic Can't Buy Me Love.\nStones did not take long to show his mind was firmly on the job at hand.

Giroud, meanwhile, missed a near open goal before heading in the decisive second.\nIn the end, Arsenal had 29 shots on goal, 12 of those on target, and their general wastefulness in the final third could be of greater concern against more attack-minded sides.\n'I still have doubts over Walcott up front'\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on Final Score: \"It was a good finish from Theo Walcott for the goal but I still have doubts about him playing as a striker.\n\"He missed two big opportunities before that.

In the second half our pace dropped maybe a little bit in our passing, but we continuously created chances and overall it was a strong performance.\n\"My only regret is that there is too big a difference between the number of chances we made and the number of goals we scored but that will come.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We wanted to make it difficult for Arsenal and get good numbers of bodies around the ball and try to condense play because we know they are very good in wide areas where they look to overload you and look for one-twos around your box.\n\"Unfortunately our defensive play was a bit too passive in terms of getting out to affect what Arsenal were trying to do, especially in the first half.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTheo Walcott scored for a ninth successive Premier League season.\nOlivier Giroud scored only his second goal in his last 12 Premier League appearances.\nMesut Ozil has created 76 goalscoring chances in the Premier League in 2015, more than any other player.\nStoke's total of two points from five games is their worst ever start in the Premier League.\nWho's up next?\nArsenal's attention switches to the Champions League as they travel to Croatia to play Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday.

Winger Moses was substituted in the 88th minute as striker Andy Carroll made his first appearance since February following knee surgery.\nWhere will Newcastle's goals come from?\nNewcastle have not scored since the opening day of the season - a run that stretches for 402 minutes - and they never looked likely to end that drought at Upton Park.\nWithout the suspended Aleksandar Mitrovic, serving a three-game ban after his early sending off against Arsenal, Papiss Cisse played up front but struggled to make an impact.\nRight-back Daryl Janmaat carried the Magpies' greatest threat - an indictment on the attacking performance of a team who had gone more than 200 minutes without a shot on target before this game.\nSubstitutes Siem de Jong, Ayoze Perez and Rolando Aarons gave Newcastle more of a threat, but McClaren must find a solution to his side's scoring problems - and fast - if the positivity surrounding his appointment is to remain.\nMan of the match - Victor Moses (West Ham)\nManager reaction\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We fully deserved the three points, we were better from the start and we scored at the right time.\n\"Newcastle put us under a bit of pressure as we were defending too deep. In the second half I was proud, because we were solid, good at keeping the ball and great at counter attacks.\n\"It is small proof we really did well in the transfer window. Payet is a player I wanted from the start.\n\"I have known him for a long time. He is one of those players who is not only a great player but he makes players around him better.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren told BBC Sport: \"Our platform has been being hard to beat and disciplined, but this was a wake-up call.\n\"I am not blaming the coach journey, you have to deal with that and we didn't deal with it very well.\n\"You need these games, they hurt like mad, but you need them to get the message across.\n\"This is a journey and it is two steps forward one step back, this was two or three steps back. Saturday is very important for us. Our final ball was poor.\"\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Steve Claridge\n\"You can see why Newcastle have not scored since the first game of the season. I don't think the Newcastle players get what Steve McClaren is trying to do at the moment - their system was totally unbalanced.\n\"There was no width and it was all down the middle. But when Ayoze Perez came on it gave Newcastle a whole new dimension - I don't know why he wasn't on from the start.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDimitri Payet has had a hand in 11 goals (four goals, seven assists) in his last 13 league appearances (Premier League and Ligue 1 combined).\nNewcastle have now failed to score in four successive Premier League games - their worst run since April 2014.\nThe Magpies have just two points from their last 10 Premier League away games (won none, drew two, lost eight).\nNewcastle have scored just one goal in their last nine Premier League away games.\nNewcastle have lost their last seven Premier League games played on a Monday, failing to score in the last four in a row.\nWhat next?\nMcClaren will be hoping to get his first Newcastle league win next Saturday when his side entertain Watford at St James' Park.\nWest Ham have what looks to be a much more difficult task as they travel to Etihad Stadium to face a Manchester City side that are top with a 100% record from five games.",

The difference at Vicarage Road on Saturday was that they also managed to score.\nWhat did the Watford forwards do right today?\nThe focus was on last season's hero Deeney, who scored 21 goals in total to help the Hornets to promotion.\nHe has yet to get off the mark this season, but played a major role in the goal and had support on Saturday from the scorer Ighalo.\nThe 26-year-old Nigeria international was impressive as a target man. He caused all sorts of trouble for Swansea's backline, with the usually unflappable Ashley Williams finding it difficult to handle his physical presence and pace.\nHis 84.6% success rate in distribution was the third best in his team and he won 50% of his duels.\nMan of the match - Odion Ighalo (Watford)\nManager reaction\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores:\n\"It was a really big experience to win first match in Premier League. It was a really tough match as Swansea is a good team.\n\"In the first half we played well and had control.

At this level if you defend like we did for the three goals you have to be disappointed.\n\"I thought we were still well in the game at half-time, but in the second half we conceded possession really cheaply.

He came off in the 62nd minute.\nBorini, who spent a successful 2013-14 season on loan, was rather less involved than Son, despite a spritely start to the match.\nWhat are Tottenham missing?\nRemember the days it was a joy to watch a Tottenham team featuring an attack of Gareth Bale, Aaron Lennon, Luka Modric and Emmanuel Adebayor? It is a far less cavalier team under manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nSpurs, who went into the game having only managed three goals in the league, were dire in the final third for much of the match. Only once Erik Lamela and Andros Townsend came on did the visitors provide some bite up front. Mason's winner was the result of a great move, but also the only highlight for the London side.\nThey need a striker to help Kane and probably wish the transfer window was still open.\nMan of the match - Jeremain Lens (Sunderland)\nWhat the managers said - 'Players could not handle speed'\nSunderland manager Dick Advocaat: \"We had the better chances at the start, we knew we were playing against a good side and the speed of the game was unbelievable. Some players could not handle it in the end.\n\"We had to score a goal but it was not to be. At the end of the game, the better side had more luck than we had. Some players still need match fitness.\n\"Everyone did well but up front we could not score that chance we got.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"We will assess Mason tomorrow [he was injured while scoring]. It was a big knock on the knee. It was a great goal and we showed how we try to play.\n\"The first half was 50-50, an open game, but we dominated the second half. I'm very pleased for our first victory. We played a high tempo from the beginning.\n\"I am very happy with Son, he played really well. He is a good player for us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland have conceded 11 goals this season - only Chelsea have conceded more in the league.\nThey have gone eight league matches without a win (D4, L4).\nRyan Mason's goal was only his third for Tottenham in all competitions in 46 appearances.\nSpurs' starting 11 had an average age of 24 years and 135 days, the youngest in the Premier League so far this season.\nWho's up next?\nSunderland have a 353-mile trip to Bournemouth next weekend, followed by a League Cup tie at home to Manchester City. Tottenham are back in Europa League action against Qarabag on Thursday, before they face Crystal Palace at home next Sunday. Will Europa League fatigue set in this season?"

We move on. It's been very difficult for us because of stuff going on away from football, and then we had the international break.\"\nMcManaman's strange penalty appeal\nWith the last four previous matches between the two teams yielding only three goals, chances were likely to be at a premium and in a subdued first-half, McManaman's penalty appeal was the biggest talking point.\nThe Baggies winger was put clear by Rickie Lambert and as he made his way into the area, Targett lunged at him.\nMcManaman managed to touch the ball past the Southampton defender, but before contact came, he seemed to fling himself over his opponent in a theatrical manner, perhaps adding to the decision of referee Stuart Attwell, who waved appeals away.\nPulis, who initially joined those appeals, said afterwards that the referee got it right.\n\"I think Callum McManaman dives first before the player touches him,\" added Pulis. \"I'll be having a word with him about that. It was a good decision by the referee.\"\nMan of the Match: Dusan Tadic (Southampton)\nManager reaction\nSouthampton boss Ronald Koeman: \"I'm a little bit disappointed because we were the better team. We had a lot of ball possession, we didn't create a lot of chances, maybe the best one was in the first half with Jay Rodriguez. In the second half we were not clinical enough.\n\"It was like we were the home team today. It was a difficult game, but we expect this, if we can't win then don't lose.\"\nStats you need to know\nSouthampton completed 522 passes in this game; the most made in a Premier League away game since their return to the league in 2012-13.\nThe Baggies have kept a clean sheet in over half of their 23 Premier League games under Tony Pulis (13 - 57%).\nNo side have kept more clean sheets in the Premier League since Pulis's first game in charge of the Baggies in January 2015 (13).\nSouthampton have won just two of their last 11 Premier League games (drew four, lost five).\nSaints have now failed to score in four of their last six Premier League games."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Arsenal 2-0 Stoke City\nArsenal recorded their first home win of the season as goals from Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud beat Stoke.\nWalcott opened the scoring in the first half when he chased a long ball over the defence from Mesut Ozil before firing low beyond Jack Butland.\nSubstitute Giroud sealed victory late on with a header.\nStoke, who have not won at Arsenal since 1981, rarely looked like scoring, Joselu going closest with a shot at Petr Cech.\nArsenal are third in the Premier League but defeat for Stoke - their second of the season - means they are bottom after five games.\nReaction to this match and the rest of Saturday's action\nRead how Arsenal beat Stoke\nFirepower found?\nArsenal's attacking strength, or perhaps lack of, has come under scrutiny during the early stages of the season, with Arsene Wenger's side having managed just three goals in their four league games prior to the visit of Stoke.\nIt has been at Emirates Stadium in particular where they have struggled, failing to score in a 2-0 defeat by West Ham and a goalless draw with Liverpool.\nWenger is keeping his faith in Walcott and Giroud to score the goals this season but, despite both netting, there were still some areas of concern as the pair spurned good opportunities to seal a victory by a bigger margin.\nWalcott shot wide early on when he should have scored, and later directed a weak effort straight at Butland. Giroud, meanwhile, missed a near open goal before heading in the decisive second.\nIn the end, Arsenal had 29 shots on goal, 12 of those on target, and their general wastefulness in the final third could be of greater concern against more attack-minded sides.\n'I still have doubts over Walcott up front'\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on Final Score: \"It was a good finish from Theo Walcott for the goal but I still have doubts about him playing as a striker.\n\"He missed two big opportunities before that. For one of them, from six yards out he couldn't get his feet right and smashed the ball over the bar.\n\"I just think he'd get just as many goals as he does playing on the right wing.\"\nStoke struggling to adapt?\nStoke, who finished ninth last season, had not won at Arsenal in 34 years, making Emirates Stadium a far from ideal venue for them to try to record their first win of the season.\nHaving developed a reputation for being a physical side in previous years, Mark Hughes is trying to re-invent the Potters and brought in technically gifted players such as Xherdan Shaqiri and Ibrahim Afellay in the summer.\nAfellay was suspended for Saturday's game but Shaqiri had little opportunity to show what he is capable of, with Stoke rarely venturing out of their own half.\nThe Potters have yet to get going this season, having now lost three and drawn two of their five games so far, and a more direct approach might be necessary to start getting the wins they need.\nMan of the match - Jack Butland\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"In the first half our movement was outstanding and we created a lot. In the second half our pace dropped maybe a little bit in our passing, but we continuously created chances and overall it was a strong performance.\n\"My only regret is that there is too big a difference between the number of chances we made and the number of goals we scored but that will come.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We wanted to make it difficult for Arsenal and get good numbers of bodies around the ball and try to condense play because we know they are very good in wide areas where they look to overload you and look for one-twos around your box.\n\"Unfortunately our defensive play was a bit too passive in terms of getting out to affect what Arsenal were trying to do, especially in the first half.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTheo Walcott scored for a ninth successive Premier League season.\nOlivier Giroud scored only his second goal in his last 12 Premier League appearances.\nMesut Ozil has created 76 goalscoring chances in the Premier League in 2015, more than any other player.\nStoke's total of two points from five games is their worst ever start in the Premier League.\nWho's up next?\nArsenal's attention switches to the Champions League as they travel to Croatia to play Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday.

The difference at Vicarage Road on Saturday was that they also managed to score.\nWhat did the Watford forwards do right today?\nThe focus was on last season's hero Deeney, who scored 21 goals in total to help the Hornets to promotion.\nHe has yet to get off the mark this season, but played a major role in the goal and had support on Saturday from the scorer Ighalo.\nThe 26-year-old Nigeria international was impressive as a target man. He caused all sorts of trouble for Swansea's backline, with the usually unflappable Ashley Williams finding it difficult to handle his physical presence and pace.\nHis 84.6% success rate in distribution was the third best in his team and he won 50% of his duels.\nMan of the match - Odion Ighalo (Watford)\nManager reaction\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores:\n\"It was a really big experience to win first match in Premier League. It was a really tough match as Swansea is a good team.\n\"In the first half we played well and had control. It got complicated after the sending off.\n\"In the second half we had to defend a lot, I don't like to play like this. I'm really pleased and would like to dedicate this win to the fans.\"\nSwansea manager Garry Monk:\n\"We got what we deserved. We just didn't perform. We couldn't get into it when the sending off came. We are very disappointed.\n\"We had a lack of focus on the things we do well. Our job is to come back and put those things right.\n\"We have no excuses. We were quite sluggish. I have no complaints with the result.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nOdion Ighalo has scored 18 goals in 23 league appearances in 2015 - more than any other player in the top four tiers this year.\nIglaho's goal was the 100th Premier League goal scored at Vicarage Road - 3044 days after the 99th.\nValon Behrami's red card was his first in 63 Premier League appearances.\nThe Hornets secured their first Premier League win at Vicarage Road since April 2007 (4-2 v Portsmouth).\nWhat next?\nWatford, who have risen to 12th, face a trip to Newcastle next week, while Swansea, who fell to sixth, are at home to Everton.",

I don't look at the table, I look to players, the training session we have and the matches.\n\"Our next match in the Premier League is against Arsenal and we are candidates to win.\"\nChelsea's defensive woes\nChelsea's failed pursuit of Everton centre-back John Stones and reports they had a transfer deadline day offer for Paris St-Germain defender Marquinhos rejected\n, external\nshows where Mourinho thinks he needs strengthen.\nThe Portuguese chose Kurt Zouma to partner John Terry, who was back from a one-game suspension, in central defence and left Gary Cahill on the bench. He also recalled John Mikel Obi to partner Matic and reinforce the defensive side of his midfield.\nBut the Blues were quickly two down, while keeper Asmir Begovic - in for the injured Thibaut Courtois - was regularly called upon and made several smart saves, denying Arouna Kone, James McCarthy and Romelu Lukaku.\nMourinho's side have now let in 12 goals this season.\n'Money can't buy you Stones'\nEngland international Stones handed in a transfer request\n, external\nbut Everton held on to him resulting in Toffees supporters chanting \"money can't buy you Stones\" at Chelsea to the tune of The Beatles classic Can't Buy Me Love.\nStones did not take long to show his mind was firmly on the job at hand. Chelsea striker Diego Costa nutmegged him early on but Stones quickly turned to reach the ball before the Spain international and cleared the danger.\nWhen Cesar Azpilicueta stole in on the right to try to haul Chelsea back into the game, Stones also got in the way of the shot to deflect it into the side-netting.\nHe showed calmness and maturity beyond his 21 years and his partnership with Phil Jagielka blends youth with experience - the latter twice putting in vital tackles on Costa in dangerous situations for the home side.\nCosta struggles\nCosta scored seven goals in his first five league games of last season but has managed just one in the same number of matches so far during the current campaign.\nHe got little change from the Everton defence and was far from the marauding powerhouse we saw early last season.\nCosta may point to the limited service as playmakers Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard made little impact, with the former not having scored or assisted a goal in any of his last six league outings.\nMourinho sent on Radamel Falcao for the ineffective Pedro late on but it made little difference, with Everton the most likely scorers as they played on the counter-attack.\nMan of the match - Steven Naismith\n'I'm the man for the job'\nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho: \"I am not feeling pressure. The results are the worst in my career. They are not adapted to my quality, my status, but I am coping well with the situation.\n\"I am the man for the job. I don't think there is better man who could come and do my job.\"\nHe added: \"Even if we win every game between now and the end of season, we still depend on other results.\"\nRead more as Jose Mourinho discusses the situation at Chelsea.\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"A performance like that gives you a feeling of pride. An incredible team performance.\n\"Steve (Naismith) is a really important player for us, not just today but over the last two seasons he has been growing week by week. He showed everyone that he is ready for his moment and he did it in real style.\"\n'Jose under real pressure'\nFormer Blackburn striker Chris Sutton on Final Score: \"That result was very unlike Chelsea. Jose won't be going anywhere, but you cannot afford to start the Premier League sluggishly and they have done.\n\"They are treading water, or really going backwards. This is the first time in his Chelsea career that he has been under real, real pressure.\n\"Jose Mourinho is talking rubbish, saying his team did not get what they deserved. Everton were much the better side. It's all very well Jose coming out and giving an interview to the media smiling away - he's culpable.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNaismith was the sixth player to score a hat-trick after coming on as a sub in a Premier League game.\nHe also became only the fifth player to score a Premier League hat-trick against Chelsea and the first since Robin van Persie for Arsenal in October 2011.\nThis is the first time that Jose Mourinho has lost two successive Premier League games since May 2006.\nThe last time Chelsea had a worse start to a top-flight season was in 1986-87 (three points - P5 W0 D3 L2). They finished that season in 14th position.\nWhat next?\nChelsea face Maccabi Tel Aviv in their opening Champions League group game on Wednesday, while Everton face a trip to Swansea in the Premier League next Saturday."

He's one of the reasons I didn't bring another striker in when we sold Edin Dzeko.\n\"He deserves that chance.\"\nIs the Premier League City's to lose?\nResults in the Premier League so far this season have shown the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal have struggled to see off teams they would be expected to beat.\nBut Manchester City have had no such problems and on Saturday dominated a battling Crystal Palace - who beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last time out.\nCity are now 11 points clear of champions Chelsea in the Premier League and five ahead of second-placed Arsenal. Far from over but ominous signs for their rivals.\nMan of the match: Kelechi Iheanacho\nPost-match reaction\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: \"Even though we beat Manchester City last season this was a better performance.\n\"It's a shame about the injury to Aguero because we are not a malicious team.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "West Ham United 2-0 Newcastle United\nWest Ham moved up to fifth in the Premier League as two Dimitri Payet goals sent Newcastle bottom.\nPayet gave the hosts an early lead when he curled the ball past Tim Krul from the edge of the area after Mark Noble's low cross from the left wing.\nThe Frenchman grabbed his second with a rebound after Victor Moses had hit the crossbar following a fine run.\nNewcastle struggled in attack and have scored only two goals this season, the lowest tally in the league.\nThe defeat leaves Steve McClaren without a league win since taking over at St James' Park in the summer.\nRelive West Ham's win over Newcastle\nListen to BBC Radio 5 live commentary of the goals\n5 live Football Daily podcast: Fan reaction, debate & social media\nLate arriving and slow starting\nNewcastle have now won only three of 24 Premier League matches in 2015 and it was a routine win for West Ham, who picked up their first home league victory of the season.\nSloppy in possession and unimaginative in attack, the visitors offered little to please the fans who made the long journey from the north east.\nTraffic chaos in east London meant the Newcastle players had to walk the last mile to the stadium - and within eight minutes they were behind.\nIt was a fine finish from Payet, but he was allowed too much time and space on the edge of the penalty area to shoot at goal unchallenged.\nMoses's pace causes Newcastle problems\nVictor Moses made his Hammers debut after joining on loan from Chelsea on transfer deadline day and his pace and direct running was a constant threat to the Newcastle defence.\nPlaying high up on the left wing, Moses was the outlet as the Hammers were able to soak up Newcastle's 61% possession before counter attacking in style.\nThis was evident for the second goal when, from a Newcastle free-kick near the West Ham penalty area, the ball ended up in their net less than 30 seconds later.\nMoses used his strength and pace to run from inside his own half before his shot from 18 yards hit the underside of the crossbar, with Payet in the right place to finish the rebound. Winger Moses was substituted in the 88th minute as striker Andy Carroll made his first appearance since February following knee surgery.\nWhere will Newcastle's goals come from?\nNewcastle have not scored since the opening day of the season - a run that stretches for 402 minutes - and they never looked likely to end that drought at Upton Park.\nWithout the suspended Aleksandar Mitrovic, serving a three-game ban after his early sending off against Arsenal, Papiss Cisse played up front but struggled to make an impact.\nRight-back Daryl Janmaat carried the Magpies' greatest threat - an indictment on the attacking performance of a team who had gone more than 200 minutes without a shot on target before this game.\nSubstitutes Siem de Jong, Ayoze Perez and Rolando Aarons gave Newcastle more of a threat, but McClaren must find a solution to his side's scoring problems - and fast - if the positivity surrounding his appointment is to remain.\nMan of the match - Victor Moses (West Ham)\nManager reaction\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We fully deserved the three points, we were better from the start and we scored at the right time.\n\"Newcastle put us under a bit of pressure as we were defending too deep. In the second half I was proud, because we were solid, good at keeping the ball and great at counter attacks.\n\"It is small proof we really did well in the transfer window. Payet is a player I wanted from the start.\n\"I have known him for a long time. He is one of those players who is not only a great player but he makes players around him better.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren told BBC Sport: \"Our platform has been being hard to beat and disciplined, but this was a wake-up call.\n\"I am not blaming the coach journey, you have to deal with that and we didn't deal with it very well.\n\"You need these games, they hurt like mad, but you need them to get the message across.\n\"This is a journey and it is two steps forward one step back, this was two or three steps back. Saturday is very important for us. Our final ball was poor.\"\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Steve Claridge\n\"You can see why Newcastle have not scored since the first game of the season. I don't think the Newcastle players get what Steve McClaren is trying to do at the moment - their system was totally unbalanced.\n\"There was no width and it was all down the middle. But when Ayoze Perez came on it gave Newcastle a whole new dimension - I don't know why he wasn't on from the start.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDimitri Payet has had a hand in 11 goals (four goals, seven assists) in his last 13 league appearances (Premier League and Ligue 1 combined).\nNewcastle have now failed to score in four successive Premier League games - their worst run since April 2014.\nThe Magpies have just two points from their last 10 Premier League away games (won none, drew two, lost eight).\nNewcastle have scored just one goal in their last nine Premier League away games.\nNewcastle have lost their last seven Premier League games played on a Monday, failing to score in the last four in a row.\nWhat next?\nMcClaren will be hoping to get his first Newcastle league win next Saturday when his side entertain Watford at St James' Park.\nWest Ham have what looks to be a much more difficult task as they travel to Etihad Stadium to face a Manchester City side that are top with a 100% record from five games."

He came off in the 62nd minute.\nBorini, who spent a successful 2013-14 season on loan, was rather less involved than Son, despite a spritely start to the match.\nWhat are Tottenham missing?\nRemember the days it was a joy to watch a Tottenham team featuring an attack of Gareth Bale, Aaron Lennon, Luka Modric and Emmanuel Adebayor? It is a far less cavalier team under manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nSpurs, who went into the game having only managed three goals in the league, were dire in the final third for much of the match. Only once Erik Lamela and Andros Townsend came on did the visitors provide some bite up front. Mason's winner was the result of a great move, but also the only highlight for the London side.\nThey need a striker to help Kane and probably wish the transfer window was still open.\nMan of the match - Jeremain Lens (Sunderland)\nWhat the managers said - 'Players could not handle speed'\nSunderland manager Dick Advocaat: \"We had the better chances at the start, we knew we were playing against a good side and the speed of the game was unbelievable. Some players could not handle it in the end.\n\"We had to score a goal but it was not to be. At the end of the game, the better side had more luck than we had. Some players still need match fitness.\n\"Everyone did well but up front we could not score that chance we got.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"We will assess Mason tomorrow [he was injured while scoring]. It was a big knock on the knee. It was a great goal and we showed how we try to play.\n\"The first half was 50-50, an open game, but we dominated the second half. I'm very pleased for our first victory. We played a high tempo from the beginning.\n\"I am very happy with Son, he played really well. He is a good player for us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland have conceded 11 goals this season - only Chelsea have conceded more in the league.\nThey have gone eight league matches without a win (D4, L4).\nRyan Mason's goal was only his third for Tottenham in all competitions in 46 appearances.\nSpurs' starting 11 had an average age of 24 years and 135 days, the youngest in the Premier League so far this season.\nWho's up next?\nSunderland have a 353-mile trip to Bournemouth next weekend, followed by a League Cup tie at home to Manchester City. Tottenham are back in Europa League action against Qarabag on Thursday, before they face Crystal Palace at home next Sunday. Will Europa League fatigue set in this season?",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester United 3-1 Liverpool\nManchester United's \u00a336m teenager Anthony Martial marked his debut in sensational fashion with a stunning goal as Liverpool were beaten at Old Trafford.\nChristian Benteke's equally stunning overhead kick had thrown Liverpool a lifeline after Daley Blind's crisp finish and Ander Herrera's penalty had put Louis van Gaal's side in control.\nIt was the signal for Martial, the 19-year-old signed from Monaco on deadline day, to make himself an instant hero after coming on as a second-half substitute, slaloming between Nathaniel Clyne and Martin Skrtel before a composed finish in front of the Stretford End.\nUnited keeper David De Gea, making his first appearance of the season after signing a new four-year contract following the breakdown of his move to Real Madrid, demonstrated his worth with fine saves from Danny Ings and Jordon Ibe.\nLiverpool, however, were uncharacteristically tame for a fixture against their fierce rivals and the win lifts United into second place in the Premier League table behind Manchester City.\nRelive how Manchester United beat Liverpool here.\nAn Old Trafford hero is born\nOld Trafford gave a rousing welcome to the world's most expensive teenager when Martial replaced Juan Mata after 65 minutes - and he electrified the \"Theatre Of Dreams\" 21 minutes later with a moment of sheer brilliance.\nMartial had barely touched the ball but came alive with a run that took him between Clyne and Skrtel, the latter left twisting and turning hopelessly in the youngster's wake as he tucked a composed low finish past Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet.\nIt was the impetuosity of youth but also the sign of quality. The comparisons have been made with fellow countryman Thierry Henry - and it was a goal the great man would have been happy to claim as his own.\nPressure mounting on Rodgers?\nIt seems ludicrous to talk in such terms after only five league games but Liverpool's promising start has been overshadowed by two poor performances in defeat against West Ham United and now Manchester United.\nEven in times of struggle under manager Brendan Rodgers, his teams have been characterised by a boldness and determination to attack and be creative.\nHere Liverpool effectively stood behind the door, timid and barely making a tackle of any meaning, until Blind put United ahead early in the second half.\nIt was all a far cry from March 2014 when Liverpool came here with Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard in their line-up and blew United away 3-0, before almost winning the title.\nTough start hurting Liverpool\nRodgers knew he had to make a fast start after being handed the backing of owners Fenway Sports Group this summer following such a poor season last time out - and in his defence, the fixture list has not been his friend by handing Liverpool a tough early schedule.\nHe was also without influential figures here, such as captain Jordan Henderson and the suspended Philippe Coutinho, while also attempting to bed new signings into his team.\nChristian Benteke showed his quality at \u00a332.5m but Roberto Firmino, a \u00a329m capture from Hoffenheim, has yet to come anywhere near the pace of the Premier League.\nSadly for Rodgers, he was always going to be under close scrutiny and a glance at social media throughout the game saw plenty of Liverpool fans making reference to the currently unemployed former Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp.\nSurely five league games in is too soon for owners to start thinking about pulling the plug on a manager they supported heavily in the transfer market this summer - but the pressure to get results is clear with the Anfield club without a victory in three, having won their opening two games.\nDavid De Gea shows his class\nManchester United goalkeeper David De Gea got a predictably rapturous reception as he made his first appearance of the season after signing a new four-year contract following the breakdown of his proposed move to Real Madrid.\nAnd he showed his class with crucial saves from Danny Ings and Jordon Ibe, although one piece of misplaced footwork almost caused problems for United. De Gea gives United real presence, quality and a formidable barrier in goal.\nThis has been a good end to the week for United and Van Gaal. They have one of the world's best keepers back and a victory over Liverpool is never bad for Old Trafford morale.\nMan of the match: Daley Blind\nPost match reaction\nManchester United United boss Louis Van Gaal: When you make a goal like Anthony you cannot wish for more, I think. A lot of players have made a debut and scored with me so it's a good signal.\n\"We played better in the first half. We had far more control, but we didn't create much, that is why I changed Memphis - to improve that last pass.\"\nLiverpool manager Brendan Rodgers: \"I thought in the first half we defended well but had nowhere near enough quality and composure on the ball.\n\"We were disappointed with a couple of the goals. I never thought the free kick was a free kick. Penalty, I think Herrera has done well, young Joe Gomez will learn he has to stay on his feet.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester United have lost just one of their previous 11 leagues games at Old Trafford.\nLiverpool have only won one of their last eight away games in the Premier League.\nDe Gea has not kept a clean sheet in any of his last eight full 90-minute appearances in the Premier League.\nMata has scored or assisted three of the four normal Premier League goals United have scored this season.\nMartial scored with his first ever shot in the Premier League.\nBenteke has scored in his last three Premier League appearances against Manchester United, but has lost two and drawn one of those three games.\nLiverpool and Manchester United are the only Premier League sides to play today and not to hit a shot on target in the first half.\nWhat next?\nManchester United travel to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League group stages on Tuesday, while Liverpool travel to Bordeaux in the Europa League on Thursday.",

He was dangerous throughout the pitch but as a team we worked really hard and deserved the plaudits,\" Canaries boss Alex Neil told BBC Match of the Day.\nNorwich have improved over the summer\nBournemouth won last season's Championship title with Norwich coming up via the play-offs. And, after identical starts to the season, the Canaries look better equipped to stay up on this performance.\nEddie Howe's Cherries have lost big-money summer signings Max Gradel and Tyrone Mings to long-term injuries, and started with 10 of last season's squad at Carrow Road.\nBefore the game Howe said it would be a \"good marker\" to see if they had improved. And after the match he said confidence had been the difference between the sides.\nNorwich's starting summer signings - Brady, Jarvis and Andre Wisdom - all played well, with Jarvis scoring on his debut after cutting the ball onto his left foot inside the area.\n'We made some bad decisions'\nNorwich manager Alex Neil told BBC Sport: \"I thought we were the dominant team throughout, we scored three good goals and deserved the win.\n\"We had our game plan and the players carried that out perfectly. All credit goes to them. They were fantastic today.\n\"Matt Jarvis had that dimension we needed, he can beat players and he did fantastically for his goal, I'm really pleased for him. Hopefully we can continue to play as well as we did today.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe told BBC Sport: \"The biggest disappointment was the goals we gave away. At this level if you defend like we did for the three goals you have to be disappointed.\n\"I thought we were still well in the game at half-time, but in the second half we conceded possession really cheaply. That's usually our strength so there's a lot for us to reflect on.\n\"Maybe there was a bit of a lack of confidence after going behind, but we ended up chasing the game and making some bad decisions. That cost us.\"\nThe view from Carrow Road\nBBC Match of the Day's Conor McNamara: \"This was impressive stuff from Norwich with Wes Hoolahan pulling the strings. If you'd offered this to Norwich at the start of the season they'd have taken it; by mid-September they are three points ahead of champions Chelsea.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJarvis scored his first Premier League goal since April 2014; ending a run of 18 league games without notching\nNorwich won their first home league game against Bournemouth since 1951; ending a nine-match winless streak (L5 D4).\nNorwich have lost only one of their last six league meetings with Bournemouth (W2 D3) - though this was only their third league match since 1960.\nAlex Neil, 34, v Eddie Howe, 37, was the youngest combined managerial age in a Premier League game since Gareth Southgate, 36, met Aidy Boothroyd, 35, for Middlesbrough v Watford in November 2006 (that pair were five days younger).\nWho's up next?\nNext Saturday, Bournemouth will fancy their chances of returning to winning ways as they host Sunderland, who have picked up two points from their first four games.

We move on. It's been very difficult for us because of stuff going on away from football, and then we had the international break.\"\nMcManaman's strange penalty appeal\nWith the last four previous matches between the two teams yielding only three goals, chances were likely to be at a premium and in a subdued first-half, McManaman's penalty appeal was the biggest talking point.\nThe Baggies winger was put clear by Rickie Lambert and as he made his way into the area, Targett lunged at him.\nMcManaman managed to touch the ball past the Southampton defender, but before contact came, he seemed to fling himself over his opponent in a theatrical manner, perhaps adding to the decision of referee Stuart Attwell, who waved appeals away.\nPulis, who initially joined those appeals, said afterwards that the referee got it right.\n\"I think Callum McManaman dives first before the player touches him,\" added Pulis. \"I'll be having a word with him about that. It was a good decision by the referee.\"\nMan of the Match: Dusan Tadic (Southampton)\nManager reaction\nSouthampton boss Ronald Koeman: \"I'm a little bit disappointed because we were the better team. We had a lot of ball possession, we didn't create a lot of chances, maybe the best one was in the first half with Jay Rodriguez. In the second half we were not clinical enough.\n\"It was like we were the home team today. It was a difficult game, but we expect this, if we can't win then don't lose.\"\nStats you need to know\nSouthampton completed 522 passes in this game; the most made in a Premier League away game since their return to the league in 2012-13.\nThe Baggies have kept a clean sheet in over half of their 23 Premier League games under Tony Pulis (13 - 57%).\nNo side have kept more clean sheets in the Premier League since Pulis's first game in charge of the Baggies in January 2015 (13).\nSouthampton have won just two of their last 11 Premier League games (drew four, lost five).\nSaints have now failed to score in four of their last six Premier League games.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 3-1 Liverpool\nManchester United's \u00a336m teenager Anthony Martial marked his debut in sensational fashion with a stunning goal as Liverpool were beaten at Old Trafford.\nChristian Benteke's equally stunning overhead kick had thrown Liverpool a lifeline after Daley Blind's crisp finish and Ander Herrera's penalty had put Louis van Gaal's side in control.\nIt was the signal for Martial, the 19-year-old signed from Monaco on deadline day, to make himself an instant hero after coming on as a second-half substitute, slaloming between Nathaniel Clyne and Martin Skrtel before a composed finish in front of the Stretford End.\nUnited keeper David De Gea, making his first appearance of the season after signing a new four-year contract following the breakdown of his move to Real Madrid, demonstrated his worth with fine saves from Danny Ings and Jordon Ibe.\nLiverpool, however, were uncharacteristically tame for a fixture against their fierce rivals and the win lifts United into second place in the Premier League table behind Manchester City.\nRelive how Manchester United beat Liverpool here.\nAn Old Trafford hero is born\nOld Trafford gave a rousing welcome to the world's most expensive teenager when Martial replaced Juan Mata after 65 minutes - and he electrified the \"Theatre Of Dreams\" 21 minutes later with a moment of sheer brilliance.\nMartial had barely touched the ball but came alive with a run that took him between Clyne and Skrtel, the latter left twisting and turning hopelessly in the youngster's wake as he tucked a composed low finish past Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet.\nIt was the impetuosity of youth but also the sign of quality. The comparisons have been made with fellow countryman Thierry Henry - and it was a goal the great man would have been happy to claim as his own.\nPressure mounting on Rodgers?\nIt seems ludicrous to talk in such terms after only five league games but Liverpool's promising start has been overshadowed by two poor performances in defeat against West Ham United and now Manchester United.\nEven in times of struggle under manager Brendan Rodgers, his teams have been characterised by a boldness and determination to attack and be creative.\nHere Liverpool effectively stood behind the door, timid and barely making a tackle of any meaning, until Blind put United ahead early in the second half.\nIt was all a far cry from March 2014 when Liverpool came here with Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard in their line-up and blew United away 3-0, before almost winning the title.\nTough start hurting Liverpool\nRodgers knew he had to make a fast start after being handed the backing of owners Fenway Sports Group this summer following such a poor season last time out - and in his defence, the fixture list has not been his friend by handing Liverpool a tough early schedule.\nHe was also without influential figures here, such as captain Jordan Henderson and the suspended Philippe Coutinho, while also attempting to bed new signings into his team.\nChristian Benteke showed his quality at \u00a332.5m but Roberto Firmino, a \u00a329m capture from Hoffenheim, has yet to come anywhere near the pace of the Premier League.\nSadly for Rodgers, he was always going to be under close scrutiny and a glance at social media throughout the game saw plenty of Liverpool fans making reference to the currently unemployed former Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp.\nSurely five league games in is too soon for owners to start thinking about pulling the plug on a manager they supported heavily in the transfer market this summer - but the pressure to get results is clear with the Anfield club without a victory in three, having won their opening two games.\nDavid De Gea shows his class\nManchester United goalkeeper David De Gea got a predictably rapturous reception as he made his first appearance of the season after signing a new four-year contract following the breakdown of his proposed move to Real Madrid.\nAnd he showed his class with crucial saves from Danny Ings and Jordon Ibe, although one piece of misplaced footwork almost caused problems for United. De Gea gives United real presence, quality and a formidable barrier in goal.\nThis has been a good end to the week for United and Van Gaal. They have one of the world's best keepers back and a victory over Liverpool is never bad for Old Trafford morale.\nMan of the match: Daley Blind\nPost match reaction\nManchester United United boss Louis Van Gaal: When you make a goal like Anthony you cannot wish for more, I think. A lot of players have made a debut and scored with me so it's a good signal.\n\"We played better in the first half. We had far more control, but we didn't create much, that is why I changed Memphis - to improve that last pass.\"\nLiverpool manager Brendan Rodgers: \"I thought in the first half we defended well but had nowhere near enough quality and composure on the ball.\n\"We were disappointed with a couple of the goals. I never thought the free kick was a free kick. Penalty, I think Herrera has done well, young Joe Gomez will learn he has to stay on his feet.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester United have lost just one of their previous 11 leagues games at Old Trafford.\nLiverpool have only won one of their last eight away games in the Premier League.\nDe Gea has not kept a clean sheet in any of his last eight full 90-minute appearances in the Premier League.\nMata has scored or assisted three of the four normal Premier League goals United have scored this season.\nMartial scored with his first ever shot in the Premier League.\nBenteke has scored in his last three Premier League appearances against Manchester United, but has lost two and drawn one of those three games.\nLiverpool and Manchester United are the only Premier League sides to play today and not to hit a shot on target in the first half.\nWhat next?\nManchester United travel to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League group stages on Tuesday, while Liverpool travel to Bordeaux in the Europa League on Thursday."

We were not the aggressive team we need to be at home.\n\"We corrected those things, played very well, created a lot of chances but didn't score. We were under pressure, falling two goals behind.\n\"We knew this would be a difficult game because it was not luck that meant they beat Liverpool and Arsenal. We needed to be better with our finishing.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"You need a bit about you if you want to score two goals here, or two goals at the Emirates or three at Anfield.\n\"You've got no chance unless you sprint until the end of the game. We deserved it, considering the way we played in the first half and fought in the second.\n\"But this was hard - City pressed us and City were the better team in the second half.\"\nWhat's next for both teams?\nThe League Cup. City, who could make a raft of changes, go to Sunderland on Tuesday for their third-round tie. West Ham are also playing away in another all-Premier League tie at Leicester.\nBoth teams return to top-flight action on 26 September when City travel to Tottenham and the Hammers host Norwich."

We showed what we're about today. We've not got any superstars but we're a real team.\n\"That comes form the manager and his team. They've given us confidence and belief and everyone has been thriving since they came in.\"\nMan of the match - Danny Ings\nThe stats you need to know\nDaniel Sturridge made his first Premier League start in nearly six months (first since 22 March).\nRussell Martin is the top-scoring defender in the Premier League.

His one touch in the Villa box was his goal, as he poked Morrison's effort home.\nHe was replaced by Craig Gardner after 67 minutes and all his problems appeared to be forgotten as he was central to Albion's post-match celebrations with manager Tony Pulis and team-mates.\nWest Brom legend Tony Brown, working for BBC WM said: \"It's nice to see a beaming face from Saido Berahino - he's coming off and hugging his team-mates.\"\nBaggies boss Pulis said: \"This game was made for Saido. He's not played a lot of football and looked tired as the game went on, but he was desperate to play and he has the quality that we want and need.\n\"Everyone in this room has made mistakes - in a few years' time he will look back on the situation and think he should have done better. But it's over now, we move on, as a club we move on and he's a very good player.\"\nVilla's struggles continue\nAfter throwing away a two-goal lead last weekend to lose to Leicester, Villa boss Tim Sherwood said \"I've never felt this bad. Ever\". He will not have seen much to improve his mood in this West Midlands derby.\nVilla's long-suffering home fans have now seen them pick up only 71 points from 73 home Premier League games since December 2011 - with little from this performance indicating things are about to change.\nThe hosts were outplayed in the first half and Sherwood's decision to replace pacy Scott Sinclair with targetman Rudy Gestede at half-time did little to turn things around.\nTheir three shots on target all came in the second half but they were all routine saves for Boaz Myhill.\n'Desperate from Villa'\nMartin Keown on BBC Radio 5 live: \"It was desperate from Aston Villa today. Long balls are all they seem to have.\n\"We saw how disappointed Tim Sherwood was after last week's result but he needs to keep his head because he'll be hurting now after this defeat by Villa's local rivals.\n\"Essentially, West Brom were just too good.\"\nMan of the match - Saido Berahino\nVilla in 'transition period'\nVilla boss Tim Sherwood: \"I'm disappointed that we didn't perform. West Brom deserved the result and did a good job on us. We didn't express ourselves.\n\"Today wasn't our day and we have to give them credit for stifling us and getting their scruffy goal. We looked threatening as the game went on but it wasn't enough.\n\"I recognise the problems at the moment and need to look at it again to make sure I'm not being too emotional. But it's a transition period at this club. The performances haven't been as bad as the results, though today is an exception as I'm disappointed.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"I thought we played really well today and were the better team - Villa can't have any complaints. We deserved it, there's no doubt.\n\"We showed today that if you have a team playing as a team it's very hard to do anything against us. But during the game Villa didn't open us up once.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSixteen of Berahino's 20 Premier League goals so far have been scored in the West Midlands (14 at The Hawthorns, two at Villa Park).\nAston Villa are winless in four Premier League games at Villa Park, losing three and drawing the other.\nThe Baggies have lost just one of their last seven Premier League matches on the road (W4 D2 L1), keeping five clean sheets in that run.\nTim Sherwood has lost six of his last eight Premier League matches (W1 D1).\nWhat's next for both teams?\nVilla move from their second biggest rivalry to their main one as they host Birmingham City on Tuesday in the League Cup second round.\nBoss Sherwood said: \"We know that Tuesday is an even bigger game than today. We know how disappointed the fans will be but I can assure them the players are equally as disappointed and desperate to put it right on Tuesday.\"\nWest Brom go to Norwich on Wednesday in their round-two clash."

He finished coolly for his second when played through on goal by Yoshida's blind backpass.\nIn contrast to the incisive Martial, Rooney did not have a shot and has now not scored in the Premier League since 4 April, or scored an away goal in the league since last November.\nBack in a deeper role he did play 56 passes, the fourth most of any player on the pitch.\nHow did United cope without Shaw?\nDespite their win, Manchester United boss Van Gaal will be concerned by their slow start and in particular their defending.\nUnited's reshaped back four looked a mess in the opening stages of their first game since left-back Luke Shaw suffered a broken leg in midweek.\nDaley Blind had a torrid afternoon as he was bullied by Pelle, who was left unmarked to collect De Gea's fine save from Sadio Mane's volley to score the opener.\nMinutes later Pelle again rolled Blind all too easily to thump a low shot against the post.\nUnited regrouped but also missed Shaw going forwards, with stand-in left-back Marcos Rojo looking uncomfortable when attacking and crossing just twice.\nThe visitors ended up with only one member of their back four in their starting positions, as Antonio Valencia came on for Matteo Darmian at the break, and Patrick McNair replaced Rojo.\nMcNair and Smalling then both left Pelle totally unattended to head in his second of the game late on.\nRetaining goalkeeper De Gea may yet prove to be United's key business this season, and he made brilliant saves from Jose Fonte and Victor Wanyama as Southampton mounted a late rally.\nMan of the match - Anthony Martial (Manchester United)\nManager reaction\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"The first 30 minutes we played perfectly, we had good organisation and they had difficulty breaking us.\n\"We lost it a bit 10 minutes before half-time. In the second half, if you make that kind of mistake it is impossible.\n\"We lost belief. The reaction after we made it 3-2 was good and we had enough chances but David De Gea made some good saves. We didn't lose because of Manchester United, we lost by ourselves.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"Anthony Martial is already special because we paid a lot of money for him. A lot of people are thinking he is a great star but he is a boy of 19. In three matches he has shown a lot.\n\"I am very happy with him but we and he have to keep our feet on the ground.\n\"That is why we were difficult in the transfer window. I have always said we wanted to keep David De Gea.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nUnited have scored from their last six shots on target in the Premier League\nAll five league meetings between Ronald Koeman and Louis van Gaal have gone in favour of the away manager\nJuan Mata has been involved in four goals in his six league games this season\n14 of Graziano Pelle's 16 league goals have come at home\nUnited have come from behind to beat Southampton on eight times in the Premier League - more than they have against any other opponent\nWhat's next for both teams?\nSouthampton will look to get back to winning ways against Championship side MK Dons in the League Cup in midweek, before they host Swansea in the Premier League next Saturday.\nManchester United face Ipswich in a midweek cup match and could go top of the table next weekend.

Aside from his two wild strikes into the stands, the Belgian international twice more took too long to finish, allowing Swansea players to cover.\nSteven Naismith and Arouna Kone were also disappointing in the Everton attack but Ross Barkley was bright in midfield, making several incisive runs and passes.\nStones shines again\nThe home side were wasteful in attack too, but they did at least manage to have more shots on target - three to Everton's two.\nGomis looked the most likely of Garry Monk's players to score, but their biggest problem was finding a way around the Everton defence.\nStones was again composed throughout and the England centre-back repeatedly made key interventions to steer his side away from danger.\nEverton right-back Ty Browning kept Jefferson Montero quiet on what was the 21-year-old's first Premier League start, and that will be another positive for Martinez.\nMan of the match - John Stones (Everton)\nThe Stats you need to know\nEverton have kept three successive clean sheets away from home in the Premier League for the first time since December 2013.\nSwansea have not won any of their five Premier League meetings with Everton at the Liberty Stadium (D2 L3), scoring just two goals in the process.\nRoberto Martinez has overseen two wins and three draws in his five Premier League games as Everton boss against the Swans.\nKevin Mirallas is the only substitute to have been sent off so far this season.\nManager reaction\nSwansea manager Garry Monk: \"We had chances and they had chances, but I think both teams will be happy with a point.\n\"I thought it was an entertaining game and a good advert for Premier League football. Both teams went for it and both teams defended well.\n\"I felt it was a good performance. If you can't win a game, you have to make sure you don't lose it, which is what we should have done last week.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"The first half was very level. We needed to be more aggressive going forward and that's why I'm pleased with the second half.\n\"We created good chances and they should have won us the game. I'm disappointed, but the overall performance was satisfying.\n\"In the second half we took control, we played through them a few times and everything started with the composure of John Stones and Phil Jagielka.\"\nWhat next?\nEverton play at Reading in the League Cup third round on Tuesday evening before travelling to West Brom for a Monday night game in the Premier League.\nSwansea play at Hull in the League Cup third round on Tuesday before travelling to Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday."

But his side were again able to retrieve the situation.\nVictory thrown away by Stoke?\nMark Hughes's side went into the game with only two points and having lost both their home games.\nThey appeared set to get their season going when Bojan, who had last made a league start in January against Leicester, slotted past goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel after a brilliant turn, run and pass from Arnautovic.\nHowever, it was the Austrian forward who allowed Leicester a route back into the game, forcing down Leicester's Danny Drinkwater early in the second half for the penalty converted by Mahrez.\nThey then failed to deal with a long ball forward for Vardy's equaliser, although Stoke players angrily claimed that Walters was being held by Morgan in the lead-up to the goal.\nBojan brings invention to Potters\nThe cruciate ligament injury suffered by Bojan in January was a cruel blow to player and club with the 25-year-old Spaniard so often the inspiration for Stoke last season.\nHughes has eased him back into the team, restricting him to only substitute appearances before this game and he was rewarded with a good display before he tired in the second half and was replaced in the 82nd minute.\nHe made 39 passes with 74% accuracy and his threat was vital for a Stoke side without top scorer Mame Biram Diouf who has a hamstring strain.\nMan of the match\nManager reaction\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"The first 12 minutes before Stoke scored we played very well but after that they scored a very, very good goal and we were making too many mistakes, losing a lot of balls in the middle of the pitch.\n\"We need to start games better so we are not always fighting back.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We were good value for being 2-0 up and talked at half-time about not letting Leicester back early in the second half and that's what happened.\n\"We made a mistake on the penalty and at 2-1 we had to deal with their momentum. We then made a mistake for their second goal but maybe we were distracted by the foul on Jonathan Walters at the other end. We picked up a point but should have had three.\n\"Bojan was a huge positive and scored a good goal. We have got to get him up to speed but I was pleased with him.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJonathan Walters (35) is now two clear of Peter Crouch (33) as Stoke City's all-time leading Premier League scorer.\nStoke have suffered just one defeat in their last seven meetings in all competitions with Leicester, winning three and drawing three.\nRiyad Mahrez has scored seven goals and assisted three in his last nine PL appearances.\nLeicester are the first team since Everton in 2012 (6) to claim at least a point from behind in four successive Premier League fixtures.\nLeicester are unbeaten after six games for only the second time in a PL season (they were unbeaten through eight in 2000-01).\nWhat's next?\nStoke travel to Fulham in the third round of the League Cup on Tuesday (19:45 BST), while Leicester host West Ham in the same competition on the same night.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 2-0 Arsenal\nPremier League champions Chelsea won only their second league game this season against nine-man Arsenal in a fiery match at Stamford Bridge.\n, external\nDefender Kurt Zouma - preferred to dropped captain John Terry - headed the opening goal after 53 minutes and Chelsea secured only their second win in six Premier League games this season when Eden Hazard's shot flew in off Calum Chambers late on.\nThis barely tells the story of a game that will leave Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger furious and frustrated in equal measure as he saw his players fall victim to the trademark and predictable wind-up tactics of Chelsea striker Diego Costa.\nArsenal defender Gabriel was sent off seconds before half-time for kicking out at Costa. It came at the end of a lengthy spat after the striker had shoved his hand into the face of Laurent Koscielny three times.\nIt handed the momentum to Chelsea and Arsenal's misery was complete when Santi Cazorla was given a second yellow card for a foul on Cesc Fabregas.\nAll this mattered little to Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who will regard this win as another sign that the reigning Premier League champions are moving somewhere towards their normal selves.\nMourinho's big call works to perfection\nMourinho sprung a major surprise by dropping Terry and starting with Zouma alongside Gary Cahill.\nThe Chelsea manager called Zouma the fastest defender Chelsea have after bringing him on for Terry in the defeat at Manchester City earlier this season. His greater pace was clearly to counter the speed of Theo Walcott, and the powerful youngster coped well.\nThe added bonus for Mourinho was Zouma's strength in the air that allowed him to get on the end of Fabregas's free-kick to head Chelsea in front after 53 minutes.\nSo what does this mean for Terry? Is it the beginning of the end for the 34-year-old?\nMourinho knows every decision he makes, particularly those involving Terry, come under great scrutiny these days. Not so long ago, leaving Terry out of a game of such importance would have been unthinkable. No longer.\nNo-one in their right mind would write off such an enduring and determined figure as Terry, but with the emergence of Zouma and Chelsea's concerted attempts to land Everton's John Stones with offers of \u00a330m, it is clear the former England captain's days as a permanent fixture in Chelsea's line-up are over.\nArsenal's sense of injustice\nCosta enjoys cult status as the anti-hero of Stamford Bridge - but you will not hear many warm words for him anywhere else and certainly not from Arsenal.\nThis was a grim day all-round for the Gunners, not simply because they lost once more to Chelsea and received another setback to their hopes of challenging for the Premier League title, but also because they lost defender Gabriel and midfield man Cazorla to red cards.\nAnd to add to their fury, they also left west London nursing a burning sense of injustice that Costa stayed on despite pushing the rules to the limit and beyond.\nThe Premier League's angriest man started a chain of events that led to Gabriel's sending off by shoving Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny three times in the face and then barging the defender to the ground.\nGabriel tried to help his team-mate and a lengthy dispute with Costa ended with the Arsenal defender finally being hooked by the obvious bait offered up by the striker, kicking out to receive a straight red card from referee Mike Dean.\nFoolish, but surely action also to be taken against Costa for the incident with Koscielny?\nArsenal's reduced numbers made their task almost impossible and altered the face of the game.\nWorst of enemies\nThe antipathy between Mourinho and his Arsenal counterpart stretches back to his first spell at Stamford Bridge when he labelled Wenger \"a voyeur\"\n, external\nfor his supposed interest in events at Stamford Bridge.\nMourinho hardly helped relations by calling Wenger \"a specialist in failure\" in February 2014 after his return to Chelsea - then there was the non-handshake at the Community Shield in August when Arsenal's boss finally got the better of \"The Special One\" at the 14th attempt.\nSo what did Saturday at a sunny Stamford Bridge bring? Mourinho was in his seat in the technical area long before kick-off and up and out of his seat well before Wenger's entrance seconds before the start.\nMourinho ensured Wenger could not have missed his proffered hand, which was taken in the coldest manner possible as the Arsenal boss breezed past on the way to his seat.\nNot the slightest trace of warmth was on show in the exchange. Indeed, the handshake was so icy it was utterly pointless.\nMaybe Costa could be called in to act as peacemaker between the two? Actually maybe not.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea)\nThe stats you need to know\nFabregas has assisted a goal in two of his three Premier League games against former side Arsenal.\nNo team in Premier League history has seen more players sent off than Arsenal (79, level with Everton).\nArsenal had two players sent off in a Premier League game for only the third time, and the first since 1999 (v Spurs).\nChelsea have kept six clean sheets in their last eight Premier League games against Arsenal, including the last five in a row.\nChelsea are unbeaten against Arsenal in their last eight Barclays Premier League encounters (W5 D3).\nWho's up next?\nArsenal face another tricky game at north London rivals Tottenham in the League Cup on Wednesday, before they are away again at Leicester on Saturday. The Blues are at Walsall in the League Cup and then are away at Newcastle next Saturday."

We were not the aggressive team we need to be at home.\n\"We corrected those things, played very well, created a lot of chances but didn't score. We were under pressure, falling two goals behind.\n\"We knew this would be a difficult game because it was not luck that meant they beat Liverpool and Arsenal. We needed to be better with our finishing.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"You need a bit about you if you want to score two goals here, or two goals at the Emirates or three at Anfield.\n\"You've got no chance unless you sprint until the end of the game. We deserved it, considering the way we played in the first half and fought in the second.\n\"But this was hard - City pressed us and City were the better team in the second half.\"\nWhat's next for both teams?\nThe League Cup.

We showed what we're about today. We've not got any superstars but we're a real team.\n\"That comes form the manager and his team.

Manchester City's Vincent Kompany and Joel Ward of Crystal Palace have both scored two.\nMartin has scored as many goals in his last five Premier League games as he did in his previous 86 appearances in the competition.\nManager reaction\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"I thought we played well, some teams sit in, which we had to do sometimes, but we offered a threat going forward too.\n\"The lads worked very hard and deserved something from the game. We're happy we have come away with a point.\n\"I left it in Russell's hands about whether he was going to play or not. He is the captain of the club and would have said if wasn't right, for the sake of the team.\n\"I think the adrenaline helped him through.\"\nLiverpool manager Brendan Rodgers: \"We had confidence after getting the first goal but we lost concentration on a corner.\n\"It was a poor goal from that aspect. Then we couldn't get that winning goal. We had a number of opportunities and that was the pleasing aspect of today.\n\"It was important that we got some flow in our game and our intensity in the second half was much better.\n\"But you have to look after the back door and at the corner we didn't do that.\"\nWhat's next for both teams?\nLiverpool host Carlisle in the third round of the League Cup on Wednesday night, before welcoming Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday.\nNorwich play West Brom at home in the League Cup on Wednesday, before travelling to West Ham in the Premier League on Saturday."

But his side were again able to retrieve the situation.\nVictory thrown away by Stoke?\nMark Hughes's side went into the game with only two points and having lost both their home games.\nThey appeared set to get their season going when Bojan, who had last made a league start in January against Leicester, slotted past goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel after a brilliant turn, run and pass from Arnautovic.\nHowever, it was the Austrian forward who allowed Leicester a route back into the game, forcing down Leicester's Danny Drinkwater early in the second half for the penalty converted by Mahrez.\nThey then failed to deal with a long ball forward for Vardy's equaliser, although Stoke players angrily claimed that Walters was being held by Morgan in the lead-up to the goal.\nBojan brings invention to Potters\nThe cruciate ligament injury suffered by Bojan in January was a cruel blow to player and club with the 25-year-old Spaniard so often the inspiration for Stoke last season.\nHughes has eased him back into the team, restricting him to only substitute appearances before this game and he was rewarded with a good display before he tired in the second half and was replaced in the 82nd minute.\nHe made 39 passes with 74% accuracy and his threat was vital for a Stoke side without top scorer Mame Biram Diouf who has a hamstring strain.\nMan of the match\nManager reaction\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"The first 12 minutes before Stoke scored we played very well but after that they scored a very, very good goal and we were making too many mistakes, losing a lot of balls in the middle of the pitch.\n\"We need to start games better so we are not always fighting back.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We were good value for being 2-0 up and talked at half-time about not letting Leicester back early in the second half and that's what happened.\n\"We made a mistake on the penalty and at 2-1 we had to deal with their momentum. We then made a mistake for their second goal but maybe we were distracted by the foul on Jonathan Walters at the other end. We picked up a point but should have had three.\n\"Bojan was a huge positive and scored a good goal. We have got to get him up to speed but I was pleased with him.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJonathan Walters (35) is now two clear of Peter Crouch (33) as Stoke City's all-time leading Premier League scorer.\nStoke have suffered just one defeat in their last seven meetings in all competitions with Leicester, winning three and drawing three.\nRiyad Mahrez has scored seven goals and assisted three in his last nine PL appearances.\nLeicester are the first team since Everton in 2012 (6) to claim at least a point from behind in four successive Premier League fixtures.\nLeicester are unbeaten after six games for only the second time in a PL season (they were unbeaten through eight in 2000-01).\nWhat's next?\nStoke travel to Fulham in the third round of the League Cup on Tuesday (19:45 BST), while Leicester host West Ham in the same competition on the same night.",

A month later and nothing has changed.\nThere was no confidence shown from either player - they were panicking while in possession and shaky when called upon to do any defensive work. Every clearance up field was being picked off with ease and the pressure kept on coming.\nKaboul got a yellow in first half for bringing down Wilson and a hack on the same player in the second half saw him dismissed.\nMan of the match - Distin's delightful debut\nBournemouth defender Sylvain Distin showed all his Premier League experience, limiting pacy striker Jermain Defoe to few chances and keeping composed with the ball at his feet.\nHard-working Wilson\nThe home side's solid defensive display laid the platform for their first clean sheet of the season, aided by striker Wilson's hard work up front.\nThe Englishman netted 20 goals for Bournemouth in their promotion campaign last term, and has started this season in similar vain, scoring five in as many games.\nWilson ran Kaboul and Coates ragged, while showing great composure with his finish in the fourth minute. His goals may be the key to whether Bournemouth stay up come the end of the season.\nRitchie's wonder strike\n\"I wont forget that goal in a hurry,\" said Ritchie. \"The ball came down from quite a height, I managed to steady myself and got a sweet strike on it. As soon as I hit it, I knew it was good.\"\nManager Eddie Howe added: \"It was a fantastic strike from Matty. He sets himself up but I don't think anyone saw the finish coming. It was sublime.\"\n'We'll stay up'\nSunderland boss Dick Advocaat: \"The second half was better but you cannot do worse than the first half. We started the first half totally hopelessly. There was no sharpness. Me and the players have to look in the mirror.\n\"Two points after six games is not enough. Nice words is not enough, we have to do it a different way now. I am sure we will stay up though.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nYounes Kaboul was sent off for the sixth time in the Premier League\nSunderland didn't manage a single shot on target after the 40th minute\nThe Black Cats have now conceded 10 first-half goals in the league this season\nAdvocaat's side are now on a nine-game winless streak in the league"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 2-0 Arsenal\nPremier League champions Chelsea won only their second league game this season against nine-man Arsenal in a fiery match at Stamford Bridge.\n, external\nDefender Kurt Zouma - preferred to dropped captain John Terry - headed the opening goal after 53 minutes and Chelsea secured only their second win in six Premier League games this season when Eden Hazard's shot flew in off Calum Chambers late on.\nThis barely tells the story of a game that will leave Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger furious and frustrated in equal measure as he saw his players fall victim to the trademark and predictable wind-up tactics of Chelsea striker Diego Costa.\nArsenal defender Gabriel was sent off seconds before half-time for kicking out at Costa. It came at the end of a lengthy spat after the striker had shoved his hand into the face of Laurent Koscielny three times.\nIt handed the momentum to Chelsea and Arsenal's misery was complete when Santi Cazorla was given a second yellow card for a foul on Cesc Fabregas.\nAll this mattered little to Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who will regard this win as another sign that the reigning Premier League champions are moving somewhere towards their normal selves.\nMourinho's big call works to perfection\nMourinho sprung a major surprise by dropping Terry and starting with Zouma alongside Gary Cahill.\nThe Chelsea manager called Zouma the fastest defender Chelsea have after bringing him on for Terry in the defeat at Manchester City earlier this season. His greater pace was clearly to counter the speed of Theo Walcott, and the powerful youngster coped well.\nThe added bonus for Mourinho was Zouma's strength in the air that allowed him to get on the end of Fabregas's free-kick to head Chelsea in front after 53 minutes.\nSo what does this mean for Terry? Is it the beginning of the end for the 34-year-old?\nMourinho knows every decision he makes, particularly those involving Terry, come under great scrutiny these days. Not so long ago, leaving Terry out of a game of such importance would have been unthinkable. No longer.\nNo-one in their right mind would write off such an enduring and determined figure as Terry, but with the emergence of Zouma and Chelsea's concerted attempts to land Everton's John Stones with offers of \u00a330m, it is clear the former England captain's days as a permanent fixture in Chelsea's line-up are over.\nArsenal's sense of injustice\nCosta enjoys cult status as the anti-hero of Stamford Bridge - but you will not hear many warm words for him anywhere else and certainly not from Arsenal.\nThis was a grim day all-round for the Gunners, not simply because they lost once more to Chelsea and received another setback to their hopes of challenging for the Premier League title, but also because they lost defender Gabriel and midfield man Cazorla to red cards.\nAnd to add to their fury, they also left west London nursing a burning sense of injustice that Costa stayed on despite pushing the rules to the limit and beyond.\nThe Premier League's angriest man started a chain of events that led to Gabriel's sending off by shoving Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny three times in the face and then barging the defender to the ground.\nGabriel tried to help his team-mate and a lengthy dispute with Costa ended with the Arsenal defender finally being hooked by the obvious bait offered up by the striker, kicking out to receive a straight red card from referee Mike Dean.\nFoolish, but surely action also to be taken against Costa for the incident with Koscielny?\nArsenal's reduced numbers made their task almost impossible and altered the face of the game.\nWorst of enemies\nThe antipathy between Mourinho and his Arsenal counterpart stretches back to his first spell at Stamford Bridge when he labelled Wenger \"a voyeur\"\n, external\nfor his supposed interest in events at Stamford Bridge.\nMourinho hardly helped relations by calling Wenger \"a specialist in failure\" in February 2014 after his return to Chelsea - then there was the non-handshake at the Community Shield in August when Arsenal's boss finally got the better of \"The Special One\" at the 14th attempt.\nSo what did Saturday at a sunny Stamford Bridge bring? Mourinho was in his seat in the technical area long before kick-off and up and out of his seat well before Wenger's entrance seconds before the start.\nMourinho ensured Wenger could not have missed his proffered hand, which was taken in the coldest manner possible as the Arsenal boss breezed past on the way to his seat.\nNot the slightest trace of warmth was on show in the exchange. Indeed, the handshake was so icy it was utterly pointless.\nMaybe Costa could be called in to act as peacemaker between the two? Actually maybe not.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea)\nThe stats you need to know\nFabregas has assisted a goal in two of his three Premier League games against former side Arsenal.\nNo team in Premier League history has seen more players sent off than Arsenal (79, level with Everton).\nArsenal had two players sent off in a Premier League game for only the third time, and the first since 1999 (v Spurs).\nChelsea have kept six clean sheets in their last eight Premier League games against Arsenal, including the last five in a row.\nChelsea are unbeaten against Arsenal in their last eight Barclays Premier League encounters (W5 D3).\nWho's up next?\nArsenal face another tricky game at north London rivals Tottenham in the League Cup on Wednesday, before they are away again at Leicester on Saturday. The Blues are at Walsall in the League Cup and then are away at Newcastle next Saturday."

He finished coolly for his second when played through on goal by Yoshida's blind backpass.\nIn contrast to the incisive Martial, Rooney did not have a shot and has now not scored in the Premier League since 4 April, or scored an away goal in the league since last November.\nBack in a deeper role he did play 56 passes, the fourth most of any player on the pitch.\nHow did United cope without Shaw?\nDespite their win, Manchester United boss Van Gaal will be concerned by their slow start and in particular their defending.\nUnited's reshaped back four looked a mess in the opening stages of their first game since left-back Luke Shaw suffered a broken leg in midweek.\nDaley Blind had a torrid afternoon as he was bullied by Pelle, who was left unmarked to collect De Gea's fine save from Sadio Mane's volley to score the opener.\nMinutes later Pelle again rolled Blind all too easily to thump a low shot against the post.\nUnited regrouped but also missed Shaw going forwards, with stand-in left-back Marcos Rojo looking uncomfortable when attacking and crossing just twice.\nThe visitors ended up with only one member of their back four in their starting positions, as Antonio Valencia came on for Matteo Darmian at the break, and Patrick McNair replaced Rojo.\nMcNair and Smalling then both left Pelle totally unattended to head in his second of the game late on.\nRetaining goalkeeper De Gea may yet prove to be United's key business this season, and he made brilliant saves from Jose Fonte and Victor Wanyama as Southampton mounted a late rally.\nMan of the match - Anthony Martial (Manchester United)\nManager reaction\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"The first 30 minutes we played perfectly, we had good organisation and they had difficulty breaking us.\n\"We lost it a bit 10 minutes before half-time. In the second half, if you make that kind of mistake it is impossible.\n\"We lost belief. The reaction after we made it 3-2 was good and we had enough chances but David De Gea made some good saves. We didn't lose because of Manchester United, we lost by ourselves.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"Anthony Martial is already special because we paid a lot of money for him.

His one touch in the Villa box was his goal, as he poked Morrison's effort home.\nHe was replaced by Craig Gardner after 67 minutes and all his problems appeared to be forgotten as he was central to Albion's post-match celebrations with manager Tony Pulis and team-mates.\nWest Brom legend Tony Brown, working for BBC WM said: \"It's nice to see a beaming face from Saido Berahino - he's coming off and hugging his team-mates.\"\nBaggies boss Pulis said: \"This game was made for Saido. He's not played a lot of football and looked tired as the game went on, but he was desperate to play and he has the quality that we want and need.\n\"Everyone in this room has made mistakes - in a few years' time he will look back on the situation and think he should have done better. But it's over now, we move on, as a club we move on and he's a very good player.\"\nVilla's struggles continue\nAfter throwing away a two-goal lead last weekend to lose to Leicester, Villa boss Tim Sherwood said \"I've never felt this bad. Ever\". He will not have seen much to improve his mood in this West Midlands derby.\nVilla's long-suffering home fans have now seen them pick up only 71 points from 73 home Premier League games since December 2011 - with little from this performance indicating things are about to change.\nThe hosts were outplayed in the first half and Sherwood's decision to replace pacy Scott Sinclair with targetman Rudy Gestede at half-time did little to turn things around.\nTheir three shots on target all came in the second half but they were all routine saves for Boaz Myhill.\n'Desperate from Villa'\nMartin Keown on BBC Radio 5 live: \"It was desperate from Aston Villa today. Long balls are all they seem to have.\n\"We saw how disappointed Tim Sherwood was after last week's result but he needs to keep his head because he'll be hurting now after this defeat by Villa's local rivals.\n\"Essentially, West Brom were just too good.\"\nMan of the match - Saido Berahino\nVilla in 'transition period'\nVilla boss Tim Sherwood: \"I'm disappointed that we didn't perform. West Brom deserved the result and did a good job on us. We didn't express ourselves.\n\"Today wasn't our day and we have to give them credit for stifling us and getting their scruffy goal. We looked threatening as the game went on but it wasn't enough.\n\"I recognise the problems at the moment and need to look at it again to make sure I'm not being too emotional. But it's a transition period at this club. The performances haven't been as bad as the results, though today is an exception as I'm disappointed.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"I thought we played really well today and were the better team - Villa can't have any complaints. We deserved it, there's no doubt.\n\"We showed today that if you have a team playing as a team it's very hard to do anything against us. But during the game Villa didn't open us up once.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSixteen of Berahino's 20 Premier League goals so far have been scored in the West Midlands (14 at The Hawthorns, two at Villa Park).\nAston Villa are winless in four Premier League games at Villa Park, losing three and drawing the other.\nThe Baggies have lost just one of their last seven Premier League matches on the road (W4 D2 L1), keeping five clean sheets in that run.\nTim Sherwood has lost six of his last eight Premier League matches (W1 D1).\nWhat's next for both teams?\nVilla move from their second biggest rivalry to their main one as they host Birmingham City on Tuesday in the League Cup second round.\nBoss Sherwood said: \"We know that Tuesday is an even bigger game than today. We know how disappointed the fans will be but I can assure them the players are equally as disappointed and desperate to put it right on Tuesday.\"\nWest Brom go to Norwich on Wednesday in their round-two clash.",

Aside from his two wild strikes into the stands, the Belgian international twice more took too long to finish, allowing Swansea players to cover.\nSteven Naismith and Arouna Kone were also disappointing in the Everton attack but Ross Barkley was bright in midfield, making several incisive runs and passes.\nStones shines again\nThe home side were wasteful in attack too, but they did at least manage to have more shots on target - three to Everton's two.\nGomis looked the most likely of Garry Monk's players to score, but their biggest problem was finding a way around the Everton defence.\nStones was again composed throughout and the England centre-back repeatedly made key interventions to steer his side away from danger.\nEverton right-back Ty Browning kept Jefferson Montero quiet on what was the 21-year-old's first Premier League start, and that will be another positive for Martinez.\nMan of the match - John Stones (Everton)\nThe Stats you need to know\nEverton have kept three successive clean sheets away from home in the Premier League for the first time since December 2013.\nSwansea have not won any of their five Premier League meetings with Everton at the Liberty Stadium (D2 L3), scoring just two goals in the process.\nRoberto Martinez has overseen two wins and three draws in his five Premier League games as Everton boss against the Swans.\nKevin Mirallas is the only substitute to have been sent off so far this season.\nManager reaction\nSwansea manager Garry Monk: \"We had chances and they had chances, but I think both teams will be happy with a point.\n\"I thought it was an entertaining game and a good advert for Premier League football. Both teams went for it and both teams defended well.\n\"I felt it was a good performance. If you can't win a game, you have to make sure you don't lose it, which is what we should have done last week.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"The first half was very level. We needed to be more aggressive going forward and that's why I'm pleased with the second half.\n\"We created good chances and they should have won us the game. I'm disappointed, but the overall performance was satisfying.\n\"In the second half we took control, we played through them a few times and everything started with the composure of John Stones and Phil Jagielka.\"\nWhat next?\nEverton play at Reading in the League Cup third round on Tuesday evening before travelling to West Brom for a Monday night game in the Premier League.\nSwansea play at Hull in the League Cup third round on Tuesday before travelling to Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday."

Just one of those has come from a cross in open play.\nWhat about Watford?\nThe Hornets were far from outclassed, despite Palace shading the contest.\nTroy Deeney should have done better when he blazed over from close range after Jurado's free-kick hit the bar, with the Spanish playmaker having a late shot superbly blocked by Joe Ledley.\nUnlike Palace, they were perhaps too narrow - and right-back Nyom often look exposed as the visitors focused many of their attacks down the right.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha\nExpert analysis\nFormer Watford manager Aidy Boothroyd, speaking to BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: \"We've seen two teams who are evenly matched.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "West Bromwich Albion 2-3 Everton\nRomelu Lukaku scored twice as he led a superb comeback by Everton, who battled from 2-0 down to win at West Brom.\nThe Baggies took the lead before the break when Saido Berahino finished well, before Craig Dawson doubled the lead in the 54th minute with a header.\nA minute later Lukaku rose to nod in Gerard Deulofeu's cross, and then set up Arouna Kone who fired in to level.\nBelgium striker Lukaku grabbed the winner with a close-range strike from another excellent Deulofeu delivery.\nThe result moves Everton up to fifth on 12 points, while West Brom, who have yet to win at home, drop to 15th with eight points.\nRead how the game unfolded here\n5 live Football Daily podcast: Reaction & analysis after Everton's win\nLukaku - a tale of two halves\nIt was a certainly a game of two halves, following a dire opening 40 minutes, but Lukaku himself had a contrasting 90 minutes.\nThe 6ft 3in 22-year-old has had to carry the burden of a \u00a328m price tag ever since he signed on a permanent deal for the Toffees in July 2014, following a successful season on loan in 2013-14.\nAnd despite scoring 20 goals last season, his performances were mixed, which prompted manager Roberto Martinez to defend him.\n, external\nEverton fans must have been wondering which Lukaku they would see at The Hawthorns. They saw both.\nThe left side of the graphic below shows that Lukaku found himself in deep positions in the first half as he tried to get into the game.\nHowever, with Everton chasing the match after the break, he moved further forward and became more of a threat in and around the area. The service also improved from Spaniard Deulofeu, who delivered two fantastic crosses for the Belgian's goals.\nWhat happened to the miserly Baggies?\nFor a team that came into the game having conceded only six goals in six matches, shipping three goals in one half would be a surprise to the casual observer.\nHowever, two injuries caused the Baggies' tight defence to become flaky.\nThe first occurred when Gareth McAuley was hurt in training prior to the match, and the second when Jonas Olsson came off in the 28th minute with what appeared to be a groin problem.\nEverton's defence also looked brittle in the first half, which again could be attributed to injuries, with John Stones, Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines missing. Fortunately for the inexperienced backline, the team's emphasis focused on attack as they chased the game after the break.\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\nManager reaction\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"The first goal kills us. We should deal with it. The other two goals are poor goals - the second one looks offside, the linesman is looking the wrong side. It's a poor decision.\n\"It's really, really disappointing because before we scored the second goal we had some good chances. We switched off and Everton will punish you.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We were very disappointed with the first half. We were off, every single individual.\n\"The mountain we had to climb, it would have been easy to lose focus but we got three goals against the best defensive structure in the Premier League.\n\"Every three points is huge but it feels extra good. Deulofeu took extra responsibility, he wanted the ball all night and it was a real mature performance.\"\nPundit analysis\nBBC Radio 5 live's Steve Claridge at the Hawthorns: \"Everton looked far more comfortable when they threw the shackles off and went for it. Going 2-0 down was the best thing that could happen to them.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTwelve of Saido Berahino's 16 Premier League goals since the start of last season have been scored at The Hawthorns.\nWest Brom are now the only team not to concede a goal away from home in the Premier League this season (Everton had also not done so, before Monday night)\nTony Pulis saw Stoke score 188 goals in 190 Premier League games, saw Crystal Palace score 26 in 26 and has now seen West Brom score 25 in 25.\nWest Brom have scored 13 set-piece (excluding penalties) goals since Tony Pulis took over. Only Crystal Palace (14) have more in that period.\nWhat's next for both teams?\nA brilliant win sets Roberto Martinez's Everton up nicely for Sunday's Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, with Liverpool only a point behind them in the table. As for West Brom, they are away at seventh-place Crystal Palace on Saturday."

It was a very good victory against a team who were top of the table.\"\nDecisions, decision, decisions\nBoth sides had cause for complaint as the assistant referees failed to spot players in offside positions for three of the goals at White Hart Lane.\nDe Bruyne was marginally ahead of play when he was set up by Yaya Toure before putting City in front, though it was a close call.\nThe decision for Tottenham's equaliser was more clear cut. Kyle Walker was clearly offside as he ran onto the ball down the left, before Son Heung-min had a shot saved at point-blank range by Willy Caballero. De Bruyne could only clear to Dier, who scored. City centre-back Martin Demichelis was booked for his complaints.\nEngland striker Kane then appeared to be in an offside position before latching onto the loose ball for his goal.\nWhat's gone wrong for City?\nCity had won five league games in succession before losing to Juventus in their opening Champions League match of the season 11 days ago.\nDefeat by the Italian champions appears to have knocked them out of their stride, and Manuel Pellegrini's side have now lost three of their past four matches.\nInjuries to key players have not helped, with goalkeeper Joe Hart on the bench at Spurs because of a back injury which meant he only trained for one day before the game.\nCaballero, his deputy, was caught out when he came for Lamela's free-kick and allowed Alderweireld to put the hosts 2-1 up.\nLike Hart, City skipper Vincent Kompany was also missing, while midfielder Toure injured a hamstring to add to Pellegrini's problems.\nMan of the match - Erik Lamela\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It is never easy to play against a club like Manchester City as they have so many great players. I congratulate my players because they were brilliant. We fully deserved the victory.\n\"We are all very happy for Harry Kane. As a striker, you want to score. It is very important for the team and him. We believe in his talent and quality.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"Two of their goals were offside. I think we didn't play well in second half. The Premier League is always very difficult.\n\"We must continue working and playing like we did in the opening 45 minutes.\"\nPundit analysis\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on Final Score: \"Spurs showed real character. Harry Kane has got his goal and they've taken their chances. After the derby defeat by Arsenal in midweek, this is exactly what they needed.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTottenham's starting XI against City had an average age of 24 years and 40 days - the youngest in the Premier League this season. The previous youngest side was also fielded by Spurs - against Crystal Palace last weekend (24 years 118 days).\nDe Bruyne has scored three goals in his past three games for City - from just four shots on target.\nToure has four assists in seven league appearances this season. He had only one in 29 games last season.\nTottenham scored four goals in a league game against Manchester City for the first time since September 1962, when they won 4-2.\nWhat next?\nCity will aim to get their Champions League campaign back on track when they visit Borussia Monchengladbach on Wednesday. Spurs are next in action on Thursday, when they travel to Monaco in the Europa League.",

Former Newcastle striker Loic Remy was unimpressive on his return to his old club, and Radamel Falcao failed to have an impact after coming off the bench.\nIt was down to fellow substitutes Ramires and Willian to give Chelsea the cutting edge they required in the closing stages, and it was clear how much they missed Costa.\nHe will be back for Chelsea's trip to Mourinho's former club Porto in the Champions League on Tuesday, but is unavailable for their next two league games at home to Southampton and Aston Villa because of his ban.\nNewcastle's new-found resolve is likely to be tested again in their next match, away at Manchester City next weekend.\nMan of the match - Ramires\nManager reaction\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren: \"A good result and a great performance, that's what we wanted. It's been a tough week and there was lots of pressure on the players today.\n\"That was more like it. We expect and demand a performance like that and they got the crowd behind them.\n\"You could see a determination in the players. Against the odds we grew into the game. The players showed real courage.\n\"Aleksandar Mitrovic has been missed and he can be a talisman for us. He is annoyed he hadn't scored but he can make a real difference for us.\"\nChelsea boss Jose Mourinho: \"We were so poor, so bad in the first half. It is possible to win the game with a good period but when you don't play for 45 minutes it's very difficult.\n\"I told the players at half-time that I have no time to ask them why they were so bad. I want to try to understand because I don't accept it.\n\"I am not a magician. I tried my best for the team. At half-time I said I was sorry I only had three subs as I wanted to change six.\n\"You cannot say that I react negatively, I complain, I am a critic. I laugh about it.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSteve McClaren has not won a Premier League game in 11 attempts: seven at Newcastle and four with Middlesbrough. It is his longest run without a top-flight victory.\nWest Brom are now the division's lowest scorers with four goals but Newcastle are second-lowest with five, having failed to find the net in four of their seven league matches.\nJose Mourinho has never won a Premier League match at St James' Park in six attempts (D3, L3).\nChelsea have conceded two or more goals in five consecutive league away matches for the first time since April to August 1992."

Their next Premier League games - against Everton, Tottenham and Southampton - could go a long way to deciding Rodgers's future.\nIs man-of-the-match Sturridge back to top form?\nThe huge boost from this game for Liverpool was the return of Sturridge's name to the scoresheet. The England international was making his second appearance since recovering from hip surgery.\nWhile he still has some fitness to gain before reproducing the form that saw him score 24 goals in 2013-14, he was the reason Liverpool won this game.\nHis first strike was a brilliant volley with the outside of his foot, and the second a calm finish after a one-two with Coutinho, who backheeled the ball to him.\nThe 26-year-old had two chances to complete his hat-trick in the final 10 minutes. First he failed to beat Micah Richards on the edge of the box, something a fully fit Sturridge might have been able to do. Then he forced a good low save from Brad Guzan who tipped his effort past the post.\nRodgers said: \"Sturridge showed what we missed for over a year - he makes the difference and helps you compete. His finishes were brilliant.\n\"He's nowhere near 100% fit yet. There was a couple of moments when he'd be away at his best but wasn't today. His two goals were the difference.\"\nCan Gestede keep Villa up?\nGestede, who replaced the injured Gabriel Agbonlahor in the line-up, was the only reason Villa - who played quite defensively - ran Liverpool so close at Anfield.\nThe Birmingham side, who were unbeaten on their last four trips to Anfield, have now picked up four points from seven games and drop into the relegation zone.\nThey had only four shots on target against the Reds, with Gestede, a summer signing from Blackburn, scoring both of his - to take him up to four for the season.\nHis first was a close-range scramble and his second a brilliant towering header as he beat centre-back Mamadou Sakho to a Jordan Amavi cross.\n'Players are behind Rodgers'\nLiverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva: \"We wanted to win for the manager. We know what has been said about him and I think we showed we are a group of players behind him and trying to make everything right. The pressure is on him but we wanted to play the way he wanted us to play and I think we did that.\"\nAston Villa boss Tim Sherwood: \"We can't score two away from home and lose - it happened against Leicester as well. You score twice at Anfield and you expect to leave with something. I've told the boys the goals were avoidable and we have to tighten up - Liverpool did not have to work too hard to get them, and we have to put that right.\n\"Our performances have merited better than one win in seven games but I said from the start it would be an uphill struggle. We need to stay in the division and if we do we will be stronger next year.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMilner's first goal for Liverpool was the quickest Premier League strike this season.\nThere were 70 seconds between Rudy Gestede's first goal of the game and Daniel Sturridge's second.\nSturridge has now scored in four consecutive Premier League games against Aston Villa.\nSince August 2013, Gestede has scored 21 headed goals in the league, six more than any other player in the English top four tiers.\nWhat's up next?\nVilla host Stoke in the Premier League next Saturday, while Liverpool are at home to Sion in the Europa League on Thursday - before Sunday's Merseyside derby at Everton.",

Wilson jogged freely at the side of the pitch but lasted only 30 seconds after coming back on before his leg gave way underneath him.\nThe 23-year-old had scored five goals in six Premier League matches and arrived in Staffordshire after talk of inclusion in the next England squad.\nHis afternoon ended prematurely as he left the field on a stretcher amid worrying scenes for the Cherries, who have already lost summer signings Tyrone Mings and Max Gradel to long-term knee injuries.\nStoke finally find a way to win\nFailure to record victory over Bournemouth would have meant Stoke had gone seven top-flight matches without a win for the first time since 1973-74.\nThe Potters surrendered a 2-0 advantage to draw with Leicester City seven days earlier and, when Dan Gosling's deflected strike beat Jack Butland to equalise for Bournemouth, it looked like a repeat was on the cards.\nMark Hughes, ranting from the touchline, was clearly unhappy his team had dropped deep to protect their lead but a moment of quality from Glen Johnson and Mame Biram Diouf eased the tension around the Britannia Stadium.\nAn unhappy hunting ground\nIt is safe to say there are grounds Bournemouth fans enjoy going to more than Stoke. The 1,635 supporters who made the 416-mile round trip to Staffordshire played a part in setting an attendance record at the Britannia Stadium but it was another day to forget in the Potteries for the Cherries.\nBournemouth have won just once away at Stoke - in 1991 and they have endured some particularly hard luck in recent visits.\nSeptember 2015: Bournemouth lost 2-1 and Callum Wilson suffered a knee injury\nJanuary 2003: Bournemouth lost 3-0 and had goalkeeper Chris Tardif sent off\nSeptember 2001: Bournemouth lost 2-0 when Shaun Maher scored own goal and Warren Feeney missed penalty\nOctober 2000: Bournemouth lost 2-1 and Richard Hughes missed a penalty\nApril 2000: Stoke Bournemouth lost 1-0 and Steve Robinson missed a penalty\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic\nManager reaction\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"It was an important win - we probably played better in other games and got beaten. This was about getting the three points.\n\"We played with a bit of apprehension in the second half which allowed them back into the game, but showed good courage after that as it would have been very easy for Bournemouth to gain momentum after their equaliser. Great ball by Glen Johnson for the goal, great finish by Mame Diouf.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"I was disappointed with the first half, we didn't react well to Callum's departure but thought we were dominant with the ball in the second half and at 1-1 there was only going to be one winner, so it's disappointing to have lost from there. We could have defended that situation better.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJonathan Walters scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since November 2014.\nTwelve of Walters' 14 Premier League goals since the start of 2014 have come at the Britannia Stadium.\nDan Gosling scored his first league goal since November 2011.\nStoke sealed their first win in seven league games, after losing three and drawing three of their previous six.\nMame Biram Diouf has netted five goals in his last seven league appearances.\nBournemouth have kept a clean sheet in just one of their seven league games this season.\nWhat's next?\nStoke travel to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 BST), while Bournemouth are at home to fellow promoted side Watford at the same time."

He did, however, provide an assist for West Ham's first equaliser, cutting the ball back for Sakho to signal a home resurgence.\nVisiting skipper Russell Martin, who earned the Canaries a point against Liverpool last week, led from the back, winning the ball back seven times as well as making seven clearances, but ultimately left disappointed.\nHaving looked like snatching all three points through with seven minutes remaining, Redmond rounding off a period of sustained pressure with his goal, Norwich conceded late in injury time; Ruddy tried to punch the ball away but it ricocheted off Andy Carroll allowing a grateful Kouyate to stab home.\nMan of the match - Robbie Brady\nWhat they said\nNorwich midfielder Nathan Redmond: \"I thought we had played well and gave ourselves a great opportunity to win the game.

His side now top the Premier League after Manchester City's defeat by Tottenham earlier on Saturday.\nDespite rarely being tested by Sunderland, the hosts struggled to open up Dick Advocaat's side in a lacklustre first period, with the game turning in the two minutes either side of the break.\nThat allowed the likes of Rooney and Mata more space to influence the game, but much of United's endeavour relied on the pace and trickery of Martial and Depay, who, at times, bullied the Sunderland backline.\nThere is a growing theme to United's performances; they may not be thrilling but they are proving hard to beat. The Red Devils lead Manchester City by a point as they target their first Premier League title since 2013.\nRooney on an upward curve\nRooney does not look back to his best, but after scoring in the League Cup win over Ipswich in midweek, he showed his goalscoring prowess remains a vital weapon for United. There were signs he is forming a good partnership with Martial.\nAlthough his Premier League drought stretched back to April last season, he was quick to gamble at the near post when Martial caused havoc in the Sunderland defence, scoring his seventh goal of the season for club and country.\nRooney looks more suited to the number 10 role behind lone striker Martial, who has scored four goals in his opening four games for the club.\nAnd with the teenager's pace and strength creating space ahead of him, Rooney could yet find the sort of form he did playing behind Robin van Persie in the 2012-2013 title-winning season.\nSunderland's woes continue\nAdvocaat, who played alongside Van Gaal for Sparta Rotterdam in the 1980s, had lost only once to his friend in their 10 previous meetings, and for much of the first half it looked as though he might extend that record.\nHaving seen his team concede 10 of their 13 league goals in the first half of matches, Advocaat set up the Black Cats to defend, and they were agonisingly close to going into the break at 0-0.\nBut Depay's strike broke their resolve and Rooney's goal seemed to destroy any confidence that may have remained.\nAlthough De Gea was called into action on a few occasions, Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole lacked any meaningful support as he made an aggressive return to the side.\nDefeat leaves Sunderland still searching for their first league win of the season, with games against West Ham and West Brom next before they face arch-rivals and fellow strugglers Newcastle on 25 October.\nMan of the match: Anthony Martial\nManager reaction\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"It's a nice feeling to be top of the table. It's the first time in my period so I'm happy. It's always difficult when you play against a team who is only defending and counting on the counter attack. You have to be aware and my defence was very good.\n\"I was very happy with the goal in extra time because they punished themselves. They were always wasting time and the referee was not reacting to that. A goal is the biggest influence in a game and I changed my approach at half-time because of that.\"\nSunderland boss Dick Advocaat: \"The first half we did well, organisation wise, but the problem was they scored one minute before half-time and one minute after half-time. United were the better side but they didn't create a lot of chances. It's a shame we gave that goal away in the first half because it made things different in the second half.\"\nStats you need to know\nVan Gaal recorded his first win in nine games against a side managed by Advocaat.\nOnly two players - Bobby Charlton (199) and Jack Rowley (182) - have more league goals for Man Utd than Rooney (171).\nMata has either scored or assisted in five of his past six Premier League appearances (four assists, two goals).\nAfter keeping three consecutive clean sheets in May, the Black Cats have conceded in each of their past eight Premier League matches.\nThe Black Cats are now on a 10-game winless streak in the Premier League (D4 L6); the longest current run in the competition.\nWhat next for Manchester United?\nVan Gaal will hope a third consecutive victory can boost their Champions League hopes when they host Wolfsburg on Wednesday, having lost their opener against PSV Eindhoven.

He did, however, provide an assist for West Ham's first equaliser, cutting the ball back for Sakho to signal a home resurgence.\nVisiting skipper Russell Martin, who earned the Canaries a point against Liverpool last week, led from the back, winning the ball back seven times as well as making seven clearances, but ultimately left disappointed.\nHaving looked like snatching all three points through with seven minutes remaining, Redmond rounding off a period of sustained pressure with his goal, Norwich conceded late in injury time; Ruddy tried to punch the ball away but it ricocheted off Andy Carroll allowing a grateful Kouyate to stab home.\nMan of the match - Robbie Brady\nWhat they said\nNorwich midfielder Nathan Redmond: \"I thought we had played well and gave ourselves a great opportunity to win the game. I thought we secured it with my goal but we are disappointed to concede late on.\"\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"When you concede with a minute to go, it is always disappointing but we will take encouragement from how well we played.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"I am happy that we showed the character at the end and we deserved it. A draw is a fair result and they are probably gutted because of the timing of the last goal.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Ham players have made four errors leading to goals in the Premier League this season; more than any other club.\nDiafra Sakho has now scored in five of his six Premier League appearances in September.\nWes Hoolahan has assisted five and scored one of Norwich's 11 Premier League goals this season."

Former Newcastle striker Loic Remy was unimpressive on his return to his old club, and Radamel Falcao failed to have an impact after coming off the bench.\nIt was down to fellow substitutes Ramires and Willian to give Chelsea the cutting edge they required in the closing stages, and it was clear how much they missed Costa.\nHe will be back for Chelsea's trip to Mourinho's former club Porto in the Champions League on Tuesday, but is unavailable for their next two league games at home to Southampton and Aston Villa because of his ban.\nNewcastle's new-found resolve is likely to be tested again in their next match, away at Manchester City next weekend.\nMan of the match - Ramires\nManager reaction\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren: \"A good result and a great performance, that's what we wanted. It's been a tough week and there was lots of pressure on the players today.\n\"That was more like it. We expect and demand a performance like that and they got the crowd behind them.\n\"You could see a determination in the players. Against the odds we grew into the game. The players showed real courage.\n\"Aleksandar Mitrovic has been missed and he can be a talisman for us. He is annoyed he hadn't scored but he can make a real difference for us.\"\nChelsea boss Jose Mourinho: \"We were so poor, so bad in the first half. It is possible to win the game with a good period but when you don't play for 45 minutes it's very difficult.\n\"I told the players at half-time that I have no time to ask them why they were so bad. I want to try to understand because I don't accept it.\n\"I am not a magician. I tried my best for the team. At half-time I said I was sorry I only had three subs as I wanted to change six.\n\"You cannot say that I react negatively, I complain, I am a critic. I laugh about it.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSteve McClaren has not won a Premier League game in 11 attempts: seven at Newcastle and four with Middlesbrough. It is his longest run without a top-flight victory.\nWest Brom are now the division's lowest scorers with four goals but Newcastle are second-lowest with five, having failed to find the net in four of their seven league matches.\nJose Mourinho has never won a Premier League match at St James' Park in six attempts (D3, L3).\nChelsea have conceded two or more goals in five consecutive league away matches for the first time since April to August 1992.",

The 6ft 4in Italian was a nuisance in the air, winning 50% of a team-high eight aerial duels, and was the pick of the Southampton XI when it came to passing stats - making 31 in the opposition half.\nOf course it was his contribution to the goals that made the biggest impact. His first was a lovely lofted ball for Tadic, whose intended square pass for Mane was deflected in.\nAnd he had a big hand in Mane's goal when his strike came off the boot of defender Ashley Williams and arrived at the feet of the impressive Mane, who produced a delightfully composed finish.\nSwans at sea?\nPerhaps not quite, because the team performed well, they just lacked someone to provide a clinical finish.\nStriker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has scored four in the league so far this season, went missing before he was found and substituted at half-time. His contribution? Seven passes in total, no efforts on goal and what is now his obligatory stray into an offside position.\nFellow attacking player Andre Ayew was busy, but not so much in the final third as he was involved in a team-high 17 duels in midfield - almost twice as many as his team-mates.\nGylfi Sigurdsson impressed in flashes and of course scored the penalty that gave the Swans a glimmer. Although that is all it was.\nPerhaps Garry Monk needs to rethink his attacking strategy because there was not much support for either lone striker - Gomis and substitute Eder.\nManager reaction\nSwansea boss Garry Monk:\n\"We have not been up to scratch in the last two away games. We were not focused enough and possibly made too many mistakes today.\n\"They punished us and we never recovered from that. All three goals were disappointing. It was poor decision-making and individual errors. It's not good enough for the standard we have set here at the club.\n\"We pushed to try to get back. We got the goal then had a couple of chances to make it 3-2. It's difficult to assess straight after the game what went wrong.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman:\n\"It was not a very good performance today. The way we played is not the level we expect. But we were much more clinical today than normally. That was the difference between Swansea and Southampton.\n\"You need good communication in the team but we had some problems - they were allowed four or five good shots from outside the area.\n\"At 3-0 up we should have dominated more in the last 30 minutes. We were too much in mind to defend the result rather than go and score more. I like to win and play good football.\"\nMan of the match - Graziano Pelle (Southampton)\nThe stats you need to know\nSouthampton have lost only one of their seven Premier League games versus Swansea (W4 D2).\nThe Saints have won six of their last nine PL games at St Mary's, losing two (D1).\nSwansea have won just three of their 17 Premier League games in the month of September (W3 D4 L10).\nSadio Mane has scored or assisted eight goals in his last five Premier League appearances at St Mary's (four goals, four assists).\nDusan Tadic has scored three goals in his last three Premier League appearances for Southampton on home soil.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton have a tricky test at Stamford Bridge for next Saturday's evening game against Chelsea. Swansea will look to get back in the winning habit at home to Tottenham next Sunday."

They saw both.\nThe left side of the graphic below shows that Lukaku found himself in deep positions in the first half as he tried to get into the game.\nHowever, with Everton chasing the match after the break, he moved further forward and became more of a threat in and around the area. The service also improved from Spaniard Deulofeu, who delivered two fantastic crosses for the Belgian's goals.\nWhat happened to the miserly Baggies?\nFor a team that came into the game having conceded only six goals in six matches, shipping three goals in one half would be a surprise to the casual observer.\nHowever, two injuries caused the Baggies' tight defence to become flaky.\nThe first occurred when Gareth McAuley was hurt in training prior to the match, and the second when Jonas Olsson came off in the 28th minute with what appeared to be a groin problem.\nEverton's defence also looked brittle in the first half, which again could be attributed to injuries, with John Stones, Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines missing. Fortunately for the inexperienced backline, the team's emphasis focused on attack as they chased the game after the break.\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\nManager reaction\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"The first goal kills us. We should deal with it. The other two goals are poor goals - the second one looks offside, the linesman is looking the wrong side. It's a poor decision.\n\"It's really, really disappointing because before we scored the second goal we had some good chances. We switched off and Everton will punish you.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We were very disappointed with the first half. We were off, every single individual.\n\"The mountain we had to climb, it would have been easy to lose focus but we got three goals against the best defensive structure in the Premier League.\n\"Every three points is huge but it feels extra good. Deulofeu took extra responsibility, he wanted the ball all night and it was a real mature performance.\"\nPundit analysis\nBBC Radio 5 live's Steve Claridge at the Hawthorns: \"Everton looked far more comfortable when they threw the shackles off and went for it. Going 2-0 down was the best thing that could happen to them.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTwelve of Saido Berahino's 16 Premier League goals since the start of last season have been scored at The Hawthorns.\nWest Brom are now the only team not to concede a goal away from home in the Premier League this season (Everton had also not done so, before Monday night)\nTony Pulis saw Stoke score 188 goals in 190 Premier League games, saw Crystal Palace score 26 in 26 and has now seen West Brom score 25 in 25.\nWest Brom have scored 13 set-piece (excluding penalties) goals since Tony Pulis took over. Only Crystal Palace (14) have more in that period.\nWhat's next for both teams?\nA brilliant win sets Roberto Martinez's Everton up nicely for Sunday's Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, with Liverpool only a point behind them in the table. As for West Brom, they are away at seventh-place Crystal Palace on Saturday.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Liverpool 3-2 Aston Villa\nDaniel Sturridge scored his first two goals since March as Liverpool beat Aston Villa in an entertaining game.\nReds midfielder James Milner opened the scoring after 66 seconds against his former club from 20 yards.\nStriker Sturridge doubled their lead after the break with a volley following a one-two with Milner, but Rudy Gestede pulled one back from close range.\nSturridge scored his second from Philippe Coutinho's pass, but Gestede gave Villa hope with a fine header.\nLiverpool boss Brendan Rodgers had been under pressure after six games without a win, other than Wednesday's League Cup penalty shootout victory over Carlisle.\nRead how Liverpool beat Aston Villa minute-by-minute here.\nFollow reaction to all of Saturday's action here.\nHas this relieved the pressure on Rodgers?\nSlightly, but probably not that much.\nThere were plans for Liverpool fans to dress up as Jurgen Klopp, the former Borussia Dortmund coach who some would like to see replace Rodgers, though there was little evidence this came to fruition.\nLiverpool will be happy to have ended such a poor run and move up to seventh in the Premier League - but they were made to work for victory against one of the worst sides in the division.\nThe Reds played some decent football for their goals, but they were caught out by Villa twice. Their next Premier League games - against Everton, Tottenham and Southampton - could go a long way to deciding Rodgers's future.\nIs man-of-the-match Sturridge back to top form?\nThe huge boost from this game for Liverpool was the return of Sturridge's name to the scoresheet. The England international was making his second appearance since recovering from hip surgery.\nWhile he still has some fitness to gain before reproducing the form that saw him score 24 goals in 2013-14, he was the reason Liverpool won this game.\nHis first strike was a brilliant volley with the outside of his foot, and the second a calm finish after a one-two with Coutinho, who backheeled the ball to him.\nThe 26-year-old had two chances to complete his hat-trick in the final 10 minutes. First he failed to beat Micah Richards on the edge of the box, something a fully fit Sturridge might have been able to do. Then he forced a good low save from Brad Guzan who tipped his effort past the post.\nRodgers said: \"Sturridge showed what we missed for over a year - he makes the difference and helps you compete. His finishes were brilliant.\n\"He's nowhere near 100% fit yet. There was a couple of moments when he'd be away at his best but wasn't today. His two goals were the difference.\"\nCan Gestede keep Villa up?\nGestede, who replaced the injured Gabriel Agbonlahor in the line-up, was the only reason Villa - who played quite defensively - ran Liverpool so close at Anfield.\nThe Birmingham side, who were unbeaten on their last four trips to Anfield, have now picked up four points from seven games and drop into the relegation zone.\nThey had only four shots on target against the Reds, with Gestede, a summer signing from Blackburn, scoring both of his - to take him up to four for the season.\nHis first was a close-range scramble and his second a brilliant towering header as he beat centre-back Mamadou Sakho to a Jordan Amavi cross.\n'Players are behind Rodgers'\nLiverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva: \"We wanted to win for the manager. We know what has been said about him and I think we showed we are a group of players behind him and trying to make everything right. The pressure is on him but we wanted to play the way he wanted us to play and I think we did that.\"\nAston Villa boss Tim Sherwood: \"We can't score two away from home and lose - it happened against Leicester as well. You score twice at Anfield and you expect to leave with something. I've told the boys the goals were avoidable and we have to tighten up - Liverpool did not have to work too hard to get them, and we have to put that right.\n\"Our performances have merited better than one win in seven games but I said from the start it would be an uphill struggle. We need to stay in the division and if we do we will be stronger next year.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMilner's first goal for Liverpool was the quickest Premier League strike this season.\nThere were 70 seconds between Rudy Gestede's first goal of the game and Daniel Sturridge's second.\nSturridge has now scored in four consecutive Premier League games against Aston Villa.\nSince August 2013, Gestede has scored 21 headed goals in the league, six more than any other player in the English top four tiers.\nWhat's up next?\nVilla host Stoke in the Premier League next Saturday, while Liverpool are at home to Sion in the Europa League on Thursday - before Sunday's Merseyside derby at Everton."

Back was the attractive one-touch football as they cut through Leicester's back line - albeit one that has now leaked 14 goals.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger said Sanchez is now \"back to his best\", and his side have now moved up to fourth in the table, just three points behind new leaders Manchester United.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez\nManager reaction\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"We must begin again now and repeat this start to the season. We fought and tried everything to score and the match was very open in the first half, but in the second half when Sanchez scored it was finished.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It took Alexis a while to find his form. He didn't come back straight away from the Copa America and after a competition like that it takes some time. Alexis was waiting for a goal and he's not used to not scoring for so long so it was important for him to score.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAlexis Sanchez is the first player to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, Serie A and La Liga\nTheo Walcott has netted 12 goals in his last 13 Premier League starts\nSince making his Premier League debut in August 2012, Santi Cazorla has provided more assists than any other player (32).\nJamie Vardy has scored in four successive league games for the first time in his career.\nOnly once in their 19 league meetings have Arsenal failed to score against Leicester.\nArsenal netted five goals against Leicester, as many as they had scored in their previous six top-tier games in total.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host Greek side Olympiakos in the Champions League on Tuesday (19:45 BST) while Leicester travel to Norwich next Saturday (15:00).",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 3-0 Sunderland\nManchester United climbed to the top of the Premier League table for the first time in more than two years with victory over bottom club Sunderland.\nMemphis Depay scored his fourth goal of the season by tucking in from Juan Mata's cut-back just before half time.\nUnited doubled their lead 40 seconds after the break as Wayne Rooney bundled home from close range to end an 11-game scoring drought in the Premier League.\nMata then converted Ashley Young's cross as Sunderland remained bottom.\nUntil Depay slid in the opener in first-half stoppage time, the hosts looked ponderous in attack but once they went 2-0 up after good work from Anthony Martial, Sunderland had little to offer in response.\nRooney's fifth goal of the season took him level with Denis Law as United's joint-third leading league scorer with 171, and ended his longest barren spell in the Premier League which stretched to 1,000 minutes.\nDavid De Gea was rarely troubled but made good saves from Jeremain Lens and Patrick van Aanholt, with United having conceded just once in the league at home this season.\nFollow all the reaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive Manchester United's win over Sunderland\nUnited stutter to the top\nThis victory was another fillip for United boss Louis van Gaal, who has been questioned about a lack of incisiveness in United's play this season. His side now top the Premier League after Manchester City's defeat by Tottenham earlier on Saturday.\nDespite rarely being tested by Sunderland, the hosts struggled to open up Dick Advocaat's side in a lacklustre first period, with the game turning in the two minutes either side of the break.\nThat allowed the likes of Rooney and Mata more space to influence the game, but much of United's endeavour relied on the pace and trickery of Martial and Depay, who, at times, bullied the Sunderland backline.\nThere is a growing theme to United's performances; they may not be thrilling but they are proving hard to beat. The Red Devils lead Manchester City by a point as they target their first Premier League title since 2013.\nRooney on an upward curve\nRooney does not look back to his best, but after scoring in the League Cup win over Ipswich in midweek, he showed his goalscoring prowess remains a vital weapon for United. There were signs he is forming a good partnership with Martial.\nAlthough his Premier League drought stretched back to April last season, he was quick to gamble at the near post when Martial caused havoc in the Sunderland defence, scoring his seventh goal of the season for club and country.\nRooney looks more suited to the number 10 role behind lone striker Martial, who has scored four goals in his opening four games for the club.\nAnd with the teenager's pace and strength creating space ahead of him, Rooney could yet find the sort of form he did playing behind Robin van Persie in the 2012-2013 title-winning season.\nSunderland's woes continue\nAdvocaat, who played alongside Van Gaal for Sparta Rotterdam in the 1980s, had lost only once to his friend in their 10 previous meetings, and for much of the first half it looked as though he might extend that record.\nHaving seen his team concede 10 of their 13 league goals in the first half of matches, Advocaat set up the Black Cats to defend, and they were agonisingly close to going into the break at 0-0.\nBut Depay's strike broke their resolve and Rooney's goal seemed to destroy any confidence that may have remained.\nAlthough De Gea was called into action on a few occasions, Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole lacked any meaningful support as he made an aggressive return to the side.\nDefeat leaves Sunderland still searching for their first league win of the season, with games against West Ham and West Brom next before they face arch-rivals and fellow strugglers Newcastle on 25 October.\nMan of the match: Anthony Martial\nManager reaction\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"It's a nice feeling to be top of the table. It's the first time in my period so I'm happy. It's always difficult when you play against a team who is only defending and counting on the counter attack. You have to be aware and my defence was very good.\n\"I was very happy with the goal in extra time because they punished themselves. They were always wasting time and the referee was not reacting to that. A goal is the biggest influence in a game and I changed my approach at half-time because of that.\"\nSunderland boss Dick Advocaat: \"The first half we did well, organisation wise, but the problem was they scored one minute before half-time and one minute after half-time. United were the better side but they didn't create a lot of chances. It's a shame we gave that goal away in the first half because it made things different in the second half.\"\nStats you need to know\nVan Gaal recorded his first win in nine games against a side managed by Advocaat.\nOnly two players - Bobby Charlton (199) and Jack Rowley (182) - have more league goals for Man Utd than Rooney (171).\nMata has either scored or assisted in five of his past six Premier League appearances (four assists, two goals).\nAfter keeping three consecutive clean sheets in May, the Black Cats have conceded in each of their past eight Premier League matches.\nThe Black Cats are now on a 10-game winless streak in the Premier League (D4 L6); the longest current run in the competition.\nWhat next for Manchester United?\nVan Gaal will hope a third consecutive victory can boost their Champions League hopes when they host Wolfsburg on Wednesday, having lost their opener against PSV Eindhoven. United then travel to Arsenal and Everton in the Premier League, either side of the international break."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Southampton 3-1 Swansea City\nVirgil van Dijk scored his first goal for Southampton who eased to a comfortable victory over Swansea.\nThe Dutch centre-back, who signed from Celtic in the summer for \u00a313m, headed in at the near post to give the Saints an 11th minute lead.\nDusan Tadic made it 2-0 after the break when his attempted cross went in off Ki Sung-yueng before Sadio Mane slotted in the third from inside the area.\nGylfi Sigurdsson scored a penalty for the Swans in the 83rd minute.\nReferee Roger East pointed to the spot after Jose Fonte had pulled down Neil Taylor, although Swans forward Eder put the ball in the net unaware the whistle had been blown.\nSouthampton's second league win of the season sees them move to nine points, level with the Swans who have now not won in three.\nRelive Southampton's 3-1 win over Swansea\nFollow all the reaction to this match and Saturday's other games.\nSaints forwards in unison\nIt was a day when everything clicked for Southampton's front men.\nGraziano Pelle failed to add to his four goals this season, but he was integral to his side's success. The 6ft 4in Italian was a nuisance in the air, winning 50% of a team-high eight aerial duels, and was the pick of the Southampton XI when it came to passing stats - making 31 in the opposition half.\nOf course it was his contribution to the goals that made the biggest impact. His first was a lovely lofted ball for Tadic, whose intended square pass for Mane was deflected in.\nAnd he had a big hand in Mane's goal when his strike came off the boot of defender Ashley Williams and arrived at the feet of the impressive Mane, who produced a delightfully composed finish.\nSwans at sea?\nPerhaps not quite, because the team performed well, they just lacked someone to provide a clinical finish.\nStriker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has scored four in the league so far this season, went missing before he was found and substituted at half-time. His contribution? Seven passes in total, no efforts on goal and what is now his obligatory stray into an offside position.\nFellow attacking player Andre Ayew was busy, but not so much in the final third as he was involved in a team-high 17 duels in midfield - almost twice as many as his team-mates.\nGylfi Sigurdsson impressed in flashes and of course scored the penalty that gave the Swans a glimmer. Although that is all it was.\nPerhaps Garry Monk needs to rethink his attacking strategy because there was not much support for either lone striker - Gomis and substitute Eder.\nManager reaction\nSwansea boss Garry Monk:\n\"We have not been up to scratch in the last two away games. We were not focused enough and possibly made too many mistakes today.\n\"They punished us and we never recovered from that. All three goals were disappointing. It was poor decision-making and individual errors. It's not good enough for the standard we have set here at the club.\n\"We pushed to try to get back. We got the goal then had a couple of chances to make it 3-2. It's difficult to assess straight after the game what went wrong.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman:\n\"It was not a very good performance today. The way we played is not the level we expect. But we were much more clinical today than normally. That was the difference between Swansea and Southampton.\n\"You need good communication in the team but we had some problems - they were allowed four or five good shots from outside the area.\n\"At 3-0 up we should have dominated more in the last 30 minutes. We were too much in mind to defend the result rather than go and score more. I like to win and play good football.\"\nMan of the match - Graziano Pelle (Southampton)\nThe stats you need to know\nSouthampton have lost only one of their seven Premier League games versus Swansea (W4 D2).\nThe Saints have won six of their last nine PL games at St Mary's, losing two (D1).\nSwansea have won just three of their 17 Premier League games in the month of September (W3 D4 L10).\nSadio Mane has scored or assisted eight goals in his last five Premier League appearances at St Mary's (four goals, four assists).\nDusan Tadic has scored three goals in his last three Premier League appearances for Southampton on home soil.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton have a tricky test at Stamford Bridge for next Saturday's evening game against Chelsea. Swansea will look to get back in the winning habit at home to Tottenham next Sunday.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Tottenham Hotspur 4-1 Manchester City\nManchester City lost a second league game in a row, with Harry Kane scoring his first club goal this season as Tottenham came from 1-0 down to win.\nKevin de Bruyne angled in an effort to put leaders City in front before Eric Dier equalised with a 25-yard shot.\nToby Alderweireld then nodded Spurs in front from an Erik Lamela free-kick.\nKane side-footed in when team-mate Christian Eriksen's free-kick came back off the woodwork before Lamela slid home as the visitors chased the game.\nKane is finally able\nKane scored four goals in his first eight games for Spurs last season but had gone 12 hours without scoring for his club when the clock ticked past 33 minutes here.\nHe looked to be in for another frustrating game when, having already shot wide, he was denied by keeper Willy Caballero after digging the ball out to get another effort away with his left foot.\nBut just after the hour mark, he was rewarded for his persistence to end a run of 748 minutes without a goal for his club.\n\"There's been a lot of talk but I'm a confident man and have faith in my ability,\" Kane told BT Sport. \"I'm delighted. It was a very good victory against a team who were top of the table.\"\nDecisions, decision, decisions\nBoth sides had cause for complaint as the assistant referees failed to spot players in offside positions for three of the goals at White Hart Lane.\nDe Bruyne was marginally ahead of play when he was set up by Yaya Toure before putting City in front, though it was a close call.\nThe decision for Tottenham's equaliser was more clear cut. Kyle Walker was clearly offside as he ran onto the ball down the left, before Son Heung-min had a shot saved at point-blank range by Willy Caballero. De Bruyne could only clear to Dier, who scored. City centre-back Martin Demichelis was booked for his complaints.\nEngland striker Kane then appeared to be in an offside position before latching onto the loose ball for his goal.\nWhat's gone wrong for City?\nCity had won five league games in succession before losing to Juventus in their opening Champions League match of the season 11 days ago.\nDefeat by the Italian champions appears to have knocked them out of their stride, and Manuel Pellegrini's side have now lost three of their past four matches.\nInjuries to key players have not helped, with goalkeeper Joe Hart on the bench at Spurs because of a back injury which meant he only trained for one day before the game.\nCaballero, his deputy, was caught out when he came for Lamela's free-kick and allowed Alderweireld to put the hosts 2-1 up.\nLike Hart, City skipper Vincent Kompany was also missing, while midfielder Toure injured a hamstring to add to Pellegrini's problems.\nMan of the match - Erik Lamela\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It is never easy to play against a club like Manchester City as they have so many great players. I congratulate my players because they were brilliant. We fully deserved the victory.\n\"We are all very happy for Harry Kane. As a striker, you want to score. It is very important for the team and him. We believe in his talent and quality.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"Two of their goals were offside. I think we didn't play well in second half. The Premier League is always very difficult.\n\"We must continue working and playing like we did in the opening 45 minutes.\"\nPundit analysis\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on Final Score: \"Spurs showed real character. Harry Kane has got his goal and they've taken their chances. After the derby defeat by Arsenal in midweek, this is exactly what they needed.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTottenham's starting XI against City had an average age of 24 years and 40 days - the youngest in the Premier League this season. The previous youngest side was also fielded by Spurs - against Crystal Palace last weekend (24 years 118 days).\nDe Bruyne has scored three goals in his past three games for City - from just four shots on target.\nToure has four assists in seven league appearances this season. He had only one in 29 games last season.\nTottenham scored four goals in a league game against Manchester City for the first time since September 1962, when they won 4-2.\nWhat next?\nCity will aim to get their Champions League campaign back on track when they visit Borussia Monchengladbach on Wednesday. Spurs are next in action on Thursday, when they travel to Monaco in the Europa League."

We talked all week about getting back to our level, and you could see the passion and the desire we had to win the game was massive.\n\"We have performed fantastically in many games already this season, but we've had a couple where we were well below our standards.\n\"According to some people, a three-game run is a blip, but I know my players have quality.\n\"It's just a question of getting that out of them on a consistent basis. We saw it here and hopefully now we can go from strength to strength.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"He [Eriksen] is a very important player for us and if you give him chances to shoot he can have an impact on the game.\n\"He is one of the best at dead-ball situations, it is hard to say he is the best but he is one of the best.\n\"We have maybe dropped two points. We are disappointed with the result but not the performance or effort.\n\"We did not win the game because of an own goal but Harry does not need to worry about it. He does a lot for the team.\"",

Chelsea's fourth defeat of the season leaves them 16th.\nThe Blues have taken only eight points from a possible 24 this season and are only four above the relegation zone.\nRelive the action from Stamford Bridge as it unfolded\nAll the reaction from Saturday's games\nChelsea's defensive frailties exposed again\nChelsea's struggles this season have been exacerbated by an uncharacteristically poor defence. They have now conceded 17 league goals - two more than they did in the whole of Mourinho's first season with the club in 2004-05.\nFollowing Chelsea's defeat by Porto in the Champions League on Tuesday, fans called for the return of captain John Terry, and they got their wish on Saturday as the 34-year-old was restored to the centre of defence alongside Gary Cahill.\nHowever, Terry's presence did not solve Chelsea's problems. Branislav Ivanovic and Ramires were fortunate to avoid giving away penalties with clumsy challenges, while Davis was allowed to run unchallenged to score the equaliser from Pelle's chested pass.\nAfter the break, Cahill gave the ball away to Dusan Tadic and Terry failed to cut out his pass, enabling Mane to put Saints in front.\nMane was a constant menace to the Blues defence, which backed off to allow the forward to set up Pelle for Southampton's third.\nMisfiring Falcao\nWith Diego Costa serving the last game of a three-match suspension, the visit of Southampton provided Radamel Falcao with a chance to make a case for a regular starting place.\nHe has scored only one goal since joining on loan from Monaco in July and, based on his showing against Southampton, it is unlikely he will be threatening Costa any time soon.\nAlthough Falcao had a strong claim for a penalty when he fell under a challenge by Saints goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, he did not trouble the visitors enough and managed a solitary shot in 90 minutes.\nBig decisions going against Chelsea?\nMourinho was incensed that no penalty was given for the incident involving Falcao, claiming that officials are \"afraid\" to give decisions for Chelsea.\nHe said: \"It was a big penalty for us. Not small, not doubtful. Big. Huge.\n\"That was a penalty. We don't get decisions and I think referees are afraid to give decisions to us.\n\"When we are top I understand everyone wants to push you down, but when you are down give us a break.\"\nRead more from Jose Mourinho\nCan Saints build on last season?\nSouthampton performed beyond expectations to finish seventh in the Premier League last season, but they had won only two of their first seven games this term before the trip to Chelsea.\nHowever, the manner of this victory - their first at Stamford Bridge since 2002 - will give them confidence of challenging for a top-seven finish again.\nThey rarely looked troubled by the Blues, with Mane and Pelle combining to devastating effect in attack. One or both of them played a part in all three goals.\nSouthampton are also a tough side to break down - only Everton have beaten them by more than one goal in the Premier League this season.\nMan of the match: Sadio Mane\nWhat they said\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"If we can show this against Chelsea we can show it much more.\n\"We had a difficult start to the game but we came back and we made it 1-1 with a great goal. The difference was how we came out of the dressing room, pressed Chelsea and had fantastic movement.\n\"We totally deserve three points today.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea have conceded at least two goals in seven of their eight Premier League games this season (the other game was a 2-0 win against Arsenal)\nChelsea have conceded as many goals in their last four home league games (seven) as they had in the previous 17 at Stamford Bridge\nChelsea have eight points from eight games. The average finishing position from this start is 14th\nThis is Chelsea's lowest points total after eight games in a top-flight season since 1978-79 (four points), when a win earned two points.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Norwich City 1-2 Leicester City\nLeicester moved up to fourth in the Premier League with a narrow victory over Norwich at Carrow Road.\nThe Canaries had most of the possession in the first half, but Leicester went ahead through striker Jamie Vardy's penalty after being brought down.\nJeffrey Schlupp put the Foxes in control by slotting in a second, before Norwich's Dieumerci Mbokani scored.\nNathan Redmond struck the post with a rising, angled drive in the closing minutes, but Leicester held on.\nDespite a late flurry, the hosts - who slip to 13th place - were unable to find an equaliser and prevent their first defeat in five games in all competitions.\nRelive all the action from Norwich v Leicester\nAll the reaction from Saturday's games\nRanieri's gamble\nClaudio Ranieri bold decision to leave out Riyad Mahrez, one of Leicester's most influential players this term, met with murmurs of discontent before the game, but the Italian was rewarded for his bold move. The Algerian playmaker's mantle was assumed by Shinji Okazaki, who was a pest to the Norwich defence in tandem with Jamie Vardy.\nThe Japanese forward - signed from German Bundesliga club Mainz in the summer - could not polish his fine performance with a goal, heading over a cross inside the opening seven minutes and skidding a low shot narrowly wide.\nBut he was integral to a wonderful counter-attacking display from Leicester, who created a flurry of chances on the break. Vardy, Danny Drinkwater and Jeffrey Schlupp (twice) all spurned opportunities.\nBlunt force\nIt was a frustrating afternoon for Norwich, who enjoyed plenty of the ball and spent large swathes of the second half arrowing, looping and scuffing deliveries into the Leicester penalty area. For all that, though, they created precious few clear chances.\nThe introduction of striker Mbokani on the hour did, however, offer a reference point for those attacks and eased the burden on the hitherto isolated Cameron Jerome.\nAnd the DR Congo striker's first goal for the club hauled the hosts back into the contest with 20 minutes remaining. Less than a minute after forcing a header against the crossbar, the 29-year-old - signed from Dinamo Kiev in August - was left unattended eight yards from goal to flick a deep cross past Kasper Schmeichel.\nA series of increasingly frantic attacks followed, with Sebastien Bassong just failing to connect with a Robbie Brady cross, Redmond hitting the outside of an upright and Christian Fuchs deflecting another Redmond effort wide, having earlier headed unwittingly over his own crossbar.\nHistory repeats itself\nAt a Carrow Road stadium bathed in Indian summer sun, the home side fell to their second home defeat of the campaign - in front of a record attendance of 27,067 for an all-seater match.\nNorwich have now picked up maximum points in just one of their last six games, but have an opportunity to turn their form around when they face bottom side Newcastle at St James' Park in their next league game.\nLeicester bounced back from last weekend's heavy defeat against Arsenal and have now lost just once in their last 10 Premier League games dating back to last season. The face Southampton, away, after the international break.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy\nWhat they said\nLeicester winger Jeffrey Schlupp: \"Everyone has seen that we don't lack the fight and team spirit. We can dig deep when we need to.\n\"We can adapt to any situation. Jamie Vardy up front terrorises the defenders. He is a pest and always in the defenders' faces.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We responded very well after our defeat against Arsenal. We showed good character and it was a good performance.\n\"We have 15 points, 25 less than we need to. After we get that, we will see what happens.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"Today, for us in the way we played, it did not work. Our use of the ball was not good enough.\n\"The lads will be disappointed and did not do themselves justice in the first half. In the second, they tried but it is difficult being two goals down.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester have won more penalties (4) than any other Premier League team this season\nLeicester City have won 11 Premier League games since the start of April - only Manchester City (12) have more\nOnly two of Norwich's 17 shots in this game were on target"

The last time they had a longer run was in 1984 (11).\nLiverpool have won just one of their last nine away Premier League games (D4 L4).\nThe last four results between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison have been 2-2, 3-3, 0-0 and 1-1.\nFive of Liverpool's last six games in all competitions have ended 1-1.\nThe Reds have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last eight games in all competitions.\nPundit analysis:\nBolton manager Neil Lennon speaking on BBC Radio 5 live: \"Liverpool were the better team in the first half.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Arsenal 3-0 Manchester United\nArsenal stunned Manchester United with three goals in the opening 20 minutes as the Gunners moved up to second in the Premier League table.\nUnited had no answer to Arsenal's opening burst as Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil scored twice in 74 seconds.\nSanchez added a third from 18 yards as the Gunners beat United for just the second time in 14 league meetings.\nUnited improved after the break but Arsenal substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hit the crossbar late on.\nDefeat leaves Louis van Gaal's side in third place, behind Arsenal on goal difference.\nFollow the reaction from the Emirates here.\nWenger relieves the pressure\nArsenal's Champions League defeat at home to Olympiakos in midweek left them in danger of failing to reach the last 16 and manager Arsene Wenger in the face of heavy criticism.\nWenger was forced to defend his selection of goalkeeper David Ospina, describing recent criticism as \"not analysis of football\". He also called the press \"boring\".\nBut his side were anything but in an opening half which saw them tear Manchester United apart, almost at will.\nWith their first real attack Sanchez back-heeled in at the near post after good work from Aaron Ramsey and Ozil, and the Germany playmaker then added the second a minute later after Walcott ran at a struggling defence.\nSanchez shrugged Matteo Darmian aside to add his second with a brilliant 18-yard strike which brought up an unwanted record for the visitors, as they conceded three goals in the opening 20 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time.\nAnd it should have been four just after the half-hour mark as Ramsey volleyed wide from close range when completely unmarked.\nWith the game won, Arsenal failed to repeat their attacking display in the second half until substitute Oxlade-Chamberlain chipped David de Gea and hit the crossbar in injury time.\nThe Gunners are now just two points behind leaders Manchester City going into a two-week international break which had the potential to be uncomfortable for their fans and for Wenger.\nDid Van Gaal get team selection wrong?\nLouis van Gaal may have spent over \u00a3250m since taking charge at Old Trafford, but he still appears to have glaring holes in his squad.\nThe decision to play winger Ashley Young at left-back, and the continuing selection of Daley Blind at centre-back, were both exposed by Arsenal's electric start.\nBlind played most of his first season at United in a deep midfield role and a lack of pace and strength were both in evidence against Walcott and Sanchez.\nEven Chris Smalling - who has been lauded for his early season form - was too slow to close down Sanchez as he bent in the third goal after easily outwitting Darmian.\nIn front of United's ragged back four, partnering Michael Carrick and Bastian Schweinsteiger in midfield also proved an error.\nCarrick, 34, and Schweinsteiger, 31, are both masters at keeping possession but in an opening 15 minutes in which Arsenal totally dominated the ball, their lack of pace against the counter-attack was exposed all too easily.\nMorgan Schneiderlin - left on the bench - may have been a better option to break up play as Arsenal's Ramsey, Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin bossed the midfield.\nThe anonymous Memphis Depay and Darmian were hauled off at the break as Marouane Fellaini belatedly stiffened the centre and Wayne Rooney was moved out to the left wing.\nThe changes worked - as United had 72.5% of second-half possession - but they came far too late to affect the result.\nThe recalled Petr Cech - who made a good save to deny Anthony Martial just before half-time - saved well from Schweinsteiger late on, but United rarely threatened.\nWhat a weekend for City\nManchester City started the weekend a point behind leaders United, and level on goal difference.\nBut Arsenal's opening burst, coupled with City's 6-1 thrashing of Newcastle, saw the men in blue open up a two-point lead at the top of the table, eight goals better off than United.\nMan of the match: Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\nManager reaction\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger:\n\"We did not give them any chances to score and that was vital. We surprised them with our start.\n\"From Petr Cech to Theo Walcott we only had superb performances. I have managed many strong teams and never had one that played 60 games at the same level. You have to accept that we are human beings.\n\"I've been at the club for 19 years and I know what you want is a strong response in a big game when you have a big disappointment.\n\"We are in it, we are two points off the league leaders, Manchester City, so I hope that result today will give us belief to fight for it.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal:\n\"It was a very bad start, without aggression and the will to win. That is the first time I have seen that from my team. I did not expect that.\n\"We have won our last four matches - I gave the players a day off because they were tired. On Saturday the training was normal, I was very amazed to see that.\n\"When you give a team like Arsenal so much space to play football, then you know that you shall lose.\n\"But all teams will have a dip.\"\nWhat next?\nBoth sides have a fortnight off thanks to the upcoming international break. Arsenal resume their Premier League campaign at Watford on 17 October, while United face Everton at Goodison Park on the same date."

Chelsea's fourth defeat of the season leaves them 16th.\nThe Blues have taken only eight points from a possible 24 this season and are only four above the relegation zone.\nRelive the action from Stamford Bridge as it unfolded\nAll the reaction from Saturday's games\nChelsea's defensive frailties exposed again\nChelsea's struggles this season have been exacerbated by an uncharacteristically poor defence. They have now conceded 17 league goals - two more than they did in the whole of Mourinho's first season with the club in 2004-05.\nFollowing Chelsea's defeat by Porto in the Champions League on Tuesday, fans called for the return of captain John Terry, and they got their wish on Saturday as the 34-year-old was restored to the centre of defence alongside Gary Cahill.\nHowever, Terry's presence did not solve Chelsea's problems. Branislav Ivanovic and Ramires were fortunate to avoid giving away penalties with clumsy challenges, while Davis was allowed to run unchallenged to score the equaliser from Pelle's chested pass.\nAfter the break, Cahill gave the ball away to Dusan Tadic and Terry failed to cut out his pass, enabling Mane to put Saints in front.\nMane was a constant menace to the Blues defence, which backed off to allow the forward to set up Pelle for Southampton's third.\nMisfiring Falcao\nWith Diego Costa serving the last game of a three-match suspension, the visit of Southampton provided Radamel Falcao with a chance to make a case for a regular starting place.\nHe has scored only one goal since joining on loan from Monaco in July and, based on his showing against Southampton, it is unlikely he will be threatening Costa any time soon.\nAlthough Falcao had a strong claim for a penalty when he fell under a challenge by Saints goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, he did not trouble the visitors enough and managed a solitary shot in 90 minutes.\nBig decisions going against Chelsea?\nMourinho was incensed that no penalty was given for the incident involving Falcao, claiming that officials are \"afraid\" to give decisions for Chelsea.\nHe said: \"It was a big penalty for us. Not small, not doubtful. Big. Huge.\n\"That was a penalty. We don't get decisions and I think referees are afraid to give decisions to us.\n\"When we are top I understand everyone wants to push you down, but when you are down give us a break.\"\nRead more from Jose Mourinho\nCan Saints build on last season?\nSouthampton performed beyond expectations to finish seventh in the Premier League last season, but they had won only two of their first seven games this term before the trip to Chelsea.\nHowever, the manner of this victory - their first at Stamford Bridge since 2002 - will give them confidence of challenging for a top-seven finish again.\nThey rarely looked troubled by the Blues, with Mane and Pelle combining to devastating effect in attack. One or both of them played a part in all three goals.\nSouthampton are also a tough side to break down - only Everton have beaten them by more than one goal in the Premier League this season.\nMan of the match: Sadio Mane\nWhat they said\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"If we can show this against Chelsea we can show it much more.\n\"We had a difficult start to the game but we came back and we made it 1-1 with a great goal. The difference was how we came out of the dressing room, pressed Chelsea and had fantastic movement.\n\"We totally deserve three points today.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea have conceded at least two goals in seven of their eight Premier League games this season (the other game was a 2-0 win against Arsenal)\nChelsea have conceded as many goals in their last four home league games (seven) as they had in the previous 17 at Stamford Bridge\nChelsea have eight points from eight games. The average finishing position from this start is 14th\nThis is Chelsea's lowest points total after eight games in a top-flight season since 1978-79 (four points), when a win earned two points.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Aston Villa 0-1 Stoke City\nMarko Arnautovic scored the only goal to give Stoke a second successive win and leave Aston Villa cut adrift in the Premier League relegation zone.\nArnautovic, who also had an effort ruled out for offside, exploited a huge gap in the Villa defence early in the second half to finish off the post.\nVilla created little bar a credible Jordan Veretout appeal for a penalty.\nTim Sherwood's side have not won since the opening day and lie 18th, four points from safety.\nRelive Stoke's 1-0 win at Aston Villa\nRead reaction to this and Saturday's other games\nMuddled Villa?\nSherwood said after last week's defeat at Liverpool that his team were already in a relegation battle and, in an attempt to turn the tide, opted for a change of system.\nJack Grealish, who pledged his international future to England this week, was left on the bench as Sherwood employed a wing-backs system, one that left the hosts' forwards short of service.\nWhen Grealish was introduced for Joleon Lescott at half-time, Villa reverted to a back four, with centre-halves Micah Richards and Jose Angel Crespo separated to provide space for Arnautovic's goal.\nVilla may be right to feel aggrieved that they were denied a penalty when Cameron clumsily challenged Veretout in the first half, but, in truth, they were toothless for large periods, managing only two shots on target.\nThey are without a win at home all season and have taken only 71 points from their last 74 games at Villa Park, a run that dates back to December 2011.\nStoke improvement continues\nSome eye-catching summer recruitment saw Stoke bring in the likes of Xherdan Shaqiri, Ibrahim Affelay and Glen Johnson to the Britannia Stadium, but an early run of six games without a win did not match the pre-season optimism.\nHowever, on the back of victory over Bournemouth last week, Stoke claimed their third successive win at Villa Park and extended an unbeaten run at Villa that goes back to 2009.\nWithout the injured Shaqiri, the trio of Arnautovic, Bojan and Jon Walters inter-changed behind Mame Biram Diouf to create regular problems for the Villa defence, while at the other end a solid rearguard resulted in the Potters' first clean sheet of the season.\nArnautovic was perhaps unfortunate to have a first-half effort ruled out - he looked to be level with the last defender before volleying past Brad Guzan - but there was no doubt about his second-half strike, played into space by Johnson before finishing from the corner of the six-yard box.\nThe only sour note for City was a late injury to Diouf, who left field on a stretcher.\nAdam almost does it again\nStoke midfielder Charlie Adam found the net with a wonder goal against Chelsea in April, collecting the ball inside his own half and lobbing Thibaut Courtois from 65 yards.\nThe Scot almost embarrassed Guzan in similar fashion, unleashing a left-footed effort from deep inside his own half, not even as far advanced as the centre circle.\nGuzan just managed to scramble back, leaping to tip the ball around the post.\n\"It was on and I felt it might have been close. I thought it was in and he did well to get back,\" said the Scot.\nAdam has now provided the goalkeepers of the Premier League with plenty of warning about wandering off their line.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic\nWhat they said\nAston Villa manager Tim Sherwood: \"I am very disappointed, we needed to win the game at home to a team that we could have leapfrogged.\n\"We failed to capitalise and it was not good enough. I think a draw would have been a fair result, both teams were average.\n\"The situation is getting worse, it is alright saying ifs, buts and maybes, but we are not picking up the wins and that is why we are down near the bottom of the league.\n\"We are all in this together but as the manager I take all the responsibility.\n\"I will use the international break to get my players fitter because they are not fit enough yet to play the way I want them to play. For some of them it will be like a mini pre-season.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"I was pleased with what we produced, it was a performance that we have been looking for. The first half was some of the best stuff we have played in terms of controlling the game.\n\"In the second half, we knew they would come at us, but we defended really well.\n\"I thought Marko was excellent today, offensively and defensively. He puts a shift in. It wasn't an easy chance, but thankfully he took it.\n\"It would have been hard to take had we not taken maximum points today and now we have a lot of time to prepare for the next game at Swansea.\"\nThe stats\nAston Villa have registered only one victory in their eight Premier League meetings with Stoke at Villa Park, losing the last three.\nAston Villa's last four Premier League games have all ended in defeats by a one-goal margin; equalling the joint-longest such run in PL history (four in a row).\nVilla have picked up just one point in their last seven Premier League games, drawing one and losing six.\nTim Sherwood has now lost as many Premier League games (19) as he has won (19).\nStoke have won their last two Premier League games - this after winning just two of their previous 11 in the competition.\nFive of Marko Arnautovic's seven Premier League goals have come away from home.\nWhat's next?\nIt does not get easier for Villa. After the two-week international break, they face a daunting trip to Chelsea on Saturday, 17 October (15:00), while Stoke go to Swansea on the following Monday evening."

He was having treatment at half-time and it was a risk for him to finish the whole game.\"\nBefore Saturday, Aguero had scored one goal in 482 Premier League minutes this season, with a shot conversion of 6.25%\nAgainst Newcastle he managed five in 66 minutes, with a shot conversion rate of 71%.\nAguero touched the ball nine times between the 42nd and 62nd minutes and scored with five of them for the fastest five-goal haul in Premier League history.\nNewcastle's season goes from bad to worse\nNewcastle have now won only one of their past 19 league games, and their failure to find a victory in any of their first eight matches of this campaign makes this their worst start to a season since 1898-99.\nThe Magpies could take plenty of encouragement from their 2-2 draw with defending champions Chelsea last week, but it was difficult to see any positives in their complete collapse at Etihad Stadium.\nBoss Steve McClaren tried his best, pointing out that his side could have been 3-0 up before City and Aguero responded, but admitted they had no answer to the Argentina striker after the break.\n\"You are coming up against a top-quality team,\" McClaren told BBC Sport. \"Aguero was world class. He is getting back to form and we were punished by a really high-quality opponent.\n\"It was such a magnificent performance in the first half. it was same against Chelsea last week but in 13 minutes we got beaten by world-class individuals. We probably frightened them into life and they killed us for it.\n\"We have had a tough eight games but I have seen enough in the last two weeks that we can win football matches.\n\"We were unlucky last week and this week. There is enough in there, we just need consistency. Our season begins now.\"\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, City have another home game, against Bournemouth, while Newcastle's search for a win will continue when they face Norwich at St James' Park on 18 October.\nThe stats you need to know\nAguero's first goal was his 80th in 128 matches in the Premier League. Only Alan Shearer (102) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (122 games) have reached that mark in fewer games.\nAguero now has 84 Premier League goals; the same number as Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez.\nManchester City are unbeaten in their past 18 Premier League meetings with Newcastle (W16 D2), their longest-ever run without defeat against a single PL opponent.\nCity have netted two or more goals in each of their past 15 PL clashes with the Magpies (45 scored in total).\nSteve McClaren has won just two of his past 21 league games as a manager (W2 D9 L10 - eight games at Newcastle, 13 at Derby County).",

He also called the press \"boring\".\nBut his side were anything but in an opening half which saw them tear Manchester United apart, almost at will.\nWith their first real attack Sanchez back-heeled in at the near post after good work from Aaron Ramsey and Ozil, and the Germany playmaker then added the second a minute later after Walcott ran at a struggling defence.\nSanchez shrugged Matteo Darmian aside to add his second with a brilliant 18-yard strike which brought up an unwanted record for the visitors, as they conceded three goals in the opening 20 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time.\nAnd it should have been four just after the half-hour mark as Ramsey volleyed wide from close range when completely unmarked.\nWith the game won, Arsenal failed to repeat their attacking display in the second half until substitute Oxlade-Chamberlain chipped David de Gea and hit the crossbar in injury time.\nThe Gunners are now just two points behind leaders Manchester City going into a two-week international break which had the potential to be uncomfortable for their fans and for Wenger.\nDid Van Gaal get team selection wrong?\nLouis van Gaal may have spent over \u00a3250m since taking charge at Old Trafford, but he still appears to have glaring holes in his squad.\nThe decision to play winger Ashley Young at left-back, and the continuing selection of Daley Blind at centre-back, were both exposed by Arsenal's electric start.\nBlind played most of his first season at United in a deep midfield role and a lack of pace and strength were both in evidence against Walcott and Sanchez.\nEven Chris Smalling - who has been lauded for his early season form - was too slow to close down Sanchez as he bent in the third goal after easily outwitting Darmian.\nIn front of United's ragged back four, partnering Michael Carrick and Bastian Schweinsteiger in midfield also proved an error.\nCarrick, 34, and Schweinsteiger, 31, are both masters at keeping possession but in an opening 15 minutes in which Arsenal totally dominated the ball, their lack of pace against the counter-attack was exposed all too easily.\nMorgan Schneiderlin - left on the bench - may have been a better option to break up play as Arsenal's Ramsey, Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin bossed the midfield.\nThe anonymous Memphis Depay and Darmian were hauled off at the break as Marouane Fellaini belatedly stiffened the centre and Wayne Rooney was moved out to the left wing.\nThe changes worked - as United had 72.5% of second-half possession - but they came far too late to affect the result.\nThe recalled Petr Cech - who made a good save to deny Anthony Martial just before half-time - saved well from Schweinsteiger late on, but United rarely threatened.\nWhat a weekend for City\nManchester City started the weekend a point behind leaders United, and level on goal difference.\nBut Arsenal's opening burst, coupled with City's 6-1 thrashing of Newcastle, saw the men in blue open up a two-point lead at the top of the table, eight goals better off than United.\nMan of the match: Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\nManager reaction\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger:\n\"We did not give them any chances to score and that was vital. We surprised them with our start.\n\"From Petr Cech to Theo Walcott we only had superb performances. I have managed many strong teams and never had one that played 60 games at the same level. You have to accept that we are human beings.\n\"I've been at the club for 19 years and I know what you want is a strong response in a big game when you have a big disappointment.\n\"We are in it, we are two points off the league leaders, Manchester City, so I hope that result today will give us belief to fight for it.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal:\n\"It was a very bad start, without aggression and the will to win. That is the first time I have seen that from my team. I did not expect that.\n\"We have won our last four matches - I gave the players a day off because they were tired. On Saturday the training was normal, I was very amazed to see that.\n\"When you give a team like Arsenal so much space to play football, then you know that you shall lose.\n\"But all teams will have a dip.\"\nWhat next?\nBoth sides have a fortnight off thanks to the upcoming international break. Arsenal resume their Premier League campaign at Watford on 17 October, while United face Everton at Goodison Park on the same date."

He was having treatment at half-time and it was a risk for him to finish the whole game.\"\nBefore Saturday, Aguero had scored one goal in 482 Premier League minutes this season, with a shot conversion of 6.25%\nAgainst Newcastle he managed five in 66 minutes, with a shot conversion rate of 71%.\nAguero touched the ball nine times between the 42nd and 62nd minutes and scored with five of them for the fastest five-goal haul in Premier League history.\nNewcastle's season goes from bad to worse\nNewcastle have now won only one of their past 19 league games, and their failure to find a victory in any of their first eight matches of this campaign makes this their worst start to a season since 1898-99.\nThe Magpies could take plenty of encouragement from their 2-2 draw with defending champions Chelsea last week, but it was difficult to see any positives in their complete collapse at Etihad Stadium.\nBoss Steve McClaren tried his best, pointing out that his side could have been 3-0 up before City and Aguero responded, but admitted they had no answer to the Argentina striker after the break.\n\"You are coming up against a top-quality team,\" McClaren told BBC Sport. \"Aguero was world class. He is getting back to form and we were punished by a really high-quality opponent.\n\"It was such a magnificent performance in the first half. it was same against Chelsea last week but in 13 minutes we got beaten by world-class individuals. We probably frightened them into life and they killed us for it.\n\"We have had a tough eight games but I have seen enough in the last two weeks that we can win football matches.\n\"We were unlucky last week and this week. There is enough in there, we just need consistency. Our season begins now.\"\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, City have another home game, against Bournemouth, while Newcastle's search for a win will continue when they face Norwich at St James' Park on 18 October.\nThe stats you need to know\nAguero's first goal was his 80th in 128 matches in the Premier League. Only Alan Shearer (102) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (122 games) have reached that mark in fewer games.\nAguero now has 84 Premier League goals; the same number as Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez.\nManchester City are unbeaten in their past 18 Premier League meetings with Newcastle (W16 D2), their longest-ever run without defeat against a single PL opponent.\nCity have netted two or more goals in each of their past 15 PL clashes with the Magpies (45 scored in total).\nSteve McClaren has won just two of his past 21 league games as a manager (W2 D9 L10 - eight games at Newcastle, 13 at Derby County).",

The Algerian playmaker's mantle was assumed by Shinji Okazaki, who was a pest to the Norwich defence in tandem with Jamie Vardy.\nThe Japanese forward - signed from German Bundesliga club Mainz in the summer - could not polish his fine performance with a goal, heading over a cross inside the opening seven minutes and skidding a low shot narrowly wide.\nBut he was integral to a wonderful counter-attacking display from Leicester, who created a flurry of chances on the break. Vardy, Danny Drinkwater and Jeffrey Schlupp (twice) all spurned opportunities.\nBlunt force\nIt was a frustrating afternoon for Norwich, who enjoyed plenty of the ball and spent large swathes of the second half arrowing, looping and scuffing deliveries into the Leicester penalty area. For all that, though, they created precious few clear chances.\nThe introduction of striker Mbokani on the hour did, however, offer a reference point for those attacks and eased the burden on the hitherto isolated Cameron Jerome.\nAnd the DR Congo striker's first goal for the club hauled the hosts back into the contest with 20 minutes remaining. Less than a minute after forcing a header against the crossbar, the 29-year-old - signed from Dinamo Kiev in August - was left unattended eight yards from goal to flick a deep cross past Kasper Schmeichel.\nA series of increasingly frantic attacks followed, with Sebastien Bassong just failing to connect with a Robbie Brady cross, Redmond hitting the outside of an upright and Christian Fuchs deflecting another Redmond effort wide, having earlier headed unwittingly over his own crossbar.\nHistory repeats itself\nAt a Carrow Road stadium bathed in Indian summer sun, the home side fell to their second home defeat of the campaign - in front of a record attendance of 27,067 for an all-seater match.\nNorwich have now picked up maximum points in just one of their last six games, but have an opportunity to turn their form around when they face bottom side Newcastle at St James' Park in their next league game.\nLeicester bounced back from last weekend's heavy defeat against Arsenal and have now lost just once in their last 10 Premier League games dating back to last season. The face Southampton, away, after the international break.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy\nWhat they said\nLeicester winger Jeffrey Schlupp: \"Everyone has seen that we don't lack the fight and team spirit. We can dig deep when we need to.\n\"We can adapt to any situation. Jamie Vardy up front terrorises the defenders. He is a pest and always in the defenders' faces.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We responded very well after our defeat against Arsenal. We showed good character and it was a good performance.\n\"We have 15 points, 25 less than we need to. After we get that, we will see what happens.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"Today, for us in the way we played, it did not work. Our use of the ball was not good enough.\n\"The lads will be disappointed and did not do themselves justice in the first half. In the second, they tried but it is difficult being two goals down.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester have won more penalties (4) than any other Premier League team this season\nLeicester City have won 11 Premier League games since the start of April - only Manchester City (12) have more\nOnly two of Norwich's 17 shots in this game were on target"

We talked all week about getting back to our level, and you could see the passion and the desire we had to win the game was massive.\n\"We have performed fantastically in many games already this season, but we've had a couple where we were well below our standards.\n\"According to some people, a three-game run is a blip, but I know my players have quality.\n\"It's just a question of getting that out of them on a consistent basis. We saw it here and hopefully now we can go from strength to strength.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"He [Eriksen] is a very important player for us and if you give him chances to shoot he can have an impact on the game.\n\"He is one of the best at dead-ball situations, it is hard to say he is the best but he is one of the best.\n\"We have maybe dropped two points. We are disappointed with the result but not the performance or effort.\n\"We did not win the game because of an own goal but Harry does not need to worry about it. He does a lot for the team.\"",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Aston Villa 0-1 Stoke City\nMarko Arnautovic scored the only goal to give Stoke a second successive win and leave Aston Villa cut adrift in the Premier League relegation zone.\nArnautovic, who also had an effort ruled out for offside, exploited a huge gap in the Villa defence early in the second half to finish off the post.\nVilla created little bar a credible Jordan Veretout appeal for a penalty.\nTim Sherwood's side have not won since the opening day and lie 18th, four points from safety.\nRelive Stoke's 1-0 win at Aston Villa\nRead reaction to this and Saturday's other games\nMuddled Villa?\nSherwood said after last week's defeat at Liverpool that his team were already in a relegation battle and, in an attempt to turn the tide, opted for a change of system.\nJack Grealish, who pledged his international future to England this week, was left on the bench as Sherwood employed a wing-backs system, one that left the hosts' forwards short of service.\nWhen Grealish was introduced for Joleon Lescott at half-time, Villa reverted to a back four, with centre-halves Micah Richards and Jose Angel Crespo separated to provide space for Arnautovic's goal.\nVilla may be right to feel aggrieved that they were denied a penalty when Cameron clumsily challenged Veretout in the first half, but, in truth, they were toothless for large periods, managing only two shots on target.\nThey are without a win at home all season and have taken only 71 points from their last 74 games at Villa Park, a run that dates back to December 2011.\nStoke improvement continues\nSome eye-catching summer recruitment saw Stoke bring in the likes of Xherdan Shaqiri, Ibrahim Affelay and Glen Johnson to the Britannia Stadium, but an early run of six games without a win did not match the pre-season optimism.\nHowever, on the back of victory over Bournemouth last week, Stoke claimed their third successive win at Villa Park and extended an unbeaten run at Villa that goes back to 2009.\nWithout the injured Shaqiri, the trio of Arnautovic, Bojan and Jon Walters inter-changed behind Mame Biram Diouf to create regular problems for the Villa defence, while at the other end a solid rearguard resulted in the Potters' first clean sheet of the season.\nArnautovic was perhaps unfortunate to have a first-half effort ruled out - he looked to be level with the last defender before volleying past Brad Guzan - but there was no doubt about his second-half strike, played into space by Johnson before finishing from the corner of the six-yard box.\nThe only sour note for City was a late injury to Diouf, who left field on a stretcher.\nAdam almost does it again\nStoke midfielder Charlie Adam found the net with a wonder goal against Chelsea in April, collecting the ball inside his own half and lobbing Thibaut Courtois from 65 yards.\nThe Scot almost embarrassed Guzan in similar fashion, unleashing a left-footed effort from deep inside his own half, not even as far advanced as the centre circle.\nGuzan just managed to scramble back, leaping to tip the ball around the post.\n\"It was on and I felt it might have been close. I thought it was in and he did well to get back,\" said the Scot.\nAdam has now provided the goalkeepers of the Premier League with plenty of warning about wandering off their line.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic\nWhat they said\nAston Villa manager Tim Sherwood: \"I am very disappointed, we needed to win the game at home to a team that we could have leapfrogged.\n\"We failed to capitalise and it was not good enough. I think a draw would have been a fair result, both teams were average.\n\"The situation is getting worse, it is alright saying ifs, buts and maybes, but we are not picking up the wins and that is why we are down near the bottom of the league.\n\"We are all in this together but as the manager I take all the responsibility.\n\"I will use the international break to get my players fitter because they are not fit enough yet to play the way I want them to play. For some of them it will be like a mini pre-season.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"I was pleased with what we produced, it was a performance that we have been looking for. The first half was some of the best stuff we have played in terms of controlling the game.\n\"In the second half, we knew they would come at us, but we defended really well.\n\"I thought Marko was excellent today, offensively and defensively. He puts a shift in. It wasn't an easy chance, but thankfully he took it.\n\"It would have been hard to take had we not taken maximum points today and now we have a lot of time to prepare for the next game at Swansea.\"\nThe stats\nAston Villa have registered only one victory in their eight Premier League meetings with Stoke at Villa Park, losing the last three.\nAston Villa's last four Premier League games have all ended in defeats by a one-goal margin; equalling the joint-longest such run in PL history (four in a row).\nVilla have picked up just one point in their last seven Premier League games, drawing one and losing six.\nTim Sherwood has now lost as many Premier League games (19) as he has won (19).\nStoke have won their last two Premier League games - this after winning just two of their previous 11 in the competition.\nFive of Marko Arnautovic's seven Premier League goals have come away from home.\nWhat's next?\nIt does not get easier for Villa. After the two-week international break, they face a daunting trip to Chelsea on Saturday, 17 October (15:00), while Stoke go to Swansea on the following Monday evening."

Defensively we did well in the first half and we scored from set pieces.\n\"But I expected a difficult second half because we know one of Leicester's strengths is unbelievable spirit and we have to be more clever.\n\"They deserved at least one point. They did two good changes after half-time. Mahrez created difficulties for us.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri on BBC Sport: \"We have fantastic spirit. We believe everything could be possible.\n\"We created a lot of chances. It is important to have good players on the bench and I have very good players who can change the match.\n\"Jamie Vardy is very important for us. I believe in this team. When we are desperate we make more, more and more.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSaints have only lost one of their last 19 top-flight home games against Leicester (W10, D8). That came in April 2000.\nFifth-placed Leicester are unbeaten in their last eight away games. They have only once enjoyed a longer run in the top division, going nine matches without defeat in 1973.\nJamie Vardy has scored in six successive league matches for the first time in his career.\nThey have earned a league-high seven points from losing positions this season.\nVardy has scored 10 goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances.\nLeicester had 18 second half shots compared to Southampton's four.\nWhat next?\nIt doesn't get any easier for Southampton as they face a trip to Liverpool for Jurgen Klopp's first home match in charge of the Reds.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 2-0 Aston Villa\nThe returning Diego Costa played a key role as Chelsea earned a much-needed win over struggling Aston Villa.\nThe striker tapped in Willian's pass midway through the first half after defender Joleon Lescott's mis-control gifted the ball to the home side.\nIt was a welcome break for the Blues, who doubled their lead when Villa's Alan Hutton deflected in Costa's shot.\nChelsea, 16th in the table at the start of the day, were not at their best - but Villa offered little.\nWhat contributions Tim Sherwood's side did make to the game were all in Chelsea's favour as they repeatedly gave the ball away and were punished accordingly.\nThey remain in 18th place and without a win in their past eight matches.\nChelsea's second home win of the season moves them up to 11th in the table, five points behind fourth place.\nFive keys to success\nIn May, BBC Sport suggested five areas key to Chelsea's title win last season: Costa's goals, the creativity of their midfield, their defensive steel, winning mentality and the influence of manager Jose Mourinho.\nThe Blues' poor start to this season - which prior to this match was their worst since 1978 - is as much down to a failure of this crucial quintet.\nCosta had not scored enough, Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard created little and they had conceded two or more goals in seven of their eight games.\nTheir edge was gone and, from the outside at least, their boss seemed more focused on criticising his recent Football Association fine than defending the title.\nWhile Saturday was far from a return to the ruthless form of last season, it did showcase a notable improvement on previous home games.\nCosta scored on his return from a three-match ban for violent conduct, the midfield - which included 19-year-old Ruben Loftus-Cheek until his removal at the break - offered more, they kept their first clean sheet in five games and saw the game out professionally.\nChelsea's desire was epitomised in one incident, 20 minutes from time when a group of Blues defenders flung themselves at the feet of Lescott to prevent him poking the ball in from close range to give Villa a foothold back in the game.\nVillans in need of some heroes\nSherwood only took over at Villa in February, after which he saved them from relegation and led them to the FA Cup final - achievements that should earn him time in his job.\nThey started reasonably well at Stamford Bridge, keeping Chelsea at bay with a packed midfield and occasionally breaking with purpose, albeit with no end product.\nJack Grealish was lively for 20 minutes on his return to the side and Rudy Gestede proved a physical challenge for Blues captain John Terry on the few occasions the ball came near him.\nBut Sherwood - and his bosses - should be concerned by the mistakes that regularly gifted Chelsea possession and ultimately the win, as well as the way the players meekly accepted a fifth straight defeat once Costa's low shot had found the net off Hutton's boot.\n'Chelsea are together and ready to fight'\n\"We are not the best team in the country, but we are a team with a very good manager and very good players trying to reach a normal level,\" said Chelsea boss Mourinho.\n\"This was a performance to compensate for a lack of confidence and self-esteem. When confidence is not high you lose quality. Tactically we were very disciplined today, especially defensively.\n\"This was a great team performance with some fantastic individual performances. My players showed their desire, that they are together and that they were ready to fight for a crucial result.\"\n'We won't shrink into corners and cry'\nAston Villa boss Sherwood said: \"We played on the front foot here at the Bridge, we matched them initially. We believe we'll stay in this division, though it's clear for everyone to see that we're a side in transition.\n\"I will stand at the front and take the brunt of it. I don't want my players shrinking and running into the corners and crying - that's what's expected of me, and I won't do that.\n\"I didn't hear my supporters shouting for me to leave. I'll keep swinging, even if I'm backed into a corner.\"\nMan of the match: Chelsea's Diego Costa\nThe stats you need to know\nJose Mourinho has still never lost successive home league games as a manager.\nBefore this game, the two outfield players on the longest current run of starts in the Premier League were Branislav Ivanovic (63 starts) and Eden Hazard (47 starts). They were both left out of the starting XI in this match.\nWillian has had a hand in a goal in each of his past three Premier League appearances (two goals, one assist) - this after not scoring or assisting in his previous 13 Premier League games for Chelsea.\nThree of the nine own goals in the Premier League this season have been in favour of Chelsea.\nVilla have not kept a Premier League clean sheet at Stamford Bridge since March 1998, conceding 32 times in their last nine trips to the West London ground.\nChelsea have scored in their past 24 home league matches; also the longest current run of its kind in the Premier League.\nWhat next?\nChelsea return to action when they travel to face group leaders Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League on Tuesday. Villa host Swansea in the Premier League next Saturday."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Chelsea 2-0 Aston Villa\nThe returning Diego Costa played a key role as Chelsea earned a much-needed win over struggling Aston Villa.\nThe striker tapped in Willian's pass midway through the first half after defender Joleon Lescott's mis-control gifted the ball to the home side.\nIt was a welcome break for the Blues, who doubled their lead when Villa's Alan Hutton deflected in Costa's shot.\nChelsea, 16th in the table at the start of the day, were not at their best - but Villa offered little.\nWhat contributions Tim Sherwood's side did make to the game were all in Chelsea's favour as they repeatedly gave the ball away and were punished accordingly.\nThey remain in 18th place and without a win in their past eight matches.\nChelsea's second home win of the season moves them up to 11th in the table, five points behind fourth place.\nFive keys to success\nIn May, BBC Sport suggested five areas key to Chelsea's title win last season: Costa's goals, the creativity of their midfield, their defensive steel, winning mentality and the influence of manager Jose Mourinho.\nThe Blues' poor start to this season - which prior to this match was their worst since 1978 - is as much down to a failure of this crucial quintet.\nCosta had not scored enough, Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard created little and they had conceded two or more goals in seven of their eight games.\nTheir edge was gone and, from the outside at least, their boss seemed more focused on criticising his recent Football Association fine than defending the title.\nWhile Saturday was far from a return to the ruthless form of last season, it did showcase a notable improvement on previous home games.\nCosta scored on his return from a three-match ban for violent conduct, the midfield - which included 19-year-old Ruben Loftus-Cheek until his removal at the break - offered more, they kept their first clean sheet in five games and saw the game out professionally.\nChelsea's desire was epitomised in one incident, 20 minutes from time when a group of Blues defenders flung themselves at the feet of Lescott to prevent him poking the ball in from close range to give Villa a foothold back in the game.\nVillans in need of some heroes\nSherwood only took over at Villa in February, after which he saved them from relegation and led them to the FA Cup final - achievements that should earn him time in his job.\nThey started reasonably well at Stamford Bridge, keeping Chelsea at bay with a packed midfield and occasionally breaking with purpose, albeit with no end product.\nJack Grealish was lively for 20 minutes on his return to the side and Rudy Gestede proved a physical challenge for Blues captain John Terry on the few occasions the ball came near him.\nBut Sherwood - and his bosses - should be concerned by the mistakes that regularly gifted Chelsea possession and ultimately the win, as well as the way the players meekly accepted a fifth straight defeat once Costa's low shot had found the net off Hutton's boot.\n'Chelsea are together and ready to fight'\n\"We are not the best team in the country, but we are a team with a very good manager and very good players trying to reach a normal level,\" said Chelsea boss Mourinho.\n\"This was a performance to compensate for a lack of confidence and self-esteem. When confidence is not high you lose quality. Tactically we were very disciplined today, especially defensively.\n\"This was a great team performance with some fantastic individual performances. My players showed their desire, that they are together and that they were ready to fight for a crucial result.\"\n'We won't shrink into corners and cry'\nAston Villa boss Sherwood said: \"We played on the front foot here at the Bridge, we matched them initially. We believe we'll stay in this division, though it's clear for everyone to see that we're a side in transition.\n\"I will stand at the front and take the brunt of it. I don't want my players shrinking and running into the corners and crying - that's what's expected of me, and I won't do that.\n\"I didn't hear my supporters shouting for me to leave. I'll keep swinging, even if I'm backed into a corner.\"\nMan of the match: Chelsea's Diego Costa\nThe stats you need to know\nJose Mourinho has still never lost successive home league games as a manager.\nBefore this game, the two outfield players on the longest current run of starts in the Premier League were Branislav Ivanovic (63 starts) and Eden Hazard (47 starts). They were both left out of the starting XI in this match.\nWillian has had a hand in a goal in each of his past three Premier League appearances (two goals, one assist) - this after not scoring or assisting in his previous 13 Premier League games for Chelsea.\nThree of the nine own goals in the Premier League this season have been in favour of Chelsea.\nVilla have not kept a Premier League clean sheet at Stamford Bridge since March 1998, conceding 32 times in their last nine trips to the West London ground.\nChelsea have scored in their past 24 home league matches; also the longest current run of its kind in the Premier League.\nWhat next?\nChelsea return to action when they travel to face group leaders Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League on Tuesday.

The Magpies have now conceded 19 goals in nine games, second only to Norwich (20) and the same as bottom side Sunderland.\nWhat went right for Newcastle?\nMcClaren can take positives from the excellent link-up play shown by Moussa Sissoko and Wijnaldum, who combined for two of their goals. Sissoko, in particular, was a threat to Norwich all game and claimed three assists.\nNetherlands international Wijnaldum was brought in during the summer for \u00a314.5m from PSV Eindhoven, becoming the club's third most expensive signing after Michael Owen and Alan Shearer.\nAlthough he hasn't produced his best so far this season, Wijnaldum showed his class in this match with a rare quadruple, becoming only the second player - after Shearer - to score that many in a single Premier League game for the club.\nThey included a cool first goal and two well-directed headers, but his fourth was the pick of the lot. He collected the ball around 40 yards out before gliding forward and arrowing an effort past John Ruddy, albeit via a deflection.\nWith Wijnaldum in this form, \u00a313m summer signing Mitrovic also among the goals and Sissoko to the fore, Newcastle have realistic hopes of climbing away from danger, although they will need to tighten up at the back.\nSmiles all around on Tyneside\nBBC Sport's Chris Bevan at St James' Park: \"It has been many months since the stadium was last in full voice but the atmosphere here was at its deafening best at the end of this afternoon.\n\"By the 70th minute, with the Magpies 5-2 up and chants of 'we love Newcastle, we do' echoing around the ground, you could be forgiven for thinking the good times were back, rather than watching a team that was bottom of the table, about to record their first league win of the season and were hammered 6-1 last time out.\n\"The mood had been a lot tenser than that until Newcastle's fourth and fifth goals went in but, bearing in mind their poor home form leading up to this game, their fans had remained patient and also pretty positive.\n\"They stayed behind their players and manager Steve McClaren throughout, and the final whistle was greeted by a huge roar. For the first time this season, they will have left the ground wearing broad smiles on their faces.\"\nNorwich leave door wide open\nNorwich manager Alex Neil has big problems after seeing his side fail to win in their last four league games, dropping them to 16th in the table.\nHaving conceded six goals against Newcastle, they now have the worst defensive record in the division and have not kept a clean sheet in any of their nine league games.\nThe ease with which Newcastle scored some of their goals will be the biggest worry, with the men in black and white afforded time and space to pick their spot.\nMan of the match - Georginio Wijnaldum\n'A win was coming'\nNewcastle head coach Steve McClaren: \"I am relieved for the supporters and players who have endured a lot.\n\"We knew a win was around the corner, but we didn't know when it would come. We played some really good football. We kept the faith with the players - everyone around us is saying what they've been saying, but we've got to keep tight.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"There was one decision made in the game, when I took Alex Tettey off, that didn't have the effect it should have had.\n\"It made us more vulnerable at the back. When you concede that many goals it's hard to take positives, but offensively we looked a threat.\"\nNewcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic: \"I enjoyed the goal a lot. We played the perfect game. After a few bad games we showed how to play football. Wijnaldum showed a bit of magic today.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle scored six goals in a Premier League game for the first time since August 2010 against Aston Villa\nMoussa Sissoko became only the second Newcastle player to register three assists in a Premier League match, after Andy Cole against West Ham in March 1994.\nThis was the highest scoring Premier League match so far this season.\nWhat next?\nDerby day for Newcastle next Sunday (kick-off 12:00 BST) as they face Sunderland, while Norwich are at home to West Brom on Saturday.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Sunderland\nSaido Berahino scored the only goal for West Bromwich Albion as Sam Allardyce's first game in charge of struggling Sunderland ended in defeat.\nBlack Cats goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon was unable to collect Chris Brunt's cross under pressure from Berahino, who poked in the winner from close range.\nThe visitors had the best chance of a goalless first half, with Boaz Myhill tipping over a Billy Jones header.\nSunderland remain without a Premier League win this season.\nThe visitors, who stay second from bottom of the table, were unable to seriously test Myhill again in a game low on quality.\nRelive West Brom's 1-0 win over Sunderland\nRead reaction to this and Saturday's other games\nA bright start fades for Big Sam\nAllardyce, appointed Sunderland boss during the international break following Dick Advocaat's resignation, had won his first Premier League match in charge of each of his previous four clubs - Bolton, Blackburn, Newcastle and West Ham.\nHis side started well at The Hawthorns and could have gone ahead with any one of three chances that came their way during a 60-second spell early in the first half.\nLee Cattermole and Steven Fletcher had shots blocked by Baggies defenders, and from the resulting corner Myhill made a superb reflex save to deny Jones a goal against his former club.\nJones and fellow full-back DeAndre Yedlin got forward well in support of Sebastian Larsson, Fabio Borini and striker Fletcher, while Sunderland's centre-back pairing of John O'Shea and Younes Kaboul were rarely breached.\nHowever, Sunderland were denied their first clean sheet of the season by a goalkeeping error - Pantilimon's second in consecutive games following the mistake that gifted West Ham a draw in their previous outing.\nPantilimon was adamant he had been fouled by Berahino as they challenged for Brunt's cross, and there were also also claims of handball against the West Brom striker, but referee Martin Atkinson allowed the goal - the 19th that Sunderland have conceded in nine Premier League games this season.\nBerahino makes the difference\nIn a week that Liverpool's Danny Ings was ruled out for the remainder of the campaign with a serious knee injury, uncapped Berahino could yet force his way into England's plans for Euro 2016 with a repeat of the form that saw him score 20 goals in all competitions for West Brom last season.\nHe was almost anonymous in the first half, touching the ball just nine times before the interval. But the 22-year-old was much more prominent after netting his third goal of the season and for the second home match in succession.\nHe was involved in the move that led to a good chance for strike partner Salomon Rondon, who poked a left-wing cross wide from eight yards.\nBerahino's goal earned Albion's first home win of the season and lifted Tony Pulis's side seven points above the relegation zone, having started the day 17th in the table.\nFlare-up at full-time\nThere were ugly scenes on the field at the end of the match after some Sunderland players took exception to Albion's former Black Cats winger James McClean celebrating victory in front of the travelling supporters.\nDanny Graham and Cattermole were among those to confront Republic of Ireland international McClean, who was escorted off the pitch by team-mate Craig Gardner.\nPulis said: \"I'd heard a roar or whatever and didn't know whether the players were involved in something. If he's out of order I'll speak to him.\n\"He played really well today, James. He's settled in really well, he's a smashing lad and the lads have really taken to him.\n\"He's not the sharpest tool in the box, and that's not being disrespectful to him. But he's a smashing lad.\"\nMan of the match: Stephane Sessegnon\nWhat the managers said\nWest Bromwich Albion head coach Tony Pulis: \"The win was more important than anything else today - the win and the clean sheet.\n\"The first half wasn't brilliant but in the second half we were much better. We have had some tough games at home. We lost against Everton when we were 2-0 up, which was a kick in the stomach, so we needed that today.\n\"It was probably a bonus for us that Sam has not had a lot of time with his players because of the international break. He will give it his best shot, as he always does.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"We have had a point taken away from us today which wasn't our fault. In our position that's a hugely precious point, even at this stage of the season.\n\"It's a big mistake by the referee. It was a clear foul in two areas: one, he [Berahino] has jumped backwards into our goalkeeper when he is not even looking at the ball. And two, he handled the ball in front of him to score.\n\"We know we have to build from a solid base. What looked like a 0-0 would have been a good basis for us because the goals will come.\"\nThe stats\nWest Brom are the only Premier League side yet to score in the opening 30 minutes of a game this season.\nSunderland have failed to score in five of their last seven trips to The Hawthorns.\nThirteen of Saido Berahino's 17 goals since the start of last season have come at The Hawthorns (76%).\nSince August 2014, Berahino has scored 23 goals in all competitions, 16 more than any other WBA player.\nThis is only the third time in Sunderland's top-flight history that they have gone nine games without a win at the start of the season (also 1969-70 and 1976-77).\nWhat's next?\nWest Bromwich Albion go to Norwich City, another side in the bottom half of the Premier League table, on Saturday, 24 October (15:00 BST).\nThe following day (12:00 GMT), Sunderland host Newcastle. Two local rivals, the bottom two clubs in the Premier League, Allardyce's first home game in charge - few Wear-Tyne derbies have been more important than that one."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Watford 0-3 Arsenal\nArsenal produced a superb second-half display to defeat Watford and move into second place in the Premier League.\nAlexis Sanchez opened the scoring after the break when he pounced on the loose ball after Mesut Ozil appeared to be fouled and fired in.\nOlivier Giroud slammed in the second, before Aaron Ramsey slotted in his first for the club this season.\nWatford's best chance came in the first half when Odion Ighalo screwed his shot wide from 12 yards.\nRelive the action between Watford and Arsenal as it unfolded\nCould an on-song Ramsey mean this is Arsenal's season?\nIt remains a big 'if', but if Ramsey can rediscover the form he showed in the first half of the 2013-14 season then Arsenal could land their first league title since 2004.\nThe Wales international was on a remarkable run two seasons ago, scoring 13 goals in 27 appearances to lead Arsenal's charge at the top of the table. However, in December he suffered a thigh injury which kept him out of action until April - and with it went Arsenal's title chances.\nThis season the Gunners' goals have largely come from Sanchez, Giroud and Theo Walcott. Ramsey had a chance to join the list in the first half but missed with what was his 26th effort on goal - more than any other Premier League player who has not scored yet this season.\nBut having notched for Wales last week, he finally grabbed his first for his club when he converted Hector Bellerin's through-ball, albeit via a slight deflection off Ikechi Anya.\nGunners' big guns firing\nRamsey became the latest member of Arsenal's strong attacking unit to find the net today.\nWalcott, with four goals this season, failed to make an impact at Vicarage Road, but manager Arsene Wenger had Giroud in reserve. And although Sanchez and Ozil were relatively anonymous in the first half, they displayed their class after the break and were ruthless as Watford's usually resilient defence tired.\nSome would criticise Ozil's lack of goals - only one so far this season - but the German World Cup winner provided two assists.\nIf they all find some consistency in the league then Arsenal fans will no doubt get value for money this campaign.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)\nManager reaction\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"It was an important win for us. You could see why Watford have not conceded many goals at home. They are strong and very direct and we could not make a mistake.\n\"When we scored the first goal I like the fact we were relentless and continued to attack. The confidence is there and once we were 1-0 up or 2-0 up we continued to play and attack.\n\"Physically and mentally the game became more difficult for Watford as well and we took advantage of that.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"I'm a little frustrated. In the first half we played really well.\n\"We have to make an amazing effort if we want to make the level. We have to be positive with our first hour. The match was finished in a 10-15 minute spell.\n\"I am really happy with the first half performance. We had chances and I felt we would get the first goal.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford have never won a Premier League game in the month of October (D4 L6).\nThe Gunners have won their last six meetings with the Hornets in all competitions, including all five previous Premier League clashes.\nWatford conceded as many goals in this game (three) as they had in their previous six top-flight matches at Vicarage Road combined.\nRamsey scored his first goal of the season in the Premier League, after failing to net with his previous 26 (inc. blocked) in 2015-16.\nWatford striker Troy Deeney has now had the most shots without scoring in the Premier League this season (23 shots inc. blocked).\nWhat next?\nArsenal face a huge test against Bayern Munich in midweek in the Champions League - a match they really have to win - before they host Everton next weekend. Watford, who dropped to 14th in the Premier League, are at Stoke."

However, in December he suffered a thigh injury which kept him out of action until April - and with it went Arsenal's title chances.\nThis season the Gunners' goals have largely come from Sanchez, Giroud and Theo Walcott. Ramsey had a chance to join the list in the first half but missed with what was his 26th effort on goal - more than any other Premier League player who has not scored yet this season.\nBut having notched for Wales last week, he finally grabbed his first for his club when he converted Hector Bellerin's through-ball, albeit via a slight deflection off Ikechi Anya.\nGunners' big guns firing\nRamsey became the latest member of Arsenal's strong attacking unit to find the net today.\nWalcott, with four goals this season, failed to make an impact at Vicarage Road, but manager Arsene Wenger had Giroud in reserve. And although Sanchez and Ozil were relatively anonymous in the first half, they displayed their class after the break and were ruthless as Watford's usually resilient defence tired.\nSome would criticise Ozil's lack of goals - only one so far this season - but the German World Cup winner provided two assists.\nIf they all find some consistency in the league then Arsenal fans will no doubt get value for money this campaign.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)\nManager reaction\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"It was an important win for us. You could see why Watford have not conceded many goals at home. They are strong and very direct and we could not make a mistake.\n\"When we scored the first goal I like the fact we were relentless and continued to attack. The confidence is there and once we were 1-0 up or 2-0 up we continued to play and attack.\n\"Physically and mentally the game became more difficult for Watford as well and we took advantage of that.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"I'm a little frustrated. In the first half we played really well.\n\"We have to make an amazing effort if we want to make the level. We have to be positive with our first hour. The match was finished in a 10-15 minute spell.\n\"I am really happy with the first half performance. We had chances and I felt we would get the first goal.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford have never won a Premier League game in the month of October (D4 L6).\nThe Gunners have won their last six meetings with the Hornets in all competitions, including all five previous Premier League clashes.\nWatford conceded as many goals in this game (three) as they had in their previous six top-flight matches at Vicarage Road combined.\nRamsey scored his first goal of the season in the Premier League, after failing to net with his previous 26 (inc. blocked) in 2015-16.\nWatford striker Troy Deeney has now had the most shots without scoring in the Premier League this season (23 shots inc. blocked).\nWhat next?\nArsenal face a huge test against Bayern Munich in midweek in the Champions League - a match they really have to win - before they host Everton next weekend. Watford, who dropped to 14th in the Premier League, are at Stoke.",

But the 22-year-old was much more prominent after netting his third goal of the season and for the second home match in succession.\nHe was involved in the move that led to a good chance for strike partner Salomon Rondon, who poked a left-wing cross wide from eight yards.\nBerahino's goal earned Albion's first home win of the season and lifted Tony Pulis's side seven points above the relegation zone, having started the day 17th in the table.\nFlare-up at full-time\nThere were ugly scenes on the field at the end of the match after some Sunderland players took exception to Albion's former Black Cats winger James McClean celebrating victory in front of the travelling supporters.\nDanny Graham and Cattermole were among those to confront Republic of Ireland international McClean, who was escorted off the pitch by team-mate Craig Gardner.\nPulis said: \"I'd heard a roar or whatever and didn't know whether the players were involved in something. If he's out of order I'll speak to him.\n\"He played really well today, James. He's settled in really well, he's a smashing lad and the lads have really taken to him.\n\"He's not the sharpest tool in the box, and that's not being disrespectful to him. But he's a smashing lad.\"\nMan of the match: Stephane Sessegnon\nWhat the managers said\nWest Bromwich Albion head coach Tony Pulis: \"The win was more important than anything else today - the win and the clean sheet.\n\"The first half wasn't brilliant but in the second half we were much better. We have had some tough games at home. We lost against Everton when we were 2-0 up, which was a kick in the stomach, so we needed that today.\n\"It was probably a bonus for us that Sam has not had a lot of time with his players because of the international break. He will give it his best shot, as he always does.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"We have had a point taken away from us today which wasn't our fault. In our position that's a hugely precious point, even at this stage of the season.\n\"It's a big mistake by the referee. It was a clear foul in two areas: one, he [Berahino] has jumped backwards into our goalkeeper when he is not even looking at the ball. And two, he handled the ball in front of him to score.\n\"We know we have to build from a solid base. What looked like a 0-0 would have been a good basis for us because the goals will come.\"\nThe stats\nWest Brom are the only Premier League side yet to score in the opening 30 minutes of a game this season.\nSunderland have failed to score in five of their last seven trips to The Hawthorns.\nThirteen of Saido Berahino's 17 goals since the start of last season have come at The Hawthorns (76%).\nSince August 2014, Berahino has scored 23 goals in all competitions, 16 more than any other WBA player.\nThis is only the third time in Sunderland's top-flight history that they have gone nine games without a win at the start of the season (also 1969-70 and 1976-77).\nWhat's next?\nWest Bromwich Albion go to Norwich City, another side in the bottom half of the Premier League table, on Saturday, 24 October (15:00 BST).\nThe following day (12:00 GMT), Sunderland host Newcastle. Two local rivals, the bottom two clubs in the Premier League, Allardyce's first home game in charge - few Wear-Tyne derbies have been more important than that one.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 6-2 Norwich City\nGeorginio Wijnaldum scored four goals as Newcastle trounced Norwich for their first Premier League win of the season to move off the bottom of the table.\nWijnaldum struck a composed first, two headers and a superb long-range fourth.\nSpaniard Ayoze Perez stroked in the third for Newcastle and Aleksandar Mitrovic lashed in the fourth.\nFor Norwich, striker Dieumerci Mbokani had poked in an equaliser to make it 1-1, and Nathan Redmond volleyed for 3-2 before the home side pulled away.\nAn electrifying contest saw five goals scored in the space of 20 first-half minutes, although neither defence covered itself in glory.\nMbokani managed to score from inside the six-yard box despite the close attentions of Chancel Mbemba and Fabricio Coloccini, while Wijnaldum was allowed two free headers and Redmond was also unmarked for his brilliant strike.\nNorwich could have had two more themselves but Robbie Brady and Redmond both hit the post.\nRelive Newcastle's thrilling victory\nPressure eases on McClaren\nThe priceless result gives Steve McClaren a first league win since taking over at St James' Park and eases the pressure on the former England manager, although Newcastle remain in the bottom three.\nThe Magpies capitulated in the second half against Manchester City last time out, losing 6-1, but recovered by showing brilliant composure in front of goal against Norwich, scoring from all of their six shots on target.\nDespite the winless start, before the game McClaren insisted his team were making progress, and three points coupled with a stunning attacking display will vindicate that view.\nDefensively, though, he will still have concerns. The Magpies have now conceded 19 goals in nine games, second only to Norwich (20) and the same as bottom side Sunderland.\nWhat went right for Newcastle?\nMcClaren can take positives from the excellent link-up play shown by Moussa Sissoko and Wijnaldum, who combined for two of their goals. Sissoko, in particular, was a threat to Norwich all game and claimed three assists.\nNetherlands international Wijnaldum was brought in during the summer for \u00a314.5m from PSV Eindhoven, becoming the club's third most expensive signing after Michael Owen and Alan Shearer.\nAlthough he hasn't produced his best so far this season, Wijnaldum showed his class in this match with a rare quadruple, becoming only the second player - after Shearer - to score that many in a single Premier League game for the club.\nThey included a cool first goal and two well-directed headers, but his fourth was the pick of the lot. He collected the ball around 40 yards out before gliding forward and arrowing an effort past John Ruddy, albeit via a deflection.\nWith Wijnaldum in this form, \u00a313m summer signing Mitrovic also among the goals and Sissoko to the fore, Newcastle have realistic hopes of climbing away from danger, although they will need to tighten up at the back.\nSmiles all around on Tyneside\nBBC Sport's Chris Bevan at St James' Park: \"It has been many months since the stadium was last in full voice but the atmosphere here was at its deafening best at the end of this afternoon.\n\"By the 70th minute, with the Magpies 5-2 up and chants of 'we love Newcastle, we do' echoing around the ground, you could be forgiven for thinking the good times were back, rather than watching a team that was bottom of the table, about to record their first league win of the season and were hammered 6-1 last time out.\n\"The mood had been a lot tenser than that until Newcastle's fourth and fifth goals went in but, bearing in mind their poor home form leading up to this game, their fans had remained patient and also pretty positive.\n\"They stayed behind their players and manager Steve McClaren throughout, and the final whistle was greeted by a huge roar. For the first time this season, they will have left the ground wearing broad smiles on their faces.\"\nNorwich leave door wide open\nNorwich manager Alex Neil has big problems after seeing his side fail to win in their last four league games, dropping them to 16th in the table.\nHaving conceded six goals against Newcastle, they now have the worst defensive record in the division and have not kept a clean sheet in any of their nine league games.\nThe ease with which Newcastle scored some of their goals will be the biggest worry, with the men in black and white afforded time and space to pick their spot.\nMan of the match - Georginio Wijnaldum\n'A win was coming'\nNewcastle head coach Steve McClaren: \"I am relieved for the supporters and players who have endured a lot.\n\"We knew a win was around the corner, but we didn't know when it would come. We played some really good football. We kept the faith with the players - everyone around us is saying what they've been saying, but we've got to keep tight.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"There was one decision made in the game, when I took Alex Tettey off, that didn't have the effect it should have had.\n\"It made us more vulnerable at the back. When you concede that many goals it's hard to take positives, but offensively we looked a threat.\"\nNewcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic: \"I enjoyed the goal a lot. We played the perfect game. After a few bad games we showed how to play football. Wijnaldum showed a bit of magic today.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle scored six goals in a Premier League game for the first time since August 2010 against Aston Villa\nMoussa Sissoko became only the second Newcastle player to register three assists in a Premier League match, after Andy Cole against West Ham in March 1994.\nThis was the highest scoring Premier League match so far this season.\nWhat next?\nDerby day for Newcastle next Sunday (kick-off 12:00 BST) as they face Sunderland, while Norwich are at home to West Brom on Saturday."

The Ivory Coast striker doubled his City tally since his \u00a328m move from Swansea last January.\nCherries suffer harsh lesson\nThe match proved a steep learning curve for Bournemouth, who were unlucky not to be awarded an early penalty after Dan Gosling was brought down by Nicolas Otamendi.\nEddie Howe warned his team they would need to reach new levels in order to contend with City, but their commitment to attack meant they left plenty of space for the hosts to exploit.\nFederici, who gifted Arsenal a winner in last season's FA Cup semi-final while playing for Reading, contributed to Bony's opener when he spilled a left-wing cross.\nBut the visitors could not cope with City's attacking threat as Bournemouth slipped two places to sit fourth from bottom of the table.\nAnd with several players out injured, including top scorer Callum Wilson, it looks to be a long, hard winter for the promoted side.\nMan of the match: Raheem Sterling\nManager reaction\nManchester City manager Pellegrini on Raheem Sterling's first career hat-trick: \"When we bought Raheem in the summer I said we are buying a 20-year-old who is very young and needs to improve. He is not a striker but he can improve his finishing and, today, he did.\"\n\"I am happy because we changed his position and played him in the middle, with Wilfried Bony in front of him.\n\"We felt it was better for him to be near Bony and also near the box. We also had to do something different because we were without Sergio Aguero and David Silva.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"It was a difficult afternoon for us. We made a really bad start and gifted them goals which is a recipe for disaster against such a quality team.\n\"Losing our keeper Artur Boruc just before kick-off was a big blow because he has done so well for us for a long time and he gives the back four a lot of confidence.\n\"There was a spell in the first half when the score was 3-1 where I thought we were on top but we conceded a crucial goal before half-time. That was a real killer blow in terms of our hopes of getting back into the game in the second half.\"\nStats you need to know\nRaheem Sterling has become the 11th different player to score a Premier League hat-trick while aged under 21.\nAll four of Sterling's goals in the Premier League this season have come against newly-promoted sides.\nKevin De Bruyne has scored four goals and assisted four more in his last six games in all competitions for Manchester City.\nBournemouth scored from their only shot on target.\nGlenn Murray has scored nine Premier League goals in 22 appearances in 2015, compared to one goal in 16 apperances before this year.\nWhat next?\nManchester City host Sevilla in the Champions League on Wednesday ahead of the Manchester derby while Bournemouth host Tottenham a week on Sunday."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester City 5-1 Bournemouth\nRaheem Sterling scored a hat-trick as Manchester City thrashed Bournemouth to remain top of the Premier League.\nCity were missing the injured Sergio Aguero but went ahead when Sterling poked in from close range.\nAdam Federici then spilled a cross for Wilfried Bony to tap in before Glenn Murray scored from 20 yards.\nSterling waltzed around the Cherries defence for his second and made up for Jesus Navas' hesitation to grab a third before Bony turned and struck late on.\nIt was a clinical performance from 20-year-old Sterling, who scored a first career hat-trick after being criticised for his lack of composure in front of goal since his \u00a344m move from Liverpool.\nBut the England international also benefited from a fine display from Kevin de Bruyne, whose pass for Sterling's second goal was almost worth the entrance fee alone.\nRelive City's win over Bournemouth\nAll the reaction to Saturday's Premier League results\nSterling and De Bruyne show worth\nCity were without top scorer Aguero and star midfielder David Silva, but new signings Sterling and De Bruyne - worth a combined \u00a399m - showed they were more than capable of leading City's charge in pursuit of a Premier League title.\nFollowing a 6-1 win over Newcastle before the international break, Sterling started behind lone striker Bony, while De Bruyne tormented the Bournemouth defence from the left with his wonderful range of passing and a hammer shot.\nAdam Federici, who was drawn into the Cherries goal after Artur Boruc was injured in the warm-up, denied the Belgium international with a fine save.\nBut his defence were often strung apart by the movement of the City pair, who will hope they can do the same in next weekend's Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\nWith Aguero out for a month, Bony's first goals of the season will also give the team confidence. The Ivory Coast striker doubled his City tally since his \u00a328m move from Swansea last January.\nCherries suffer harsh lesson\nThe match proved a steep learning curve for Bournemouth, who were unlucky not to be awarded an early penalty after Dan Gosling was brought down by Nicolas Otamendi.\nEddie Howe warned his team they would need to reach new levels in order to contend with City, but their commitment to attack meant they left plenty of space for the hosts to exploit.\nFederici, who gifted Arsenal a winner in last season's FA Cup semi-final while playing for Reading, contributed to Bony's opener when he spilled a left-wing cross.\nBut the visitors could not cope with City's attacking threat as Bournemouth slipped two places to sit fourth from bottom of the table.\nAnd with several players out injured, including top scorer Callum Wilson, it looks to be a long, hard winter for the promoted side.\nMan of the match: Raheem Sterling\nManager reaction\nManchester City manager Pellegrini on Raheem Sterling's first career hat-trick: \"When we bought Raheem in the summer I said we are buying a 20-year-old who is very young and needs to improve. He is not a striker but he can improve his finishing and, today, he did.\"\n\"I am happy because we changed his position and played him in the middle, with Wilfried Bony in front of him.\n\"We felt it was better for him to be near Bony and also near the box. We also had to do something different because we were without Sergio Aguero and David Silva.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"It was a difficult afternoon for us. We made a really bad start and gifted them goals which is a recipe for disaster against such a quality team.\n\"Losing our keeper Artur Boruc just before kick-off was a big blow because he has done so well for us for a long time and he gives the back four a lot of confidence.\n\"There was a spell in the first half when the score was 3-1 where I thought we were on top but we conceded a crucial goal before half-time. That was a real killer blow in terms of our hopes of getting back into the game in the second half.\"\nStats you need to know\nRaheem Sterling has become the 11th different player to score a Premier League hat-trick while aged under 21.\nAll four of Sterling's goals in the Premier League this season have come against newly-promoted sides.\nKevin De Bruyne has scored four goals and assisted four more in his last six games in all competitions for Manchester City.\nBournemouth scored from their only shot on target.\nGlenn Murray has scored nine Premier League goals in 22 appearances in 2015, compared to one goal in 16 apperances before this year.\nWhat next?\nManchester City host Sevilla in the Champions League on Wednesday ahead of the Manchester derby while Bournemouth host Tottenham a week on Sunday.",

Defensively we did well in the first half and we scored from set pieces.\n\"But I expected a difficult second half because we know one of Leicester's strengths is unbelievable spirit and we have to be more clever.\n\"They deserved at least one point. They did two good changes after half-time. Mahrez created difficulties for us.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri on BBC Sport: \"We have fantastic spirit. We believe everything could be possible.\n\"We created a lot of chances. It is important to have good players on the bench and I have very good players who can change the match.\n\"Jamie Vardy is very important for us. I believe in this team. When we are desperate we make more, more and more.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSaints have only lost one of their last 19 top-flight home games against Leicester (W10, D8). That came in April 2000.\nFifth-placed Leicester are unbeaten in their last eight away games. They have only once enjoyed a longer run in the top division, going nine matches without defeat in 1973.\nJamie Vardy has scored in six successive league matches for the first time in his career.\nThey have earned a league-high seven points from losing positions this season.\nVardy has scored 10 goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances.\nLeicester had 18 second half shots compared to Southampton's four.\nWhat next?\nIt doesn't get any easier for Southampton as they face a trip to Liverpool for Jurgen Klopp's first home match in charge of the Reds. Leicester entertain Crystal Palace looking to maintain their top five spot.\nMore follows."

Klopp has laid the foundations of how he wants his side to play, but does he have right equipment to emulate his achievements at Borussia Dortmund?\nThe Reds have appeared to become, in such a short space of time, a team that is hard to defeat.\nThe energy spent by the hunting packs in closing down space when Southampton had the ball was impressive. Known as a form of gegenpressing - immediate closing down of counter-attacks - the Reds enjoyed over 60% possession and limited the Saints to just three efforts on target.\nBut on the flip side Klopp does not appear to have the necessary attacking players to make that possession count in the opposition's third.\nLiverpool barely threatened as an attacking force and prior to Benteke's goal they managed just one effort on target.\nOrigi and out?\nHow Liverpool could do with forwards like Mane and Graziano Pelle, who now have 13 goals between them in all competitions this season.\nKlopp - his options limited by injuries to Danny Ings and Daniel Sturridge - opted to start with Divock Origi as his lone frontman. After a poor display, it is now three matches and no goals for the Belgium international under Klopp.\nThe disparity in performance between the Reds forward, who was replaced by Benteke at half-time, and Pelle was stark.\nThe Saints frontman was the busier of the two despite his side having less possession than the opposition, while Origi managed 10 touches in his 45 minutes - the fewest of any player on the field.\nWhat they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"Of course this moment is not the best moment in the week because we wasted a lot of energy.\n\"Southampton haven't lost away from home so we had to work hard. You score the goal and you want to win, but it didn't happen tonight.\n\"Football is not a fairytale. Sometimes we write stories like this but it doesn't happen. You see these guys can play football, are technically strong and physically strong but you saw how big the disappointment was.\n\"It's only a goal, only a game of football. It's like it's the last thing in your life and we have to calm this down.\"\nRead more of Klopp's thoughts on the game\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman on BBC Sport:\n\"We deserved at least one point but honestly it was not our best performance but we had a good reaction after going down to a great goal from Benteke.\n\"Our defensive organisation is good, it is difficult to create chances against us.\n\"Teams like Liverpool, if they have a change in management, there is always a change in expectation. I know that, I have played for big teams and I know the expectation on the manager of Liverpool is always bigger than that of Southampton.\"\nMan of the match - Virgil van Dijk (Southampton)\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool have drawn four of their last five league games (W1, D4).\nTheir 3-2 win over Aston Villa is the only league fixture in which they have scored more than one goal this season.\nThe Reds have scored just nine league goals this season. Only West Brom (8) and Watford (8) have scored fewer.\nSouthampton are unbeaten away from home in this season's Premier League (W1, D4).\nNo player has scored more headed goals in the Premier League since 2013-14 than Christian Benteke (14, level with Arsenal's Olivier Giroud).\nWhat next?\nLiverpool have a League Cup encounter against Bournemouth midweek before they travel to Chelsea, with Jose Mourinho's side in turmoil. The Saints on the other hand face Aston Villa, who are without a manager, in the cup and then host the Cherries next week in the battle of the south coast."

We controlled it, created chances and never looked like giving away anything at the back. Even with 10 men in the second half we still controlled it. Referee decisions are out of your control.\n\"It was never a penalty. The penalty and red card was a double whammy. In the first half the team were excellent. I was totally relaxed. We were in control. I said to players that's what we must continue. If we continue doing that and get decisions right then we'll do OK.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThe 13 shots Newcastle had in the first half was the the most they have had in the first half of a Premier League game since September 2014 v Hull.\nAdam Johnson is now Sunderland's joint-top scorer in Premier League derbies against Newcastle, with four.\nNewcastle have had 10 red cards since the start of 2014-15, three more than any other side.\nNewcastle have managed to score just one goal in their last 627 minutes of football against Sunderland.\nBilly Jones netted only his second PL goal, after also scoring against Newcastle in April 2013.\nThis is the first time Sunderland have scored 3+ goals in a PL game since 3 November 2014\nWhat next?\nSunderland will look to build on their first win of the season away to Everton next weekend, while Newcastle entertain Stoke in the Premier League.",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "West Ham United 2-1 Chelsea\nChelsea had midfielder Nemanja Matic and manager Jose Mourinho sent off as Andy Carroll's late winner dealt their faltering title defence another blow.\nMauro Zarate fired the Hammers in front when Chelsea failed to clear a corner.\nMatic was sent off after being booked twice in nine minutes before the break, and Mourinho joined him after speaking to referee Jon Moss at half-time.\nGary Cahill levelled from a corner but Carroll met Aaron Cresswell's cross to send the Hammers third in the table.\nChelsea, who have now lost five of their first 10 Premier League games this season, continue to languish in the bottom half.\nAs well as Matic and Mourinho, the Blues' assistant first-team coach Silvino Louro was also dismissed.\nChelsea had five other players booked in a stormy east versus west London derby, the last to be played at Upton Park in the league before West Ham move to the Olympic Stadium next summer.\nMatic, Mourinho and Louro see red\nZarate's goal, after Dimitri Payet's corner was not cleared, meant West Ham led at the break but his goal was not the decisive moment of the first half.\nThat came when Matic slipped out on the right by-line and dragged down Diafra Sakho.\nThe Chelsea midfielder had been booked nine minutes earlier for hauling back Cheikhou Kouyate as West Ham looked to break.\nReferee Moss took his time before showing Matic a second yellow card, which brought a furious response from Chelsea.\nDiego Costa and Cesc Fabregas were booked as the visiting players lost their discipline, while Louro was sent from the bench.\nMourinho continued his protests at half-time and was sent to the stands for the second half after going to speak to Moss in the referee's room.\nHe was stood among West Ham fans when Carroll scored, but disappeared from view soon afterwards.\nChelsea millimetres from an equaliser\nMatic's first booking came seconds after Chelsea thought they had equalised.\nKurt Zouma rose to head Cesc Fabregas's corner goalwards, but a combination of defender Carl Jenkinson and goalkeeper Adrian kept it out - just - before the whole ball crossed the line.\nChelsea were also denied by another marginal decision when a Fabregas goal was ruled out for offside moments before Matic was dismissed.\nCarroll back among the goals\nWhen Chelsea did draw level, through Cahill's opportunistic second-half finish from Willian's corner, West Ham rethought their approach.\nHammers boss Slaven Bilic threw on Carroll for the last 20 minutes and the home side began pumping crosses into the box.\nCarroll is yet to start a Premier League game this season because of a summer setback following a serious knee injury in February, but is getting closer to full fitness.\nHe was not just on for match minutes against Chelsea, however, and had the desired impact with his first goal since January.\n\"It's impossible to mark him in the box,\" Bilic said afterwards.\n\"His quality was never in question. If he's in good shape now we have a good chance that he will be injury-free for a long time. In that case West Ham and England will benefit from that a lot.\"\nRead more: Bilic backs Carroll to stay fit\nMan of the match - West Ham's Dimitri Payet\n'We're not feeling sorry for ourselves' - Cahill\nWhen asked about the mood in the dressing room, Chelsea defender Gary Cahill told BBC Sport: \"It is not great - like you'd imagine when you lose games. Last season we weren't used to it.\n\"The lads are devastated. Not many words are being said at the moment. I'm sure we'll reflect in [the] next day or so.\n\"You're left scratching your head sometimes. In the first half the Fabregas goal could have been given and we had the ball that was nearly over the line. That sums up the way we're going.\n\"And then we've got the sending off. Originally we played on - we thought the referee had played on. Maybe the assistant called it back, I'm not sure sure what's happened there.\n\"We've not had the rub of the green, but we're not feeling sorry for ourselves. We have to work hard to turn this round.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is West Ham's best ever start to a PL season after 10 games (20 points), while it's Chelsea's worst ever start to a PL campaign after 10 games (11 points).\nJose Mourinho has lost six of his last 12 PL matches; immediately before that run, he had lost six in 64 in the English top-flight.\nChelsea have conceded the first goal in five of their 10 PL matches this season; they only managed it in eight games throughout the entire 2014/15 campaign.\nWest Ham have now won their three Premier League London derbies so far this season (also v Arsenal and Crystal Palace) - they only won two PL London derbies in the whole of 2014-15.\nMauro Zarate scored his first ever PL goal at Upton Park in this match.\nWest Ham United scored their first goal against Chelsea in 467 minutes.\nWhat happens next?\nWest Ham go to Vicarage Road on Saturday to face Watford in their next Premier League game, while Chelsea's next test is against Stoke in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday."

Substitute Jesse Lingard hit the bar late on and City keeper Joe Hart saved well from Chris Smalling.\nUnited defender Marcos Rojo and City's Nicolas Otamendi were both outstanding as Old Trafford's atmosphere was muted long before the final whistle.\nAnalysis: Why Wayne Rooney is not a number nine anymore\nRelive the game as it happened, plus reaction.\nRooney lacking spark\nWayne Rooney celebrated his 30th birthday on Saturday, but did not produce a performance to get the home supporters in the party mood.\nIt was not for want of trying as Rooney tirelessly tried to exert influence on a game where both sides cancelled each other out for long periods.\nHis performance prompted more post-match questions from the media, which United boss Louis van Gaal said he was \"sick\" of answering.\nThere is no doubt, however, that some of the old snap and spark is currently missing, ending in Rooney treading the familiar territory of a player almost trying too hard to make things happen.\nRooney having a head wound stapled on the touchline was arguably the most eye-catching moment of a dreadful first half, where his struggles were underlined with one wayward pass that ended a promising United move.\nAnd there were howls of frustration from United's fans after the break when he decided against trying to pick out an option further forward, turning to pass back.\nRooney has had such fallow spells before and has invariably ended them in spectacular style so only a fool would write him off - but this was not his best day.\nCity wide men fail to fire\nManchester City spent in excess of \u00a3100m on Raheem Sterling from Liverpool and Kevin de Bruyne from Wolfsburg to add extra potency to their attack.\nThe \u00a355m Belgian De Bruyne and Sterling, who cost \u00a349m, have both sparkled since the start of the season but failed to flourish in their first Manchester derby, with the latter only lasting 55 minutes before he was replaced by Jesus Navas.\nSterling's main contribution was to almost give away a very soft penalty when he tangled with United's Ander Herrera in the second half. He wore the look of a very relieved man when referee Mark Clattenburg ignored the appeals of Old Trafford.\nDe Bruyne saw more of the ball, especially on the right flank before he was switched to the left in the second half. However, his delivery was uncharacteristically poor.\nThere is plenty more to come from both of these fine young players but, like so much else on offer at Old Trafford, they were unable to rise above the general mediocrity.\nOld Trafford bored into submission\nThe empty seats and relative silence around Old Trafford in the closing moments illustrated just how poor this 170th Manchester derby was.\nIt took 82 minutes for a shot on target, or an apology of one - a Navas effort that rolled through to United keeper David de Gea.\nSmalling brought that good save out of Hart late on but this was one of the worst derbies in recent memory.\nCity have had spectacular wins such as the 6-1 thrashing of United here in October 2011, and they were arguably even more convincing in a 3-0 win over David Moyes' team in March 2014.\nVan Gaal's United were outstanding in a 4-2 derby win at Old Trafford last April. All of those were games contained the elements of excitement this bore draw did not.\nLacking attacking ambition and cutting edge, both sides cancelled each other out for long periods in a game that will have been forgotten by most fans as soon as the final whistle blew.\nMan of the match - Nicolas Otamendi (Manchester City)\nPowerful in the air and on the ground, the \u00a332m summer signing from Valencia was a reassuring presence alongside returning captain Vincent Kompany, justifying Manuel Pellegrini's decision to pick him ahead of Eliaquim Mangala.\n'Not an attractive game' - managers react\nManchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"We are back at the top of the table.\n\"It was a very tactical game. I prefer to play in another way but we defended well.\n\"Unfortunately for the fans it was not a very attractive game. We are two creative teams but we could not do it today.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"We had 90 minutes control of the game against a side like Manchester City. I cannot complain. But you want to win and we did not.\n\"We should have had a penalty on Ander Herrera. It is easy to see for me but I have a replay. The referee has one second.\n\"I always say we need the modern technology but I am the only one in the desert calling for it.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is only the third goalless Manchester derby in the Premier League era.\nIt is the first time in 13 Manchester derbies in all competitions where the game has ended in a draw.\nIt is Manchester City's first goalless Premier League draw in their last 61 games, the last draw was 0-0 v Norwich in February 2014.\nIt is only the second Premier League game this season not to have a shot on target in the first half, along with United v Liverpool.\nManchester United failed to muster a single shot in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time since the 2003-04 season.\nWhat's up next?\nBoth sides are in League Cup fourth-round action on Wednesday - United are at home to Middlesbrough and City host Crystal Palace.\nOn Saturday in the Premier League United go to Palace, while City host Norwich.",

It is not a nice time, I have never even lost two league games in a row, never mind three.\n\"Yes, you are concerned, I'm looking at what I can do to put it right. I'm trying to do everything I can and I'm working as hard as I can and it is about making sure when the lads are on the pitch they do as well as they can.\n\"In our box we didn't defend well enough and in the other box they defended it well.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"The defenders do a lot of work on the training ground, we work very hard on certain aspects.\n\"We talk about it because of the record I have got but we also work hard going forward and today we got our reward. The quality of our play going forward was very, very good at times.\n\"We also thought we should have had a penalty and we had a couple of headers as well.\"\nWhat's next\nNorwich have an opportunity to forget their poor league form on Tuesday when they visit Everton in the fourth round of the League Cup. They desperately require a confidence-boosting win before their next league match at title-chasing Manchester City on 31 October.\nAs for West Brom, they entertain in-form Leicester next Saturday before a tough double-header away to Manchester United on 7 November and at home to Arsenal on 21 November.\nThe stats you need to know\nNorwich have won just three of their last 10 league games against West Brom\nThe Baggies have kept a league-high 16 clean sheets in the Premier League since Tony Pulis' first game in charge on 10 January\nThe Canaries have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premier League this season - 21\nThe Baggies have kept six clean sheets in their last nine Premier League games"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester Utd 0-0 Manchester City\nManchester United and Manchester City played out a dull deadlock in their derby at Old Trafford.\nCity returned to the top of the Premier League ahead of Arsenal on goal difference - but there was little else to celebrate in a dire game devoid of attacking quality.\nWhat few chances there were fell to United. Substitute Jesse Lingard hit the bar late on and City keeper Joe Hart saved well from Chris Smalling.\nUnited defender Marcos Rojo and City's Nicolas Otamendi were both outstanding as Old Trafford's atmosphere was muted long before the final whistle.\nAnalysis: Why Wayne Rooney is not a number nine anymore\nRelive the game as it happened, plus reaction.\nRooney lacking spark\nWayne Rooney celebrated his 30th birthday on Saturday, but did not produce a performance to get the home supporters in the party mood.\nIt was not for want of trying as Rooney tirelessly tried to exert influence on a game where both sides cancelled each other out for long periods.\nHis performance prompted more post-match questions from the media, which United boss Louis van Gaal said he was \"sick\" of answering.\nThere is no doubt, however, that some of the old snap and spark is currently missing, ending in Rooney treading the familiar territory of a player almost trying too hard to make things happen.\nRooney having a head wound stapled on the touchline was arguably the most eye-catching moment of a dreadful first half, where his struggles were underlined with one wayward pass that ended a promising United move.\nAnd there were howls of frustration from United's fans after the break when he decided against trying to pick out an option further forward, turning to pass back.\nRooney has had such fallow spells before and has invariably ended them in spectacular style so only a fool would write him off - but this was not his best day.\nCity wide men fail to fire\nManchester City spent in excess of \u00a3100m on Raheem Sterling from Liverpool and Kevin de Bruyne from Wolfsburg to add extra potency to their attack.\nThe \u00a355m Belgian De Bruyne and Sterling, who cost \u00a349m, have both sparkled since the start of the season but failed to flourish in their first Manchester derby, with the latter only lasting 55 minutes before he was replaced by Jesus Navas.\nSterling's main contribution was to almost give away a very soft penalty when he tangled with United's Ander Herrera in the second half. He wore the look of a very relieved man when referee Mark Clattenburg ignored the appeals of Old Trafford.\nDe Bruyne saw more of the ball, especially on the right flank before he was switched to the left in the second half. However, his delivery was uncharacteristically poor.\nThere is plenty more to come from both of these fine young players but, like so much else on offer at Old Trafford, they were unable to rise above the general mediocrity.\nOld Trafford bored into submission\nThe empty seats and relative silence around Old Trafford in the closing moments illustrated just how poor this 170th Manchester derby was.\nIt took 82 minutes for a shot on target, or an apology of one - a Navas effort that rolled through to United keeper David de Gea.\nSmalling brought that good save out of Hart late on but this was one of the worst derbies in recent memory.\nCity have had spectacular wins such as the 6-1 thrashing of United here in October 2011, and they were arguably even more convincing in a 3-0 win over David Moyes' team in March 2014.\nVan Gaal's United were outstanding in a 4-2 derby win at Old Trafford last April. All of those were games contained the elements of excitement this bore draw did not.\nLacking attacking ambition and cutting edge, both sides cancelled each other out for long periods in a game that will have been forgotten by most fans as soon as the final whistle blew.\nMan of the match - Nicolas Otamendi (Manchester City)\nPowerful in the air and on the ground, the \u00a332m summer signing from Valencia was a reassuring presence alongside returning captain Vincent Kompany, justifying Manuel Pellegrini's decision to pick him ahead of Eliaquim Mangala.\n'Not an attractive game' - managers react\nManchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"We are back at the top of the table.\n\"It was a very tactical game. I prefer to play in another way but we defended well.\n\"Unfortunately for the fans it was not a very attractive game. We are two creative teams but we could not do it today.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"We had 90 minutes control of the game against a side like Manchester City. I cannot complain. But you want to win and we did not.\n\"We should have had a penalty on Ander Herrera. It is easy to see for me but I have a replay. The referee has one second.\n\"I always say we need the modern technology but I am the only one in the desert calling for it.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is only the third goalless Manchester derby in the Premier League era.\nIt is the first time in 13 Manchester derbies in all competitions where the game has ended in a draw.\nIt is Manchester City's first goalless Premier League draw in their last 61 games, the last draw was 0-0 v Norwich in February 2014.\nIt is only the second Premier League game this season not to have a shot on target in the first half, along with United v Liverpool.\nManchester United failed to muster a single shot in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time since the 2003-04 season.\nWhat's up next?\nBoth sides are in League Cup fourth-round action on Wednesday - United are at home to Middlesbrough and City host Crystal Palace.\nOn Saturday in the Premier League United go to Palace, while City host Norwich."

It is not a nice time, I have never even lost two league games in a row, never mind three.\n\"Yes, you are concerned, I'm looking at what I can do to put it right. I'm trying to do everything I can and I'm working as hard as I can and it is about making sure when the lads are on the pitch they do as well as they can.\n\"In our box we didn't defend well enough and in the other box they defended it well.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"The defenders do a lot of work on the training ground, we work very hard on certain aspects.\n\"We talk about it because of the record I have got but we also work hard going forward and today we got our reward. The quality of our play going forward was very, very good at times.\n\"We also thought we should have had a penalty and we had a couple of headers as well.\"\nWhat's next\nNorwich have an opportunity to forget their poor league form on Tuesday when they visit Everton in the fourth round of the League Cup. They desperately require a confidence-boosting win before their next league match at title-chasing Manchester City on 31 October.\nAs for West Brom, they entertain in-form Leicester next Saturday before a tough double-header away to Manchester United on 7 November and at home to Arsenal on 21 November.\nThe stats you need to know\nNorwich have won just three of their last 10 league games against West Brom\nThe Baggies have kept a league-high 16 clean sheets in the Premier League since Tony Pulis' first game in charge on 10 January\nThe Canaries have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premier League this season - 21\nThe Baggies have kept six clean sheets in their last nine Premier League games",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Sunderland 3-0 Newcastle United\nSunderland moved off the bottom of the Premier League table with a record sixth consecutive win over north-east rivals and fellow strugglers Newcastle, who had Fabricio Coloccini sent off.\nAdam Johnson's penalty before half-time gave the hosts an undeserved lead, after Coloccini was penalised for a push on Steven Fletcher and dismissed.\nThe furious visitors saw Aleksandar Mitrovic denied by Costel Pantilimon.\nBut Billy Jones' close-range finish and Fletcher's volley sealed the win.\nSunderland's controversial first-half penalty changed the match after the Magpies had dominated the opening 45 minutes.\nThe victory sees Sam Allardyce's men move ahead of Newcastle on goal difference and up two places to third from bottom in the table.\nRelive Sunderland's win here\nWas it a penalty?\nNewcastle were furious with referee Robert Madley's decision because the penalty and resulting dismissal of their skipper changed the shape of what was a crucial Wear-Tyne derby.\nThe Black Cats had been second best throughout the first half, with just three shots compared to Newcastle's 12, but were handed a route into the game when Coloccini was adjudged to have fouled Fletcher.\nThe defender ran across Fletcher as he attempted to latch on to a through-ball but appeared to ease him out of the way with his shoulder with the ball running to goalkeeper Rob Elliot.\nMadley though believed there was an infringement and, having awarded the penalty, was left with little choice but to send him off for preventing a goalscoring opportunity.\nThe Football Association's law on impeding an opponent says: \" A player who places himself between an opponent and the ball for tactical reasons has not committed an offence as long as the ball is kept within playing distance and the player does not hold off the opponent with his arms or body.\n\"If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly charged by an opponent.\"\nCan Allardyce keep Sunderland up?\nAllardyce has never been relegated from the Premier League as a manager, keeping the likes of Blackburn, Bolton and West Ham in the top flight.\nRarely can he have taken such a tough job on though, with the Black Cats bottom of the table going into Sunday's match on the back of a 12-game winless run.\nHe has never lost his opening Premier League home game in charge of a club though and became the fourth consecutive Sunderland boss to beat Newcastle in his second game in charge.\nAllardyce will know his side have a battle to stay up but the manner of Fletcher's final goal, volleying home a sweeping move late on, and a first clean sheet of the season will be reason for hope.\nMore trouble for Newcastle\nTo rub salt into the wound for Newcastle fans, Allardyce had an unpopular spell in charge of the Magpies in the 2007-08 season.\nAnd these fans have not had much reason for optimism in recent months, with just one win now from the last 21 league matches.\nThey must have thought the corner had been turned when, after thrashing Norwich 6-2 last time out, they controlled the first 45 minutes of the derby.\nBut, following the dismissal of Coloccini, their afternoon took a turn for the worse as Steve McClaren's 200th Premier League game as a manager ended in an 82nd defeat.\nMan of the match: Steven Fletcher\nWhat the managers said:\nSunderland boss Sam Allardyce told BBC Sport: \"We've carried that precious piece of history on - the fourth manager to beat Newcastle in their second game as Sunderland boss.\n\"This was quite an achievement considering the low ebb we're in at the moment - facing a rival with the extra pressure of having won the last five derbies.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren said: \"We were the better side by a distance. We controlled it, created chances and never looked like giving away anything at the back. Even with 10 men in the second half we still controlled it. Referee decisions are out of your control.\n\"It was never a penalty. The penalty and red card was a double whammy. In the first half the team were excellent. I was totally relaxed. We were in control. I said to players that's what we must continue. If we continue doing that and get decisions right then we'll do OK.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThe 13 shots Newcastle had in the first half was the the most they have had in the first half of a Premier League game since September 2014 v Hull.\nAdam Johnson is now Sunderland's joint-top scorer in Premier League derbies against Newcastle, with four.\nNewcastle have had 10 red cards since the start of 2014-15, three more than any other side.\nNewcastle have managed to score just one goal in their last 627 minutes of football against Sunderland.\nBilly Jones netted only his second PL goal, after also scoring against Newcastle in April 2013.\nThis is the first time Sunderland have scored 3+ goals in a PL game since 3 November 2014\nWhat next?\nSunderland will look to build on their first win of the season away to Everton next weekend, while Newcastle entertain Stoke in the Premier League."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Liverpool 1-1 Southampton\nSadio Mane's late equaliser for Southampton denied Jurgen Klopp his first victory as Liverpool manager.\nThe home side dominated possession at Anfield and took the lead when Christian Benteke headed in James Milner's cross from the right.\nBut with four minutes left, Mane bundled in when Gaston Ramirez's header across goal was palmed by keeper Simon Mignolet into the body of the forward.\nMane was then sent off in stoppage time after picking up two late yellows.\nThe draw moves the Saints up to eighth, with Liverpool up to ninth and level on 14 points.\nRelive the action from Anfield\nGegenpressing works - but where's the end product?\nPlayed three, drawn three. Klopp has laid the foundations of how he wants his side to play, but does he have right equipment to emulate his achievements at Borussia Dortmund?\nThe Reds have appeared to become, in such a short space of time, a team that is hard to defeat.\nThe energy spent by the hunting packs in closing down space when Southampton had the ball was impressive. Known as a form of gegenpressing - immediate closing down of counter-attacks - the Reds enjoyed over 60% possession and limited the Saints to just three efforts on target.\nBut on the flip side Klopp does not appear to have the necessary attacking players to make that possession count in the opposition's third.\nLiverpool barely threatened as an attacking force and prior to Benteke's goal they managed just one effort on target.\nOrigi and out?\nHow Liverpool could do with forwards like Mane and Graziano Pelle, who now have 13 goals between them in all competitions this season.\nKlopp - his options limited by injuries to Danny Ings and Daniel Sturridge - opted to start with Divock Origi as his lone frontman. After a poor display, it is now three matches and no goals for the Belgium international under Klopp.\nThe disparity in performance between the Reds forward, who was replaced by Benteke at half-time, and Pelle was stark.\nThe Saints frontman was the busier of the two despite his side having less possession than the opposition, while Origi managed 10 touches in his 45 minutes - the fewest of any player on the field.\nWhat they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"Of course this moment is not the best moment in the week because we wasted a lot of energy.\n\"Southampton haven't lost away from home so we had to work hard. You score the goal and you want to win, but it didn't happen tonight.\n\"Football is not a fairytale. Sometimes we write stories like this but it doesn't happen. You see these guys can play football, are technically strong and physically strong but you saw how big the disappointment was.\n\"It's only a goal, only a game of football. It's like it's the last thing in your life and we have to calm this down.\"\nRead more of Klopp's thoughts on the game\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman on BBC Sport:\n\"We deserved at least one point but honestly it was not our best performance but we had a good reaction after going down to a great goal from Benteke.\n\"Our defensive organisation is good, it is difficult to create chances against us.\n\"Teams like Liverpool, if they have a change in management, there is always a change in expectation. I know that, I have played for big teams and I know the expectation on the manager of Liverpool is always bigger than that of Southampton.\"\nMan of the match - Virgil van Dijk (Southampton)\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool have drawn four of their last five league games (W1, D4).\nTheir 3-2 win over Aston Villa is the only league fixture in which they have scored more than one goal this season.\nThe Reds have scored just nine league goals this season. Only West Brom (8) and Watford (8) have scored fewer.\nSouthampton are unbeaten away from home in this season's Premier League (W1, D4).\nNo player has scored more headed goals in the Premier League since 2013-14 than Christian Benteke (14, level with Arsenal's Olivier Giroud).\nWhat next?\nLiverpool have a League Cup encounter against Bournemouth midweek before they travel to Chelsea, with Jose Mourinho's side in turmoil. The Saints on the other hand face Aston Villa, who are without a manager, in the cup and then host the Cherries next week in the battle of the south coast.",

Southampton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg had little to trouble him until Tomlin and King fired shots straight at him in the closing five minutes.\nMan of the match - Graziano Pelle\nThe Italian was on target for the second time in a week, having struck the decisive goal in Wednesday's 2-1 League Cup fourth-round win over Aston Villa.\nHe found himself having to drop deeper in the second half, a side of his game many might not be too familiar with.\nPelle is rapidly turning into Southampton's key player, having scored 15 top-flight goals last season and 10 goals in his last 12 home games.\nThe stats you need to know\nSouthampton are unbeaten in their last six league meetings with Bournemouth (W5 D1).\nThe Cherries have failed to score on six of their nine visits to Southampton in the league.\nSouthampton are unbeaten at home in league competition against Bournemouth, winning seven and drawing two.\nWhat the managers said\nSouthampton's Ronald Koeman: \"The first 45 minutes was the best football so far this season. Good movement and great goals. We learned a bit from the Leicester game at 2-0 to defend better. Always an opponent will give a reaction and you have to deal with that. We lost balls and had no control. We need to do that better.\n\"In every Premier League game, even at 2-0 up is difficult. You need good defending and more control and to win every battle. Still, I think it was a very good performance.\n\"We know we can play fantastic football. If we take that and learn from the second half, we will finish in a high position.\"\nOn striker Pelle: \"Yes, he's very important to us, we know he's a very good striker, scoring goals and he's strong.\n\"In my opinion, he's one of the best in the Premier League.\"\nBournemouth's Eddie Howe: \"I thought the second half was everything we wanted the first to be. We were off the pace in the first half and Southampton played well. It was a reverse in the second but all that was missing were goals.\n\"We wanted a bit more pace after the break. We got our passing rhythm going in the second half. The overall performance and work ethic was very good.\n\"Technically we showed we can compete. Our passing and movement were to a high level. We need to cut out the mistakes.\"\nOn whether he needs to buy a new striker in January to address a lack of goals: \"The disappointing thing in the second half was we didn't have the cutting edge to create more.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 0-0 Stoke City\nStoke keeper Jack Butland produced a number of key saves to help his side earn a point at Newcastle.\nThe Magpies went close when a first-half header from striker Aleksandar Mitrovic hit the post before Butland scrambled the ball clear.\nMoussa Sissoko twice went close with well-struck shots only for Butland to save impressively each time.\nHowever, Stoke's keeper saved his best until late on when he tipped a Jamaal Lascelles header over the crossbar.\nRelive Newcastle's draw against Stoke.\nReaction to Saturday's games.\nHow good was Butland?\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren had a wry expression on his face when he went over to shake hands with Butland after the final whistle.\nMcClaren's side were denied only a second Premier League win of the season following a superb display from the England international.\nButland has prospered as first choice in the Stoke goal since the summer departure of Asmir Begovic to Chelsea and only enhanced his growing reputation at St James' Park.\nHe was the hero in his side's midweek penalty shoot-out win against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup and continued that impressive form to keep Newcastle at bay.\n\"It was a hard-fought, quite fortunate point,\" he said. \"We were a bit sluggish. Maybe we felt a bit of the pace from midweek but the lads dug in.\n\"It's nice to get a few clean sheets now and contribute to getting some points. We are still managing to get points when we are not at our best.\"\nNewcastle bounce back from derby defeat\nMcClaren insisted his team were improving, despite last week's derby defeat by Sunderland, and there were signs of the progress he had talked about in the game against Stoke.\nHis side secured only their second clean sheet of the season, with keeper Rob Elliot's main save coming when he kept out a Jon Walters header.\nThe Magpies also created plenty of chances, with Butland also keeping out an Ayoze Perez shot and Georginio Wijnaldum free-kick.\n\"The English goalkeeper situation is looking healthy,\" said McClaren. \"Four great saves from Jack denied us a win and got Stoke a point. He was unbelievable and the difference between us and three points.\"\nA concern for McClaren will be Mitrovic, who had two yellow cards and a red before this game.\nThe Serb got involved in tangles with Stoke defenders Ryan Shawcross and Philipp Wollscheid - picking up a booking for his clash with the latter. McClaren faces the task of channelling Mitrovic's fiery temper in the right way.\nMan of the match - Jack Butland\nReaction:\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren: \"We dominated the game and created chances but could not tuck one away. We were frustrated.\n\"We are building, growing and progressing - the last five games - we are getting there.\n\"There were lost of positives and the only disappointment is not getting the three points.\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We were a bit frustrated in the first half. We had plenty of possession around their area but didn't look like we wanted to shoot.\n\"Their keeper made a great save from Jon Walters.\n\"As the away team you are going to give away a couple of chances and when we did, Jack Butland saved.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle have had 36 shots in their last two Premier League games, but have failed to score in either.\nThe Magpies ended a run of seven Premier League games without a clean sheet.\nButland made six saves in a Premier League game for the third time this season.\nButland has made the most saves this top-flight campaign overall (46).\nWhat next?\nNewcastle, who are third from bottom prior to Sunday's games, have an away match at Bournemouth in the top flight next Saturday, while 14th-placed Stoke host Chelsea."

It was an excellent performance from us - as good as we have been all year.\n\"United - and it doesn't happen very often - were probably fortunate to get a point.\n\"It was a shame we didn't win it but with the run we've been on we needed to take something, so the point was important for us. We got back to the real Crystal Palace today.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"We did not keep the ball. That's a very important factor and because of that we didn't create too many chances. I have to say I can't complain about the result.\n\"[Not scoring for a third consecutive game] is a big concern but I already said that after the second match, especially against Middlesbrough, because we created many chances but did not finish.\n\"Today we didn't create so many chances so it's more difficult. When you don't keep the ball you can't create chances.\"\nStats you need to know\nLouis van Gaal's side have lost only one of their last seven league games (W4 D2 L1), keeping four clean sheets in the process.\nPalace have scored just once in their last six league games against the Red Devils.\nThe Eagles have are winless in all 13 of their Premier League games against Manchester United (D3 L10).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United are at home to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League next Tuesday before hosting West Brom on Saturday 7 November.

His 35th Everton appearance also triggered a new 12-month extension to his existing contract.\nDeulofeu's calm finish and two assists were also a reminder of his talents, although an appalling second-half dive, for which he was booked, showed the 21-year-old still has plenty to learn.\nMan of the Match: Arouna Kone\nManager reaction\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"Arouna Kone is just a phenomenal story. He has had one injury but it has been a career-threatening injury and it takes a long time to come back from it.\n\"We have seen a Kone that was ready to perform for the team, but I thought his overall play was outstanding, not just the goals but the way he played with others. At the end, the fans were singing his name.\"\nSunderland boss Sam Allardyce: \"The defensive frailties were just too much today and we allowed Everton to win the game comfortably in the end. If we don't sort those out, it will be a long haul over the next few months or so.\n\"I don't understand why they did it. We came here to look after Everton and we didn't play too bad in the first half at all, and for us to get it back to 2-2, that should be enough for us today. We needed to make sure Everton just couldn't score but we made it so easy for them to score three in seven minutes.\n\"I need the players to understand what an opportunity they had today. They let their emotions get carried away.\"\nStats you need to know\nThere were more goals scored in this fixture (eight) than the last five top-tier clashes between Everton and Sunderland combined (seven).\nSunderland have failed to keep a clean sheet in 11 of their last 12 Premier League matches.\nKone became the fifth Ivorian to score a Premier League hat-trick (Aruna Dindane, Didier Drogba, Salomon Kalou, Yaya Toure); more than any other African nation.\nKone's hat-trick goal was the 300th scored in this season's Premier League.\nDefoe has scored in five of his last eight Premier League appearances at Goodison Park against Everton.\nWhat next?\nEverton face a trip to West Ham on Saturday ahead of the international break, while Sunderland host Southampton, also on Saturday."

Norwich defended very well. The games before Champions League games are always difficult. But we have the character, the personality and the trust to win the game - we are not finished until the last minute.\"\nNorwich City boss Alex Neil:\n\"I thought we limited Man City to very little, but if you're going to lose a goal away to the top teams, you want it to be from a bit of quality, so to lose one to a set-piece is disappointing.\n\"Then we made mistakes at the back for the second goal and it cost us the game. If people do their jobs properly and do the basics right, the rest of our game has been good.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have lost just two of their 15 Premier League clashes with Norwich, winning eight and drawing five.\nThe Canaries have now lost four in a row in the league; they last lost four consecutive league games back in April 2014 (five in a row in total).\nRussell Martin was awarded his first ever red card in league competition in this game.\nYaya Toure has been directly involved in six goals (three goals, three assists) in his seven Premier League appearances against Norwich City.\nKevin De Bruyne has had a hand in seven goals in his seven Premier League appearances this season (scoring three, assisting four).\nManchester City have scored four goals from a corner this season; a league-high.\nWhat's up next?\nMan City look to go a step closer to qualifying for the Champions League knock-out stage as they travel to Sevilla on Tuesday, before a trip to Aston Villa on Sunday.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Swansea City 0-3 Arsenal\nArsenal kept up the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester City with a ruthless second-half dismantling of Swansea City.\nSwansea's Bafetimbi Gomis squandered the best chance of an entertaining but goalless first half.\nOlivier Giroud headed Arsenal in front soon after the restart, before Laurent Koscielny seized on an error by former Gunners goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to double their lead.\nJoel Campbell struck on his first Premier League start to seal victory and keep Arsenal, missing several key players because of injury, level on points with Manchester City, who have a superior goal difference.\nFor Swansea, the result is a setback after ending a six-game winless run against Aston Villa in their previous outing.\nReaction from the Liberty Stadium and the rest of the Premier League\nRelive the action from the Liberty Stadium\nArsenal title contenders?\nHaving had to withstand concerted Swansea pressure in the first half, Arsenal were transformed after the interval as they strolled to a convincing victory.\nThey had failed to win any of their previous three meetings with the Swans, but Arsene Wenger's side produced a clinical second 45 minutes which suggested they could sustain a serious title challenge.\nFrance international Giroud made the breakthrough with his fifth goal in six games for club and country, nodding in unmarked from Mesut Ozil's corner to score the 2,000th goal of Wenger's Arsenal tenure.\nIf Swansea's defending was slack on that occasion, it was found wanting again as Fabianski spilled a looping ball into the path of Koscielny, who had the simple task of tapping into an empty net.\nGunners coping with casualties\nArsenal's second-half stroll was particularly impressive considering Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott were added to their growing injury list during Tuesday's abject 3-0 League Cup defeat by Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.\nThe shock of that loss was particularly jolting, coming as it did after victories over Everton and Bayern Munich.\nBut the pain of defeat was perhaps less severe than the headache caused by those injuries, with Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta, David Ospina, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck and Tomas Rosicky already out.\nTheir absence paved the way for Campbell's first Premier League start, and the Costa Rican took his opportunity as he fired in firmly from Ozil's cross to add a final gloss to Arsenal's victory.\nGoalless Gomis a worry for Swansea\nGomis scored the winner on both occasions as Swansea did the double over Arsenal last season - but he is currently in the midst of a barren spell.\nThe Fance international striker had failed to score in his previous six Premier League appearances, and his loss of confidence was evident as he missed a glorious opportunity midway through the first half.\nClean through after an incisive through ball from Jonjo Shelvey, Gomis hesitantly took the ball around Petr Cech and fell under the pressure of the goalkeeper's sliding challenge, appealing in vain for a penalty as Hector Bellerin cleared.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil\nWhat they said\nSwansea City manager Garry Monk: \"There were a lot of positives in our play and we were exceptional in the first half. We should have taken the lead when we were on top.\n\"We gifted them two goals and you can't do that against any team, let alone Arsenal. I'm disappointed to lose, but I think the scoreline flatters Arsenal.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"Swansea took six points off us last year and that shows we've moved forward. The second half we were a different team.\n\"After we scored the first goal, it was all us and there was only one winner on the pitch. Joel Campbell took his goal really well and he is still a young player who had to wait for his chance.\n\"He's adapted to Europe, been in a few leagues and come back and I like his team spirit and work rate.\"\nWhat next?\nArsenal will not have much time to celebrate this result ahead of a huge week for them. They travel to Germany for Tuesday's crucial Champions League game at Bayern Munich, then host Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby at Emirates Stadium on 8 November.\nSwansea will hope to get back to winning way when they face Norwich City at Carrow Road in the Premier League on 7 November.\nThe stats you need to know\nSince making his Premier League debut in August 2012, Olivier Giroud has scored more headed goals than any other player (15).\nSwansea are now without a win in four home league games (D2 L2); their worst run under current boss Garry Monk.\nMesut Ozil has made more assists (22) than any other Premier League player since his debut in September 2013.\nLaurent Koscielny has scored in back-to-back games for the first time in his Arsenal career.\nSwansea failed to score in consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since May 2013."

His 35th Everton appearance also triggered a new 12-month extension to his existing contract.\nDeulofeu's calm finish and two assists were also a reminder of his talents, although an appalling second-half dive, for which he was booked, showed the 21-year-old still has plenty to learn.\nMan of the Match: Arouna Kone\nManager reaction\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"Arouna Kone is just a phenomenal story. He has had one injury but it has been a career-threatening injury and it takes a long time to come back from it.\n\"We have seen a Kone that was ready to perform for the team, but I thought his overall play was outstanding, not just the goals but the way he played with others. At the end, the fans were singing his name.\"\nSunderland boss Sam Allardyce: \"The defensive frailties were just too much today and we allowed Everton to win the game comfortably in the end. If we don't sort those out, it will be a long haul over the next few months or so.\n\"I don't understand why they did it. We came here to look after Everton and we didn't play too bad in the first half at all, and for us to get it back to 2-2, that should be enough for us today. We needed to make sure Everton just couldn't score but we made it so easy for them to score three in seven minutes.\n\"I need the players to understand what an opportunity they had today. They let their emotions get carried away.\"\nStats you need to know\nThere were more goals scored in this fixture (eight) than the last five top-tier clashes between Everton and Sunderland combined (seven).\nSunderland have failed to keep a clean sheet in 11 of their last 12 Premier League matches.\nKone became the fifth Ivorian to score a Premier League hat-trick (Aruna Dindane, Didier Drogba, Salomon Kalou, Yaya Toure); more than any other African nation.\nKone's hat-trick goal was the 300th scored in this season's Premier League.\nDefoe has scored in five of his last eight Premier League appearances at Goodison Park against Everton.\nWhat next?\nEverton face a trip to West Ham on Saturday ahead of the international break, while Sunderland host Southampton, also on Saturday.",

Southampton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg had little to trouble him until Tomlin and King fired shots straight at him in the closing five minutes.\nMan of the match - Graziano Pelle\nThe Italian was on target for the second time in a week, having struck the decisive goal in Wednesday's 2-1 League Cup fourth-round win over Aston Villa.\nHe found himself having to drop deeper in the second half, a side of his game many might not be too familiar with.\nPelle is rapidly turning into Southampton's key player, having scored 15 top-flight goals last season and 10 goals in his last 12 home games.\nThe stats you need to know\nSouthampton are unbeaten in their last six league meetings with Bournemouth (W5 D1).\nThe Cherries have failed to score on six of their nine visits to Southampton in the league.\nSouthampton are unbeaten at home in league competition against Bournemouth, winning seven and drawing two.\nWhat the managers said\nSouthampton's Ronald Koeman: \"The first 45 minutes was the best football so far this season. Good movement and great goals. We learned a bit from the Leicester game at 2-0 to defend better. Always an opponent will give a reaction and you have to deal with that. We lost balls and had no control. We need to do that better.\n\"In every Premier League game, even at 2-0 up is difficult. You need good defending and more control and to win every battle. Still, I think it was a very good performance.\n\"We know we can play fantastic football. If we take that and learn from the second half, we will finish in a high position.\"\nOn striker Pelle: \"Yes, he's very important to us, we know he's a very good striker, scoring goals and he's strong.\n\"In my opinion, he's one of the best in the Premier League.\"\nBournemouth's Eddie Howe: \"I thought the second half was everything we wanted the first to be. We were off the pace in the first half and Southampton played well. It was a reverse in the second but all that was missing were goals.\n\"We wanted a bit more pace after the break. We got our passing rhythm going in the second half. The overall performance and work ethic was very good.\n\"Technically we showed we can compete. Our passing and movement were to a high level. We need to cut out the mistakes.\"\nOn whether he needs to buy a new striker in January to address a lack of goals: \"The disappointing thing in the second half was we didn't have the cutting edge to create more. I wouldn't necessarily blame the strikers for that.\n\"I'm not going to say that we need to buy a new striker. It's both ends of the pitch we need to improve and we'll be working hard to do that.\"\nWhat next?\nBournemouth face a crucial home game against fellow early-season strugglers Newcastle next weekend, before a trip to Swansea.\nAs for Southampton, they visit bottom club Sunderland next before welcoming Stoke to St Mary's."

What I see from my players was good until the moment they felt it was impossible to do better.\n\"The fans are not stupid, I don't need to tell them anything. They know how much myself and the players are trying.\n\"They know why they are getting bad results. The fight goes on, but sometimes there are fights very impossible to win. You go to a fight with different ammunition. I can play against any team or manager.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on Mourinho:\n\"I feel for him. He's a great coach. I don't think anyone in this room doubts he's one of the best in the world.\n\"Things like this happen. I had a similar situation at Dortmund last year. The good thing was no one in the club was in doubt of my situation. I feel for him of course, but it's work.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJose Mourinho has lost six Premier League matches this season.

Norwich defended very well. The games before Champions League games are always difficult. But we have the character, the personality and the trust to win the game - we are not finished until the last minute.\"\nNorwich City boss Alex Neil:\n\"I thought we limited Man City to very little, but if you're going to lose a goal away to the top teams, you want it to be from a bit of quality, so to lose one to a set-piece is disappointing.\n\"Then we made mistakes at the back for the second goal and it cost us the game. If people do their jobs properly and do the basics right, the rest of our game has been good.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have lost just two of their 15 Premier League clashes with Norwich, winning eight and drawing five.\nThe Canaries have now lost four in a row in the league; they last lost four consecutive league games back in April 2014 (five in a row in total).\nRussell Martin was awarded his first ever red card in league competition in this game.\nYaya Toure has been directly involved in six goals (three goals, three assists) in his seven Premier League appearances against Norwich City.\nKevin De Bruyne has had a hand in seven goals in his seven Premier League appearances this season (scoring three, assisting four).\nManchester City have scored four goals from a corner this season; a league-high.\nWhat's up next?\nMan City look to go a step closer to qualifying for the Champions League knock-out stage as they travel to Sevilla on Tuesday, before a trip to Aston Villa on Sunday. Norwich host fellow bottom-half side Swansea on Saturday."

Manager reaction\nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho tells BBC Sport:\n\"I can't express my feelings in any way at all. You are not just here to interview me. You are also here to see the game. What I see from my players was good until the moment they felt it was impossible to do better.\n\"The fans are not stupid, I don't need to tell them anything. They know how much myself and the players are trying.\n\"They know why they are getting bad results. The fight goes on, but sometimes there are fights very impossible to win. You go to a fight with different ammunition. I can play against any team or manager.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on Mourinho:\n\"I feel for him. He's a great coach. I don't think anyone in this room doubts he's one of the best in the world.\n\"Things like this happen. I had a similar situation at Dortmund last year. The good thing was no one in the club was in doubt of my situation. I feel for him of course, but it's work.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJose Mourinho has lost six Premier League matches this season. He's never lost more in a Premier League campaign at Chelsea.\nChelsea lost their first game against Liverpool in seven Premier League meetings.\nThis is the first time Liverpool have netted more than twice at Stamford Bridge in a league game since December 1989.\nPhilippe Coutinho ended a run of 710 minutes without a Premier League goal.\nThis is the first Premier League game since Middlesbrough beat Manchester City 8-1 in 2008 in which a Brazilian has scored for both sides.\nJames Milner, 29, made his 400th Premier League appearance, becoming the third youngest player to reach the milestone after Wayne Rooney and Gareth Barry.\nWhat's up next?\nBoth sides head into European competition this week.\nChelsea are at home to Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League on Wednesday in a game they can't afford to lose if they are to advance from Group G.\nThe following night Liverpool go to Rubin Kazan in the Europa League, looking for their first win after three draws in Group B.",

It was an excellent performance from us - as good as we have been all year.\n\"United - and it doesn't happen very often - were probably fortunate to get a point.\n\"It was a shame we didn't win it but with the run we've been on we needed to take something, so the point was important for us. We got back to the real Crystal Palace today.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"We did not keep the ball. That's a very important factor and because of that we didn't create too many chances. I have to say I can't complain about the result.\n\"[Not scoring for a third consecutive game] is a big concern but I already said that after the second match, especially against Middlesbrough, because we created many chances but did not finish.\n\"Today we didn't create so many chances so it's more difficult. When you don't keep the ball you can't create chances.\"\nStats you need to know\nLouis van Gaal's side have lost only one of their last seven league games (W4 D2 L1), keeping four clean sheets in the process.\nPalace have scored just once in their last six league games against the Red Devils.\nThe Eagles have are winless in all 13 of their Premier League games against Manchester United (D3 L10).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United are at home to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League next Tuesday before hosting West Brom on Saturday 7 November. Crystal Palace travel to Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool a week on Sunday."

We should have taken the lead when we were on top.\n\"We gifted them two goals and you can't do that against any team, let alone Arsenal. I'm disappointed to lose, but I think the scoreline flatters Arsenal.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"Swansea took six points off us last year and that shows we've moved forward. The second half we were a different team.\n\"After we scored the first goal, it was all us and there was only one winner on the pitch. Joel Campbell took his goal really well and he is still a young player who had to wait for his chance.\n\"He's adapted to Europe, been in a few leagues and come back and I like his team spirit and work rate.\"\nWhat next?\nArsenal will not have much time to celebrate this result ahead of a huge week for them. They travel to Germany for Tuesday's crucial Champions League game at Bayern Munich, then host Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby at Emirates Stadium on 8 November.\nSwansea will hope to get back to winning way when they face Norwich City at Carrow Road in the Premier League on 7 November.\nThe stats you need to know\nSince making his Premier League debut in August 2012, Olivier Giroud has scored more headed goals than any other player (15).\nSwansea are now without a win in four home league games (D2 L2); their worst run under current boss Garry Monk.\nMesut Ozil has made more assists (22) than any other Premier League player since his debut in September 2013.\nLaurent Koscielny has scored in back-to-back games for the first time in his Arsenal career.\nSwansea failed to score in consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since May 2013.",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 2-0 West Brom\nJesse Lingard scored his first Manchester United goal as Louis van Gaal's side beat West Brom.\nWinger Lingard, 22, curled home from the edge of the box early in the second half to give the hosts the lead.\nSubstitute Saido Berahino missed a superb opportunity to equalise late on when he headed over from close range.\nJuan Mata then made the win safe from the penalty spot late on after Anthony Martial was fouled by Gareth McAuley, who was sent off.\nThe victory keeps Manchester United fourth in the Premier League, while West Brom are 13th.\nIt was also a first win in three league games for the hosts, who have not conceded in 550 minutes.\nRelive Manchester United's win over West Brom\nSee reaction to this and all the day's Premier League games\n'Attack, attack, attack'\nManchester United fans are struggling to warm to Louis van Gaal's defensive style of football, with chants of \"attack, attack, attack\" heard at Old Trafford during Tuesday's Champions League win against CSKA Moscow.\nOnly the Baggies had attempted fewer shots (109) than Manchester United (110) prior to Saturday's game, but Van Gaal indicated he had no intention of abandoning his conservative approach by naming two defensive midfielders - Bastian Schweinsteiger and Michael Carrick - in his starting line-up.\nThe outcome was, perhaps, predictable, as the hosts, for the most part, lacked the creativity to break down their defence-minded visitors. Only one shot on target was registered in the first half, when Martial shot straight at Boaz Myhill.\nHowever, a moment of quality from Lingard changed the game.\nThe youngster's goal forced West Brom to abandon their cautious approach, opening up more gaps at the back for the home side to exploit, ultimately leading to the moment when Martial got through on goal in stoppage time, causing McAuley to give away the decisive penalty.\nA star is born?\nLingard put in a man-of-the-match performance against CSKA Moscow in midweek and he impressed once again.\nHis goal lifted an encounter that was threatening to end in a dull draw, taking one touch to control a clearing header, before finding the far corner with his second.\nLingard has spent recent seasons on loan at Championship clubs Birmingham City and Derby County, but is now keeping Memphis Depay on the bench. If Lingard keeps up his recent form, the Dutch winger is likely to have to be patient for his next opportunity to stake a claim for a place in the first team.\nMore needed once again from Rooney\nRooney got the winning goal against CSKA Moscow to move into joint second alongside Denis Law in Manchester United's all-time scorers list with 237 goals.\nYet his return in the Premier League this season has been disappointing, with this blank against West Brom extending his record to two goals in 11 games.\nThe England international lined up just behind Martial and, while he produced one or two moments of quality, he failed to register a single effort on target.\nUnited fans appreciated his efforts, applauding him off the pitch when he was substituted late on, but they will surely be keen for him to start posing a greater threat in the final third sooner rather than later.\nMan of the match - Jesse Lingard\nWhat the managers said\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal tells BBC Sport: \"Everybody knows who has played football that the most difficult way to score is against a very defensive team. The space is only on the wings and we have tried to do that.\n\"The only way you can play against such a defensive, organised team is the way we do it, you need patience. In the second half West Brom are more tired and the chances come. The goal changed the game, we had more space. Then you can see the qualities of Anthony Martial, and we score the second goal out of his actions.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis tells BBC Sport: \"After half-time the game opened up and we got more into it but the first goal is poor from us. It's a great finish. After that I thought we got into the game and the chance [for Saido Berahino] - if there's a guy you want it to drop to then it's Saido.\n\"I'm disappointed for the players - most of my sides don't lack effort and commitment - we've just switched off and been punished. Gareth McAuley [for the red card and penalty] should have stayed on his feet and if the kid scores, the kid scores.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLingard's strike was the first United had scored from outside the box in the Premier League since December 2014 (Juan Mata v Stoke).\nSince debuting for Manchester United, Juan Mata has been involved in more PL goals than any other player at the club (30).\nUnited have kept eight clean sheets in the Premier League this season already - they kept 11 in the whole of last season.\nTony Pulis has lost 11 of his 13 Premier League games against Manchester United (W1 D1).\nManchester United have lost just one of their last 14 Premier League games at Old Trafford (W10 D3 L1).\nWhat next?\nManchester United travel to Watford in the Premier League on 21 November, while West Brom host Arsenal on the same day."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 0-1 Newcastle United\nAyoze Perez's first-half goal earned Newcastle a fortunate first Premier League away win of the season as they leapfrogged Bournemouth in the table.\nPerez scored from Newcastle's only shot on target, with Adam Federici failing to stop his tame effort.\nThe result was very harsh on a dominant Bournemouth, who were denied by a string of brilliant saves from Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot.\nThe Cherries, six league games without a win, slip into the bottom three.\nEddie Howe's side, promoted to the top tier from the Championship last season, could have done little more to win in the game. Newcastle little less.\nBut the hosts were let down by poor finishing and a man-of-the-match display by Elliot as they chalked up 20 efforts on goal to Newcastle's two.\nRelive Newcastle's fortunate win\nFollow all Saturday's action and reaction from the later games\nNewcastle complete smash and grab\nRarely can Newcastle have come away with a victory after threatening the opposition's goal on so few occasions.\nAside from Perez's crucial strike, Fabricio Coloccini's second-half header was the Magpies' only other effort on goal, and they spent most of the game defending as Bournemouth poured forward from the flanks.\nBut having failed to score in a goalless draw against Stoke last weekend where Potters goalkeeper Jack Butland was equally brilliant, Newcastle boss Steve McClaren may feel that his side warranted some fortune.\nRepublic of Ireland international Elliot was an injury doubt for the game, yet played a telling part in what could be a critical win, their first in 13 away league games.\nHarsh lesson for Howe's side\nBournemouth's bright beginning to the season has tailed off in recent weeks after crucial injuries to key players such as Callum Wilson, Tommy Elphick and Max Gradel.\nSeveral pundits have suggested that they should alter their style but another energetic performance from his team ensured that at no point did Newcastle have any sort of control.\nMidfielder Harry Arter, Gosling and Ritchie were indefatigable as the Cherries out-ran and out-passed their opponents. And the attacking threat was relentless as they peppered Newcastle's goal from both flanks, chalking up 16 corners to Newcastle's none.\nJoshua King was twice denied by Elliot, also stopping Ritchie's diving header. But his effort to deny Gosling was perhaps his finest moment when he threw himself to his right to prevent the midfielder scoring against his former club from close range.\nAfter putting so much energy into the performance, it was no wonder that Bournemouth eventually tired. At the end, some of their players looked mentally and physically worn out, but now they must gather themselves for the international break realising that, at least in terms of performance, they are on the right track.\nOn the basis of this game, only their finishing can be improved upon.\nMan of the match - Rob Elliot\nManager reaction\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was very cruel for us today, we were excellent and controlled the game from start to finish. The goal was against the run of play and the frustrating thing for us was we kept knocking on the door and we felt it would come but it just wasn't meant to be.\n\"I can't fault the quality of the performance, the only missing thing was the goals on top of it. The last part of the game we lost belief, but apart from that I'm very pleased with the players. There's a lot of positives in the game, we can't dwell on the defeat.\n\"My job is always important to pick the players up and keep believing. We've been through spells like this before. This is our biggest challenge, we need to make sure we don't lose the faith in what we're doing.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve McClaren on Rob Elliot: \"Rob was a big doubt and we needed him today. He's been injured and not trained, and I like him. He's a talker and experienced.\n\"We've played better than that, you can't explain football sometimes. We've played far better, created chances and been denied by goalkeepers but this week we had one bit of quality for the goal and the rest of the time we were defending for our lives and relied on our goalkeeper.\n\"Bournemouth will be disappointed with their finishing but we got the luck today and we had a great defensive performance to get a clean sheet which is what you need sometimes.\"\nStats you need to know\nBournemouth have only kept one clean sheet in their 12 Premier League games this season.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum has been directly involved in eight of Newcastle's 13 goals this season in the Premier League.\nBournemouth's 20 shots were their most in a Premier League game this season.\nTheir 67.53% possession figure in the defeat was also their highest figure in a Premier League game this season.\nThe Cherries out-ran Newcastle by 119 km to 114 km, and have done so in each of their league games this term.\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Bournemouth travel to Swansea before hosting Everton the following Saturday. Newcastle are at home to Leicester before a trip to Crystal Palace.",

He needs a solution, his side have just one win in 15 league games.\nThe Black Cats started the day with the lowest possession on average in the league (41.7%), and with just 35% against Southampton, they seem inept at building attacks to ease pressure on their back four.\nOne-way traffic always looked like telling and when MVila - one of Sunderland's better players on the day - slid in as Bertrand posed little threat, Tadic whipped the winner left-footed into the corner, ensuring the Saints remain unbeaten on the road this season.\nSaints on a roll\nAllardyce was frustrated his side were not given a penalty for a Maya Yoshida handball, but such an award would have been harsh on the defender and his team.\nSouthampton were dominant - playing 555 passes to their hosts' 306 - and they could have been well ahead at the break as both Tadic and Sadio Mane saw efforts well saved by Costel Pantilimon.\nHaving taken just two points from nine to start the season, the south coast club have now built momentum and by the time they face Stoke after the international break, will have gone more than two months without a defeat.\nWithout European commitments Southampton perhaps have an advantage on those chasing a top four place around them and more somewhat ugly and efficient wins like this will certainly not harm their cause.\nMan of the match\nManager reaction\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"We are playing with fear and we need to get rid of that. In the end we have gifted it to Southampton. We need to pass the ball better. Our passing was poor and I think it's the fear of the position we are in. It could have been a point. We have to do better and cut out the silly mistakes. At the moment we are not good enough.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"I think if we reach European football, it would be like we had won the title. Of course it's possible. We have the experience from last year. But we have potential, we have qualities, in my opinion, we have a squad now to fight for that. Top four? It's maybe too difficult. Qualifying for Europe means maybe seventh place - like last season.\"\nUp next\nSouthampton will look to continue their fine form with a home game against Stoke when the international break is over while Sunderland must stew on defeat for more than two weeks before travelling to Crystal Palace for a Monday night fixture.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Stoke City 1-0 Chelsea\nJose Mourinho's troubles increased in his absence with Chelsea's manager powerless as his Premier League champions slumped to another damaging defeat at Stoke City.\nMourinho was forced to watch from Chelsea's team hotel as he served a one-match stadium ban for his behaviour towards match officials in the 2-1 defeat at West Ham United in October.\nChelsea's backroom team took charge but were left tasting defeat once more as they lost their seventh game out of 12 in the league this season, to be left in a lowly 16th position by Marko Arnautovic's acrobatic 53rd-minute finish.\nMourinho will have been cursing Chelsea's luck as they deserved a point, Pedro hitting a post and Loic Remy stumbling as he went around Stoke City's outstanding keeper Jack Butland - with penalty appeals ignored by referee Anthony Taylor.\nButland also saved well from Ramires and Diego Costa, but Stoke's determination and superb defensive organisation won the day in a thunderous atmosphere in The Potteries.\nMourinho, who once more received vociferous support from Chelsea's fans throughout, will be back in the technical area for the home game against Norwich City on 21 November - left with a fight to somehow guide his side away from the bottom end of the table.\nRelive Chelsea's defeat by Stoke\nSee reaction to all of Saturday's Premier League games\nWas Mourinho missed?\nAs Mourinho watched events unfold from Chelsea's team hotel, his trusted lieutenants took charge in his absence.\nSteve Holland was first out into the technical area giving instructions before the combustible Rui Faria took his turn - until the pair were out together directing operations.\nLittle was seen of Silvino Louro, who stayed in his seat while Faria made notes and Holland was seen with his iPad as Chelsea fought to salvage something from the game.\nWith their manager banned from being in attendance, Chelsea played with real attacking verve in the first half without finding the final product and chased an equaliser with real determination.\nThis was not a team lacking effort or seemingly at odds with their manager - this was a game where they deserved a point but were unable to find the moment that made the difference.\nMourinho was present in some form as hundreds of Chelsea fans wore masks bearing the image of their manager to compensate for his absence.\nAnd, as they did during the Champions League win against Dynamo Kiev, Chelsea's fans made it clear they are still right behind their manager.\nAs the game entered its final seconds, the section of the Britannia housing Chelsea's supporters echoed to Mourinho's name once more. They clearly want \"The Special One\" to guide them out of this current crisis.\nButland is England class\nAsmir Begovic's presence in Chelsea's goal was proof of just how highly Stoke City manager Mark Hughes rated his deputy Jack Butland.\nHughes was comfortable accepting Chelsea's \u00a38m offer for Begovic in the summer because he knew he had a replacement of real quality in the 22-year-old.\nAnd, as he has all season, Butland showed exactly why Hughes felt it was time to make him Stoke City's first-choice keeper with another impressive display.\nButland showed great agility to stretch to tip over a dipping drive from Ramires in the first half, as well as blocking an angled drive from Diego Costa with his legs.\nButland has been given a taste of England action and with friendlies coming up against Spain in Alicante on Friday 13 November and France at Wembley the following Tuesday, he should get a further opportunity to confirm the goalkeeping position behind Joe Hart is in safe hands.\nStoke on the up\nHughes was left mystified as his side made a slow start to the season, but this result means they have only lost once in nine games.\nStoke's boss will be eyeing up another top-10 Premier League finish after Chelsea left The Potteries beaten for the second time inside a fortnight, following their defeat on penalties in the Capital One Cup.\nBacked by fervent support inside one of the Premier League's most atmospheric arenas, Stoke showed trademark determination and resilience to keep Chelsea at bay in the first half before mixing real purpose and defensive solidity to carve out the win.\nHughes had a tough act to follow to build on what Tony Pulis left behind at Stoke but now, in his third season, this is very much his team and - the blip of that defeat at home to Watford apart - they are now back to their best.\nHe has added the flourishes of \u00a312m record signing Xherdan Shaqiri to Stoke's concrete-clad willpower and the results are impressive.\nMan of the match - Ryan Shawcross\nWhat they said:\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We displayed great character today, all the qualities you need to compete against one of the best teams in Europe. They have world-class players.\n\"We are really delighted. We have beaten them twice in a short period of time.\n\"Chelsea played well today. They are struggling to get positive results but they will turn it around. Maybe they won't go up against sides as committed as we are every week.\"\nChelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic: \"We definitely did enough to get a result here, but when things aren't going your way you don't get the luck you deserve.\n\"We hit the post, we slipped over when we had open goals, we are making things hard for ourselves.\"\nOn Mourinho's stadium ban, he added: \"Jose did the pre-match talk at the hotel and that was it.\"\nAsked if he was concerned that there may be a change from above, Begovic said: \"That is out of our hands, we are behind the manager - you can see that from our performances. We think he is the right man and someone we work hard for.\n\"His spirit and his presence is always there, we wanted to get a result for him.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJose Mourinho has lost seven league games in a campaign for the first time as a manager.\nMarko Arnautovic scored his first league goal at the Britannia Stadium since May 2014 (v Fulham).\nChelsea have not kept a clean sheet in any of their last eight away games in the Premier League.\nThe last time Chelsea lost seven of their opening 12 games in a top-flight season they were relegated (1978-79).\nOnly one side in Premier League history has finished in the top six having taken 11 points or fewer from their first 12 games - Aston Villa in 2003/04.\nThe Potters have kept four clean sheets in their last five PL games, having gone eight without one prior to that run.\nWhat next?\nChelsea host Norwich on 21 November, while Stoke travel to Southampton on the same day."

We can only hope that he will be OK and it is not going to be long-term, but we have to wait for the scan.\"\nWithout Payet, the Hammers struggled to break down the Everton defence, although Moses impressed down the right flank.\nThe threat Moses posed was as much to do with his pace and industry as any silky skills, but he was behind his side's goal and also got on the end of crosses when they were put in from the opposite flank.\nBut Andy Carroll was never able to make his presence felt in the box and, too often, the Hammers' promising build-up play went to waste.\nMan of the match - Everton's Gerard Deulofeu\nManager reaction\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We are never happy with one point, especially at home, but I was happy with the performance.\n\"We needed that kind of positive reaction after what happened last week at Watford.\n\"Everton deserved a point but in my opinion we were slightly better than them.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"Once we got to grips with the intensity West Ham play with, I thought we were very strong, especially in the second half.\n\"Our concentration levels were very high once we had conceded, and we worked very hard as a unit defensively.\n\"We had quality going forward too and it seemed the winning goal would come but we just could not find the final pass.\"\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Everton host Aston Villa and West Ham make the short trip to north London to play Tottenham.\nThe stats you need to know\nRomelu Lukaku has scored seven goals in seven games against West Ham for Everton (five in the Premier League, two in the FA Cup).\nLukaku's goal equalled the most number of goals he has scored against a single opponent in the Premier League; he has also scored five against Newcastle and Liverpool.\nManuel Lanzini is the first West Ham player since Bobby Zamora in 2006-07 to score against both Merseyside clubs in the same season.\nOnly David Silva (six) and Mesut Ozil (nine) have more Premier League assists this season than Gerard Deulofeu (five).\nThe Hammers haven't beaten the Toffees in the league in 15 attempts (D5 L10), their last win coming in April 2007 courtesy of a Bobby Zamora goal.\nEverton have lost just two of their last 10 Premier League away games (W4 D4 L2).",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Aston Villa 0-0 Manchester City\nBottom club Aston Villa held leaders Manchester City to a goalless draw in Remi Garde's first game as manager.\nDisplaying a new-found defensive solidity, the hosts restricted City well although Raheem Sterling should have scored with a close-range header.\nFernando saw a late header hit the bar for the visitors, while substitute Fabian Delph's low shot rolled just wide.\nVilla were less effective going forward and did not manage a shot on target.\nHowever, they will welcome their first point since August against a free-scoring City side who were held to their second successive 0-0 draw away from home in the Premier League.\nThe result ends a disastrous run of seven straight league defeats for the Villans, while Manuel Pellegrini's side remain level on points with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League following the Gunners' 1-1 draw with Tottenham.\nDid City miss an attacking spearhead?\nManchester City had 13 shots on goal in total - 10 of which came in the second half - but far too often they appeared to lack a figurehead up front.\nWilfried Bony was substituted with a hamstring injury after 25 minutes, but rather than send on a like-for-like striking replacement in Kelechi Iheanacho they pushed Sterling and Kevin de Bruyne further forward and put Bony's replacement Jesus Navas out wide.\nThey still created enough chances to win the game, but a combination of poor finishing, good goalkeeping and some new manager luck denied them.\nSterling will be disappointed not to score when clean through, but the England forward elected to cut inside on to his right foot and that allowed two defenders to get back and clear the danger.\nThe \u00a349m signing also saw a point-blank header hit goalkeeper Brad Guzan on the forehead and deflect wide, while De Bruyne stabbed wide following a good cross from Navas.\nCity almost nicked it when former Villa captain Delph, who was booed when he came on, went close moments after Fernando had struck the bar in a frenetic end to the game.\nRude manners from Gestede?\nRudy Gestede provided more attacking spark for Aston Villa in a six-minute cameo at the end than the rest of his team-mates put together.\nHe angered City when he returned the ball to Joe Hart via a heavy throw-in and the goalkeeper could only deflect it wide for a corner.\nThe striker ignored City's reaction and, from the resulting corner, shot just over the bar.\nMan of the match - Ciaran Clark (Aston Villa)\nThe stats that matter\nAston Villa have failed to score in six of their last eight league meetings with Man City.\nCity have lost just one of their past eight away Premier League games (W5 D2), keeping six clean sheets in that run.\nHowever, City are winless in three Premier League away games (D2 L1).\nThe Villans kept their first PL clean sheet since the opening day of the season, and first at home this season.\nVilla failed to register a single shot on target for the first time in a Premier League match since August 2014 (v Newcastle).\nMan City have allowed their opponents just 28 shots on target this season, fewer than any other team in the Premier League.\nVilla kept their first clean sheet against Man City since January 2011.\nWhat the managers said\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"It was a nice experience and a fantastic atmosphere. It was a tough game. I can be vey happy with my team today, I saw smiles on their faces.\n\"When you play with sadness it does not help you. I tried in the three training sessions we had to deliver my message. Nobody expected we were going to score two or three goals. The difference between the two teams before was huge. Making sure we were well organised defensively was my priority.\n\"Some of the players who didn't start today had problems during the week. Nobody will play because he's French or Spanish or British. I saw in training how good or bad they were.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"We're disappointed with the draw. I think we did enough to win the game. They had just one shot on our goal, we had three or four clear chances to score.\n\"Villa defended very well with nine or 10 players. We tried to break that line. Two or three of our chances were unlucky. This happens in football.\n\"Without Bony and without Sergio Aguero we don't have a player who plays inside the box. We have to try and work without them.\"\nWhat next?\nAston Villa have a difficult, but winnable, couple of games ahead of them in November. They visit Everton after the international break on 21 November before welcoming Watford the following week.\nIt is also a big month for Manchester City, who play Liverpool on 21 November before facing Juventus and Southampton, although the two Premier League games are at home."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Stoke City 1-0 Chelsea\nJose Mourinho's troubles increased in his absence with Chelsea's manager powerless as his Premier League champions slumped to another damaging defeat at Stoke City.\nMourinho was forced to watch from Chelsea's team hotel as he served a one-match stadium ban for his behaviour towards match officials in the 2-1 defeat at West Ham United in October.\nChelsea's backroom team took charge but were left tasting defeat once more as they lost their seventh game out of 12 in the league this season, to be left in a lowly 16th position by Marko Arnautovic's acrobatic 53rd-minute finish.\nMourinho will have been cursing Chelsea's luck as they deserved a point, Pedro hitting a post and Loic Remy stumbling as he went around Stoke City's outstanding keeper Jack Butland - with penalty appeals ignored by referee Anthony Taylor.\nButland also saved well from Ramires and Diego Costa, but Stoke's determination and superb defensive organisation won the day in a thunderous atmosphere in The Potteries.\nMourinho, who once more received vociferous support from Chelsea's fans throughout, will be back in the technical area for the home game against Norwich City on 21 November - left with a fight to somehow guide his side away from the bottom end of the table.\nRelive Chelsea's defeat by Stoke\nSee reaction to all of Saturday's Premier League games\nWas Mourinho missed?\nAs Mourinho watched events unfold from Chelsea's team hotel, his trusted lieutenants took charge in his absence.\nSteve Holland was first out into the technical area giving instructions before the combustible Rui Faria took his turn - until the pair were out together directing operations.\nLittle was seen of Silvino Louro, who stayed in his seat while Faria made notes and Holland was seen with his iPad as Chelsea fought to salvage something from the game.\nWith their manager banned from being in attendance, Chelsea played with real attacking verve in the first half without finding the final product and chased an equaliser with real determination.\nThis was not a team lacking effort or seemingly at odds with their manager - this was a game where they deserved a point but were unable to find the moment that made the difference.\nMourinho was present in some form as hundreds of Chelsea fans wore masks bearing the image of their manager to compensate for his absence.\nAnd, as they did during the Champions League win against Dynamo Kiev, Chelsea's fans made it clear they are still right behind their manager.\nAs the game entered its final seconds, the section of the Britannia housing Chelsea's supporters echoed to Mourinho's name once more. They clearly want \"The Special One\" to guide them out of this current crisis.\nButland is England class\nAsmir Begovic's presence in Chelsea's goal was proof of just how highly Stoke City manager Mark Hughes rated his deputy Jack Butland.\nHughes was comfortable accepting Chelsea's \u00a38m offer for Begovic in the summer because he knew he had a replacement of real quality in the 22-year-old.\nAnd, as he has all season, Butland showed exactly why Hughes felt it was time to make him Stoke City's first-choice keeper with another impressive display.\nButland showed great agility to stretch to tip over a dipping drive from Ramires in the first half, as well as blocking an angled drive from Diego Costa with his legs.\nButland has been given a taste of England action and with friendlies coming up against Spain in Alicante on Friday 13 November and France at Wembley the following Tuesday, he should get a further opportunity to confirm the goalkeeping position behind Joe Hart is in safe hands.\nStoke on the up\nHughes was left mystified as his side made a slow start to the season, but this result means they have only lost once in nine games.\nStoke's boss will be eyeing up another top-10 Premier League finish after Chelsea left The Potteries beaten for the second time inside a fortnight, following their defeat on penalties in the Capital One Cup.\nBacked by fervent support inside one of the Premier League's most atmospheric arenas, Stoke showed trademark determination and resilience to keep Chelsea at bay in the first half before mixing real purpose and defensive solidity to carve out the win.\nHughes had a tough act to follow to build on what Tony Pulis left behind at Stoke but now, in his third season, this is very much his team and - the blip of that defeat at home to Watford apart - they are now back to their best.\nHe has added the flourishes of \u00a312m record signing Xherdan Shaqiri to Stoke's concrete-clad willpower and the results are impressive.\nMan of the match - Ryan Shawcross\nWhat they said:\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We displayed great character today, all the qualities you need to compete against one of the best teams in Europe. They have world-class players.\n\"We are really delighted. We have beaten them twice in a short period of time.\n\"Chelsea played well today. They are struggling to get positive results but they will turn it around. Maybe they won't go up against sides as committed as we are every week.\"\nChelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic: \"We definitely did enough to get a result here, but when things aren't going your way you don't get the luck you deserve.\n\"We hit the post, we slipped over when we had open goals, we are making things hard for ourselves.\"\nOn Mourinho's stadium ban, he added: \"Jose did the pre-match talk at the hotel and that was it.\"\nAsked if he was concerned that there may be a change from above, Begovic said: \"That is out of our hands, we are behind the manager - you can see that from our performances. We think he is the right man and someone we work hard for.\n\"His spirit and his presence is always there, we wanted to get a result for him.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJose Mourinho has lost seven league games in a campaign for the first time as a manager.\nMarko Arnautovic scored his first league goal at the Britannia Stadium since May 2014 (v Fulham).\nChelsea have not kept a clean sheet in any of their last eight away games in the Premier League.\nThe last time Chelsea lost seven of their opening 12 games in a top-flight season they were relegated (1978-79).\nOnly one side in Premier League history has finished in the top six having taken 11 points or fewer from their first 12 games - Aston Villa in 2003/04.\nThe Potters have kept four clean sheets in their last five PL games, having gone eight without one prior to that run.\nWhat next?\nChelsea host Norwich on 21 November, while Stoke travel to Southampton on the same day.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Norwich City 1-0 Swansea City\nNorwich City arrested a run of four league defeats as Jonny Howson's goal earned a scrappy victory over Swansea.\nThe midfielder tapped in his first goal of the season after Dieumerci Mbokani headed a corner back across goal.\nSwansea hit the bar through Gylfi Sigurdsson's clever scooped attempt from Wayne Routledge's cross.\nBut Norwich held firm to record their first clean sheet of the season and condemn Swansea to a fifth defeat in eight games.\nThe win moves Alex Neil's side up to 15th in the table, and they are now just one point and one place behind their opponents.\nFor Swansea, defeat continues a poor run that has seen them slip from fourth in the table at the end of August, and will put renewed pressure on manager Garry Monk to address the worst spell of his tenure.\nRelive all the action from Carrow Road\nSee reaction to this and the day's other Premier League games\nCanaries end abject home run\nGoing into the match, the Canaries had won just one and lost six of their last eight home games.\nBut though this was far from a classic home performance - with the hosts enjoying just 33% of possession - Norwich were deserving winners as they created the clearer chances.\nIn a dire first half, they fashioned the sole clear opportunity, with Cameron Jerome heading just over from the excellent Howson's free-kick after 15 minutes.\nAnd they could have added a second as Swansea folded late on, with Robbie Brady firing wide from a narrow angle and Wes Hoolahan forcing a fine save from Lukasz Fabianski with a venomous drive.\nSwansea's trident blunted\nSigurdsson's clever effort aside, this was a desperately disappointing performance from Swansea, who failed to muster a single shot on target despite having two-thirds of possession.\nAnd Monk will be particularly concerned by the continuing ineffectiveness of attacking trio Jefferson Montero, Andre Ayew and Bafetimbi Gomis.\nThey were superb as Swansea went unbeaten in August, with winger Ayew and striker Gomis netting seven goals between them and Montero tormenting full-backs with his direct running.\nBut they have only managed two goals between them in the seven games since and here again all three were a pale imitation of their best.\nMontero was substituted after 62 minutes of another quiet display, while Gomis was marshalled out of the game by Norwich centre-backs Ryan Bennett and Sebastien Bassong, and failed to find the target with any of his five shots.\nMan of the match - Jonny Howson\nWhat they said\nNorwich City manager Alex Neil: \"It certainly wasn't one of our best performances of the season, but we created the best chances in the game and kept it tight at the back.\n\"We changed our style, which I felt was necessary because we haven't been keeping enough clean sheets. I thought the lads responded well to that, though conceding possession at home is not something we are used to.\n\"I'm really delighted for the players. Our confidence has never been in question, but we needed to ensure we got points on the board.\"\nSwansea City manager Garry Monk: \"It's very frustrating. We had total control up until the goal, but unfortunately one lapse of concentration has cost us dearly again and it's been the story of the last couple of weeks.\n\"It was a difficult game, but our intention was right. We knew we might only get one or two chances. But we got caught with a sucker punch against the run of play. We totally dominated Norwich with the ball and didn't allow them anything other than the goal.\n\"We have work to do now. We have to look and assess where we are.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJonny Howson's goal was his first in his last 31 Premier League games, with his last coming back in October 2013 against Arsenal.\nIt was Norwich's first headed goal in the top flight this season.\nSwansea are now without a clean sheet in six Premier League games, their worst run since August 2014, when they went seven matches without a shutout.\nThey have won just one of their last 16 away trips to Carrow Road in all competitions (W1 D3 L12).\nWhat's next?\nSwansea take on Bournemouth at home on Saturday 21 November, while Norwich visit Chelsea on the same day."

Only one shot on target was registered in the first half, when Martial shot straight at Boaz Myhill.\nHowever, a moment of quality from Lingard changed the game.\nThe youngster's goal forced West Brom to abandon their cautious approach, opening up more gaps at the back for the home side to exploit, ultimately leading to the moment when Martial got through on goal in stoppage time, causing McAuley to give away the decisive penalty.\nA star is born?\nLingard put in a man-of-the-match performance against CSKA Moscow in midweek and he impressed once again.\nHis goal lifted an encounter that was threatening to end in a dull draw, taking one touch to control a clearing header, before finding the far corner with his second.\nLingard has spent recent seasons on loan at Championship clubs Birmingham City and Derby County, but is now keeping Memphis Depay on the bench. If Lingard keeps up his recent form, the Dutch winger is likely to have to be patient for his next opportunity to stake a claim for a place in the first team.\nMore needed once again from Rooney\nRooney got the winning goal against CSKA Moscow to move into joint second alongside Denis Law in Manchester United's all-time scorers list with 237 goals.\nYet his return in the Premier League this season has been disappointing, with this blank against West Brom extending his record to two goals in 11 games.\nThe England international lined up just behind Martial and, while he produced one or two moments of quality, he failed to register a single effort on target.\nUnited fans appreciated his efforts, applauding him off the pitch when he was substituted late on, but they will surely be keen for him to start posing a greater threat in the final third sooner rather than later.\nMan of the match - Jesse Lingard\nWhat the managers said\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal tells BBC Sport: \"Everybody knows who has played football that the most difficult way to score is against a very defensive team. The space is only on the wings and we have tried to do that.\n\"The only way you can play against such a defensive, organised team is the way we do it, you need patience. In the second half West Brom are more tired and the chances come. The goal changed the game, we had more space. Then you can see the qualities of Anthony Martial, and we score the second goal out of his actions.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis tells BBC Sport: \"After half-time the game opened up and we got more into it but the first goal is poor from us. It's a great finish. After that I thought we got into the game and the chance [for Saido Berahino] - if there's a guy you want it to drop to then it's Saido.\n\"I'm disappointed for the players - most of my sides don't lack effort and commitment - we've just switched off and been punished. Gareth McAuley [for the red card and penalty] should have stayed on his feet and if the kid scores, the kid scores.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLingard's strike was the first United had scored from outside the box in the Premier League since December 2014 (Juan Mata v Stoke).\nSince debuting for Manchester United, Juan Mata has been involved in more PL goals than any other player at the club (30).\nUnited have kept eight clean sheets in the Premier League this season already - they kept 11 in the whole of last season.\nTony Pulis has lost 11 of his 13 Premier League games against Manchester United (W1 D1).\nManchester United have lost just one of their last 14 Premier League games at Old Trafford (W10 D3 L1).\nWhat next?\nManchester United travel to Watford in the Premier League on 21 November, while West Brom host Arsenal on the same day.",

In the end I think it's a good 1-1.\n\"Kieran Gibbs' movement is good. His timing in the box is good. Sometimes when he gets into a position he doesn't believe he can score.\n\"What this championship shows is that you have to fight 200% in every game for a result, you've seen that in all the games today. It shows it will be down to the team that can find the mental resource in every game.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"The way we played we should feel very proud. The effort was brilliant. The level we showed and the commitment was fantastic. It's the way we want to carry on.\n\"In six days we've played three matches, maybe we felt it in the final minutes. We need to recognise we are a very young team. This experience is very important.\n\"We need to show we are maturing. The level we have today is good, we need to show more and to improve. It's early to set a limit or to expect a lot of things.\"\nWhat next?\nArsenal visit West Brom and Norwich in the Premier League after the international break, while Tottenham have home London derbies against West Ham and Chelsea to look forward to."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Norwich City 1-0 Swansea City\nNorwich City arrested a run of four league defeats as Jonny Howson's goal earned a scrappy victory over Swansea.\nThe midfielder tapped in his first goal of the season after Dieumerci Mbokani headed a corner back across goal.\nSwansea hit the bar through Gylfi Sigurdsson's clever scooped attempt from Wayne Routledge's cross.\nBut Norwich held firm to record their first clean sheet of the season and condemn Swansea to a fifth defeat in eight games.\nThe win moves Alex Neil's side up to 15th in the table, and they are now just one point and one place behind their opponents.\nFor Swansea, defeat continues a poor run that has seen them slip from fourth in the table at the end of August, and will put renewed pressure on manager Garry Monk to address the worst spell of his tenure.\nRelive all the action from Carrow Road\nSee reaction to this and the day's other Premier League games\nCanaries end abject home run\nGoing into the match, the Canaries had won just one and lost six of their last eight home games.\nBut though this was far from a classic home performance - with the hosts enjoying just 33% of possession - Norwich were deserving winners as they created the clearer chances.\nIn a dire first half, they fashioned the sole clear opportunity, with Cameron Jerome heading just over from the excellent Howson's free-kick after 15 minutes.\nAnd they could have added a second as Swansea folded late on, with Robbie Brady firing wide from a narrow angle and Wes Hoolahan forcing a fine save from Lukasz Fabianski with a venomous drive.\nSwansea's trident blunted\nSigurdsson's clever effort aside, this was a desperately disappointing performance from Swansea, who failed to muster a single shot on target despite having two-thirds of possession.\nAnd Monk will be particularly concerned by the continuing ineffectiveness of attacking trio Jefferson Montero, Andre Ayew and Bafetimbi Gomis.\nThey were superb as Swansea went unbeaten in August, with winger Ayew and striker Gomis netting seven goals between them and Montero tormenting full-backs with his direct running.\nBut they have only managed two goals between them in the seven games since and here again all three were a pale imitation of their best.\nMontero was substituted after 62 minutes of another quiet display, while Gomis was marshalled out of the game by Norwich centre-backs Ryan Bennett and Sebastien Bassong, and failed to find the target with any of his five shots.\nMan of the match - Jonny Howson\nWhat they said\nNorwich City manager Alex Neil: \"It certainly wasn't one of our best performances of the season, but we created the best chances in the game and kept it tight at the back.\n\"We changed our style, which I felt was necessary because we haven't been keeping enough clean sheets. I thought the lads responded well to that, though conceding possession at home is not something we are used to.\n\"I'm really delighted for the players. Our confidence has never been in question, but we needed to ensure we got points on the board.\"\nSwansea City manager Garry Monk: \"It's very frustrating. We had total control up until the goal, but unfortunately one lapse of concentration has cost us dearly again and it's been the story of the last couple of weeks.\n\"It was a difficult game, but our intention was right. We knew we might only get one or two chances. But we got caught with a sucker punch against the run of play. We totally dominated Norwich with the ball and didn't allow them anything other than the goal.\n\"We have work to do now. We have to look and assess where we are.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJonny Howson's goal was his first in his last 31 Premier League games, with his last coming back in October 2013 against Arsenal.\nIt was Norwich's first headed goal in the top flight this season.\nSwansea are now without a clean sheet in six Premier League games, their worst run since August 2014, when they went seven matches without a shutout.\nThey have won just one of their last 16 away trips to Carrow Road in all competitions (W1 D3 L12).\nWhat's next?\nSwansea take on Bournemouth at home on Saturday 21 November, while Norwich visit Chelsea on the same day.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 0-1 Newcastle United\nAyoze Perez's first-half goal earned Newcastle a fortunate first Premier League away win of the season as they leapfrogged Bournemouth in the table.\nPerez scored from Newcastle's only shot on target, with Adam Federici failing to stop his tame effort.\nThe result was very harsh on a dominant Bournemouth, who were denied by a string of brilliant saves from Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot.\nThe Cherries, six league games without a win, slip into the bottom three.\nEddie Howe's side, promoted to the top tier from the Championship last season, could have done little more to win in the game. Newcastle little less.\nBut the hosts were let down by poor finishing and a man-of-the-match display by Elliot as they chalked up 20 efforts on goal to Newcastle's two.\nRelive Newcastle's fortunate win\nFollow all Saturday's action and reaction from the later games\nNewcastle complete smash and grab\nRarely can Newcastle have come away with a victory after threatening the opposition's goal on so few occasions.\nAside from Perez's crucial strike, Fabricio Coloccini's second-half header was the Magpies' only other effort on goal, and they spent most of the game defending as Bournemouth poured forward from the flanks.\nBut having failed to score in a goalless draw against Stoke last weekend where Potters goalkeeper Jack Butland was equally brilliant, Newcastle boss Steve McClaren may feel that his side warranted some fortune.\nRepublic of Ireland international Elliot was an injury doubt for the game, yet played a telling part in what could be a critical win, their first in 13 away league games.\nHarsh lesson for Howe's side\nBournemouth's bright beginning to the season has tailed off in recent weeks after crucial injuries to key players such as Callum Wilson, Tommy Elphick and Max Gradel.\nSeveral pundits have suggested that they should alter their style but another energetic performance from his team ensured that at no point did Newcastle have any sort of control.\nMidfielder Harry Arter, Gosling and Ritchie were indefatigable as the Cherries out-ran and out-passed their opponents. And the attacking threat was relentless as they peppered Newcastle's goal from both flanks, chalking up 16 corners to Newcastle's none.\nJoshua King was twice denied by Elliot, also stopping Ritchie's diving header. But his effort to deny Gosling was perhaps his finest moment when he threw himself to his right to prevent the midfielder scoring against his former club from close range.\nAfter putting so much energy into the performance, it was no wonder that Bournemouth eventually tired. At the end, some of their players looked mentally and physically worn out, but now they must gather themselves for the international break realising that, at least in terms of performance, they are on the right track.\nOn the basis of this game, only their finishing can be improved upon.\nMan of the match - Rob Elliot\nManager reaction\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was very cruel for us today, we were excellent and controlled the game from start to finish. The goal was against the run of play and the frustrating thing for us was we kept knocking on the door and we felt it would come but it just wasn't meant to be.\n\"I can't fault the quality of the performance, the only missing thing was the goals on top of it. The last part of the game we lost belief, but apart from that I'm very pleased with the players. There's a lot of positives in the game, we can't dwell on the defeat.\n\"My job is always important to pick the players up and keep believing. We've been through spells like this before. This is our biggest challenge, we need to make sure we don't lose the faith in what we're doing.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve McClaren on Rob Elliot: \"Rob was a big doubt and we needed him today. He's been injured and not trained, and I like him. He's a talker and experienced.\n\"We've played better than that, you can't explain football sometimes. We've played far better, created chances and been denied by goalkeepers but this week we had one bit of quality for the goal and the rest of the time we were defending for our lives and relied on our goalkeeper.\n\"Bournemouth will be disappointed with their finishing but we got the luck today and we had a great defensive performance to get a clean sheet which is what you need sometimes.\"\nStats you need to know\nBournemouth have only kept one clean sheet in their 12 Premier League games this season.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum has been directly involved in eight of Newcastle's 13 goals this season in the Premier League.\nBournemouth's 20 shots were their most in a Premier League game this season.\nTheir 67.53% possession figure in the defeat was also their highest figure in a Premier League game this season.\nThe Cherries out-ran Newcastle by 119 km to 114 km, and have done so in each of their league games this term.\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Bournemouth travel to Swansea before hosting Everton the following Saturday. Newcastle are at home to Leicester before a trip to Crystal Palace."

It was a tough game. I can be vey happy with my team today, I saw smiles on their faces.\n\"When you play with sadness it does not help you. I tried in the three training sessions we had to deliver my message. Nobody expected we were going to score two or three goals. The difference between the two teams before was huge. Making sure we were well organised defensively was my priority.\n\"Some of the players who didn't start today had problems during the week. Nobody will play because he's French or Spanish or British. I saw in training how good or bad they were.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"We're disappointed with the draw. I think we did enough to win the game. They had just one shot on our goal, we had three or four clear chances to score.\n\"Villa defended very well with nine or 10 players. We tried to break that line. Two or three of our chances were unlucky. This happens in football.\n\"Without Bony and without Sergio Aguero we don't have a player who plays inside the box. We have to try and work without them.\"\nWhat next?\nAston Villa have a difficult, but winnable, couple of games ahead of them in November. They visit Everton after the international break on 21 November before welcoming Watford the following week.\nIt is also a big month for Manchester City, who play Liverpool on 21 November before facing Juventus and Southampton, although the two Premier League games are at home.",

The Eagles had 63% possession in the opening 20 minutes, making it count as Bolasie drilled in a finish after some sloppy Reds defending.\nLiverpool unable to make dominance count\nLiverpool eventually picked up the tempo, equalising shortly before the interval through Coutinho.\nThe Brazilian ran onto Nathaniel Clyne's right-wing cross inside the Palace area, bending the ball past Wayne Hennessey for his third goal in two matches.\nIt was a deserved leveller based on the pattern of play following Bolasie's opener, but the Reds were unable to push on and force a second-half winner.\nReds striker Christian Benteke came close with a header and, moments after Dann's goal, Hennessey denied Coutinho from the edge of the area with a fingertip save.\nBut, in truth, Liverpool did not test the Wales keeper enough. The Reds had almost 65% possession over the 90 minutes, but only managed to hit the target with four of their 22 attempts.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha\nManager reaction\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"Today is a bad feeling - it was not necessary to lose this game. We were the better team but for the first 15 minutes we were not on the pitch. We got the goal, we were awake, we started creating chances.\n\"But after the break, we gave them chances to cause us problems. Then we woke up again but couldn't make a goal. It feels so bad because it was not necessary. This was not enough for us - we can do more. We have to learn from this.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"We came here with ambition. The worst thing that happened to us was scoring, we then lost the ambition. Liverpool came on to us.\n\"We went toe-to-toe against Manchester United and got a draw, we went toe-toe toe with Liverpool and got the win.\n\"Sometimes it is about our own belief. We have been unlucky in the last few games. We have started really well this year. We need to make sure we capitalise on that.\"\nStats of the day\nAlan Pardew played in Palace's first league win at Anfield in 1991 and has managed the side to their two other wins there in 2015\nPhilippe Coutinho has scored as many goals in his last two appearances under Jurgen Klopp as he did in his final 17 under Brendan Rodgers\nPalace have won 10 away games in the Premier League in 2015, only Arsenal (11) have more\nLiverpool had 13 first-half shots.

In the end I think it's a good 1-1.\n\"Kieran Gibbs' movement is good. His timing in the box is good. Sometimes when he gets into a position he doesn't believe he can score.\n\"What this championship shows is that you have to fight 200% in every game for a result, you've seen that in all the games today. It shows it will be down to the team that can find the mental resource in every game.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"The way we played we should feel very proud. The effort was brilliant. The level we showed and the commitment was fantastic. It's the way we want to carry on.\n\"In six days we've played three matches, maybe we felt it in the final minutes. We need to recognise we are a very young team. This experience is very important.\n\"We need to show we are maturing. The level we have today is good, we need to show more and to improve. It's early to set a limit or to expect a lot of things.\"\nWhat next?\nArsenal visit West Brom and Norwich in the Premier League after the international break, while Tottenham have home London derbies against West Ham and Chelsea to look forward to.",

We can only hope that he will be OK and it is not going to be long-term, but we have to wait for the scan.\"\nWithout Payet, the Hammers struggled to break down the Everton defence, although Moses impressed down the right flank.\nThe threat Moses posed was as much to do with his pace and industry as any silky skills, but he was behind his side's goal and also got on the end of crosses when they were put in from the opposite flank.\nBut Andy Carroll was never able to make his presence felt in the box and, too often, the Hammers' promising build-up play went to waste.\nMan of the match - Everton's Gerard Deulofeu\nManager reaction\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We are never happy with one point, especially at home, but I was happy with the performance.\n\"We needed that kind of positive reaction after what happened last week at Watford.\n\"Everton deserved a point but in my opinion we were slightly better than them.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"Once we got to grips with the intensity West Ham play with, I thought we were very strong, especially in the second half.\n\"Our concentration levels were very high once we had conceded, and we worked very hard as a unit defensively.\n\"We had quality going forward too and it seemed the winning goal would come but we just could not find the final pass.\"\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Everton host Aston Villa and West Ham make the short trip to north London to play Tottenham.\nThe stats you need to know\nRomelu Lukaku has scored seven goals in seven games against West Ham for Everton (five in the Premier League, two in the FA Cup).\nLukaku's goal equalled the most number of goals he has scored against a single opponent in the Premier League; he has also scored five against Newcastle and Liverpool.\nManuel Lanzini is the first West Ham player since Bobby Zamora in 2006-07 to score against both Merseyside clubs in the same season.\nOnly David Silva (six) and Mesut Ozil (nine) have more Premier League assists this season than Gerard Deulofeu (five).\nThe Hammers haven't beaten the Toffees in the league in 15 attempts (D5 L10), their last win coming in April 2007 courtesy of a Bobby Zamora goal.\nEverton have lost just two of their last 10 Premier League away games (W4 D4 L2)."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Sunderland 0-1 Southampton\nSouthampton extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to six games as Dusan Tadic's penalty left Sunderland in the relegation zone.\nRonald Koeman's side bettered exchanges at the Stadium of Light and both Jose Fonte and Steven Davis saw efforts cleared off the line after half-time.\nThe pressure told when Yann M'Vila fouled Ryan Bertrand and Tadic struck a fourth league goal of the season.\nFabio Borini forced a save in response, but the away side easily held on.\nVictories for Leicester City and Manchester United mean the Saints were unable to reduce the gap to the Champions League qualification places, but back-to-back clean sheets for just the second time this season highlight the resilience of Koeman's side.\nSunderland in contrast still have the worst defensive record in the top tier - conceding 26 goals this season - and while they looked more competitive than during last week's thrashing at Everton, the needless penalty conceded by M'Vila will deeply frustrate Sam Allardyce.\nHow does Big Sam solve a worrying puzzle?\nAllardyce abandoned the back three he used in the 6-2 drubbing at Goodison Park in favour of a 4-4-2 system with a narrow midfield.\nThe result was a fragmented game, but as time wore on, Southampton's extra quality became evident.\nSebastian Coates denied Davis with a superb goal-line clearance and DeAndre Yedlin bravely stooped to clear Fonte's header off the line.\nSunderland had one clear chance through Duncan Watmore on his full debut, but they only achieved a pass accuracy rate of 66% as attacks repeatedly broke down.\nSo how does Allardyce - who admitted his side were \"disappointing\" - marry tightening Sunderland's system with offering some threat going forward? He needs a solution, his side have just one win in 15 league games.\nThe Black Cats started the day with the lowest possession on average in the league (41.7%), and with just 35% against Southampton, they seem inept at building attacks to ease pressure on their back four.\nOne-way traffic always looked like telling and when MVila - one of Sunderland's better players on the day - slid in as Bertrand posed little threat, Tadic whipped the winner left-footed into the corner, ensuring the Saints remain unbeaten on the road this season.\nSaints on a roll\nAllardyce was frustrated his side were not given a penalty for a Maya Yoshida handball, but such an award would have been harsh on the defender and his team.\nSouthampton were dominant - playing 555 passes to their hosts' 306 - and they could have been well ahead at the break as both Tadic and Sadio Mane saw efforts well saved by Costel Pantilimon.\nHaving taken just two points from nine to start the season, the south coast club have now built momentum and by the time they face Stoke after the international break, will have gone more than two months without a defeat.\nWithout European commitments Southampton perhaps have an advantage on those chasing a top four place around them and more somewhat ugly and efficient wins like this will certainly not harm their cause.\nMan of the match\nManager reaction\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"We are playing with fear and we need to get rid of that. In the end we have gifted it to Southampton. We need to pass the ball better. Our passing was poor and I think it's the fear of the position we are in. It could have been a point. We have to do better and cut out the silly mistakes. At the moment we are not good enough.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"I think if we reach European football, it would be like we had won the title. Of course it's possible. We have the experience from last year. But we have potential, we have qualities, in my opinion, we have a squad now to fight for that. Top four? It's maybe too difficult. Qualifying for Europe means maybe seventh place - like last season.\"\nUp next\nSouthampton will look to continue their fine form with a home game against Stoke when the international break is over while Sunderland must stew on defeat for more than two weeks before travelling to Crystal Palace for a Monday night fixture."

You could feel that tension, it affected us with the ball and our confidence. We need to build that side of it by putting a run of results together.\n\"This is a point gained and a result to put us on the road to getting our confidence. Overall we have to be happy with a point.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We should be standing here with three points. We're disappointed but there were a lot of positives.\n\"The players are beginning to believe in themselves a lot more, they know they have nothing to fear. I'm very proud to be Bournemouth manager tonight.\"\nOn Swansea's penalty: \"He [Andre Ayew] has induced the penalty but the referee has fallen for it.\"\nThe stats you may have missed\nJoshua King scored his first Bournemouth goal in his 11th Premier League appearance for the Cherries. He is the 35th different Norwegian to score in the division\nSince the start of last season, only Cesc Fabregas (20) has provided more assists than Matt Ritchie (19) in the top four tiers of English league football\nEddie Howe's side have shipped 27 goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other team\nWhat next?\nSwansea have a challenging trio of fixtures coming up, starting with a trip to Liverpool, followed by the visit of surprise high-flyers Leicester to the Liberty Stadium. It concludes with a meeting with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.\nBournemouth host Everton next, then visit Chelsea before facing Manchester United on home soil.",

For Everton's third goal, no fewer than four defenders and the on-rushing Guzan failed to deal with the ball bouncing in the area, with Barkley eventually rolling into an empty net.\nOn top of all this, Villa showed virtually no attacking threat, with not one of their players posting an average position in Everton territory during the first half.\nBy this evidence, Garde faces an almighty task if he is to keep Villa from relegation.\nExcellent Everton\nPinning this result solely on the inadequacies of Villa would be unfair on Everton, who put in a ruthless, clinical and entertaining display of attacking football.\nDeulofeu tormented Kieran Richardson down the Everton right, from where the majority of the home team's attacking threat came.\nHis shot, after good work from Lukaku and James McCarthy, led to Barkley's opener, with Seamus Coleman again supplying from the right for Lukaku's header to make it 2-0.\nBarkley nipped in to take advantage of the defensive chaos for the third, but it was Everton's fourth that was most impressive and came as their three stars linked up.\nDeulofeu surged through the middle, fed Barkley, whose one-touch pass was perfectly placed into the path of Lukaku, who lifted over Guzan.\nThe numbers game\nLukaku's first goal was his 50th in the Premier League, the 22-year-old becoming only the fifth man - alongside Robbie Fowler (92), Michael Owen (91), Wayne Rooney (71) and Cristiano Ronaldo (54) - to reach that landmark before his 23rd birthday.\nThis was the 201st league meeting between Everton and Villa, and it is the most played fixture in English league football.\nIf Villa fail to improve, then the 202nd in March could be the last for some time.\nMan of the match - Gerard Deulofeu\nWhat they said\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"It was a really strong performance. You're are always worried how you will react after an international break, but it was very pleasing. It was a complete performance.\n\"You get used to hearing Lukaku's name, but it's a good reminder that he is such a young man. It is a very elite group that he has joined. It is great to see him growing all the time and this season he has gone to a different level.\n\"Ross Barkley is coming into his mature best. To play the amount of football he has in the last seven days and still get to that level is remarkable.\"\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"In the first 30 minutes we were not good enough to resist. We didn't want to concede an early goal and we did. After that it was too difficult.\n\"When you concede four goals it is not a good performance. We will have to work on that. The second half was better. I was not pleased at all with the first half.\n\"I knew the size of the task before I came. Today we lost 4-0, I prefer to lose one game 4-0 than four games 1-0. We have to be ready for the next game, because that is very important.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton have lost only one of their last 10 Premier League games against Aston Villa\nNo Premier League team has ever survived having accumulated five points or fewer after 13 games of a season: QPR in 2012-13, Sheffield Wednesday in 1999-00, Swindon Town in 1993-94 and Sunderland in 2005-06\nAll 24 of Everton's goals this season have been from open play, making them the only side in the Premier League yet to score from a set-piece this season\nRomelu Lukaku has scored seven goals in his last seven Premier League games\nRoss Barkley has already been involved in more goals this season (nine - five goals, four assists) than in any of his previous campaigns\nWhat's next?\nVilla's long quest for a win next takes in the visit of Watford next Saturday. Everton make the long trip to Bournemouth on the same day."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester City 1-4 Liverpool\nLiverpool wrecked Manchester City's hopes of returning to the top of the Premier League and delivered more evidence of vast improvement under new manager Jurgen Klopp with an emphatic victory at The Etihad.\nKlopp's side tore City apart with a dazzling first-half performance, which saw them take a 3-0 lead through Eliaquim Mangala's early own goal and cool finishes from Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino.\nSergio Aguero gave City faint hope when he pulled a goal back on half time but City were undermined by shambolic defending as they failed to cope with the absence of injured captain Vincent Kompany.\nLiverpool, however, never looked like conceding their advantage and Martin Skrtel's thunderous late fourth confirmed their superiority as they added this fine away win to their recent victory at champions Chelsea.\nKlopp's revival continues\nThe optimism engendered by Klopp's arrival was punctured by Liverpool's home defeat by Crystal Palace, but all the signs of what the former Borussia Dortmund coach wants from his side were on show here.\nLiverpool put City under pressure in possession right away and it was not long before City's impatient fans were getting stuck into their team for their inability to get the ball out of their own half.\nThe visitors were able to cut through City's defence almost at will, with Klopp urging his players not to take a backward step as they went in search of what would be a highly impressive victory.\nThe contrast between the two managers could not have been starker. Klopp was all action and animation in his technical area while City counterpart Manuel Pellegrini stood motionless for much of the match, hands in his pockets or with arms folded in frustration. The body language reflected the performances of their teams.\nCoutinho and Firmino the key factors\nCoutinho struggled to hit his previous heights earlier this season but the little Brazilian magician has come to life with the arrival of Klopp.\nHis equaliser right on half-time time at Chelsea paved the way for victory at Stamford Bridge and has reignited him. He was masterly as Liverpool cut City to shreds in the first 45 minutes, dropping deep into positions where he could not be countered then darting into the area to get a goal and create countless problems.\nThe same applies to \u00a329m summer signing Firmino. He initially struggled with the pace of the Premier League after arriving from Hoffenheim but has grown in confidence backed by the faith of Klopp, who has started him in an advanced role in preference to Christian Benteke in the wins at Chelsea and now City. It is a ploy that has reaped a rich reward.\nCan City cope with Kompany?\nAguero's absence is always a source of anxiety to Manchester City - but on this evidence the damage is even worse when Vincent Kompany is missing.\nThe injured City captain looked on grim-faced from the stands as Mangala and Martin Demichelis floundered - although they were by no means the only offenders in what was a shocking display from Pellegrini's team.\nWithout Kompany, City lacked authority and composure at the back and had Liverpool scored more they could have had few complaints.\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho\nWhat they said\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"Today we did it all wrong - the performance, the way we defended, the way we went forward. It was a fake night, a fake game. It is difficult to understand.\n\"If we meant to do it on purpose we couldn't have done it that badly. We tried to make changes and have some options to score. We tried to fight but continued making so many mistakes with the ball.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It feels perfect. The game was not perfect but it was very good.\n\"City couldn't start like they want but that is important for us. We played with big passion and that's the most important thing for us.\n\"The good news is that we can do better. At half-time I told the boys they were surprised to be winning 3-0, and we must do better in that situation.\n\"We have quality, we could have more goals but 4-1 is perfect. The boys can believe now that they are stronger than many people think.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis game saw Man City concede three goals in the first half of a competitive game at the Etihad Stadium for just the second time (2-3 v Manchester United in the FA Cup in Jan 2012, the other)\nThis is only the second time that Man City have conceded four goals in a competitive game at the Etihad (Man City 2-4 Aston Villa in the League Cup in September 2012 the other)\nIt's the first time they have conceded four at home in the Premier League since February 2003 against Arsenal. That game, at Maine Road, ended 5-1\nSergio Aguero became the top-scoring South American player in Premier League history (85 goals)\nLiverpool have scored as many goals in their last two away Premier League games (7) as they managed in their 11 before that\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday. Group leaders City lead the second-placed Italians by a point.\nLiverpool are also in Europe, but in the Europa League on Thursday when they face Bordeaux at Anfield. Klopp's side are second in Group B, three points ahead of the French side and two behind leaders FC Sion.",

Palace remain 10th on 19 points.\nListen as pundits on Radio 5 live predict Sunderland victory\nPodcast: Allardyce's 150th Premier League win\nPatience a virtue for Black Cats\nThe goal eventually came as a result of Yannick Bolasie losing control of the ball in midfield as he tried to perform another trick, and team-mate's Dann's ambling at the back.\nThe hard-working Defoe, who fired wide in the first half, chased down the Palace defender, pushed the ball past keeper Wayne Hennessey and slotted in.\nIt was his seventh goal of the season, and underlines his importance to the club despite recent reports suggesting he might leave in January.\n, external\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce said: \"He is a classy finisher. If you want somebody to chase down what looks a lost cause [it is him].\n\"Defoe not giving up is why the defender and the goalkeeper messed up.\"\nExcellent defence pays dividends for Allardyce\nPrior to the match both managers stated how Sunderland would set up at the back - Palace boss Alan Pardew said it would be five while Allardyce said he would pick four.\nIt actually flitted from a 3-5-1-1 formation to a 5-3-1-1, although the graphic below seems to suggest Allardyce opted for an 8-1-1.\nFor a manager whose side conceded six goals against Everton in their last away outing, his conservatism was understandable, especially against the potent and pacy attack of Palace.\nThe tactic worked. Palace had plenty of possession but their attacks - led by Wilfried Zaha and Bolasie - often broke down around the area, and balls that found their way into the box were cut out by Sunderland's three centre-backs.\nHowever, the graphic does not tell the full story. The Black Cats were dangerous on the counter-attack and looked far fitter than they did in the 6-2 loss at Goodison Park, catching Palace out on the break on several occasions.\nIf Steven Fletcher, Defoe or Patrick van Aanholt had provided more assured final touches, Sunderland would have been ahead in the first half.\nClean sheets the key for Black Cats boss\nThis was only Sunderland's second clean sheet in 15 games in all competitions this season, following the 3-0 win over Newcastle in October.\n\"It was a good solid defensive performance,\" Allardyce said.\n\"Going five at the back was something that we thought about a lot. Palace have a real threat in Bolasie and Zaha and if we played wing-backs they would go tight and stop them working their magic.\n\"It is no coincidence - two clean sheets, two victories and a very, very valuable three points.\n\"We have been conceding on average three goals a game and that just has to stop.\n\"Hopefully the message is getting through to the players that we have to be resilient as a team, dig in and work hard out of possession.\"\nHappy 150th for Big Sam\nIt was also a good day for Allardyce on a personal level as he recorded his 150th win in the top flight.\nOnly four managers have won more games in the Premier League - Sir Alex Ferguson (528), Arsene Wenger (422), Harry Redknapp (236) and David Moyes (190).\n'Final pass let us down'\nPardew gave credit to Sunderland and their gameplan, but rued a lack of incisiveness in attack from his team.\n\"We got a lot of the ball, a lot of possession,\" he said. \"Unfortunately we could not create a sweet moment tonight and things went the wrong way for us.\n\"Our crossing and final pass let us down. It was a simplistic game they played but they did it well.\n\"Dann tried to take Defoe and edge him out, but Defoe checked his run and got on the other side of him.\n\"Dann has been magnificent for us.

For Everton's third goal, no fewer than four defenders and the on-rushing Guzan failed to deal with the ball bouncing in the area, with Barkley eventually rolling into an empty net.\nOn top of all this, Villa showed virtually no attacking threat, with not one of their players posting an average position in Everton territory during the first half.\nBy this evidence, Garde faces an almighty task if he is to keep Villa from relegation.\nExcellent Everton\nPinning this result solely on the inadequacies of Villa would be unfair on Everton, who put in a ruthless, clinical and entertaining display of attacking football.\nDeulofeu tormented Kieran Richardson down the Everton right, from where the majority of the home team's attacking threat came.\nHis shot, after good work from Lukaku and James McCarthy, led to Barkley's opener, with Seamus Coleman again supplying from the right for Lukaku's header to make it 2-0.\nBarkley nipped in to take advantage of the defensive chaos for the third, but it was Everton's fourth that was most impressive and came as their three stars linked up.\nDeulofeu surged through the middle, fed Barkley, whose one-touch pass was perfectly placed into the path of Lukaku, who lifted over Guzan.\nThe numbers game\nLukaku's first goal was his 50th in the Premier League, the 22-year-old becoming only the fifth man - alongside Robbie Fowler (92), Michael Owen (91), Wayne Rooney (71) and Cristiano Ronaldo (54) - to reach that landmark before his 23rd birthday.\nThis was the 201st league meeting between Everton and Villa, and it is the most played fixture in English league football.\nIf Villa fail to improve, then the 202nd in March could be the last for some time.\nMan of the match - Gerard Deulofeu\nWhat they said\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"It was a really strong performance. You're are always worried how you will react after an international break, but it was very pleasing. It was a complete performance.\n\"You get used to hearing Lukaku's name, but it's a good reminder that he is such a young man. It is a very elite group that he has joined. It is great to see him growing all the time and this season he has gone to a different level.\n\"Ross Barkley is coming into his mature best. To play the amount of football he has in the last seven days and still get to that level is remarkable.\"\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"In the first 30 minutes we were not good enough to resist. We didn't want to concede an early goal and we did. After that it was too difficult.\n\"When you concede four goals it is not a good performance. We will have to work on that. The second half was better. I was not pleased at all with the first half.\n\"I knew the size of the task before I came. Today we lost 4-0, I prefer to lose one game 4-0 than four games 1-0. We have to be ready for the next game, because that is very important.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton have lost only one of their last 10 Premier League games against Aston Villa\nNo Premier League team has ever survived having accumulated five points or fewer after 13 games of a season: QPR in 2012-13, Sheffield Wednesday in 1999-00, Swindon Town in 1993-94 and Sunderland in 2005-06\nAll 24 of Everton's goals this season have been from open play, making them the only side in the Premier League yet to score from a set-piece this season\nRomelu Lukaku has scored seven goals in his last seven Premier League games\nRoss Barkley has already been involved in more goals this season (nine - five goals, four assists) than in any of his previous campaigns\nWhat's next?\nVilla's long quest for a win next takes in the visit of Watford next Saturday.

United's injury problems up front - with both Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial out - meant Depay was given his first league start since the drubbing at Arsenal on 4 October.\nManager Louis van Gaal has said he expects more from his fellow Dutchman, and his faith here was rewarded.\nDepay sweetly struck the opener, showing calmness and composure to guide Herrera's cross into the roof of the net.\nFull of confidence, he tested Heurelho Gomes with a low drive shortly afterwards, and sent another two efforts wide of goal.\nRooney has been entrusted with leading the line for the Red Devils this season, but he has scored just twice in the league, a tally now matched by Depay.\nShould he be fit, the captain will surely be restored to the side for Wednesday's home Champions League game against PSV Eindhoven, but where?\nOn this showing, it may be better to leave a confident Depay up front against his old side, playing Rooney in the number 10 role, particularly as Herrera went off injured.\nUnited finally concede\nUnited were in control for much of the game, and finished with 56.7% possession, but should have put the game to bed early on. Lingard was twice thwarted by Gomes when through on goal and the industrious Morgan Schneiderlin firing narrowly over.\nWatford grew into the game and forwards Deeney and Ighalo caused them some problems in the second half.\nThey found visiting goalkeeper David de Gea in fine form, though, and it took a penalty for them to get past the Spaniard.\nDe Gea - playing against a side managed by Quique Sanchez Flores, who gave him his debut for Atletico Madrid - made five crucial saves, including a stunning reaction stop from Almen Abdi's deflected strike.\nDeeney's spot-kick ended United's run of 641 minutes without conceding.\nWatford should be fine, if they finish chances\nThe Hornets may have lost back-to-back league games for the first time this season, but they posed a real threat to title-chasing United.\nHaving been tipped for an immediate return to the Championship, they are seven points above the relegation zone after 13 games and showed their fighting spirit.\nSpaniard Flores took over in the summer and has put together a well-drilled side who are organised and work hard for each other.\nThe introduction of midfielder Nathan Ake at half-time provided them with more bite, as the on-loan Chelsea man made six tackles, more than any other player on the pitch despite playing only 45 minutes.\nThey do not concede many goals - just 14 in the league so far this season - but with only 12 scored at the other end, they will need to be more clinical if they are to remain in the top flight.\nMan of the match - Memphis Depay\nWhat they said\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We deserved a draw in the second half. It was difficult to play with the wind in the first half, same for them in the second half, but this is football.\n\"We tried in the first half but we could not. At half-time we had to forget and play a match for 45 minutes.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"It was a short time to play after the penalty but you have seen also the spirit of my team. It was amazing because even after the penalty we gave another injection into the game. In five minutes we had possibilities and scored a goal, that was the consequence of the spirit.\n\"I am very happy for Bastian Schweinsteiger. He needed a goal, he got it and Memphis Depay also scored a beautiful goal. I am a happy coach.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford conceded in the first half of a game at Vicarage Road for the first time since January 2015 (against Blackpool)\nAnder Herrera has had a hand in four goals in his past six Premier League appearances (two goals, two assists)\nMemphis Depay had 67 touches - Wayne Rooney has had more in only one of his 11 Premier League appearances this season (68 at Arsenal)\nWhat next?\nWatford travel to bottom side Aston Villa next Saturday, while United play PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday."

Palace remain 10th on 19 points.\nListen as pundits on Radio 5 live predict Sunderland victory\nPodcast: Allardyce's 150th Premier League win\nPatience a virtue for Black Cats\nThe goal eventually came as a result of Yannick Bolasie losing control of the ball in midfield as he tried to perform another trick, and team-mate's Dann's ambling at the back.\nThe hard-working Defoe, who fired wide in the first half, chased down the Palace defender, pushed the ball past keeper Wayne Hennessey and slotted in.\nIt was his seventh goal of the season, and underlines his importance to the club despite recent reports suggesting he might leave in January.\n, external\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce said: \"He is a classy finisher. If you want somebody to chase down what looks a lost cause [it is him].\n\"Defoe not giving up is why the defender and the goalkeeper messed up.\"\nExcellent defence pays dividends for Allardyce\nPrior to the match both managers stated how Sunderland would set up at the back - Palace boss Alan Pardew said it would be five while Allardyce said he would pick four.\nIt actually flitted from a 3-5-1-1 formation to a 5-3-1-1, although the graphic below seems to suggest Allardyce opted for an 8-1-1.\nFor a manager whose side conceded six goals against Everton in their last away outing, his conservatism was understandable, especially against the potent and pacy attack of Palace.\nThe tactic worked. Palace had plenty of possession but their attacks - led by Wilfried Zaha and Bolasie - often broke down around the area, and balls that found their way into the box were cut out by Sunderland's three centre-backs.\nHowever, the graphic does not tell the full story. The Black Cats were dangerous on the counter-attack and looked far fitter than they did in the 6-2 loss at Goodison Park, catching Palace out on the break on several occasions.\nIf Steven Fletcher, Defoe or Patrick van Aanholt had provided more assured final touches, Sunderland would have been ahead in the first half.\nClean sheets the key for Black Cats boss\nThis was only Sunderland's second clean sheet in 15 games in all competitions this season, following the 3-0 win over Newcastle in October.\n\"It was a good solid defensive performance,\" Allardyce said.\n\"Going five at the back was something that we thought about a lot. Palace have a real threat in Bolasie and Zaha and if we played wing-backs they would go tight and stop them working their magic.\n\"It is no coincidence - two clean sheets, two victories and a very, very valuable three points.\n\"We have been conceding on average three goals a game and that just has to stop.\n\"Hopefully the message is getting through to the players that we have to be resilient as a team, dig in and work hard out of possession.\"\nHappy 150th for Big Sam\nIt was also a good day for Allardyce on a personal level as he recorded his 150th win in the top flight.\nOnly four managers have won more games in the Premier League - Sir Alex Ferguson (528), Arsene Wenger (422), Harry Redknapp (236) and David Moyes (190).\n'Final pass let us down'\nPardew gave credit to Sunderland and their gameplan, but rued a lack of incisiveness in attack from his team.\n\"We got a lot of the ball, a lot of possession,\" he said. \"Unfortunately we could not create a sweet moment tonight and things went the wrong way for us.\n\"Our crossing and final pass let us down. It was a simplistic game they played but they did it well.\n\"Dann tried to take Defoe and edge him out, but Defoe checked his run and got on the other side of him.\n\"Dann has been magnificent for us. We will have to pick ourselves up for Saturday.\"\nStats you need to know\nNine of Crystal Palace's 13 Premier League games this season have been goalless at half-time\nDefoe has now scored seven goals in nine starts for Sunderland in all competitions this season\nTen of the 13 goals the Eagles have conceded in the Premier League this season have come in the second half\nThis was only Sunderland's second win in their last 16 top-flight games (D5 L9)\nPalace have won only three of their past 11 Premier League home games (W3 D1 L7)\nComing up next\nSunderland are at home to Stoke on Saturday, before facing Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool in December.\nPalace manager Pardew welcomes former club Newcastle next week.",

I think it was partly because of the minute's silence for what happened last week. The atmosphere in the stadium was not normal.\n\"In the second half, we played better, it was a good reaction, but I have to recognise that best chances in the game fell to Stoke.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We're delighted - it's an important win for us. We could have finished off more of our chances but overall it was a good performance from us.\n\"I think in terms of clear-cut chances we were miles ahead of Southampton. I don't think Jack Butland had a save to make and that's illustrative of how well we played - and we broke with real purpose too.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nStoke have kept five clean sheets in their last six Premier League matches - after conceding in each of their eight league games prior to this run\nTheir run of four successive clean sheets away from home is their best in the top flight since February 1970\nThere have been just 23 goals scored in Premier League games involving Stoke this season; fewer than any other side\nSouthampton's defeat was only their second in their last 11 Premier League games (W5 D4)\nWhat's next?\nStoke visit Sunderland next Saturday, while Southampton face a trip to Manchester City - without striker Pelle, who picked up his fifth booking of this season in this match and will serve a one-match suspension."

Lingard was twice thwarted by Gomes when through on goal and the industrious Morgan Schneiderlin firing narrowly over.\nWatford grew into the game and forwards Deeney and Ighalo caused them some problems in the second half.\nThey found visiting goalkeeper David de Gea in fine form, though, and it took a penalty for them to get past the Spaniard.\nDe Gea - playing against a side managed by Quique Sanchez Flores, who gave him his debut for Atletico Madrid - made five crucial saves, including a stunning reaction stop from Almen Abdi's deflected strike.\nDeeney's spot-kick ended United's run of 641 minutes without conceding.\nWatford should be fine, if they finish chances\nThe Hornets may have lost back-to-back league games for the first time this season, but they posed a real threat to title-chasing United.\nHaving been tipped for an immediate return to the Championship, they are seven points above the relegation zone after 13 games and showed their fighting spirit.\nSpaniard Flores took over in the summer and has put together a well-drilled side who are organised and work hard for each other.\nThe introduction of midfielder Nathan Ake at half-time provided them with more bite, as the on-loan Chelsea man made six tackles, more than any other player on the pitch despite playing only 45 minutes.\nThey do not concede many goals - just 14 in the league so far this season - but with only 12 scored at the other end, they will need to be more clinical if they are to remain in the top flight.\nMan of the match - Memphis Depay\nWhat they said\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We deserved a draw in the second half. It was difficult to play with the wind in the first half, same for them in the second half, but this is football.\n\"We tried in the first half but we could not. At half-time we had to forget and play a match for 45 minutes.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"It was a short time to play after the penalty but you have seen also the spirit of my team. It was amazing because even after the penalty we gave another injection into the game. In five minutes we had possibilities and scored a goal, that was the consequence of the spirit.\n\"I am very happy for Bastian Schweinsteiger. He needed a goal, he got it and Memphis Depay also scored a beautiful goal. I am a happy coach.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford conceded in the first half of a game at Vicarage Road for the first time since January 2015 (against Blackpool)\nAnder Herrera has had a hand in four goals in his past six Premier League appearances (two goals, two assists)\nMemphis Depay had 67 touches - Wayne Rooney has had more in only one of his 11 Premier League appearances this season (68 at Arsenal)\nWhat next?\nWatford travel to bottom side Aston Villa next Saturday, while United play PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday."

The Spanish international had missed a couple of good chances but made no mistake this time as he cut inside Ryan Bennett and found the far corner of John Ruddy's net.\nIt was only Costa's fourth goal of the season, following a debut 2014-15 campaign that yielded 20.\nHazard warning\nEqually as promising for Chelsea was the positive display of Eden Hazard.\nThe Belgian excelled in a floating number 10 role behind Costa, with Pedro and Willian providing further attacking options from wide positions.\nMost of what was positive about the Blues came through the Belgian international, be it driving runs, clever movement or intelligent passes into space.\nTwice before the opening goal he used his speed and trickery to drive to the bye-line and provided a low cross between Norwich's defence and keeper.\nHad Costa, or one of his fellow Chelsea forwards, been more alert they would have provided a simple finish.\nWhen Hazard left the field to be replaced by Cesar Azpilicueta in the 90th minute, he received a deserved standing ovation.\nCanaries lack a cutting edge\nIn their previous away game, Norwich came within a few minutes of earning a point against Manchester City courtesy of a hard-working and disciplined display at the Etihad.\nOnce again, Alex Neil's men can take pride from the way they competed at one of the league's strongest sides.\nThey defended resolutely in numbers and broke with intent but lacked the requisite ruthlessness in front of goal when chances came their way.\nNathan Redmond saw an angled shot saved by Asmir Begovic, Dieumerci Mbokani blazed over from the edge of the box and, in the best opportunity of the lot, Sebastien Bassong was denied by a superb diving block from Blues captain John Terry.\nThe Canaries have now only won one of their last eight games and have not won on their travels since their first away game at Sunderland in August.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\nWhat they said\nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho: \"The only thing we didn't do was score more from the chances we had. We should have scored at least two and breathed easier, but it is difficult for us to score goals and to keep a clean sheet against a team who plays defensively and then has a try in the final few minutes because they had nothing to lose.\n\"Diego Costa missed two big chances in the first half and if he did not score it would be a big 50 kilo on his back, but he scored and he could breathe easy.\n\"Now I have two big games to watch - Real Madrid against Barcelona and the Portuguese Cup, so I think I will have a good meal in front of the television.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"I am disappointed. I thought our players worked really hard, I felt we gave Chelsea very little and we worked really hard.\n\"We put some fresh legs on as the game went on, and tried to create problems. Arguably we could have done more but I am happy with my players.\n\"We've done it at Liverpool, at Manchester City and here - gone to the so-called bigger clubs and put on a show. It is just disappointing we had that one lapse of concentration.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis was only Chelsea's third clean sheet in their last 16 Premier League matches; Norwich have kept just one in their last 17 away from home\nDiego Costa ended a run of 603 minutes without a goal in all competitions for Chelsea\nCesc Fabregas provided his first assist in 10 games for the Blues. This was only his second Premier League assist of the season; eight fewer than he managed after his first 13 Premier League appearances of 2014/15\nChelsea's 65% possession figure in this match was their highest in a league match since December 2014\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to face Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Champions League on Tuesday. The Blues are second in their group, three points behind leaders Porto.\nNorwich take on Arsenal at Carrow Road in the Premier League next Sunday."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester City 1-4 Liverpool\nLiverpool wrecked Manchester City's hopes of returning to the top of the Premier League and delivered more evidence of vast improvement under new manager Jurgen Klopp with an emphatic victory at The Etihad.\nKlopp's side tore City apart with a dazzling first-half performance, which saw them take a 3-0 lead through Eliaquim Mangala's early own goal and cool finishes from Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino.\nSergio Aguero gave City faint hope when he pulled a goal back on half time but City were undermined by shambolic defending as they failed to cope with the absence of injured captain Vincent Kompany.\nLiverpool, however, never looked like conceding their advantage and Martin Skrtel's thunderous late fourth confirmed their superiority as they added this fine away win to their recent victory at champions Chelsea.\nKlopp's revival continues\nThe optimism engendered by Klopp's arrival was punctured by Liverpool's home defeat by Crystal Palace, but all the signs of what the former Borussia Dortmund coach wants from his side were on show here.\nLiverpool put City under pressure in possession right away and it was not long before City's impatient fans were getting stuck into their team for their inability to get the ball out of their own half.\nThe visitors were able to cut through City's defence almost at will, with Klopp urging his players not to take a backward step as they went in search of what would be a highly impressive victory.\nThe contrast between the two managers could not have been starker. Klopp was all action and animation in his technical area while City counterpart Manuel Pellegrini stood motionless for much of the match, hands in his pockets or with arms folded in frustration. The body language reflected the performances of their teams.\nCoutinho and Firmino the key factors\nCoutinho struggled to hit his previous heights earlier this season but the little Brazilian magician has come to life with the arrival of Klopp.\nHis equaliser right on half-time time at Chelsea paved the way for victory at Stamford Bridge and has reignited him. He was masterly as Liverpool cut City to shreds in the first 45 minutes, dropping deep into positions where he could not be countered then darting into the area to get a goal and create countless problems.\nThe same applies to \u00a329m summer signing Firmino. He initially struggled with the pace of the Premier League after arriving from Hoffenheim but has grown in confidence backed by the faith of Klopp, who has started him in an advanced role in preference to Christian Benteke in the wins at Chelsea and now City. It is a ploy that has reaped a rich reward.\nCan City cope with Kompany?\nAguero's absence is always a source of anxiety to Manchester City - but on this evidence the damage is even worse when Vincent Kompany is missing.\nThe injured City captain looked on grim-faced from the stands as Mangala and Martin Demichelis floundered - although they were by no means the only offenders in what was a shocking display from Pellegrini's team.\nWithout Kompany, City lacked authority and composure at the back and had Liverpool scored more they could have had few complaints.\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho\nWhat they said\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"Today we did it all wrong - the performance, the way we defended, the way we went forward. It was a fake night, a fake game. It is difficult to understand.\n\"If we meant to do it on purpose we couldn't have done it that badly. We tried to make changes and have some options to score. We tried to fight but continued making so many mistakes with the ball.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It feels perfect. The game was not perfect but it was very good.\n\"City couldn't start like they want but that is important for us. We played with big passion and that's the most important thing for us.\n\"The good news is that we can do better.

You could feel that tension, it affected us with the ball and our confidence. We need to build that side of it by putting a run of results together.\n\"This is a point gained and a result to put us on the road to getting our confidence. Overall we have to be happy with a point.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We should be standing here with three points. We're disappointed but there were a lot of positives.\n\"The players are beginning to believe in themselves a lot more, they know they have nothing to fear. I'm very proud to be Bournemouth manager tonight.\"\nOn Swansea's penalty: \"He [Andre Ayew] has induced the penalty but the referee has fallen for it.\"\nThe stats you may have missed\nJoshua King scored his first Bournemouth goal in his 11th Premier League appearance for the Cherries. He is the 35th different Norwegian to score in the division\nSince the start of last season, only Cesc Fabregas (20) has provided more assists than Matt Ritchie (19) in the top four tiers of English league football\nEddie Howe's side have shipped 27 goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other team\nWhat next?\nSwansea have a challenging trio of fixtures coming up, starting with a trip to Liverpool, followed by the visit of surprise high-flyers Leicester to the Liberty Stadium. It concludes with a meeting with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.\nBournemouth host Everton next, then visit Chelsea before facing Manchester United on home soil."

The Spanish international had missed a couple of good chances but made no mistake this time as he cut inside Ryan Bennett and found the far corner of John Ruddy's net.\nIt was only Costa's fourth goal of the season, following a debut 2014-15 campaign that yielded 20.\nHazard warning\nEqually as promising for Chelsea was the positive display of Eden Hazard.\nThe Belgian excelled in a floating number 10 role behind Costa, with Pedro and Willian providing further attacking options from wide positions.\nMost of what was positive about the Blues came through the Belgian international, be it driving runs, clever movement or intelligent passes into space.\nTwice before the opening goal he used his speed and trickery to drive to the bye-line and provided a low cross between Norwich's defence and keeper.\nHad Costa, or one of his fellow Chelsea forwards, been more alert they would have provided a simple finish.\nWhen Hazard left the field to be replaced by Cesar Azpilicueta in the 90th minute, he received a deserved standing ovation.\nCanaries lack a cutting edge\nIn their previous away game, Norwich came within a few minutes of earning a point against Manchester City courtesy of a hard-working and disciplined display at the Etihad.\nOnce again, Alex Neil's men can take pride from the way they competed at one of the league's strongest sides.\nThey defended resolutely in numbers and broke with intent but lacked the requisite ruthlessness in front of goal when chances came their way.\nNathan Redmond saw an angled shot saved by Asmir Begovic, Dieumerci Mbokani blazed over from the edge of the box and, in the best opportunity of the lot, Sebastien Bassong was denied by a superb diving block from Blues captain John Terry.\nThe Canaries have now only won one of their last eight games and have not won on their travels since their first away game at Sunderland in August.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\nWhat they said\nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho: \"The only thing we didn't do was score more from the chances we had. We should have scored at least two and breathed easier, but it is difficult for us to score goals and to keep a clean sheet against a team who plays defensively and then has a try in the final few minutes because they had nothing to lose.\n\"Diego Costa missed two big chances in the first half and if he did not score it would be a big 50 kilo on his back, but he scored and he could breathe easy.\n\"Now I have two big games to watch - Real Madrid against Barcelona and the Portuguese Cup, so I think I will have a good meal in front of the television.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"I am disappointed. I thought our players worked really hard, I felt we gave Chelsea very little and we worked really hard.\n\"We put some fresh legs on as the game went on, and tried to create problems. Arguably we could have done more but I am happy with my players.\n\"We've done it at Liverpool, at Manchester City and here - gone to the so-called bigger clubs and put on a show. It is just disappointing we had that one lapse of concentration.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis was only Chelsea's third clean sheet in their last 16 Premier League matches; Norwich have kept just one in their last 17 away from home\nDiego Costa ended a run of 603 minutes without a goal in all competitions for Chelsea\nCesc Fabregas provided his first assist in 10 games for the Blues. This was only his second Premier League assist of the season; eight fewer than he managed after his first 13 Premier League appearances of 2014/15\nChelsea's 65% possession figure in this match was their highest in a league match since December 2014\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to face Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Champions League on Tuesday. The Blues are second in their group, three points behind leaders Porto.\nNorwich take on Arsenal at Carrow Road in the Premier League next Sunday.",

It is the hope that hurts.\nThe match at The Hawthorns was supposed to be the start of a winning run that would see them go on beat Norwich, Sunderland and Aston Villa. But, alas, they have stumbled once again.\nThe Gunners had 73% possession and 11 efforts on goal. Two of those should have been converted, with substitute Joel Campbell missing from four yards and Cazorla slipping as he went to take a spot-kick.\nThen there is the growing injury list...\nGunners squad depleted again\nInjuries have cost Arsenal time and time again in recent years.\nIndeed, when Aaron Ramsey was sidelined in December 2013, the Gunners' title hopes were damaged.\nThey have a stronger squad now, but any team missing players of the calibre of Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Danny Welbeck and Jack Wilshere would find it hard to sustain a title challenge.\nHere, midfielders Mikel Arteta and Francis Coquelin came off with injuries. Arteta had replaced Coquelin in the 14th minute.\nArsene Wenger's squad is not yet threadbare, but he cannot afford any more injuries over the next five weeks.\nPulis' men find their dogged touch\nYes, they rode luck and conceded the majority of possession to the Gunners, but the Baggies deserve full marks for resilience and belief.\nTheir previous two league games saw them leak five goals, but Jonas Olsson's introduction to the backline provided some much-needed muscle.\nBodies were flung in front of Arsenal players to deny them space, while Craig Dawson produced the block of the match when he blocked Kieran Gibbs from six yards out.\nMan of the match - James McClean\nWhat they said\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis:\n\"There have been games here this year where we've been disappointed because we've lost. I thought Arsenal were very good, particularly second half when they ramped it up.\n\"Alexis Sanchez was just wonderful - his movement, his play. You've got Ozil and Cazorla who have wonderful talent. The lads deserve it for the effort and commitment, but we've played better and done better and not got the results.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger:\n\"It was a very bad afternoon for us. We had 70% possession, we scored an own goal, we missed a penalty, we gave away a goal from a set-piece, that is perfect to make the afternoon a nightmare.\n\"We missed open-goal chances. I believe West Brom did fight with 100% commitment as well and you have to give them credit for that.\n\"At 1-0 we had just to make sure they did not come back with an easy goal and that's where we were guilty, because apart from that I cannot fault the team who gave what they could until the last minute. We produced enough to win the game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSince joining Arsenal in 2012, Giroud has scored more headed goals than any other player in the Premier League (16)\nOzil has provided an assist in seven consecutive Premier League appearances, the most in the division's history\nChris Brunt has racked up 11 assists in the Premier League from set-pieces since the start of the last season, more than any other player\nMorrison has scored three Premier League goals against Arsenal - against no other side has he managed more (also three v Manchester United)\nCazorla failed to score from the penalty spot for the first time in the Premier League, having converted each of his previous six spot-kicks\nWhat next?\nArsenal face Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League this week before are away to Norwich on Sunday.

Certainly by winning three in the first six, it takes us to where we want to be going.\n\"I said when I came here, I don't really want to be doing what the club has done over the last four years and have to win a huge amount of games in the last six or eight matches.\n\"Let's try not to get there and let's try to do it as quickly as we can.\"\n'The red card cost us'\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes: \"In the second half the sending off affected us. It was always going to be difficult from there.\n\"Jon will kick himself for missing - it was a clear chance and he should score. He knows that and if we score at that point we would have very probably taken the game away from them.\n\"But we pick ourselves up. We have a big game on Tuesday and we will draw a line under this.\nMan of the match - Lee Cattermole (Sunderland)\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland have lost just one of their last nine Premier League meetings with Stoke (W5 D3 L1).\nThe Black Cats have now won as many league games in six games under Sam Allardyce as they had in 17 under Dick Advocaat (three).\nPatrick van Aanholt's strike was his first goal in the Premier League.\nGames involving Stoke have seen just 25 goals so far this season, fewer than any other team in the Premier League.\nSunderland mustered 18 shots (including blocked) - their highest number in a Premier League game this season.\nWhat's next for both sides?\nSunderland play away to Arsenal in the Premier League next Saturday, before welcoming Watford to the Stadium of Light the following Saturday.\nStoke play at home to Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday, before taking on Manchester City in the Premier League's early kick-off next Saturday.",

And the run may not be over yet.\nRooney's struggles continue\nEngland captain Rooney suffered another game of toil and struggle before he was substituted by Louis van Gaal after 67 minutes.\nRooney, 30, has had his worth continually questioned this season - both for club and country - and he did nothing here to dismiss the claims that he has lost many of his former formidable powers.\nHe looked off the pace as United struggled to get any rhythm, although he was not alone there, and took a couple of hefty bangs before he was replaced by Memphis Depay.\nRooney was not lacking effort, it was the inspiration and spark that was missing and he did not look like rediscovering it.\nCan Leicester keep mixing it at the top?\nIf Vardy is the man of the Premier League season, then Leicester City have been the team of the season - but can they keep it going?\nIt hardly takes huge expertise or insight to work out that so much depends on the form and fitness of Vardy - his pace, work-rate and goals give Claudio Ranieri's side an extra dimension.\nPlayers of Vardy's pace make even the best defences take a step back, instantly allowing others to profit from the space created by his threat.\nLeicester have plenty of other things going for them though - especially the raw talent, pace and unpredictability of the outstanding Riyad Mahrez.\nHe has rivalled Vardy for the headlines this season and is a potent threat, currently fuelled by a combination of neat adrenalin and confidence.\nRanieri has ditched his \"Tinkerman\" style in favour of stability and here at the King Power Stadium you get football in the raw, with the Foxes backed by a noisy, fanatical support only too happy to ride the wave that has been this Premier League season.\nPut that together and - while it is a stretch to suggest they will be serious title challengers - this season still holds huge potential for Leicester City.\n'You have to win these games'\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"I'm very, very happy. We wanted to win today, but also we wanted to help Jamie achieve the record. Well done to my players for helping Jamie Vardy to score.\n\"The whole team are in very good physical condition and they have a good mentality. They want to do their best until the end, and if the opponent is better than us on the day then well done to the opponent.\n\"Our first priority remains 40 points - that is our goal, to keep us in the Premier League.

Certainly by winning three in the first six, it takes us to where we want to be going.\n\"I said when I came here, I don't really want to be doing what the club has done over the last four years and have to win a huge amount of games in the last six or eight matches.\n\"Let's try not to get there and let's try to do it as quickly as we can.\"\n'The red card cost us'\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes: \"In the second half the sending off affected us.

He knows that and if we score at that point we would have very probably taken the game away from them.\n\"But we pick ourselves up. We have a big game on Tuesday and we will draw a line under this.\nMan of the match - Lee Cattermole (Sunderland)\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland have lost just one of their last nine Premier League meetings with Stoke (W5 D3 L1).\nThe Black Cats have now won as many league games in six games under Sam Allardyce as they had in 17 under Dick Advocaat (three).\nPatrick van Aanholt's strike was his first goal in the Premier League.\nGames involving Stoke have seen just 25 goals so far this season, fewer than any other team in the Premier League.\nSunderland mustered 18 shots (including blocked) - their highest number in a Premier League game this season.\nWhat's next for both sides?\nSunderland play away to Arsenal in the Premier League next Saturday, before welcoming Watford to the Stadium of Light the following Saturday.\nStoke play at home to Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday, before taking on Manchester City in the Premier League's early kick-off next Saturday."

And the run may not be over yet.\nRooney's struggles continue\nEngland captain Rooney suffered another game of toil and struggle before he was substituted by Louis van Gaal after 67 minutes.\nRooney, 30, has had his worth continually questioned this season - both for club and country - and he did nothing here to dismiss the claims that he has lost many of his former formidable powers.\nHe looked off the pace as United struggled to get any rhythm, although he was not alone there, and took a couple of hefty bangs before he was replaced by Memphis Depay.\nRooney was not lacking effort, it was the inspiration and spark that was missing and he did not look like rediscovering it.\nCan Leicester keep mixing it at the top?\nIf Vardy is the man of the Premier League season, then Leicester City have been the team of the season - but can they keep it going?\nIt hardly takes huge expertise or insight to work out that so much depends on the form and fitness of Vardy - his pace, work-rate and goals give Claudio Ranieri's side an extra dimension.\nPlayers of Vardy's pace make even the best defences take a step back, instantly allowing others to profit from the space created by his threat.\nLeicester have plenty of other things going for them though - especially the raw talent, pace and unpredictability of the outstanding Riyad Mahrez.\nHe has rivalled Vardy for the headlines this season and is a potent threat, currently fuelled by a combination of neat adrenalin and confidence.\nRanieri has ditched his \"Tinkerman\" style in favour of stability and here at the King Power Stadium you get football in the raw, with the Foxes backed by a noisy, fanatical support only too happy to ride the wave that has been this Premier League season.\nPut that together and - while it is a stretch to suggest they will be serious title challengers - this season still holds huge potential for Leicester City.\n'You have to win these games'\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"I'm very, very happy. We wanted to win today, but also we wanted to help Jamie achieve the record. Well done to my players for helping Jamie Vardy to score.\n\"The whole team are in very good physical condition and they have a good mentality. They want to do their best until the end, and if the opponent is better than us on the day then well done to the opponent.\n\"Our first priority remains 40 points - that is our goal, to keep us in the Premier League. As soon as we get there we can look to take another step.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I am very disappointed. It was a feeling that we could have won this game and we didn't. We gave the goal away and the other chances we had we gave away as well.\n\"We could have lost as well in spite of our dominance and I think we you want to be the champion at the end of the season, and the players, managers and supporters all want that, you have to win these kind of games.\n\"We created not so many chances but that was also because there were many chances in a very compact pitch.\"\nMan of the match: Jamie Vardy (Leicester City)\nThe stats you need to know\nVardy's 14 goals make him the highest scoring Leicester player in a single Premier League season, one above Tony Cottee who scored 13 in 1999-2000.\nManchester United (and David de Gea) conceded from open play in the Premier League for the first time in 545 minutes.\nBastian Schweinsteiger netted his first goal since May for Bayern Munich against Mainz - Leicester's Shinji Okazaki was playing for Mainz that day.\nChristian Fuchs registered his first assist in the Premier League for Jamie Vardy's goal, becoming the seventh Austrian to provide an assist for a Premier League goal.\nTwo of Daley Blind's three Premier League assists have come against Leicester.\nWhat's next for both sides?\nManchester United play at home to West Ham in the Premier League on Saturday, before travelling to Wolfsburg for a game they must win if they are to be certain of reaching the Champions League knockout stages.\nLeicester play away to Swansea in the Premier League next Saturday, before playing Chelsea in a Monday night kick-off, nine days later."

A free quick was taken quickly to King, who beat Brendon Galloway down the right and centred for Stanislas to fire in.\nCherries snatch point in frantic finish\nBy now, Bournemouth were exerting all the pressure, but it seemed that they would be denied a point by familiar defensive failings in the most heartbreaking fashion.\nSeamus Coleman drove into the area and the ball fell kindly for Barkley, who netted his third goal in two games with a shot on the turn.\nEverton looked assured of victory, but Bournemouth were not to be denied their first come-from-behind point of the season.\nCharlie Daniels clipped in a cross from the left and Stanislas buried a nerveless header past Tim Howard.\nMan of the match - Joshua King\nWhat they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It's unbelievable how football can play with your emotions. To score in the manner we did at the end was one of the biggest highs I've had in football. An incredible day, though this game is no good for your health. I'll be having an early night tonight.\n\"The character we showed today was excellent. We've shown our resolve and our willingness to improve, which we will need if we are going to get through this tough season. We are improving week on week. We have to now build on today's result.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"Our first-half performance was very good. We were in control, dominant and scored two goals. But in the second half we lost control, though you must expect the home side to come at you.\n\"We lacked that instinct to put the game to bed. With a two-goal lead you feel very comfortable. After the equaliser we showed good character to score a third. But it was a massive, massive blow to concede so late in the game, and it's a feeling of dropping two points.\n\"I don't know why the referee allowed play to continue for so long, but maybe it was luck for Bournemouth which they haven't had all season.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThe final two goals were timed at 94:45 and 97:13 - the two latest goals in the Premier League this season.\nRomelu Lukaku has already matched his tally of 10 Premier League goals from last season.\nRoss Barkley has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other English midfielder this season (11, six goals and five assists).\nBournemouth and Everton have now met four times.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Liverpool 1-0 Swansea City\nJurgen Klopp picked up his first league win at Anfield as James Milner's second-half penalty gave Liverpool the points in a stale game against Swansea.\nMilner converted after Swans full-back Neil Taylor was penalised for handball.\nLiverpool - so impressive in their win at Manchester City last week - were flat for large periods but did see captain Jordan Henderson return from injury as a substitute.\nSwansea have now won once in 10 league games since August.\nGarry Monk's side failed to record a single effort on target in 90 minutes and face the top two in Leicester and Manchester City in their next two games.\nRelive the match as it happened\nKlopp's Reds struggling for style at home?\nLiverpool's last two Premier League games away from home have seen them record hugely impressive wins at champions Chelsea and leaders Manchester City, with Klopp's preferred 'gegenpressing' style well suited to winning the ball back quickly and hurting teams on the break.\nBut in three league games at home, the Reds have scored just three times under Klopp and remain a work in progress.\nDespite a bright opening spell, during which Jordon Ibe forced defender Kyle Bartley to clear against his own post, the hosts soon ran out of steam and did not have an effort on target until the 52nd minute, when Ibe's tame shot was saved by Lukas Fabianski.\nIn truth, they were grateful to referee's assistant Simon Beck for the decisive moment when he awarded a penalty as Taylor blocked an Ibe cross with his arm.\nMilner lifted the spot-kick high into the net to give Liverpool a sixth win in seven games in all competitions, which lifted them up to sixth in the table.\nWith former captain Steven Gerrard watching from the stands, perhaps the biggest plusses Liverpool fans can take from the win are the returns of Henderson and Daniel Sturridge.\nHenderson - missing with a broken foot since the second game of the season in August - was handed the armband when he came on for the final 25 minutes, while Sturridge had a 19-minute run out for his first appearance since Klopp replaced Brendan Rodgers in October.\nMonk under increasing pressure?\nIf Liverpool looked uninspiring in attack, Swansea's failure to test Simon Mignolet at all will give manager Monk plenty to ponder.\nMore worryingly it was the second time in the last three Premier League matches that Swansea failed to hit a single effort on target - also registering no attempts in the 1-0 defeat at Norwich.\nMonk - who took charge in February 2014 - guided Swansea to their highest Premier League finish of eighth last season.\nWhen they beat Manchester United at the end of August the Swans were in fourth but they have won only once since, scoring seven goals in 10 matches.\nMonk can point to a harsh handball decision which settled the game but, in attack, his side offered precious little threat.\nCentre-forward Eder was often isolated and replacement Bafetimbi Gomis has lost the spark which saw him score in each of the opening four games of the season.\nWith testing games against Leicester and Manchester City to come a four-point gap to the relegation zone is a real concern.\n'Difficult circumstances'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: \"It was really difficult for both teams, the wind was in the stadium more than the stands.\n\"Swansea defended very well. They had some problems in the last few games but they were more compact. I am proud of the lads. It is a good result in difficult circumstances.\"\nMan of the match - Emre Can\nWhat next?\nLiverpool face a trip to Southampton on Wednesday for a League Cup quarter-final, before facing Newcastle at St James' Park next Sunday.\nLife does not get easier for Swansea as they host Jamie Vardy's Leicester next Saturday, and then travel to leaders Manchester City the week after."

A free quick was taken quickly to King, who beat Brendon Galloway down the right and centred for Stanislas to fire in.\nCherries snatch point in frantic finish\nBy now, Bournemouth were exerting all the pressure, but it seemed that they would be denied a point by familiar defensive failings in the most heartbreaking fashion.\nSeamus Coleman drove into the area and the ball fell kindly for Barkley, who netted his third goal in two games with a shot on the turn.\nEverton looked assured of victory, but Bournemouth were not to be denied their first come-from-behind point of the season.\nCharlie Daniels clipped in a cross from the left and Stanislas buried a nerveless header past Tim Howard.\nMan of the match - Joshua King\nWhat they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It's unbelievable how football can play with your emotions. To score in the manner we did at the end was one of the biggest highs I've had in football. An incredible day, though this game is no good for your health. I'll be having an early night tonight.\n\"The character we showed today was excellent. We've shown our resolve and our willingness to improve, which we will need if we are going to get through this tough season. We are improving week on week. We have to now build on today's result.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"Our first-half performance was very good. We were in control, dominant and scored two goals. But in the second half we lost control, though you must expect the home side to come at you.\n\"We lacked that instinct to put the game to bed. With a two-goal lead you feel very comfortable. After the equaliser we showed good character to score a third. But it was a massive, massive blow to concede so late in the game, and it's a feeling of dropping two points.\n\"I don't know why the referee allowed play to continue for so long, but maybe it was luck for Bournemouth which they haven't had all season.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThe final two goals were timed at 94:45 and 97:13 - the two latest goals in the Premier League this season.\nRomelu Lukaku has already matched his tally of 10 Premier League goals from last season.\nRoss Barkley has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other English midfielder this season (11, six goals and five assists).\nBournemouth and Everton have now met four times.

But not Quique Sanchez Flores.\nIn Deeney and Ighalo, the Spanish coach has statistically the most creative pairing in the league.\nBoth are incredibly hard working, and interchange where they play in attack. When Ighalo is furthest forward, the skipper plays behind him and vice versa.\nIt is a tactic that works because both have the physical strength to challenge the last defender with balls played through and over the top, and both can hold the ball up in deep positions before releasing the other.\nThe duo have now combined to create 24 goal-scoring chances for each other in the Premier League this campaign - more than any other pair.\nImmense Ighalo\nDeeney grabbed his fifth in six Premier League games on Saturday, but today it was Ighalo who deserved the plaudits after he gave the Canaries defence a tough workout.\nThe 26 year old was 'shifted' to Hertfordshire in 2014 from Udinese - a club run by the Pozzo family,\n, external\nwho also own Watford. He has been one of the players of the Premier League season so far.\nSebastian Bassong was asked to mark the Nigerian today. It was a battle the Cameroonian looked set to win having put him off his stride during two goalscoring chances.\nBut Ighalo never gave up, and in the 91st minute the Nigeria international outmuscled his shadow to fire home. The assist? Deeney once again.\nHuff and puff but no bite\nOf their six defeats in the last eight games, in only one match have Norwich conceded more than two goals. That was the 6-2 defeat at Newcastle, which was not a fair reflection of the way the Canaries performed.\nDespite conceding twice, Alex Neil should have no qualms about his side defended. His problems are at the other end.\nLewis Grabban failed to have a shot on target and was substituted midway through the second half. Dieumerci Mbokani was brought on at half-time to provide more of an aerial and physical threat but made little contribution. Midfielder Robbie Brady had the best effort for his side with a shot that went three yards wide.\nFour goals in the last eight league games tells the tale.\nMan of the match - Odion Ighalo (Watford)\nWhat the managers said\nWatford boss Quique Flores, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"It was difficult to play Norwich. They put a lot of strikers on the pitch and played the long ball. We tried to keep calm until the last moment and still counter attack. Finally I think the result is clear because we had a lot of chances - especially in the second half.\n\"The wind was very hard for both teams. But in the second half we protected the ball better. I think we played a good match.\n\"Ighalo is not just scoring goals but he is also supporting the offensive system with Deeney, who is creating chances too.\n\"The players here have been really focused since the beginning of the season. They are very positive, and it's true that we have a lot of new players, but they are very good professionals. We are still improving.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"The conditions didn't make for a great game and they dealt with them better. There wasn't anything between the teams. At this level the first goal is absolutely crucial. To give it away in the manner we did, it didn't do us any favours.\n\"To lose 2-0 is extremely disappointing. As the game opened up we left more space at the back, but that is the price you pay when you concede the first goal.\n\"Robbie Brady had a couple of good chances, there was a bad touch and a bad finish. There were wee bits and bobs throughout the game, but I don't think we did enough.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDeeney is the first Watford player to score in four consecutive Premier League appearances.\nThe Hornets have score three penalty goals this season, only Leicester have netted more (five).\nIghalo has been directly involved in six goals in his last six top-flight appearances (4 goals, 2 assists).\nIghalo has also scored more goals than any other player in the top four tiers in 2015 (25).\nNorwich have managed just one clean sheet in the Premier League this season (no team has no clean sheets).\nWhat next?\nThe Hornets travel to Sunderland, another struggling team, next Saturday. Alex Neil's Norwich, with six defeats in their last eight league matches, host Everton.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Everton 1-1 Crystal Palace\nRomelu Lukaku scored his sixth goal in five league games to equalise with a late strike in an entertaining match against Crystal Palace.\nPoor Everton defending allowed Scott Dann to head Palace in front late on as the Londoners looked on course to win.\nBut Lukaku - who had twice struck the woodwork - tapped in Gerard Deulofeu's low cross from two yards for a deserved point for the dominant hosts.\nPalace's Jordon Mutch sent a shot wide as both sides searched for a winner.\nThe draw was still enough to move Palace to sixth on goal difference, though manager Alan Pardew will be disappointed that his team only held their lead for five minutes, to drop points from a winning position for the first time this season.\nBut Everton dominated possession and, in the second half in particular, were adventurous and easy on the eye.\nRead reaction from the draw between Everton and Palace.\n5 live Football Daily podcast: 'We've made Lukaku a better player'\nEverton's fab four shine\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez has boasted he has some of the most valuable young talent in Europe at his disposal and the Spaniard's highly-prised quartet strengthened the manager's claim with their performances against Palace.\nRecord signing Lukaku, Ross Barkley, John Stones and Gerard Deulofeu - aged 22, 22, 21 and 21 respectively - were authoritative and influential, as they have been all season.\nLukaku's power posed Palace problems, with the post denying him a first-half goal and the crossbar stopping him from equalising straight after Palace took the lead.\nBarkley and Deulofeu were inventive, with the latter's sublime second-half free-kick forcing Connor Wickham to head a defensive header onto his own crossbar, while it was former Barcelona prodigy Deulofeu who again provided the assist to his ruthless team-mate.\nAt the back, Stones anticipated play brilliantly and, as has become routine this campaign, had the confidence and guile to glide out of defence and even pose a threat in the final third - a quick turn in the box followed up by a dangerous cross was a particular highlight.\nMartinez has said a Champions League place is the club's aim this season and he certainly has four players who, on current form, would be at ease facing Europe's elite.\nMan of the match - Lukaku\nOnly Jamie Vardy, the Premier League's top scorer with 14, has scored more league goals than the \u00a328m Lukaku, while he is on course to become the first Everton striker to score more than 20 league goals since Gary Lineker in 1985-86\nThe Belgian has consistently been a threat, missing only 39 minutes of action this campaign, and was a menace against Palace before levelling with his 50th goal in a century of Everton appearances.\nMartinez describe his striker as sensational, adding: \"He is always there to give us a focal point and score goals.\n\"It was a big moment. One hundred games is a landmark and 50 goals is a remarkable return. He is in a very good moment of his career. He is vital in everything we are trying to do.\"\nPalace at home on the road\nPalace have already picked up more points away from home than at Selhurst Park this season and, having thrashed Newcastle 5-1 at home in their previous league outing, are a team in form.\nBut their sporadic attacks mainly came on the counter-attack against Everton and a Wickham header at the near post, which forced a fine save from Tim Howard, was the closest they came to scoring before Dann gave his team the lead against the run of play.\nIt had been all Everton after the break before the defender got the better of the static Gareth Barry and Arouna Kone at a corner to score with a simple header, for his second goal at Goodison in three seasons.\nBut Palace must be praised for holding firm when under pressure, with such stoicism illustrating why they have been successful on the road. Since Pardew took charge in January, the Eagles have collected 31 points away from home with only Arsenal of the Premier League's clubs amassing more.\nPalace argued for a penalty when Barry tugged on Mile Jedinak's shirt, but Pardew believed a draw was a fair result.\n\"If we could have seen that five minutes out after our goal, it might have been different, but all credit to Everton - they kept coming and we are really pleased with a draw as it takes us sixth and with a home game to come,\" said the Eagles boss.\nThe stats you need to know\nCrystal Palace have lost just one of their last five Premier League games against Everton (W2 D2 L1).\nCrystal Palace have scored the highest proportion of goals from set-pieces this season in the Premier League (45%).\nBelgian striker Lukaku has scored in each of his last three Premier League appearances against Crystal Palace.\nCrystal Palace have won more points away at Everton (13) in the Premier League than they have away at any other team.\nScott Dann has scored in back-to-back Premier League away appearances - both coming in Merseyside (v Liverpool and Everton).\nWhat next?\nEverton, unbeaten in seven games, will be confident of extending their run should they continue to perform with such assurance against their next three opponents - Norwich (away on Saturday at 12:45 GMT), Leicester (home) and Newcastle (away). Crystal Palace, meanwhile, host Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT) before travelling to Stoke."

It meant they missed the chance to go second and take advantage of rivals Manchester City's 2-0 loss at Stoke.\nIt could have been worse, though, had midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger been sent off for raising his arm at West Ham defender Reid in the first half - the incident went unpunished by the referee.\nRelive the goalless draw from Old Trafford here\nGoals are coming, says Van Gaal\nFans unhappy with wayward Man Utd\nCaptain Wayne Rooney has borne the brunt of much of the Old Trafford fans' frustration this season, unhappy with the striker's contributions as well as the team's style of play.\nThe side managed a narrow 2-1 victory at Watford in their last top-flight game without him but this time they failed to break down a resolute West Ham defence.\nVan Gaal's preference for a slow and patient build-up has now yielded five goalless draws in his side's past nine games in all competitions.\nMartial, on his 20th birthday, was deployed as the furthest man forward and had chances in both halves, but failed to work Spanish keeper Adrian, while Jesse Lingard blazed wide late on.\nA visiting goalkeeper at Old Trafford can generally expect to be kept busy, but only had one save to make from Fellaini's close-range shot, much to the dissatisfaction of the home support who booed their team off at full-time.\nReid leads way to a welcome shut-out\nPrior to this game, West Ham boss Slaven Bilic had masterminded impressive away wins at Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool. The Hammers could easily have made Manchester United another scalp.\nSitting back for much of the game, they caused their hosts problems on the break as winger Victor Moses struck straight at David de Gea when through on goal early on.\nBut it was in defence that the visitors were most impressive, led by the central defensive partnership of Winston Reid and Angelo Ogbonna. Both players made seven clearances in the match - the most of anyone on the pitch.\nIn front of them, midfielder Alex Song made his first start of the season following injury and added bite, making seven tackles - more than any other player.\nIt was a welcome clean sheet for West Ham, who had gone nine games without one before this, but they have now gone five games in the league without victory.\nMan of the match - Winston Reid\nWhat they said:\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"The most important thing is you dominate, create and you finish. Football is scoring goals. The first two basic aspects of football we have done. When you don't finish from a metre in front of an empty goal you can say nothing anymore.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: On the clash between Bastian Schweinsteiger and Winston Reid: \"To be fair I didn't see it when it happened.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Swansea City 0-3 Leicester City\nRiyad Mahrez's hat-trick propelled Leicester to the top of the Premier League as they beat Swansea to increase the pressure on manager Garry Monk.\nMahrez headed the Foxes in front after five minutes and fired in calmly for his second, although he seemed offside.\nSwansea's Ki Sung-yueng headed against the bar after the break, but Mahrez finished an incisive counter-attack to seal his first ever hat-trick.\nManchester City's defeat by Stoke sees Leicester leapfrog them at the summit.\nThis result leaves the Swans, 15th in the league, four points above the relegation zone, having won only one of their last 11 league matches.\nManager Monk's position had already been under intense scrutiny and, having heard his side booed for a second successive home game, there will be more doubts than ever about his future.\nMahrez outshines Vardy\nThe pre-match attention was inevitably focused on Leicester's Jamie Vardy, who had set a Premier League record by scoring for an 11th successive game against Manchester United.\nBut the former Fleetwood striker had to settle for a supporting role as Mahrez took centre stage.\nBoth the Algerian's first two goals were fortuitous, but they were no more than Claudio Ranieri's side deserved for an utterly dominant first half.\nMahrez's opening goal was a scrappy one, the ball flicked on from a corner and appeared to hit his head and arm before trickling over the line.\nThe 24-year-old's second was a more conventional finish - confidently swept into the bottom corner - but he seemed to be offside from N'Golo Kante's pass.\nPiling the pressure on Monk\nMonk said his players were affected by the \"tension and anxiety\" of the Liberty crowd when they fell behind 2-0 to Bournemouth a fortnight earlier.\nBut whereas the Swans recovered to draw 2-2 against the Cherries, they looked like cannon fodder for Leicester.\nCentre-backs Ashley Williams and Kyle Bartley seemed nervous, the latter needlessly conceding a corner for the opening goal and presenting Vardy with a glorious chance to score for a 12th successive game.\nTheir unease extended to the rest of the team, with Swansea struggling to keep possession or create any opportunities of note.\nAnd it will have been the dismal performance as much as the result which will compound the concerns of an already worried Swansea board.\nLeicester's unlikely title challenge\nManchester City's defeat to Stoke had presented Leicester with the opportunity to reclaim their place at the top of the table and, as Ranieri's men have done so often this season, they seized the moment.\nThe Foxes were barely tested by a dreadful first-half showing from Swansea, but they were incisive and clinical when they needed to be.\nMonk's men posed more of a threat after the interval, with Ki heading against the bar and Gylfi Sigurdsson's whipped shot hitting the post.\nBut Leicester were still in control and they eliminated any slim chance of a Swansea revival when a swift counter-attack involving Leonardo Ulloa and Vardy was finished by Mahrez's low, firm shot.\nLeicester are now two points clear at the top of the table and, with the busy festive period looming, they find themselves in the unlikely position of being early title challengers.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez\nWhat they said\nSwansea manager Garry Monk: \"It was a poor first half from us. Those first two goals were extremely soft. The first one was clearly handball, the second was clearly offside, but the results haven't been good enough in this period.\n\"I feel sorry for the fans. We're not playing like this club can play, like these players can play.\n\"It's very difficult to analyse and put your finger on it. The results aren't acceptable and I'm fully aware of that, and it's up to me to put it right.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We are thinking about ourselves, to take points and make good football. That is our first goal, to achieve 40 points, to be safe.\n\"It was a tough match because Swansea play very good football. We started very well, we scored three goals, and had a minimum other four clear chances and I'm very pleased.\n\"Our fans they must dream, but we must stay calm and keep our feet on the ground.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nRiyard Mahrez becomes the first Algerian player to score a Premier League hat-trick.\nMahrez has now been involved in 16 Premier League goals this season (10 goals, 6 assists) - a record only team-mate Jamie Vardy can match (14 goals, 2 assists).\nThe midfielder became only the third Leicester player to score a Premier League hat-trick, after Ian Marshall and Stan Collymore.\nThe Swans have won just one of their last 11 Premier League games (D3 L7).\nMeanwhile, the Foxes have lost just one of their last 19 top-flight games (W12 D6).\nClaudio Ranieri's side are the only team to have scored in all 15 games this season.\nWhat next?\nLeicester face a tricky run of fixtures, with Chelsea their next league opponents - followed by away trips to Everton and Liverpool - but on recent form they have proved they are capable of competing with the best. Swansea, meanwhile, desperately need a league win, though their next match is away to title contenders Manchester City."

One hundred games is a landmark and 50 goals is a remarkable return. He is in a very good moment of his career. He is vital in everything we are trying to do.\"\nPalace at home on the road\nPalace have already picked up more points away from home than at Selhurst Park this season and, having thrashed Newcastle 5-1 at home in their previous league outing, are a team in form.\nBut their sporadic attacks mainly came on the counter-attack against Everton and a Wickham header at the near post, which forced a fine save from Tim Howard, was the closest they came to scoring before Dann gave his team the lead against the run of play.\nIt had been all Everton after the break before the defender got the better of the static Gareth Barry and Arouna Kone at a corner to score with a simple header, for his second goal at Goodison in three seasons.\nBut Palace must be praised for holding firm when under pressure, with such stoicism illustrating why they have been successful on the road. Since Pardew took charge in January, the Eagles have collected 31 points away from home with only Arsenal of the Premier League's clubs amassing more.\nPalace argued for a penalty when Barry tugged on Mile Jedinak's shirt, but Pardew believed a draw was a fair result.\n\"If we could have seen that five minutes out after our goal, it might have been different, but all credit to Everton - they kept coming and we are really pleased with a draw as it takes us sixth and with a home game to come,\" said the Eagles boss.\nThe stats you need to know\nCrystal Palace have lost just one of their last five Premier League games against Everton (W2 D2 L1).\nCrystal Palace have scored the highest proportion of goals from set-pieces this season in the Premier League (45%).\nBelgian striker Lukaku has scored in each of his last three Premier League appearances against Crystal Palace.\nCrystal Palace have won more points away at Everton (13) in the Premier League than they have away at any other team.\nScott Dann has scored in back-to-back Premier League away appearances - both coming in Merseyside (v Liverpool and Everton).\nWhat next?\nEverton, unbeaten in seven games, will be confident of extending their run should they continue to perform with such assurance against their next three opponents - Norwich (away on Saturday at 12:45 GMT), Leicester (home) and Newcastle (away). Crystal Palace, meanwhile, host Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT) before travelling to Stoke.",

We rode our luck.\n\"But we showed grit and determination, the manager wanted more desire from us and we showed that.\"\nHow did Southampton not win?\nSouthampton ended a run of three defeats with the draw but they will be left scratching their heads at how they did not win.\nThe home side could have been three up in the first 20 minutes but lacked a clinical edge in front of goal.\nDusan Tadic shot high after Sadio Mane's cut back, Pelle also cleared the bar from close range while Fonte had an effort kicked off the line by Rudy Gestede as Villa's goal led a charmed life in the early stages.\nSaints had more than 60% possession during the match, 23 shots compared to Villa's nine, 10 corners in contrast to four for the visitors and they put in 45 crosses as opposed 10 from the Midlands outfit.\nThe deserved equaliser for the St Mary's side eventually came from an unlikely source as Romeu scored his first goal for the club from almost exactly the same spot as Lescott after Villa failed to deal with a corner.\nMan of the match - Joleon Lescott\nWhat the managers said:\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"Normally you don't sign up for one point at home, but it's a point. We made it difficult for ourselves. We had three or four big chances to score and then we concede.\n\"Last year we were 4-0 up against Villa [when Saints won 6-1] and we didn't start as well as today! But we didn't score and that is the detail in football. For the first time in maybe two seasons we conceded such a soft goal from a corner.\"\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"It is a big point. We have suffered a lot, Southampton created many chances and we were under pressure for long periods. But we showed a very good spirit. I'm happy about that.\n\"I prefer to have this solidarity in every game than have much more talent. Solidarity is the key when you are fighting relegation. If we show this spirit again we will get more points.\n\"The talent at Aston Villa is not the same as at Manchester City or Arsenal but they still lose games.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAston Villa have dropped 10 points from leading positions this season, a joint league-high along with Newcastle.\nFollowing a six-game unbeaten run, Ronald Koeman's side are winless in their last three Premier League games (D1 L2).\nVilla picked up their first point on the road since their 1-0 win at Bournemouth on the opening day of the campaign.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton are at Crystal Palace on Saturday, 12 December, while Aston Villa host Arsenal a day later."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Arsenal 3-1 Sunderland\nOlivier Giroud scored for both teams as below-par Arsenal battled past Sunderland to end a run of three Premier League games without a win.\nArsenal were poor for long periods, but led when Joel Campbell finished from a Mesut Ozil through ball.\nSunderland deservedly levelled through a free-kick that Giroud deflected into his own net.\nBut Giroud made amends with a header from virtually the same spot, before Aaron Ramsey scrambled a late third.\nSunderland, who have been dragged back into the relegation zone by Bournemouth's win at Chelsea, can rightly feel hard done by after a performance of both disciplined defence and incisive attacking play.\nArsenal were hampered by the absence of both Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez and looked ponderous going forward, while a shaky defence was indebted to the excellence of goalkeeper Petr Cech.\nStill, they climb to second in the Premier League, two points behind leaders Leicester.\nGiroud makes amends\nGiroud's performance was almost Arsenal in microcosm - the own goal an error caused by Sunderland pressure, but ultimately enough quality to secure a victory that was barely deserved.\nA lacklustre first-half display looked set to be behind the Gunners when Campbell finished a seven-pass move underneath the on-rushing Costel Pantilimon.\nBut they were ahead for only 12 minutes as the impressive Duncan Watmore won a free-kick on the left that was swung in by Yann M'Vila and accidentally steered home by the leg of Giroud.\nArsenal showed little sign of improving in the second half, but, as in the first, one flowing move was enough to cut through an otherwise organised Sunderland defence.\nNacho Monreal was heavily involved as Arsenal came down the left, with Giroud stooping to head Ramsey's cross into the same part of the net he erroneously found in the first half.\nThe third, in the dying moments, was harsh on a Sunderland team looking for an equaliser. With visiting defenders outnumbered, Ramsey pounced to leave a scoreline that did not reflect the contest.\nBig Gunners stand up\nWith so many players out injured, Arsenal needed their most experienced men to perform and Ozil and Cech delivered.\nVirtually all of Arsenal's attacking play went through Ozil, but it was the performance of Cech that was perhaps most telling.\nHe made saves from Fabio Borini and a Mathieu Flamini deflection in the first half and, most importantly, brilliantly denied Steven Fletcher in the second.\nAs Fletcher arrived at the back post from a corner, Cech moved across his goal to stop the ball virtually on the line. Moments later, Arsenal were ahead.\nWilling Watmore\nSunderland arrived at the Emirates on the back of two wins and two clean sheets.\nWhile they defended with nine behind the ball, they also carried an attacking threat, particularly through the industry of Watmore - indeed, Arsenal ended with six defenders on the pitch.\nMaking only his second Premier League start in place of the injured Jermain Defoe, the 21-year-old not only did his defensive duties but regularly had the legs to get up in support of Fletcher.\nHe won the free-kick that resulted in Sunderland's goal and also, with the score still at 2-1, got behind the Arsenal defence only to fire a tame shot straight at Cech.\nAnd, while it was Watmore who impressed, the Black Cats demonstrated that Sam Allardyce has brought both enough solidity and potency to suggest that fight against relegation can be won.\nMan of the match - Petr Cech\nWhat they said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"We started a bit nervous and edgy in the first half. We were unlucky to come in at 1-1, so I was positive. I told the players they still had 45 minutes to win the game, and play with more pace and different angles. You see this Premier League is a battle. Sunderland played a dangerous game on the break.\n\"It could have been one of those days, but we kept our determination and the mental aspect was good. We have lost players in the heart of our game, so we had to find a balance again. It took us time to get going.\n\"[Premier League leaders] Leicester have been very impressive. The best you can do is to win games, and hope that they drop points, but that is not happening. We go to Olympiakos in midweek, which Leicester don't do, so they have an advantage in that way too.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"I couldn't ask for any more in terms of the way we played, I couldn't have asked for more in terms of the chances we created, but we failed to take the chances we had.\n\"It makes me wonder what would have happened if we'd had Jermain Defoe on the field. He could have had two or three goals. I'm really disappointed we haven't got anything out of the game, but I have to be satisfied with the performance.\n\"I think we've got goalscorers. We've got Steven Fletcher, we've got Duncan Watmore. We've got Jermain to come back.

But not Quique Sanchez Flores.\nIn Deeney and Ighalo, the Spanish coach has statistically the most creative pairing in the league.\nBoth are incredibly hard working, and interchange where they play in attack. When Ighalo is furthest forward, the skipper plays behind him and vice versa.\nIt is a tactic that works because both have the physical strength to challenge the last defender with balls played through and over the top, and both can hold the ball up in deep positions before releasing the other.\nThe duo have now combined to create 24 goal-scoring chances for each other in the Premier League this campaign - more than any other pair.\nImmense Ighalo\nDeeney grabbed his fifth in six Premier League games on Saturday, but today it was Ighalo who deserved the plaudits after he gave the Canaries defence a tough workout.\nThe 26 year old was 'shifted' to Hertfordshire in 2014 from Udinese - a club run by the Pozzo family,\n, external\nwho also own Watford. He has been one of the players of the Premier League season so far.\nSebastian Bassong was asked to mark the Nigerian today. It was a battle the Cameroonian looked set to win having put him off his stride during two goalscoring chances.\nBut Ighalo never gave up, and in the 91st minute the Nigeria international outmuscled his shadow to fire home. The assist? Deeney once again.\nHuff and puff but no bite\nOf their six defeats in the last eight games, in only one match have Norwich conceded more than two goals. That was the 6-2 defeat at Newcastle, which was not a fair reflection of the way the Canaries performed.\nDespite conceding twice, Alex Neil should have no qualms about his side defended. His problems are at the other end.\nLewis Grabban failed to have a shot on target and was substituted midway through the second half. Dieumerci Mbokani was brought on at half-time to provide more of an aerial and physical threat but made little contribution. Midfielder Robbie Brady had the best effort for his side with a shot that went three yards wide.\nFour goals in the last eight league games tells the tale.\nMan of the match - Odion Ighalo (Watford)\nWhat the managers said\nWatford boss Quique Flores, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"It was difficult to play Norwich. They put a lot of strikers on the pitch and played the long ball. We tried to keep calm until the last moment and still counter attack. Finally I think the result is clear because we had a lot of chances - especially in the second half.\n\"The wind was very hard for both teams. But in the second half we protected the ball better. I think we played a good match.\n\"Ighalo is not just scoring goals but he is also supporting the offensive system with Deeney, who is creating chances too.\n\"The players here have been really focused since the beginning of the season. They are very positive, and it's true that we have a lot of new players, but they are very good professionals. We are still improving.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"The conditions didn't make for a great game and they dealt with them better. There wasn't anything between the teams. At this level the first goal is absolutely crucial. To give it away in the manner we did, it didn't do us any favours.\n\"To lose 2-0 is extremely disappointing. As the game opened up we left more space at the back, but that is the price you pay when you concede the first goal.\n\"Robbie Brady had a couple of good chances, there was a bad touch and a bad finish. There were wee bits and bobs throughout the game, but I don't think we did enough.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDeeney is the first Watford player to score in four consecutive Premier League appearances.\nThe Hornets have score three penalty goals this season, only Leicester have netted more (five).\nIghalo has been directly involved in six goals in his last six top-flight appearances (4 goals, 2 assists).\nIghalo has also scored more goals than any other player in the top four tiers in 2015 (25).\nNorwich have managed just one clean sheet in the Premier League this season (no team has no clean sheets).\nWhat next?\nThe Hornets travel to Sunderland, another struggling team, next Saturday. Alex Neil's Norwich, with six defeats in their last eight league matches, host Everton."

The 14-point gap to the top four is beginning to look insurmountable.\nChelsea started once again without Diego Costa, only for the Spain striker - who responded angrily to being an unused substitute against Tottenham last Sunday - to be summoned at the interval.\nHe did offer a greater presence to a hitherto meek attack, winning the odd header and occupying the visitors' centre-backs, but could not conjure the goal that would have settled the growing nerves around Stamford Bridge.\nThe closest Costa came was first narrowly failing to connect with a flashing Branoslav Ivanovic cross, then having a prodded effort blocked by Artur Boruc. He also claimed forlornly for a penalty when his cross struck the arm of the sliding Simon Francis, but referee Mike Jones waved away the appeal.\nIt meant that his only appearance in the official's notebook was for a booking, received for tugging down Matt Ritchie.\nCalm, composed and clinical\nChelsea were unbeaten in 43 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge against promoted clubs but will rarely have faced one as confident and composed as Eddie Howe's side were.\nBournemouth were comfortable on the ball and ambitious in their use of it, which allowed them to squeeze up the pitch and cleave open their more feted hosts on several occasions.\nIndeed, had it not been for returning Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois - who had not played since the defeat by Crystal Palace in August after damaging medial knee ligaments - the visitors might have won more comfortably. The Belgian thwarted Josh King three times in the opening half after being preferred to Asmir Begovic,\nHowever, he was unconvincing in his attempts to claim Junior Stanislas' 82nd-minute corner, his weak punch being directed back towards goal by Steve Cook before Murray planted a header into the unguarded net. Mourinho might also question Branislav Ivanovic's tame attempt to prevent Cook winning the loose ball.\nMan of the match - Harry Arter\nWhat they said:\nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho: \"The result is not fair. In the first half we were soft and did not press and were not aggressive and were not intense. In the second half everything changed. We were aggressive, created chances and had crosses and a clear penalty that the referee did not see. That is the game.\n\"In the moment when our opponent were thinking just about defending a clean sheet they cross the halfway line for the first time and scored. If it was offside it is another episode that goes against us, but I did not see it.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was really emotional in the dressing room afterwards. I'm so proud of them.\n\"We defended so well, put our bodies on the line and didn't succumb to the pressure. We hung in there and that was crucial. We've talked all season about trying to score more goals from corner and free kicks and it happened today.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea went 388 minutes (all comps) without conceding a goal until Glenn Murray scored\nBournemouth (18) have now scored more goals than Chelsea (17) this season\nNo reigning Premier League champion has won fewer (four) or lost more (eight) after 15 games than Chelsea this season\nIn the Premier League this season, no side has conceded more goals in the last 15 minutes of games than Chelsea (seven - level with Norwich)\nNo Premier League team has ever finished higher than eighth after having exactly 15 points from the first 15 games\nWhat next?\nChelsea host Porto in the Champions League on Wednesday, needing to avoid defeat to advance, then visit league leaders Leicester City the following Monday.

It meant they missed the chance to go second and take advantage of rivals Manchester City's 2-0 loss at Stoke.\nIt could have been worse, though, had midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger been sent off for raising his arm at West Ham defender Reid in the first half - the incident went unpunished by the referee.\nRelive the goalless draw from Old Trafford here\nGoals are coming, says Van Gaal\nFans unhappy with wayward Man Utd\nCaptain Wayne Rooney has borne the brunt of much of the Old Trafford fans' frustration this season, unhappy with the striker's contributions as well as the team's style of play.\nThe side managed a narrow 2-1 victory at Watford in their last top-flight game without him but this time they failed to break down a resolute West Ham defence.\nVan Gaal's preference for a slow and patient build-up has now yielded five goalless draws in his side's past nine games in all competitions.\nMartial, on his 20th birthday, was deployed as the furthest man forward and had chances in both halves, but failed to work Spanish keeper Adrian, while Jesse Lingard blazed wide late on.\nA visiting goalkeeper at Old Trafford can generally expect to be kept busy, but only had one save to make from Fellaini's close-range shot, much to the dissatisfaction of the home support who booed their team off at full-time.\nReid leads way to a welcome shut-out\nPrior to this game, West Ham boss Slaven Bilic had masterminded impressive away wins at Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool. The Hammers could easily have made Manchester United another scalp.\nSitting back for much of the game, they caused their hosts problems on the break as winger Victor Moses struck straight at David de Gea when through on goal early on.\nBut it was in defence that the visitors were most impressive, led by the central defensive partnership of Winston Reid and Angelo Ogbonna. Both players made seven clearances in the match - the most of anyone on the pitch.\nIn front of them, midfielder Alex Song made his first start of the season following injury and added bite, making seven tackles - more than any other player.\nIt was a welcome clean sheet for West Ham, who had gone nine games without one before this, but they have now gone five games in the league without victory.\nMan of the match - Winston Reid\nWhat they said:\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"The most important thing is you dominate, create and you finish. Football is scoring goals. The first two basic aspects of football we have done. When you don't finish from a metre in front of an empty goal you can say nothing anymore.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: On the clash between Bastian Schweinsteiger and Winston Reid: \"To be fair I didn't see it when it happened. At half-time they showed me and it's a clear red card. A straight red without any doubts.\n\"I said to the referee I can't blame him because he simply didn't see it and it happens. They were concentrating on the ball and I can't blame him no matter how disappointed we are.\"\nWhat next?\nManchester United head to Germany on Tuesday (kick-off 19:45 GMT) almost certainly needing a win against Wolfsburg to stay in the Champions League, while West Ham host Stoke in the Premier League next Saturday (kick-off 15:00 GMT).\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester United are unbeaten in their last 14 Premier League meetings with West Ham, winning 11 and drawing three\nUnited have kept nine clean sheets this season, the most in the Premier League. They racked up 11 in the whole of last season\nThe Red Devils have lost just two Premier League home games in 2015, a joint-lowest along with Arsenal and Tottenham\nWest Ham have taken 14 points from away games this campaign, having secured just 16 last season under Sam Allardyce"

We rode our luck.\n\"But we showed grit and determination, the manager wanted more desire from us and we showed that.\"\nHow did Southampton not win?\nSouthampton ended a run of three defeats with the draw but they will be left scratching their heads at how they did not win.\nThe home side could have been three up in the first 20 minutes but lacked a clinical edge in front of goal.\nDusan Tadic shot high after Sadio Mane's cut back, Pelle also cleared the bar from close range while Fonte had an effort kicked off the line by Rudy Gestede as Villa's goal led a charmed life in the early stages.\nSaints had more than 60% possession during the match, 23 shots compared to Villa's nine, 10 corners in contrast to four for the visitors and they put in 45 crosses as opposed 10 from the Midlands outfit.\nThe deserved equaliser for the St Mary's side eventually came from an unlikely source as Romeu scored his first goal for the club from almost exactly the same spot as Lescott after Villa failed to deal with a corner.\nMan of the match - Joleon Lescott\nWhat the managers said:\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"Normally you don't sign up for one point at home, but it's a point. We made it difficult for ourselves. We had three or four big chances to score and then we concede.\n\"Last year we were 4-0 up against Villa [when Saints won 6-1] and we didn't start as well as today! But we didn't score and that is the detail in football. For the first time in maybe two seasons we conceded such a soft goal from a corner.\"\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"It is a big point. We have suffered a lot, Southampton created many chances and we were under pressure for long periods. But we showed a very good spirit. I'm happy about that.\n\"I prefer to have this solidarity in every game than have much more talent. Solidarity is the key when you are fighting relegation. If we show this spirit again we will get more points.\n\"The talent at Aston Villa is not the same as at Manchester City or Arsenal but they still lose games.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAston Villa have dropped 10 points from leading positions this season, a joint league-high along with Newcastle.\nFollowing a six-game unbeaten run, Ronald Koeman's side are winless in their last three Premier League games (D1 L2).\nVilla picked up their first point on the road since their 1-0 win at Bournemouth on the opening day of the campaign.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton are at Crystal Palace on Saturday, 12 December, while Aston Villa host Arsenal a day later.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Arsenal 3-1 Sunderland\nOlivier Giroud scored for both teams as below-par Arsenal battled past Sunderland to end a run of three Premier League games without a win.\nArsenal were poor for long periods, but led when Joel Campbell finished from a Mesut Ozil through ball.\nSunderland deservedly levelled through a free-kick that Giroud deflected into his own net.\nBut Giroud made amends with a header from virtually the same spot, before Aaron Ramsey scrambled a late third.\nSunderland, who have been dragged back into the relegation zone by Bournemouth's win at Chelsea, can rightly feel hard done by after a performance of both disciplined defence and incisive attacking play.\nArsenal were hampered by the absence of both Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez and looked ponderous going forward, while a shaky defence was indebted to the excellence of goalkeeper Petr Cech.\nStill, they climb to second in the Premier League, two points behind leaders Leicester.\nGiroud makes amends\nGiroud's performance was almost Arsenal in microcosm - the own goal an error caused by Sunderland pressure, but ultimately enough quality to secure a victory that was barely deserved.\nA lacklustre first-half display looked set to be behind the Gunners when Campbell finished a seven-pass move underneath the on-rushing Costel Pantilimon.\nBut they were ahead for only 12 minutes as the impressive Duncan Watmore won a free-kick on the left that was swung in by Yann M'Vila and accidentally steered home by the leg of Giroud.\nArsenal showed little sign of improving in the second half, but, as in the first, one flowing move was enough to cut through an otherwise organised Sunderland defence.\nNacho Monreal was heavily involved as Arsenal came down the left, with Giroud stooping to head Ramsey's cross into the same part of the net he erroneously found in the first half.\nThe third, in the dying moments, was harsh on a Sunderland team looking for an equaliser. With visiting defenders outnumbered, Ramsey pounced to leave a scoreline that did not reflect the contest.\nBig Gunners stand up\nWith so many players out injured, Arsenal needed their most experienced men to perform and Ozil and Cech delivered.\nVirtually all of Arsenal's attacking play went through Ozil, but it was the performance of Cech that was perhaps most telling.\nHe made saves from Fabio Borini and a Mathieu Flamini deflection in the first half and, most importantly, brilliantly denied Steven Fletcher in the second.\nAs Fletcher arrived at the back post from a corner, Cech moved across his goal to stop the ball virtually on the line. Moments later, Arsenal were ahead.\nWilling Watmore\nSunderland arrived at the Emirates on the back of two wins and two clean sheets.\nWhile they defended with nine behind the ball, they also carried an attacking threat, particularly through the industry of Watmore - indeed, Arsenal ended with six defenders on the pitch.\nMaking only his second Premier League start in place of the injured Jermain Defoe, the 21-year-old not only did his defensive duties but regularly had the legs to get up in support of Fletcher.\nHe won the free-kick that resulted in Sunderland's goal and also, with the score still at 2-1, got behind the Arsenal defence only to fire a tame shot straight at Cech.\nAnd, while it was Watmore who impressed, the Black Cats demonstrated that Sam Allardyce has brought both enough solidity and potency to suggest that fight against relegation can be won.\nMan of the match - Petr Cech\nWhat they said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"We started a bit nervous and edgy in the first half. We were unlucky to come in at 1-1, so I was positive. I told the players they still had 45 minutes to win the game, and play with more pace and different angles. You see this Premier League is a battle. Sunderland played a dangerous game on the break.\n\"It could have been one of those days, but we kept our determination and the mental aspect was good. We have lost players in the heart of our game, so we had to find a balance again. It took us time to get going.\n\"[Premier League leaders] Leicester have been very impressive. The best you can do is to win games, and hope that they drop points, but that is not happening. We go to Olympiakos in midweek, which Leicester don't do, so they have an advantage in that way too.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"I couldn't ask for any more in terms of the way we played, I couldn't have asked for more in terms of the chances we created, but we failed to take the chances we had.\n\"It makes me wonder what would have happened if we'd had Jermain Defoe on the field. He could have had two or three goals. I'm really disappointed we haven't got anything out of the game, but I have to be satisfied with the performance.\n\"I think we've got goalscorers. We've got Steven Fletcher, we've got Duncan Watmore. We've got Jermain to come back.

Once or twice we've taken ourselves to the brink of crisis and clawed our way back and that's what we've done today.\n\"We worked hard, it is so tough to get a result in this league. We've crawled off the field, we've put in so much effort. That's what we need every week.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"I think we deserved a point maybe but not more because we didn't play well enough. I like to play the dirty points too - it's no problem. If Alberto's goal was given it was 1-1 then the game can change. Until then we didn't play as well as we like to.\n\"I have to watch the game again. We were not really in the game. We were not aggressive enough or close enough.

Once or twice we've taken ourselves to the brink of crisis and clawed our way back and that's what we've done today.\n\"We worked hard, it is so tough to get a result in this league. We've crawled off the field, we've put in so much effort. That's what we need every week.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"I think we deserved a point maybe but not more because we didn't play well enough. I like to play the dirty points too - it's no problem. If Alberto's goal was given it was 1-1 then the game can change. Until then we didn't play as well as we like to.\n\"I have to watch the game again. We were not really in the game. We were not aggressive enough or close enough. There were good moments for pressing but we didn't do it.\"\nStats you need to know\nNewcastle have won four of their last six home Premier League matches against Liverpool (D1 L1), including the last two.\nThe Magpies netted as many goals in this game versus Liverpool as they had in their past five Premier League games combined.\nAll seven of Georginio Wijnaldum's Premier League goals for Newcastle have arrived at St James' Park.\nMartin Skrtel now has seven Premier League own goals - only Richard Dunne (10) has more (Jamie Carragher also has 7).\nFabricio Coloccini made his 200th Premier League appearance.

Those first two goals were extremely soft. The first one was clearly handball, the second was clearly offside, but the results haven't been good enough in this period.\n\"I feel sorry for the fans. We're not playing like this club can play, like these players can play.\n\"It's very difficult to analyse and put your finger on it. The results aren't acceptable and I'm fully aware of that, and it's up to me to put it right.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We are thinking about ourselves, to take points and make good football. That is our first goal, to achieve 40 points, to be safe.\n\"It was a tough match because Swansea play very good football. We started very well, we scored three goals, and had a minimum other four clear chances and I'm very pleased.\n\"Our fans they must dream, but we must stay calm and keep our feet on the ground.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nRiyard Mahrez becomes the first Algerian player to score a Premier League hat-trick.\nMahrez has now been involved in 16 Premier League goals this season (10 goals, 6 assists) - a record only team-mate Jamie Vardy can match (14 goals, 2 assists).\nThe midfielder became only the third Leicester player to score a Premier League hat-trick, after Ian Marshall and Stan Collymore.\nThe Swans have won just one of their last 11 Premier League games (D3 L7).\nMeanwhile, the Foxes have lost just one of their last 19 top-flight games (W12 D6).\nClaudio Ranieri's side are the only team to have scored in all 15 games this season.\nWhat next?\nLeicester face a tricky run of fixtures, with Chelsea their next league opponents - followed by away trips to Everton and Liverpool - but on recent form they have proved they are capable of competing with the best. Swansea, meanwhile, desperately need a league win, though their next match is away to title contenders Manchester City.",

The 14-point gap to the top four is beginning to look insurmountable.\nChelsea started once again without Diego Costa, only for the Spain striker - who responded angrily to being an unused substitute against Tottenham last Sunday - to be summoned at the interval.\nHe did offer a greater presence to a hitherto meek attack, winning the odd header and occupying the visitors' centre-backs, but could not conjure the goal that would have settled the growing nerves around Stamford Bridge.\nThe closest Costa came was first narrowly failing to connect with a flashing Branoslav Ivanovic cross, then having a prodded effort blocked by Artur Boruc. He also claimed forlornly for a penalty when his cross struck the arm of the sliding Simon Francis, but referee Mike Jones waved away the appeal.\nIt meant that his only appearance in the official's notebook was for a booking, received for tugging down Matt Ritchie.\nCalm, composed and clinical\nChelsea were unbeaten in 43 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge against promoted clubs but will rarely have faced one as confident and composed as Eddie Howe's side were.\nBournemouth were comfortable on the ball and ambitious in their use of it, which allowed them to squeeze up the pitch and cleave open their more feted hosts on several occasions.\nIndeed, had it not been for returning Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois - who had not played since the defeat by Crystal Palace in August after damaging medial knee ligaments - the visitors might have won more comfortably. The Belgian thwarted Josh King three times in the opening half after being preferred to Asmir Begovic,\nHowever, he was unconvincing in his attempts to claim Junior Stanislas' 82nd-minute corner, his weak punch being directed back towards goal by Steve Cook before Murray planted a header into the unguarded net. Mourinho might also question Branislav Ivanovic's tame attempt to prevent Cook winning the loose ball.\nMan of the match - Harry Arter\nWhat they said:\nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho: \"The result is not fair. In the first half we were soft and did not press and were not aggressive and were not intense. In the second half everything changed. We were aggressive, created chances and had crosses and a clear penalty that the referee did not see. That is the game.\n\"In the moment when our opponent were thinking just about defending a clean sheet they cross the halfway line for the first time and scored. If it was offside it is another episode that goes against us, but I did not see it.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was really emotional in the dressing room afterwards. I'm so proud of them.\n\"We defended so well, put our bodies on the line and didn't succumb to the pressure. We hung in there and that was crucial. We've talked all season about trying to score more goals from corner and free kicks and it happened today.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea went 388 minutes (all comps) without conceding a goal until Glenn Murray scored\nBournemouth (18) have now scored more goals than Chelsea (17) this season\nNo reigning Premier League champion has won fewer (four) or lost more (eight) after 15 games than Chelsea this season\nIn the Premier League this season, no side has conceded more goals in the last 15 minutes of games than Chelsea (seven - level with Norwich)\nNo Premier League team has ever finished higher than eighth after having exactly 15 points from the first 15 games\nWhat next?\nChelsea host Porto in the Champions League on Wednesday, needing to avoid defeat to advance, then visit league leaders Leicester City the following Monday. Bournemouth host Manchester United on Saturday."

I knew it would be difficult because we had three or four players who couldn't recover from the last game.\n\"Swansea played very well and it's not the way we want to win. Now we have a week to recover - we have played too many games with 13 or 14 players.\"\nCaretaker boss Alan Curtis: \"We certainly deserved to get something out of the game, and when we equalised I thought we were would hang in there. We probably did create more chances than City, that's the difference between the teams at the top of the league and at the bottom.\n\"We have been struggling with our form, but that's the standard we have to set between now and the end of the season.\"\nStats you need to know\nManuel Pellegrini's side have won 14 and lost two of their last 16 Premier League home games.\nSwansea have won just one of their last nine Premier League away outings (W1 D2 L6).\nWilfried Bony has scored five goals in the last four Premier League meetings between Manchester City and Swansea, (three for Swansea, two for Man City).\nSince his debut in August 2013, no Man City player has made more assists in all competitions than Jesus Navas (27 - level with David Silva).\nBafetimbi Gomis ended a run of 836 minutes in all competitions without a goal for Swansea.\nWhat next?\nManchester City travel to Arsenal a week on Monday, before hosting Sunderland on Boxing Day and have a trip to Leicester on 29 December.

He showed every reason why we spent the pennies to bring him here.\n\"This is a good team. I am very proud to be manager of it and they worked very hard for it. The scoreline says it was a 1-0 but it was more than that - the two keepers had to be brilliant.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"I'm disappointed about the final result, but not in the performance of the team.\n\"The wind made it very difficult to play our football. Maybe it suited Palace more because they play more direct than we do, but we controlled it for 20 minutes but then they scored. We were the better team in second half and dominated, and we're disappointed not score in the last seconds.\n\"Maybe we lack a bit of confidence, but the boys showed good character. It's now four or five games where we don't win. I'm a little bit worried about that but not worried about the spirit.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis was Crystal Palace's first top-flight win against Southampton in their past 14 attempts (drawn four, lost nine).\nYannick Bolasie provided his first Premier League assist since March and his first in 24 Premier League apps.\nThe Eagles have lost just one of their past six Premier League matches, winning three (W3 D2 L1).\nYohan Cabaye scored his fifth Premier League goal for Crystal Palace and his first in open play since the opening day of the 2015-16 season.\nWhat next?\nFormer Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino will return to St Mary's next weekend as his Tottenham side, who are just three points from a Champions League spot, face Southampton. It is a fixture current Saints boss Ronald Koeman has described as \"nice\".\nPalace, too, have a tough assignment as they go to Stoke. Mark Hughes' men are below the Londoners in the league, but are enjoying a fine run of form - having convincingly beaten Manchester City last weekend and kept seven clean sheets in their past nine league games.",

Indeed, the Baggies players managed a good 30 seconds of celebration before they were cut short by an extremely belated flag for offside.\nReplays had shown the ultimate decision to be the right one but Albion manager Tony Pulis and his players were irate at the mysterious and protracted manner in which it was reached.\nMan of the match - Jonas Olsson\nWhat the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I'm satisfied now because it was the perfect finish to this game. The one point was the minimum that we deserved today.\n\"Two set plays cost us. We knew about their quality in these situations. It was difficult. We created chances, made a perfect goal then conceded those two.\n\"But at the end I can live with it. This could prove to be a very special moment for us in the season to strike back against such a team.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We're disappointed. We showed great resilience and to get done with a deflected goal in the eighth minute of stoppage time is particularly disappointing for the players.\n\"I can't fault the players. To come to a place like this with their budget, players and standing, we shouldn't be in their league.\"\nOn Albion having a goal ruled out for a 2-1 lead before half-time: \"What disappointed me is the linesman doesn't put his flag up. If he puts his flag up straight away it is offside. Why the referee goes over and talks to him I don't know.\"\nWhat next?\nLiverpool travel to Watford next Sunday for a 13:30 GMT kick-off in the Premier League, while West Brom's final fixture before Christmas is at home against in-form Bournemouth on Saturday.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester City 2-1 Swansea City\nKelechi Iheanacho's injury-time deflection helped Manchester City return to the top of the Premier League as they beat managerless Swansea.\nThe hosts, who lost at Stoke a week ago, struggled against the Swans, who sacked ex-boss Garry Monk on Wednesday.\nAnd after Wilfried Bony lost Ashley Williams to score against his former club, Bafetimbi Gomis' late equaliser looked like it would earn a point.\nBut there was still time for Yaya Toure to curl in off Iheanacho.\nThe hugely fortunate strike was a severe blow to a rejuvenated Swansea, who were led by caretaker boss Alan Curtis and created the better chances.\nYet after an almost perfect game plan, where Gomis came off the bench late on to end an 11-game goal drought in the league, Swansea slumped to a third consecutive defeat.\nThe result means the visitors have won one of their last 12 league games and after Bournemouth's win over Manchester United, slip to 16th in the table, a point above the relegation zone.\nRelive Manchester City's dramatic win over Swansea\nFollow all the reaction to the match\nListen - Man City leave it late to beat Swansea\nSwans players show they give a Monk-eys\nMonk was sacked despite leading Swansea to their highest Premier League finish last season, and former Wales international Curtis said the team felt like they had let down their previous manager, intending to \"go a small way to rectifying that\" at Etihad Stadium.\nAfter ensuring that Manchester City's Joe Hart was the busier goalkeeper, they succeeded.\nWith Gomis dropped to the bench and Gylfi Sigurdsson acting as an auxiliary centre-forward forward, this was a performance which combined defensive discipline and the heart that has perhaps been missing in Swansea's recent poor run.\nIt will certainly give hope to the incoming boss, with AEK Athens manager Gus Poyet among those linked with the job.\nThe only disappointing aspect from a Swansea point of view was City's first goal, as their normally reliable captain Ashley Williams failed to keep track of Bony's movement from a corner, allowing the Ivorian to score his seventh of the season with an easy header.\nOther than that, Lukasz Fabianski was rarely troubled in the Swansea goal with Wayne Routledge and Sigurdsson drawing decent saves from Hart.\nThe stage was set for a late intervention as Gomis timed his run perfectly to beat Hart at the near post after coming on seven minutes earlier.\nHowever, Swansea could do little to stop the winner as Toure cut in from the right and watched as his left-footed effort went in off Iheanacho's back.\nMan City look laboured after Euro win\nManchester City will care little about Swansea's plight as they went above previous leaders Leicester, who face Chelsea on Monday, and Arsenal, who visit Aston Villa on Sunday.\nManuel Pellegrini's team now lead the Foxes on goal difference, with the Gunners two points behind.\nBut after topping their Champions League group with a 4-2 win over Borussia Monchengladbach on Tuesday, City's Chilean boss will be concerned by the lack of verve shown by his side, who did not have much intensity and purpose for long periods.\nKevin de Bruyne, who played in the victory over the Bundesliga side, was dropped to the bench despite some leading performances this season, and it appeared that the hosts missed the Belgian's guile.\nDavid Silva looked like he is still working his way back to full sharpness after an injury lay-off while Raheem Sterling was well shackled by Swansea right-back Angel Rangel.\nIn the end, Pellegrini will be content to have earned three points, but Manchester City will need to improve for their crucial trip to Arsenal on 21 December.\nMan of the match: Gylfi Sigurdsson\nManager reaction\nManchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"I think the three points were very important, more than the way we played. I knew it would be difficult because we had three or four players who couldn't recover from the last game.\n\"Swansea played very well and it's not the way we want to win. Now we have a week to recover - we have played too many games with 13 or 14 players.\"\nCaretaker boss Alan Curtis: \"We certainly deserved to get something out of the game, and when we equalised I thought we were would hang in there. We probably did create more chances than City, that's the difference between the teams at the top of the league and at the bottom.\n\"We have been struggling with our form, but that's the standard we have to set between now and the end of the season.\"\nStats you need to know\nManuel Pellegrini's side have won 14 and lost two of their last 16 Premier League home games.\nSwansea have won just one of their last nine Premier League away outings (W1 D2 L6).\nWilfried Bony has scored five goals in the last four Premier League meetings between Manchester City and Swansea, (three for Swansea, two for Man City).\nSince his debut in August 2013, no Man City player has made more assists in all competitions than Jesus Navas (27 - level with David Silva).\nBafetimbi Gomis ended a run of 836 minutes in all competitions without a goal for Swansea.\nWhat next?\nManchester City travel to Arsenal a week on Monday, before hosting Sunderland on Boxing Day and have a trip to Leicester on 29 December. Swansea have two home games to come, against West Ham on 20 December and West Brom six days later."

We hit the post twice and they did once. I'm not happy with the result but it was a fair result.\n\"Considering the effort we put in I can't be unhappy with my team.\n\"I can't be happier with our spirit and togetherness and resilience and, at times, our quality.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We're reasonably pleased with the draw.\n\"I thought we defended really well. Both teams will be comfortable with the point. That's something we can build on.\n\"[The clean sheet record] is a base and platform to build on. West Ham are a good team and as the home side we knew it was a test for us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNo keeper has kept more clean sheets in the Premier League than Jack Butland this campaign (seven, level with Joe Hart). He also has the best saves-to-shots ratio in the Premier League so far in 2015-16 (82.5%).\nThe Potters have not conceded a Premier League goal while Ryan Shawcross has been on the pitch this season (497 minutes).\nWest Ham have won just two of their last nine Premier League home games (W2 D4 L3), but are unbeaten in the last six.\nThe Hammers have kept back-to-back clean sheets twice this season.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Crystal Palace 1-0 Southampton\nCrystal Palace moved up to sixth in the table thanks to a Yohan Cabaye winner that inflicted a third defeat in four league games on struggling Southampton.\nThe hosts fully deserved their first Premier League win over Southampton, a victory that also extended Palace's unbeaten run to three league games.\nYannick Bolasie's perfect cross allowed the unmarked Cabaye to tap home from six yards late in the first half.\nSouthampton's best chance was a Shane Long strike late on.\nWayne Hennessey's stop to prevent the Republic of Ireland striker's low shot earning Southampton an injury-time equaliser was the Welshman's second outstanding save of the day - the first was an acrobatic reach to tip away the same player's goal-bound header when the match was goalless.\nIt ensured only Palace's fourth clean sheet in 24 home league matches, as the hosts held on for a win that moves them level on points with Tottenham, who are fifth on goal difference.\nFollow all the reaction to the match.\nBolasie & Cabaye key for Palace\nWilfried Zaha returned from suspension to boost Crystal Palace's attacking armoury, but it was his fellow winger Bolasie who shone brightest.\nThe DR Congo international, who signed a contract extension in September, was valued - optimistically perhaps - at \u00a340m by Alan Pardew last season, but once again he proved why his manager rates him so highly.\nHis pace and strength caused Southampton's defence frequent problems, no more so than when the winger outmuscled captain Jose Fonte to cross to Cabaye for the opening goal.\nOne second-half move saw him collect the ball inside his own half and beat several defenders as his run took him all the way into the opposition box - although the final ball was disappointing.\nHe and Cabaye were a threat throughout, Palace manager Alan Pardew describing the Frenchman's performance in midfield as \"outstanding\".\nGazzaniga keeps Saints in it\nDespite their recent dip in form, Southampton would have hoped that a trip to Selhurst Park - a ground where they have won their last seven league games against Palace - would spark a change in their fortunes.\nBut while they saw plenty of possession, the visitors lacked confidence in the final third and only occasionally tested Palace.\nSaints boss Ronald Koeman can thank his goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga for keeping his team in the match in the first half - the Italian making three saves in quick succession with the score goalless.\nFirst, he stopped Bolasie's looping shot from curling into the top corner and then kept out Cabaye and Connor Wickham from close range.\nWickham - who has yet to score for Palace - went close again after the break but, thanks to Hennessey, Palace did not need their \u00a39m striker firing on all cylinders as the Londoners went on to record back-to-back home wins in the league for the first time since April 2014.\nMan of the match - Yannick Bolasie (Crystal Palace)\nWhat the managers said\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"It was a tough game - Southampton really applied themselves well but I thought we edged it in certain areas.\n\"Our wide players were terrific, but the difference between the two sides was a masterclass in midfield from Cabaye. He showed every reason why we spent the pennies to bring him here.\n\"This is a good team. I am very proud to be manager of it and they worked very hard for it. The scoreline says it was a 1-0 but it was more than that - the two keepers had to be brilliant.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"I'm disappointed about the final result, but not in the performance of the team.\n\"The wind made it very difficult to play our football. Maybe it suited Palace more because they play more direct than we do, but we controlled it for 20 minutes but then they scored. We were the better team in second half and dominated, and we're disappointed not score in the last seconds.\n\"Maybe we lack a bit of confidence, but the boys showed good character. It's now four or five games where we don't win. I'm a little bit worried about that but not worried about the spirit.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis was Crystal Palace's first top-flight win against Southampton in their past 14 attempts (drawn four, lost nine).\nYannick Bolasie provided his first Premier League assist since March and his first in 24 Premier League apps.\nThe Eagles have lost just one of their past six Premier League matches, winning three (W3 D2 L1).\nYohan Cabaye scored his fifth Premier League goal for Crystal Palace and his first in open play since the opening day of the 2015-16 season.\nWhat next?\nFormer Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino will return to St Mary's next weekend as his Tottenham side, who are just three points from a Champions League spot, face Southampton. It is a fixture current Saints boss Ronald Koeman has described as \"nice\".\nPalace, too, have a tough assignment as they go to Stoke. Mark Hughes' men are below the Londoners in the league, but are enjoying a fine run of form - having convincingly beaten Manchester City last weekend and kept seven clean sheets in their past nine league games."

I don't have any reproach for my players.\n\"I have the feeling that the best team won but I have regrets. To concede an early goal - we did not want that. You don't expect that.\n\"In the second half it was a good reaction. The performance is not the one you expected but I never saw a player wearing the Villa shirt that was not proud to do that.\n\"I knew the size of the challenge before coming. Now we have games that we have to win against direct opponents. The next few matches will be crucial for us.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It was a perfect week for us. We spent a lot of energy away in the Champions League on Wednesday but found the resources to win again here today, in another away match.\n\"In the first half we were in control but in the second half the legs had gone a bit. But we were mature, and maybe a bit lucky on one or two occasions, but overall it is great to come here and to win away again.\n\"This season is so unpredictable that you just focus on yourself and try to play well in the next game. You know if you are consistent then you have a chance. This is an opportunity for us to find that consistency.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal are now unbeaten in 17 Premier League visits to Villa Park (W10 D7), dating back to 13 December 1998\nOlivier Giroud scored his 50th Premier League goal for the Gunners in his 113th game. Only Thierry Henry (83) and Ian Wright (87) have reached the milestone quicker for Arsenal\nAston Villa are now without a win in 15 league games - the joint-longest current run in English football (along with York)\nGiroud has scored nine goals in his past nine away games in all competitions and has also scored in each of his past five meetings with Villa in all competitions\nMesut Ozil has had a hand in more goals against Villa than any other Premier League opponents (five - two goals and three assists)\nAston Villa had 18 shots to Arsenal's eight (including blocked), although only two of these were on target\nWhat next?\nAston Villa face a crucial period.

I look at the chances in the last 15 or 20 minutes and I am a little bit dumbfounded why we haven't at least got one point on the board.\n\"If we had won it would have made such a huge difference but now we are back in the pressure pot, which is really disappointing with the games we have coming up.\"\nWhat next?\nSunderland go to Stamford Bridge to play defending champions Chelsea, at the start of a difficult spell that sees them face Manchester City and Liverpool either side of Christmas.\nWatford host Liverpool in their next match, and also face Chelsea, Tottenham and City over the festive period.\nThe stats you need to know\nOdion Ighalo has now scored the most goals by a Watford player in Premier League history (10).\nThe last players to score 10+ goals in a top-flight season for Watford were Mark Falco (14), Luther Blissett (11) & John Barnes (10) in 1986-87.\nIghalo (26) and Deeney (17) have scored 43 goals combined in league football in 2015; 11 more than Sunderland have overall this year (32).\nSunderland have conceded a league high five goals in the first 15 minutes of Premier League action.\nOnly Jamie Vardy (6) has scored the opening goal of a Premier League game more often than Odion Ighalo (5) this season.\nJohn O'Shea became the third Republic of Ireland player to reach 400 Premier League appearances after Shay Given (443) & Richard Dunne (431).",

Indeed, the Baggies players managed a good 30 seconds of celebration before they were cut short by an extremely belated flag for offside.\nReplays had shown the ultimate decision to be the right one but Albion manager Tony Pulis and his players were irate at the mysterious and protracted manner in which it was reached.\nMan of the match - Jonas Olsson\nWhat the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I'm satisfied now because it was the perfect finish to this game. The one point was the minimum that we deserved today.\n\"Two set plays cost us. We knew about their quality in these situations. It was difficult. We created chances, made a perfect goal then conceded those two.\n\"But at the end I can live with it. This could prove to be a very special moment for us in the season to strike back against such a team.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We're disappointed. We showed great resilience and to get done with a deflected goal in the eighth minute of stoppage time is particularly disappointing for the players.\n\"I can't fault the players. To come to a place like this with their budget, players and standing, we shouldn't be in their league.\"\nOn Albion having a goal ruled out for a 2-1 lead before half-time: \"What disappointed me is the linesman doesn't put his flag up. If he puts his flag up straight away it is offside. Why the referee goes over and talks to him I don't know.\"\nWhat next?\nLiverpool travel to Watford next Sunday for a 13:30 GMT kick-off in the Premier League, while West Brom's final fixture before Christmas is at home against in-form Bournemouth on Saturday."

I don't have any reproach for my players.\n\"I have the feeling that the best team won but I have regrets. To concede an early goal - we did not want that. You don't expect that.\n\"In the second half it was a good reaction. The performance is not the one you expected but I never saw a player wearing the Villa shirt that was not proud to do that.\n\"I knew the size of the challenge before coming. Now we have games that we have to win against direct opponents. The next few matches will be crucial for us.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It was a perfect week for us. We spent a lot of energy away in the Champions League on Wednesday but found the resources to win again here today, in another away match.\n\"In the first half we were in control but in the second half the legs had gone a bit. But we were mature, and maybe a bit lucky on one or two occasions, but overall it is great to come here and to win away again.\n\"This season is so unpredictable that you just focus on yourself and try to play well in the next game. You know if you are consistent then you have a chance. This is an opportunity for us to find that consistency.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal are now unbeaten in 17 Premier League visits to Villa Park (W10 D7), dating back to 13 December 1998\nOlivier Giroud scored his 50th Premier League goal for the Gunners in his 113th game. Only Thierry Henry (83) and Ian Wright (87) have reached the milestone quicker for Arsenal\nAston Villa are now without a win in 15 league games - the joint-longest current run in English football (along with York)\nGiroud has scored nine goals in his past nine away games in all competitions and has also scored in each of his past five meetings with Villa in all competitions\nMesut Ozil has had a hand in more goals against Villa than any other Premier League opponents (five - two goals and three assists)\nAston Villa had 18 shots to Arsenal's eight (including blocked), although only two of these were on target\nWhat next?\nAston Villa face a crucial period.

Crystal Palace were resolute and had the benefit of a penalty and then they were happy to sit back and hit us on the break.\n\"It's two years running they have come here and nicked the points.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 1-2 Norwich City\nManchester United were booed off the pitch as Norwich earned a shock victory at Old Trafford, increasing the pressure on manager Louis van Gaal.\nDespite all of United's possession, it was Norwich who took the lead in the first half through Cameron Jerome.\nIt got worse for the home side in the second half as Jerome broke clear to feed Alex Tettey, who poked in.\nAnthony Martial pulled a goal back, but United's winless run is now six games while Norwich are out of the drop zone.\nJuan Mata saw a free-kick from the edge of the area pushed away by Declan Rudd as the hosts went in search of the equaliser in the second half.\nCentre-back Chris Smalling could have earned a point late on, but headed narrowly wide as United dropped to fifth in the Premier League table.\nRelive the game from Old Trafford here\nVan Gaal \"worried\" about Man Utd future\nVan Gaal out, Mourinho in?\nMany fans left the stadium early, but some stayed in their seats at the end of the match with a look of disbelief on their faces. The atmosphere was almost mutinous, with a loud show of resentment at both half-time and at the final whistle.\nOn a day when former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho said he is looking to get back to management straight away, the weight of expectation was significantly ramped up on Dutchman van Gaal, whose job is now under increased scrutiny.\nThe manager decided to maintain his passive style for the match - staying in his seat as assistant Ryan Giggs barked out instructions from the touchline - but could not inspire his side to even a point.\nThis season's theme of a lack of goals but plenty of possession continued in this game for United, despite Frenchman Martial's first goal in nine Premier League games. It was only one of two shots on target they had. The Red Devils ended the game with a landslide 70% possession.\nChristmas just got a whole lot tougher\nOut of the top-four spots, United suffered their first home defeat of the season and their third defeat in a row. The last time they went six without victory in all competitions was in 1998 - the season they went on to win the treble. That won't happen this time, having been knocked out of the Champions League.\nThey now face a testing festive period which sees three games in the space of eight days, starting on Boxing Day at Stoke.\nWill van Gaal be given the opportunity to turn the club's form around after back-to-back losses to promoted sides?\nCanaries cock-a-hoop\nThe surprise scoreline allowed Norwich to climb out of the relegation zone, having won at the venue for the first time since 1989.\nThe Canaries were well organised, playing on the break and anything less than the victory would have been disappointing for them after they earned their two-goal advantage.\nWingers Robbie Brady and Nathan Redmond epitomised the side's hard work, as Brady made four tackles, more than any other player. He also won back possession seven times - the same as team-mate Redmond.\nRedmond's desire led to the opener, as he collected the ball before playing in Jerome, who kept his cool to slot in from inside the area. The goalscorer turned provider in the second period, as Norway international Tettey surged forward to double the advantage.\nSubstitute Youssuf Mulumbu could even have managed a third late on, but his low strike was saved by David de Gea, as Norwich closed out the game for a famous victory.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond\nWhat they said:\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"We've lost three matches in a row so it's not happening so much not for Manchester United. We cannot accept that and that's why we have to stick together and believe in ourselves.\"\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"It's a really important win. We've been in most of the games against the bigger sides, our problem has been that we've been the makers of our own downfall if you like, but today we eradicated those mistakes. The boys were fantastic and deserved to win the game.\nWhat next?\nManchester United face Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on 26 December, followed by a meeting against Chelsea at Old Trafford two days later.\nNorwich travel to Tottenham on Boxing Day, before playing Aston Villa on 28 December.\nThe stats you need to know\nAlex Neil (34 years, 193 days) is the third youngest manager to win a Premier League away game at Old Trafford, after Chris Coleman (33 years, 137 days) and Ruud Gullit (34 years, 62 days)\nNorwich became the first newly promoted side to win at Old Trafford since Bolton in October 2001\nManchester United conceded more goals in this match (2) than they had in their previous seven home games this season combined (1)\nUnited have hit a total of seven shots on target in their last four Premier League home games\nWayne Rooney became the 10th player to make 500 appearances for Manchester United in all competitions"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "West Bromwich Albion 1-2 Bournemouth\nCharlie Daniels' late penalty earned Bournemouth a third successive Premier League victory at the expense of West Brom, who finished with nine men.\nThe Baggies were a man down in the 34th minute when James McClean was shown red for scything down Adam Smith.\nThe Cherries took the lead when Smith fired in low from 20 yards before Gareth McAuley equalised with a header.\nDaniels crashed home the winner three minutes from time before Salomon Rondon saw red for a clash with Dan Gosling.\nThe result sees manager Eddie Howe's Cherries stay 14th in the table, although they are now only two points behind 13th place West Brom who have 20 points.\nRelive the action from the Hawthorns.\nResults and reaction from Saturday's other Premier League matches.\nSizzling second half\nThe opening 30 minutes was rather tepid.\nThe contest took a turn for the better - although Baggies fans will disagree - when McClean was shown a straight red by referee Mike Dean for a challenge on Smith. Cue the expected Bournemouth charge.\nThe Cherries were already on top but having a man advantage gave them that added fillip to go and attack their hosts.\nThe goal came seven minutes after the break when Smith collected a crossfield ball from Andrew Surman, cut in from the right before slotting into keeper Boaz Myhill's bottom left.\nThen came an unexpected twist. The Baggies had posed little threat on the rare forays into the final third, so when McAuley headed in off the post from a corner, even the home fans inside the ground seemed surprised.\nDebatable penalty?\nAlthough the Baggies did not have their finest 90 minutes this season, they would rightly feel aggrieved for the penalty decision in the 87th minute.\nDean, subjected to some jeers for sending off McClean, was adamant Gosling had been fouled inside the area by West Brom skipper Darren Fletcher.\nHowever, the TV replays seem to suggest that the infringement occurred outside the area.\nDaniels, unaffected by the plastic bag that floated near the penalty spot, confidently blasted his kick past the reach of Myhill.\nRondon's day to forget\nThe \u00a312m club-record signing had a day to forget. Bar a spectacular volley early in the second half, the Venezuela international was largely ineffective as a lone frontman.\nThen came the sending off. With his side heading for defeat, Rondon went face-to-face, or should that be head-to-head with Gosling. The forward then thrusted his forehead at the Cherries midfielder which referee Dean judged to be a red-card offence.\nThat will be a three-match ban for Rondon, while McClean will also get a ban which will give manager Tony Pulis a headache over the busy festive period.\nMan of the match - Adam Smith (Bournemouth)\nManager reaction\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"Whenever you come here, to get three points, under the conditions you are faced with, it is a huge three points and take nothing away from the lads.\n\"The fact it was against 10 men doesn't really change their threat from set pieces. It is a great win for us. It was hard to create chances first half - anyone who sees us consistently will say we are a side that creates more chances than today.\n\"Personally I thought it [McClean] was a red card. They came together just seconds before that tackle and James just lost his head a little bit and seemed to go over the ball from my angle so I wasn't surprised when the red card came out.\n\"It [Rondon] was a silly one really. Both players came together and I'm pleased my lads kept their cool and control. The referee had a very good view is what I'll say.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis on the penalty decision: \"I think everybody can see it's outside the box. It's really disappointing, you can't be giving big decision unless you're absolutely 100 per cent sure. He's an experienced referee and it's very disappointing.\n\"The reaction of the players when Mike Dean gives the penalty, they were absolutely distraught. It's not a penalty. We've worked very hard second half with 10 men.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTony Pulis has suffered his 100th Premier League defeat, a figure only 14 other managers have reached in the competition.\nBournemouth have seen their opponents pick up five red cards this season in the Premier League; more than any other side.\nSmith has scored two (both from outside the box) in his last four league games for Bournemouth after netting just one in his previous 86.\nWBA have scored a league-high eight headed goals in the Premier League this season.\nThe Cherries have shipped a league-high 12 goals from set-piece situations this season.\nWhat's next?\nThe Baggies travel to strugglers Swansea on Boxing Day, while the Cherries are hosting Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace on the same day.",

Replays suggested he might have had two hands on the ball when Ake pounced, but nonetheless it was a poor error.\nBogdan said: \"I had both hands on the ball but we are talking about a split-second. It's not easy for the referee to see. If I catch the first ball, there is no second one.\n\"Something went wrong, I have to think about it again. It was a mistake and I will learn from it.\"\nHungarian Bogdan didn't cover himself in glory when punching a through ball into Lucas' face either though, and his nervousness seemed to spread through the Reds defence.\nMartin Skrtel, who came off injured before half-time, was arguably too weak when trying to steer Ighalo away from goal for Watford's second and his fellow centre-back Mamadou Sakho was dangerously ponderous in possession.\nSakho, returning after six weeks out, also fell over under no pressure to allow Ighalo in on goal in the second half, with Bogdan making partial amends via a fine reflex save.\nWatford more than Deeney and Ighalo combined\nTroy Deeney and Ighalo have created more goalscoring chances for one another than any other pairing this season. They were at it again for Watford's second as a simple Deeney ball over the top put Ighalo through with only Skrtel for company.\nThe 26-year-old brushed off the Liverpool defender's weak challenge and fired in off the post from a tight angle, before adding his second with a simple header to bring his tally for 2015 to 28 goals - the best return in England's professional leagues.\nIf Watford were surprised to have gone ahead so early and so comfortably, the rest of their performance showed no sign of it. The Hornets were composed and committed as they outplayed a disappointing Liverpool side.\nThere was none of the high-intensity, slick interplay that has characterised the best performances of Klopp's time at Anfield so far, and instead it was Watford who claimed a deserved victory.\nMan of the match - Odion Ighalo\nWhat the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"If you watch the TV, you see Bogdan had the ball under control and both hands were on the ball.\n\"It should not be allowed but first of all he should not drop the ball. That is the mistake of the referee but the biggest mistake was our reaction.\n\"It was a deserved win for Watford. Not because of our faults, but more because of the reaction to our faults.\"\nWatford manager Quique Flores: \"Of course we want to dream but we want to remain humble. This is our one advantage, because the Premier League is very tough.\n\"We have a lot of matches and we never underestimate the teams we play. We are completely happy with the performance. It was an amazing victory against an amazing team.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford have won four consecutive top-flight games for the first time since April 1987; their joint-longest winning run (also achieved in November 1982, January 1984 and December 1984)\nWith 28 points, they have equalled their tally from their last season in the Premier League (2006-07). It is their joint-highest tally in a Premier League campaign\nLiverpool conceded as many goals against Watford in this match as they had in their previous four Premier League meetings combined\nWatford's 3-0 win was the biggest margin of victory they have enjoyed against Liverpool\nWhat next?\nWatford play Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester City in their next three fixtures over Christmas and New Year, while Liverpool host leaders Leicester on Boxing Day before away games against Sunderland and West Ham.",

That's real credit to them.\n\"They are outstanding on the counter-attack and I thought we stopped that really well.\n\"They tried to take as long as they can with every restart and it seems that frustrated our play a little bit.\n\"We had a sense of control and that allowed Leicester to get goals from disappointing positions. We need to learn and get a lot better.\"\nLeicester City boss Claudio Ranieri: \"I am satisfied because we were against a fantastic team. We worked so hard to concentrate during all the match.\n\"It only gets harder when you are down the table. For our fans and everybody it is a dream. We have to concentrate now and clear our mind.\n\"Our target is 40 points and I want to speak to my players. It is important to understand what they believe they can achieve and also I will say my ideas about them.\n\"If some players relax they go out the team. That is my philosophy and they know that.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nOnly 11 of the previous 23 teams to have been top of the Premier League at Christmas have gone on to win the title, although five of the past six\nJamie Vardy has won six penalties in the Premier League since the start of the 2014-15 season, more than any other player\nRiyad Mahrez has scored seven goals in nine Premier League appearances in the month of December, including 2015\nJamie Vardy has scored or assisted a goal in 15 successive Premier League appearances, extending his own Premier League record\nRomelu Lukaku is the first Everton player to score in eight successive matches in all competitions since Dave Hickson between January and March 1954\nGareth Barry made his 100th competitive appearance for Everton; it is the third team for which he has played at least 100 games in all competitions (also Man City and Aston Villa)\nLeighton Baines made his 250th Premier League start for Everton, only the fourth player to do so after Tim Howard, Leon Osman and David Unsworth\nWhat next?\nEverton travel to Newcastle on 26 December, looking for a first league win in five games, while Leicester are at Liverpool, before hosting Manchester City in a top-of-the-table clash on 29 December."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Southampton 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur\nHarry Kane scored on his 100th Tottenham appearance as they moved into the Premier League top four with victory at struggling Southampton.\nKane broke through the Saints defensive line and finished coolly for a 10th goal in his past 10 games.\nSoon after, Dele Alli benefitted from some lax defending to score from close range and put Spurs firmly in control.\nSpurs managed the game superbly in the second half against a Saints side who are now without a win in six matches.\nIt represents a shocking start to what Southampton manager Ronald Koeman had described as a crucial two weeks for his team, who remain seven points clear of the relegation zone but in need of an upturn in form to avoid slipping closer to danger.\nIn contrast, Tottenham gave the perfect riposte to last weekend's surprise defeat at home to Newcastle with a professional performance to take them to 29 points from 17 league games.\nKane caps his century with a goal\nFor much of the first half, it was an even encounter between the sides, but Tottenham seized a control they would not relinquish with two goals in the space of three minutes just before half-time.\nIn Kane, they had the one quality striker on the pitch and he proved his class with a superb show of strength, skill and composure to give them the lead.\nErik Lamela broke on the halfway line and found Alli, who managed to move the ball on to Kane shortly before being taken out by a wild challenge from Jose Fonte.\nKane did the rest, darting between two home players before poking the ball past Virgil van Dijk, running in on goal and finishing neatly past Southampton keeper Paulo Gazzaniga for the 47th goal of his Spurs career.\nClearly shaken, Southampton gifted the visitors a second as the excellent Alli went from provider to scorer, finishing unchallenged at the back post after Kyle Walker's low cross made its way through a host of static defenders.\nToo Mane misses\nDuring their poor recent run, Koeman has complained that his side's biggest problem has been a failure to convert the numerous chances they have created.\nThis was certainly the case in the opening 20 minutes on Saturday as Sadio Mane spurned a number of good opportunities.\nThe best two saw the forward's angled drive blocked by the boot of former Saints defender Toby Alderweireld, before Hugo Lloris saved his first-time shot from the edge of the area.\nHaving conceded twice before the break, Southampton failed to recover as Tottenham withheld their limp and increasingly desperate forays forward with ease.\nThey only seriously threatened in added time when Lloris produced a superb low save to palm away a shot from substitute James Ward-Prowse, but by then it was a case of much too little, way too late.\nA triumph for Pochettino's method\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino left Southampton to take over at Spurs in May 2014, following 18 months in which he helped sculpt Saints into an effective Premier League outfit.\nIt has taken time for the Argentine's preferred high-energy pressing game to bed in at White Hart Lane but, with the addition of the likes of Alli in midfield, Alderweireld in defence and significant contributions from Lloris and Kane at either end, they are reaping the rewards.\nPrior to Saturday, they had given away more points - 11 - from winning positions than any other Premier League club this season, including three last Sunday against Newcastle, which can be an unfortunate by-product of such an attacking style.\nHowever, Tottenham ensured they did not add to this unwanted stat with a pragmatic and intelligent display in the second half to see the game out, playing largely in the Saints half to earn a deserved and impressive win.\nMan of the match - Dele Alli\nWhat they said\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"If you analyse the game and watch the first goal, I am very worried because the defending was at amateur level and not the level you need to win this kind of game. It was so naive.\n\"One of my criticisms this season is that we are too nice people. Until the first goal, Southampton was the better team but they showed us what is a 'killing mentality'. They won the battles and second balls and were more clever in one-on-one situations.\n\"It might also be about confidence, but we need to be more clinical. If you get three or four good chances, you have to score. We maybe need to change players because they are not responding to our strategy.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"I am very happy because it was a very difficult game. Southampton are a very good team and the first 20 minutes were difficult but after that we settled and managed the game and deserved our victory.\n\"I am pleased with the victory after a difficult week and after our defeat by Newcastle.\n\"The table is not the important thing at the moment. We need to keep working hard because the Premier League is very tough.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTottenham Hotspur have won six and lost none of their past seven Premier League meetings with Southampton\nSouthampton have conceded at least twice in their past four home Premier League games against Spurs, having kept a clean sheet in the five prior to that run\nDele Alli has scored or assisted four goals in his past four league matches (two goals, two assists)\nSouthampton failed to score in a home Premier League game against Spurs for the first time since November 1999\nSaints have not won in five Premier League matches, their worst run since December 2014\nWhat next?\nSouthampton are at home again in a week's time, on Boxing Day, when they face Tottenham's north-London rivals Arsenal at St Mary's.\nTottenham's 26 December fixture is against Norwich, who beat Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 1-2 Norwich City\nManchester United were booed off the pitch as Norwich earned a shock victory at Old Trafford, increasing the pressure on manager Louis van Gaal.\nDespite all of United's possession, it was Norwich who took the lead in the first half through Cameron Jerome.\nIt got worse for the home side in the second half as Jerome broke clear to feed Alex Tettey, who poked in.\nAnthony Martial pulled a goal back, but United's winless run is now six games while Norwich are out of the drop zone.\nJuan Mata saw a free-kick from the edge of the area pushed away by Declan Rudd as the hosts went in search of the equaliser in the second half.\nCentre-back Chris Smalling could have earned a point late on, but headed narrowly wide as United dropped to fifth in the Premier League table.\nRelive the game from Old Trafford here\nVan Gaal \"worried\" about Man Utd future\nVan Gaal out, Mourinho in?\nMany fans left the stadium early, but some stayed in their seats at the end of the match with a look of disbelief on their faces. The atmosphere was almost mutinous, with a loud show of resentment at both half-time and at the final whistle.\nOn a day when former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho said he is looking to get back to management straight away, the weight of expectation was significantly ramped up on Dutchman van Gaal, whose job is now under increased scrutiny.\nThe manager decided to maintain his passive style for the match - staying in his seat as assistant Ryan Giggs barked out instructions from the touchline - but could not inspire his side to even a point.\nThis season's theme of a lack of goals but plenty of possession continued in this game for United, despite Frenchman Martial's first goal in nine Premier League games. It was only one of two shots on target they had. The Red Devils ended the game with a landslide 70% possession.\nChristmas just got a whole lot tougher\nOut of the top-four spots, United suffered their first home defeat of the season and their third defeat in a row. The last time they went six without victory in all competitions was in 1998 - the season they went on to win the treble. That won't happen this time, having been knocked out of the Champions League.\nThey now face a testing festive period which sees three games in the space of eight days, starting on Boxing Day at Stoke.\nWill van Gaal be given the opportunity to turn the club's form around after back-to-back losses to promoted sides?\nCanaries cock-a-hoop\nThe surprise scoreline allowed Norwich to climb out of the relegation zone, having won at the venue for the first time since 1989.\nThe Canaries were well organised, playing on the break and anything less than the victory would have been disappointing for them after they earned their two-goal advantage.\nWingers Robbie Brady and Nathan Redmond epitomised the side's hard work, as Brady made four tackles, more than any other player. He also won back possession seven times - the same as team-mate Redmond.\nRedmond's desire led to the opener, as he collected the ball before playing in Jerome, who kept his cool to slot in from inside the area. The goalscorer turned provider in the second period, as Norway international Tettey surged forward to double the advantage.\nSubstitute Youssuf Mulumbu could even have managed a third late on, but his low strike was saved by David de Gea, as Norwich closed out the game for a famous victory.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond\nWhat they said:\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"We've lost three matches in a row so it's not happening so much not for Manchester United. We cannot accept that and that's why we have to stick together and believe in ourselves.\"\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"It's a really important win. We've been in most of the games against the bigger sides, our problem has been that we've been the makers of our own downfall if you like, but today we eradicated those mistakes. The boys were fantastic and deserved to win the game.\nWhat next?\nManchester United face Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on 26 December, followed by a meeting against Chelsea at Old Trafford two days later.\nNorwich travel to Tottenham on Boxing Day, before playing Aston Villa on 28 December.\nThe stats you need to know\nAlex Neil (34 years, 193 days) is the third youngest manager to win a Premier League away game at Old Trafford, after Chris Coleman (33 years, 137 days) and Ruud Gullit (34 years, 62 days)\nNorwich became the first newly promoted side to win at Old Trafford since Bolton in October 2001\nManchester United conceded more goals in this match (2) than they had in their previous seven home games this season combined (1)\nUnited have hit a total of seven shots on target in their last four Premier League home games\nWayne Rooney became the 10th player to make 500 appearances for Manchester United in all competitions"

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Watford 3-0 Liverpool\nWatford profited from Liverpool's calamitous opening at Vicarage Road to continue their remarkable rise with a fourth consecutive Premier League win.\nAdam Bogdan dropped a corner with the very first touch of his league debut, allowing Nathan Ake to stab the home side ahead after just three minutes.\nOdion Ighalo doubled the lead, firing in off the post from a tight angle.\nAnd the Nigerian sealed a deserved victory with his 12th of the season, nodding in from Valon Behrami's cross.\nThe Hornets, promoted from the Championship last term, move to within a point of the Champions League places.\nDefeat for Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, who are now without a win in their last three league games, leaves them ninth - four points behind Quique Flores' side in seventh.\nRe-live Watford's victory over Liverpool\n'We have to change everything' - Klopp on 5 live Football Daily podcast\nWere Liverpool really that bad?\nWith regular goalkeeper Simon Mignolet absent from the squad with a hamstring injury, 28-year-old Bogdan - who had previously only played in the League Cup since his summer arrival - was called in.\nJust over two minutes into the match, he bounced Ben Watson's corner at his own feet rather than making what looked like an easy catch. Replays suggested he might have had two hands on the ball when Ake pounced, but nonetheless it was a poor error.\nBogdan said: \"I had both hands on the ball but we are talking about a split-second. It's not easy for the referee to see. If I catch the first ball, there is no second one.\n\"Something went wrong, I have to think about it again. It was a mistake and I will learn from it.\"\nHungarian Bogdan didn't cover himself in glory when punching a through ball into Lucas' face either though, and his nervousness seemed to spread through the Reds defence.\nMartin Skrtel, who came off injured before half-time, was arguably too weak when trying to steer Ighalo away from goal for Watford's second and his fellow centre-back Mamadou Sakho was dangerously ponderous in possession.\nSakho, returning after six weeks out, also fell over under no pressure to allow Ighalo in on goal in the second half, with Bogdan making partial amends via a fine reflex save.\nWatford more than Deeney and Ighalo combined\nTroy Deeney and Ighalo have created more goalscoring chances for one another than any other pairing this season. They were at it again for Watford's second as a simple Deeney ball over the top put Ighalo through with only Skrtel for company.\nThe 26-year-old brushed off the Liverpool defender's weak challenge and fired in off the post from a tight angle, before adding his second with a simple header to bring his tally for 2015 to 28 goals - the best return in England's professional leagues.\nIf Watford were surprised to have gone ahead so early and so comfortably, the rest of their performance showed no sign of it. The Hornets were composed and committed as they outplayed a disappointing Liverpool side.\nThere was none of the high-intensity, slick interplay that has characterised the best performances of Klopp's time at Anfield so far, and instead it was Watford who claimed a deserved victory.\nMan of the match - Odion Ighalo\nWhat the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"If you watch the TV, you see Bogdan had the ball under control and both hands were on the ball.\n\"It should not be allowed but first of all he should not drop the ball. That is the mistake of the referee but the biggest mistake was our reaction.\n\"It was a deserved win for Watford. Not because of our faults, but more because of the reaction to our faults.\"\nWatford manager Quique Flores: \"Of course we want to dream but we want to remain humble. This is our one advantage, because the Premier League is very tough.\n\"We have a lot of matches and we never underestimate the teams we play. We are completely happy with the performance. It was an amazing victory against an amazing team.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford have won four consecutive top-flight games for the first time since April 1987; their joint-longest winning run (also achieved in November 1982, January 1984 and December 1984)\nWith 28 points, they have equalled their tally from their last season in the Premier League (2006-07). It is their joint-highest tally in a Premier League campaign\nLiverpool conceded as many goals against Watford in this match as they had in their previous four Premier League meetings combined\nWatford's 3-0 win was the biggest margin of victory they have enjoyed against Liverpool\nWhat next?\nWatford play Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester City in their next three fixtures over Christmas and New Year, while Liverpool host leaders Leicester on Boxing Day before away games against Sunderland and West Ham."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Arsenal 2-1 Manchester City\nArsenal moved to within two points of surprise Premier League leaders Leicester City with victory over Manchester City at Emirates Stadium.\nThe Gunners - without a title triumph since 2004 - showed the sort of impressive drive, cutting edge and resilience that will lead manager Arsene Wenger to believe Arsenal can finally end that barren spell.\nCity dominated early possession but Kevin de Bruyne wasted a good chance and Theo Walcott punished the visitors with a right-foot finish from 20 yards in the 33rd minute.\nEliaquim Mangala's dreadful clearance allowed Mesut Ozil's 15th assist of the season as he set up Olivier Giroud for an angled finish in first-half stoppage time. Yaya Toure's clever shot from outside the area set up a tense finale which saw both Toure and substitute Wilfried Bony waste chances to equalise.\nHow the action unfolded, pictures and the best of social media\nIs it now or never for Wenger to win the title?\nPodcast: 'Arsenal were tactically superb'\nRuthless Arsenal\nWenger's side have often been accused of having a soft centre when the pressure is on - but here, faced with the team many believe will still emerge as their closes title rivals, they showed a ruthless streak.\nCity may have dominated possession and territory for the first half hour but it was Arsenal who made it count at the business end. Their tally for the opening 45 minutes read two shots on target and two goals. For a manager who prides himself on efficiency, Wenger will have been delighted.\nThe Gunners were impressive at the back too, where goalkeeper Petr Cech was the epitome of safe handling and security, proving once more what a significant signing he has been.\nArsenal's defenders were in the mood too, with two crunching tackles from full-back Nacho Monreal drawing a high-five from fellow defender Per Mertesacker.\nWalcott grows in stature\nFor a player often criticised for his lack of end product, Walcott looks to be evolving into the complete striker at the age of 26.\nWalcott's goal, wonderfully accomplished as he turned inside before curling a perfect finish beyond the stretching City keeper Joe Hart, was his 13th in his past 17 league appearances and delivered further evidence of his development into a consistent and reliable goalscorer.\nHe, and indeed Arsenal, are receiving plenty of help from the Premier League's current creator supreme Ozil, who had a hand in both goals and received a standing ovation when he was replaced late on.\nAdd in Giroud's golden sequence of 12 goals in his past 14 matches in all competitions, and Arsenal will believe they possess the potency to carry them all the way.\nManchester City come up short again\nAside from a dominant opening half and a late rally after Toure's goal, this was another poor performance from Manuel Pellegrini's side.\nCity were too often laboured and the sight of captain Vincent Kompany watching forlornly from the stands pointed to where many of the problems lie.\nPellegrini may have signed Mangala and Nicolas Otamendi for fees in excess of \u00a360m, but they are still not the same and markedly less assured.\nAnd with Sergio Aguero still not fully fit and substituted, City are currently well short of their best.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"I believe we have shown spirit, organisation, brilliance and altogether they gave us the three points.\n\"You could see that there is exceptional life in this team and when we did not have the legs anymore, we relied on spirit and that got us through in the end.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"In the second half we took some risks, we continued going for the game.\n\"We did better than Arsenal but we didn't win and that is all that matters.\n\"We didn't deserve to lose the game.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer Manchester City defender Danny Mills: \"City dominated possession but only had long shots as Arsenal played perfect counter-attacking football.\n\"Arsenal had really good chances to kill the game off and got nervous at the end but you have to say all credit to them. It was a terribly disappointing performance from City.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal have lost just one of their 19 Premier League home games against Manchester City.\nMan City have won none of their last five Premier League away matches.\nMesut Ozil recorded his 14th and 15th assists of the season in this game, reaching the total in 16 appearances, faster than any player in a single Premier League season.\nOzil now has 29 Premier League assists in his career, as many as Eden Hazard but in 59 games fewer.\nFive of Arsenal's last six top-flight title wins have seen them in second place at Christmas, including two of their three Premier League titles.\nMan City have lost five games this season. The last team to lose five or more games before Christmas and still win the title were Everton in 1986-87.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to 12th-placed Southampton on Boxing Day before entertaining Bournemouth two days later. Manchester City play Sunderland at home next, before taking on current leaders Leicester away on 28 December.",

He had gone seven games without scoring at the start of the season but, having been employed in a more central role recently, he has scored four goals in his last eight games.\nMan of the match - Jordan Ayew\nWhat the managers said\nNewcastle head coach Steve McClaren: \"The conditions were horrendous. Get the ball wide and get the ball in the box - it was a game for width.\n\"Anybody can beat anybody in the league. I said before the match this was a dangerous game. Regarding us, a settled side has helped the momentum. We might not win every game but we've made huge steps forward.\"\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"We didn't play well at all in the first 45 minutes. We were out of the game in terms of impact and intensity. If you are in the position we are in it's difficult for the player to get in the game straight away.\n\"There's a lack of confidence. It's better to react late then not to react. The fact we got back in the game could be very important. Newcastle have won the last two games, but in the second half we showed we are not far away from this type of team.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nFabricio Coloccini scored his first Premier League goal since November 2014 and his first at St James' Park since January 2011 against Spurs.\nNewcastle have dropped 12 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season; more than any other side.\nNewcastle are unbeaten in three Premier League games (W2 D1) - the first time they've managed to go three league games without defeat since February 2015 (W1 D2).\nAston Villa will be bottom of the Premier League at Xmas - just three of the previous 23 teams to be bottom of the competition on Christmas Day have stayed up.\nHowever, the team that were bottom of the Premier League on Xmas Day in each of the last two seasons have managed to avoid relegation that campaign (Leicester 2014-15 and Sunderland in 2013-14).\nWhat next?\nNewcastle host Everton on Boxing Day while Aston Villa host West Ham on the same day.",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "West Bromwich Albion 1-2 Bournemouth\nCharlie Daniels' late penalty earned Bournemouth a third successive Premier League victory at the expense of West Brom, who finished with nine men.\nThe Baggies were a man down in the 34th minute when James McClean was shown red for scything down Adam Smith.\nThe Cherries took the lead when Smith fired in low from 20 yards before Gareth McAuley equalised with a header.\nDaniels crashed home the winner three minutes from time before Salomon Rondon saw red for a clash with Dan Gosling.\nThe result sees manager Eddie Howe's Cherries stay 14th in the table, although they are now only two points behind 13th place West Brom who have 20 points.\nRelive the action from the Hawthorns.\nResults and reaction from Saturday's other Premier League matches.\nSizzling second half\nThe opening 30 minutes was rather tepid.\nThe contest took a turn for the better - although Baggies fans will disagree - when McClean was shown a straight red by referee Mike Dean for a challenge on Smith. Cue the expected Bournemouth charge.\nThe Cherries were already on top but having a man advantage gave them that added fillip to go and attack their hosts.\nThe goal came seven minutes after the break when Smith collected a crossfield ball from Andrew Surman, cut in from the right before slotting into keeper Boaz Myhill's bottom left.\nThen came an unexpected twist. The Baggies had posed little threat on the rare forays into the final third, so when McAuley headed in off the post from a corner, even the home fans inside the ground seemed surprised.\nDebatable penalty?\nAlthough the Baggies did not have their finest 90 minutes this season, they would rightly feel aggrieved for the penalty decision in the 87th minute.\nDean, subjected to some jeers for sending off McClean, was adamant Gosling had been fouled inside the area by West Brom skipper Darren Fletcher.\nHowever, the TV replays seem to suggest that the infringement occurred outside the area.\nDaniels, unaffected by the plastic bag that floated near the penalty spot, confidently blasted his kick past the reach of Myhill.\nRondon's day to forget\nThe \u00a312m club-record signing had a day to forget. Bar a spectacular volley early in the second half, the Venezuela international was largely ineffective as a lone frontman.\nThen came the sending off. With his side heading for defeat, Rondon went face-to-face, or should that be head-to-head with Gosling. The forward then thrusted his forehead at the Cherries midfielder which referee Dean judged to be a red-card offence.\nThat will be a three-match ban for Rondon, while McClean will also get a ban which will give manager Tony Pulis a headache over the busy festive period.\nMan of the match - Adam Smith (Bournemouth)\nManager reaction\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"Whenever you come here, to get three points, under the conditions you are faced with, it is a huge three points and take nothing away from the lads.\n\"The fact it was against 10 men doesn't really change their threat from set pieces. It is a great win for us. It was hard to create chances first half - anyone who sees us consistently will say we are a side that creates more chances than today.\n\"Personally I thought it [McClean] was a red card. They came together just seconds before that tackle and James just lost his head a little bit and seemed to go over the ball from my angle so I wasn't surprised when the red card came out.\n\"It [Rondon] was a silly one really. Both players came together and I'm pleased my lads kept their cool and control. The referee had a very good view is what I'll say.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis on the penalty decision: \"I think everybody can see it's outside the box. It's really disappointing, you can't be giving big decision unless you're absolutely 100 per cent sure. He's an experienced referee and it's very disappointing.\n\"The reaction of the players when Mike Dean gives the penalty, they were absolutely distraught. It's not a penalty. We've worked very hard second half with 10 men.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTony Pulis has suffered his 100th Premier League defeat, a figure only 14 other managers have reached in the competition.\nBournemouth have seen their opponents pick up five red cards this season in the Premier League; more than any other side.\nSmith has scored two (both from outside the box) in his last four league games for Bournemouth after netting just one in his previous 86.\nWBA have scored a league-high eight headed goals in the Premier League this season.\nThe Cherries have shipped a league-high 12 goals from set-piece situations this season.\nWhat's next?\nThe Baggies travel to strugglers Swansea on Boxing Day, while the Cherries are hosting Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace on the same day."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Southampton 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur\nHarry Kane scored on his 100th Tottenham appearance as they moved into the Premier League top four with victory at struggling Southampton.\nKane broke through the Saints defensive line and finished coolly for a 10th goal in his past 10 games.\nSoon after, Dele Alli benefitted from some lax defending to score from close range and put Spurs firmly in control.\nSpurs managed the game superbly in the second half against a Saints side who are now without a win in six matches.\nIt represents a shocking start to what Southampton manager Ronald Koeman had described as a crucial two weeks for his team, who remain seven points clear of the relegation zone but in need of an upturn in form to avoid slipping closer to danger.\nIn contrast, Tottenham gave the perfect riposte to last weekend's surprise defeat at home to Newcastle with a professional performance to take them to 29 points from 17 league games.\nKane caps his century with a goal\nFor much of the first half, it was an even encounter between the sides, but Tottenham seized a control they would not relinquish with two goals in the space of three minutes just before half-time.\nIn Kane, they had the one quality striker on the pitch and he proved his class with a superb show of strength, skill and composure to give them the lead.\nErik Lamela broke on the halfway line and found Alli, who managed to move the ball on to Kane shortly before being taken out by a wild challenge from Jose Fonte.\nKane did the rest, darting between two home players before poking the ball past Virgil van Dijk, running in on goal and finishing neatly past Southampton keeper Paulo Gazzaniga for the 47th goal of his Spurs career.\nClearly shaken, Southampton gifted the visitors a second as the excellent Alli went from provider to scorer, finishing unchallenged at the back post after Kyle Walker's low cross made its way through a host of static defenders.\nToo Mane misses\nDuring their poor recent run, Koeman has complained that his side's biggest problem has been a failure to convert the numerous chances they have created.\nThis was certainly the case in the opening 20 minutes on Saturday as Sadio Mane spurned a number of good opportunities.\nThe best two saw the forward's angled drive blocked by the boot of former Saints defender Toby Alderweireld, before Hugo Lloris saved his first-time shot from the edge of the area.\nHaving conceded twice before the break, Southampton failed to recover as Tottenham withheld their limp and increasingly desperate forays forward with ease.\nThey only seriously threatened in added time when Lloris produced a superb low save to palm away a shot from substitute James Ward-Prowse, but by then it was a case of much too little, way too late.\nA triumph for Pochettino's method\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino left Southampton to take over at Spurs in May 2014, following 18 months in which he helped sculpt Saints into an effective Premier League outfit.\nIt has taken time for the Argentine's preferred high-energy pressing game to bed in at White Hart Lane but, with the addition of the likes of Alli in midfield, Alderweireld in defence and significant contributions from Lloris and Kane at either end, they are reaping the rewards.\nPrior to Saturday, they had given away more points - 11 - from winning positions than any other Premier League club this season, including three last Sunday against Newcastle, which can be an unfortunate by-product of such an attacking style.\nHowever, Tottenham ensured they did not add to this unwanted stat with a pragmatic and intelligent display in the second half to see the game out, playing largely in the Saints half to earn a deserved and impressive win.\nMan of the match - Dele Alli\nWhat they said\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"If you analyse the game and watch the first goal, I am very worried because the defending was at amateur level and not the level you need to win this kind of game. It was so naive.\n\"One of my criticisms this season is that we are too nice people. Until the first goal, Southampton was the better team but they showed us what is a 'killing mentality'. They won the battles and second balls and were more clever in one-on-one situations.\n\"It might also be about confidence, but we need to be more clinical. If you get three or four good chances, you have to score.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Arsenal 2-1 Manchester City\nArsenal moved to within two points of surprise Premier League leaders Leicester City with victory over Manchester City at Emirates Stadium.\nThe Gunners - without a title triumph since 2004 - showed the sort of impressive drive, cutting edge and resilience that will lead manager Arsene Wenger to believe Arsenal can finally end that barren spell.\nCity dominated early possession but Kevin de Bruyne wasted a good chance and Theo Walcott punished the visitors with a right-foot finish from 20 yards in the 33rd minute.\nEliaquim Mangala's dreadful clearance allowed Mesut Ozil's 15th assist of the season as he set up Olivier Giroud for an angled finish in first-half stoppage time. Yaya Toure's clever shot from outside the area set up a tense finale which saw both Toure and substitute Wilfried Bony waste chances to equalise.\nHow the action unfolded, pictures and the best of social media\nIs it now or never for Wenger to win the title?\nPodcast: 'Arsenal were tactically superb'\nRuthless Arsenal\nWenger's side have often been accused of having a soft centre when the pressure is on - but here, faced with the team many believe will still emerge as their closes title rivals, they showed a ruthless streak.\nCity may have dominated possession and territory for the first half hour but it was Arsenal who made it count at the business end. Their tally for the opening 45 minutes read two shots on target and two goals. For a manager who prides himself on efficiency, Wenger will have been delighted.\nThe Gunners were impressive at the back too, where goalkeeper Petr Cech was the epitome of safe handling and security, proving once more what a significant signing he has been.\nArsenal's defenders were in the mood too, with two crunching tackles from full-back Nacho Monreal drawing a high-five from fellow defender Per Mertesacker.\nWalcott grows in stature\nFor a player often criticised for his lack of end product, Walcott looks to be evolving into the complete striker at the age of 26.\nWalcott's goal, wonderfully accomplished as he turned inside before curling a perfect finish beyond the stretching City keeper Joe Hart, was his 13th in his past 17 league appearances and delivered further evidence of his development into a consistent and reliable goalscorer.\nHe, and indeed Arsenal, are receiving plenty of help from the Premier League's current creator supreme Ozil, who had a hand in both goals and received a standing ovation when he was replaced late on.\nAdd in Giroud's golden sequence of 12 goals in his past 14 matches in all competitions, and Arsenal will believe they possess the potency to carry them all the way.\nManchester City come up short again\nAside from a dominant opening half and a late rally after Toure's goal, this was another poor performance from Manuel Pellegrini's side.\nCity were too often laboured and the sight of captain Vincent Kompany watching forlornly from the stands pointed to where many of the problems lie.\nPellegrini may have signed Mangala and Nicolas Otamendi for fees in excess of \u00a360m, but they are still not the same and markedly less assured.\nAnd with Sergio Aguero still not fully fit and substituted, City are currently well short of their best.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"I believe we have shown spirit, organisation, brilliance and altogether they gave us the three points.\n\"You could see that there is exceptional life in this team and when we did not have the legs anymore, we relied on spirit and that got us through in the end.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"In the second half we took some risks, we continued going for the game.\n\"We did better than Arsenal but we didn't win and that is all that matters.\n\"We didn't deserve to lose the game.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer Manchester City defender Danny Mills: \"City dominated possession but only had long shots as Arsenal played perfect counter-attacking football.\n\"Arsenal had really good chances to kill the game off and got nervous at the end but you have to say all credit to them. It was a terribly disappointing performance from City.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal have lost just one of their 19 Premier League home games against Manchester City.\nMan City have won none of their last five Premier League away matches.\nMesut Ozil recorded his 14th and 15th assists of the season in this game, reaching the total in 16 appearances, faster than any player in a single Premier League season.\nOzil now has 29 Premier League assists in his career, as many as Eden Hazard but in 59 games fewer.\nFive of Arsenal's last six top-flight title wins have seen them in second place at Christmas, including two of their three Premier League titles.\nMan City have lost five games this season. The last team to lose five or more games before Christmas and still win the title were Everton in 1986-87.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to 12th-placed Southampton on Boxing Day before entertaining Bournemouth two days later. Manchester City play Sunderland at home next, before taking on current leaders Leicester away on 28 December."

You have to have respect for Watford because they have been on a winning streak and have very decent strikers.\n\"But in the end I think we could have made a little bit more, we had some chances and it was a pity Oscar slipped for the penalty.\n\"Diego Costa when he is focused on what he is good at he has his profit from his play.\n\"He will not be there [against Manchester United on Monday] which means we have to think a bit. [Eden] Hazard came back in the last week and had two training sessions and we hope he can be fully fit.\"\nWatford manager Quique Flores: \"I think we had the possibility to win but Chelsea played really well.\n\"They pushed us a lot and were probably closer to the win than us. We defended well, we fought a lot in the 90 minutes, and for us this is a very important point.\nOn whether Diego Costa was offside when scoring: \"I don't know, it is very quick, probably if you say it is offside maybe it is offside, but anyway I think the result is fair.\n\"I think the team has enough confidence for the future, it's amazing for the story of Watford.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea are unbeaten in the Premier League on Boxing Day since 2003, winning six and drawing five matches since then.\nWatford have won just two of their last 14 league matches played on Boxing Day (won two, drew five, lost seven).\nThe Hornets have already won more points in 2015-16 than in any of their previous two Premier League campaigns (29).\nDiego Costa scored his first Premier League brace since 17 January versus Swansea City and it was only the second time that he scored more than once in a single Premier League game at Stamford Bridge.\nWillian - who assisted Costa's second goal - has had a hand in 10 goals in all competitions for Chelsea this season (seven goals, three assists).\nOdion Ighalo is the first Watford player to score in five successive top-flight games.\nTroy Deeney has been directly involved in six goals in his last seven Premier League appearances (five goals, one assist).\nDeeney's strike was Watford's first goal at Stamford Bridge since Allan Smart in February 2000 - they had failed to score in their last four competitive trips there.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea go to Manchester United on Monday, without the suspended Diego Costa, while Watford host Tottenham.",

I think we need to feel proud. The performance from the players was perfect. Only the first 15 minutes was difficult but we managed the game very well.\n\"It is difficult to speak more about Harry Kane. For me, he needs to keep working hard and keep showing his qualities in the games. Dele Alli is another player we are very happy with but it is about the team and they showed confidence in how we played.\"\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"Until they got the penalty and the first goal, there was nothing in it. Once we conceded the goal, they grew in confidence and we found it tough.\n\"Defensively, we could have done better. We hit a lull after the first goal, which is disappointing. We just did not have enough to get anything from the game.\n\"Teams in the bottom half of the table are crucial for us. The next one against Aston Villa - we know the importance of it. If we beat Villa, we will be at 20 points after half way and everyone talks about reaching the 40-point mark.\"\nPlayer reaction\nThe stats you need to know\nHarry Kane scored with both of his two shots on target in the game.\nDele Alli has scored or assisted five goals in his past five Premier League games (two goals, three assists).\nNorwich City have never won a Premier League game on Boxing Day (D1 L5).\nSince defeating Spurs at White Hart Lane in April 2012 (2-1), Norwich City have failed to win any of their past 16 Premier League away trips to London (L10 D6).\nWhat next?\nSpurs make the short trip to Vicarage Road to face Watford, who are just three places and three points behind them, at 15:00 GMT on Monday.\nAt the same time, Norwich will host bottom-of-the-table Aston Villa."

As a result, all eyes were on the Belgium international before kick-off.\nLukaku had scored in each of the Toffees' previous eight games, and needed one more to equal Dixie Dean's record of scoring in nine games in a row for Everton, which has stood for 88 years.\nHe should have scored when Everton were on top in the opening stages of the first half, but shot straight at Elliot in the Newcastle goal, and had another chance midway through the second half, turning his marker before seeing his powerful drive stopped.\nWhen Lukaku shot over from a rebound after Funes Mori's header was saved, it looked like not being his, or Everton's day.\nThat was until Cleverley, without a goal in his 10 previous appearances for Everton, kept his composure to head home.\nHarsh on Elliot\nIn what has been a miserable season so far for Newcastle, the emergence of Elliot has been of the few positives.\nHe started the season as Newcastle's third-choice keeper but got his chance to impress when number one Tim Krul was ruled out for the season after injuring himself on international duty in October.\nWith Krul's deputy, Karl Darlow, out with an ankle injury, Elliot came into the side against Norwich in October and has not looked back.\nHe was on course for a man-of-the-match performance against Everton, producing a string of fine saves from Lukaku and Aaron Lennon.\nA weak punch ultimately proved costly, but the game could have been out of sight long before Cleverley struck if not for Elliot.\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku\nWhat they said\nNewcastle boss Steve McClaren: \"Last kick of the game, what a huge disappointment. I am disappointed for the players because they gave everything. They did not deserve to lose.\n\"All we can do is pick ourselves up and go again.

They started 2015 with a 1-1 draw over United at the Britannia. They're ending the calendar year within sight of a European place.\nMan of the match - Bojan Krkic\nWhat the managers said\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes: \"I thought we were excellent in the first half. We looked to be positive and tried to get in behind their back four.\n\"They may have got some momentum but we saw it out quite comfortably.\n\"We wanted to be on the front foot and force errors and that's what happened.\n\"We have got players who can take chances but they might have taken more this season.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"We have lost the game in the first 45 minutes because we didn't dare to play our football.\n\"I thought it was the right decision [to leave out Wayne Rooney] otherwise I would not have done it.\n\"I have received it [backing of club] all the time but we have lost today so there is a new situation. I feel the support of my players and my board. The fans will be disappointed but that is logical after four defeats.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer Everton winger Kevin Kilbane, speaking on Final Score: \"I can't see Louis van Gaal staying beyond this now. On Tuesday he walked out of his press conference, and there has been an awful lot of pressure on him this week.\n\"That performance was as bad you will ever see from a Manchester United side.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMarko Arnautovic has now scored more Premier League goals this season (six) than his previous two combined (five).\nThe last time Manchester United lost four competitive games in a row was between May and August 2001.\nUnited have lost four straight competitive matches in a single season for the first time since November 1961.\nUnited lost a Premier League game on Boxing Day for the first time since 2002 (1-3 at Middlesbrough) and only for the second time overall in the top flight (P22 W18 D2 L2).\nLouis van Gaal's side have averaged just 1.22 goals per game in the league this season (22 goals in 18 games) - United's lowest average in a league campaign since 1989-90 (1.21).\nStoke have kept a clean sheet in eight of their past 11 Premier League games.\nWhat next?\nBoth teams have little time before they are back in action.

As a result, all eyes were on the Belgium international before kick-off.\nLukaku had scored in each of the Toffees' previous eight games, and needed one more to equal Dixie Dean's record of scoring in nine games in a row for Everton, which has stood for 88 years.\nHe should have scored when Everton were on top in the opening stages of the first half, but shot straight at Elliot in the Newcastle goal, and had another chance midway through the second half, turning his marker before seeing his powerful drive stopped.\nWhen Lukaku shot over from a rebound after Funes Mori's header was saved, it looked like not being his, or Everton's day.\nThat was until Cleverley, without a goal in his 10 previous appearances for Everton, kept his composure to head home.\nHarsh on Elliot\nIn what has been a miserable season so far for Newcastle, the emergence of Elliot has been of the few positives.\nHe started the season as Newcastle's third-choice keeper but got his chance to impress when number one Tim Krul was ruled out for the season after injuring himself on international duty in October.\nWith Krul's deputy, Karl Darlow, out with an ankle injury, Elliot came into the side against Norwich in October and has not looked back.\nHe was on course for a man-of-the-match performance against Everton, producing a string of fine saves from Lukaku and Aaron Lennon.\nA weak punch ultimately proved costly, but the game could have been out of sight long before Cleverley struck if not for Elliot.\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku\nWhat they said\nNewcastle boss Steve McClaren: \"Last kick of the game, what a huge disappointment. I am disappointed for the players because they gave everything. They did not deserve to lose.\n\"All we can do is pick ourselves up and go again.

I think we need to feel proud. The performance from the players was perfect. Only the first 15 minutes was difficult but we managed the game very well.\n\"It is difficult to speak more about Harry Kane. For me, he needs to keep working hard and keep showing his qualities in the games. Dele Alli is another player we are very happy with but it is about the team and they showed confidence in how we played.\"\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"Until they got the penalty and the first goal, there was nothing in it. Once we conceded the goal, they grew in confidence and we found it tough.\n\"Defensively, we could have done better. We hit a lull after the first goal, which is disappointing. We just did not have enough to get anything from the game.\n\"Teams in the bottom half of the table are crucial for us. The next one against Aston Villa - we know the importance of it. If we beat Villa, we will be at 20 points after half way and everyone talks about reaching the 40-point mark.\"\nPlayer reaction\nThe stats you need to know\nHarry Kane scored with both of his two shots on target in the game.\nDele Alli has scored or assisted five goals in his past five Premier League games (two goals, three assists).\nNorwich City have never won a Premier League game on Boxing Day (D1 L5).\nSince defeating Spurs at White Hart Lane in April 2012 (2-1), Norwich City have failed to win any of their past 16 Premier League away trips to London (L10 D6).\nWhat next?\nSpurs make the short trip to Vicarage Road to face Watford, who are just three places and three points behind them, at 15:00 GMT on Monday.\nAt the same time, Norwich will host bottom-of-the-table Aston Villa.",

I wanted to win. A draw was not the goal for this game.\n\"We only missed the points. What we put into this game was probably the best we can do. I think we deserved more than we got. I am frustrated and also a bit sad for my players.\n\"We are still in a very bad position but when I see my team play it's very encouraging. The performance we gave was not a bottom one. We have to score goals and be more efficient in the offensive parts.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic on Villa's penalty: \"I am not happy with that of course. From my point of view I saw Rudy Gestede was pulling Ogbonna's shirt. With that it gained him an advantage and he got in front of Angelo. For me it was a foul.\n\"He gave a penalty but if he gave that he should have given a penalty for one of the handballs for us. Unfortunately, he didn't.\n\"It's mixed emotions for us. When you are leading 1-0 at half-time against a team which is fighting for their lives and nervous, you expect to win the game.\n\"They scored a penalty and then got the momentum so it was a fair point. With the injuries and everything that happened we showed good character. We got a point away from home which is good. Hopefully we will have a few players back very soon.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAston Villa are now winless in 17 Premier League games - only four teams have ever had a longer run in the division (Derby 32, Sunderland 26, Norwich 21 and Nottingham Forest 19 - QPR also had a run of 17).\nWest Ham have recorded five successive top-flight draws for the first time since October 1968.\nAaron Cresswell scored his first Premier League goal since April and his first for the Hammers away from Upton Park.\nAston Villa have won just one of their past 15 games on Boxing Day (Won 1, Drawn 5, Lost 9).\nThe Hammers have earned 16 points on the road so far this season, the same tally as in the whole of last season.\nWhat next?\nPrior to this match, Garde had said his team needed \"at least 10 victories\" from their remaining 21 matches to avoid relegation, and one of those victories must surely come against fellow strugglers Norwich on Monday.\nOn the same day, West Ham will hope to end their eight-match winless run against a Southampton side which enjoyed a thumping 4-0 win over Arsenal on Boxing Day."

They started 2015 with a 1-1 draw over United at the Britannia. They're ending the calendar year within sight of a European place.\nMan of the match - Bojan Krkic\nWhat the managers said\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes: \"I thought we were excellent in the first half. We looked to be positive and tried to get in behind their back four.\n\"They may have got some momentum but we saw it out quite comfortably.\n\"We wanted to be on the front foot and force errors and that's what happened.\n\"We have got players who can take chances but they might have taken more this season.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"We have lost the game in the first 45 minutes because we didn't dare to play our football.\n\"I thought it was the right decision [to leave out Wayne Rooney] otherwise I would not have done it.\n\"I have received it [backing of club] all the time but we have lost today so there is a new situation. I feel the support of my players and my board. The fans will be disappointed but that is logical after four defeats.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer Everton winger Kevin Kilbane, speaking on Final Score: \"I can't see Louis van Gaal staying beyond this now. On Tuesday he walked out of his press conference, and there has been an awful lot of pressure on him this week.\n\"That performance was as bad you will ever see from a Manchester United side.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMarko Arnautovic has now scored more Premier League goals this season (six) than his previous two combined (five).\nThe last time Manchester United lost four competitive games in a row was between May and August 2001.\nUnited have lost four straight competitive matches in a single season for the first time since November 1961.\nUnited lost a Premier League game on Boxing Day for the first time since 2002 (1-3 at Middlesbrough) and only for the second time overall in the top flight (P22 W18 D2 L2).\nLouis van Gaal's side have averaged just 1.22 goals per game in the league this season (22 goals in 18 games) - United's lowest average in a league campaign since 1989-90 (1.21).\nStoke have kept a clean sheet in eight of their past 11 Premier League games.\nWhat next?\nBoth teams have little time before they are back in action.

You have to have respect for Watford because they have been on a winning streak and have very decent strikers.\n\"But in the end I think we could have made a little bit more, we had some chances and it was a pity Oscar slipped for the penalty.\n\"Diego Costa when he is focused on what he is good at he has his profit from his play.\n\"He will not be there [against Manchester United on Monday] which means we have to think a bit. [Eden] Hazard came back in the last week and had two training sessions and we hope he can be fully fit.\"\nWatford manager Quique Flores: \"I think we had the possibility to win but Chelsea played really well.\n\"They pushed us a lot and were probably closer to the win than us. We defended well, we fought a lot in the 90 minutes, and for us this is a very important point.\nOn whether Diego Costa was offside when scoring: \"I don't know, it is very quick, probably if you say it is offside maybe it is offside, but anyway I think the result is fair.\n\"I think the team has enough confidence for the future, it's amazing for the story of Watford.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea are unbeaten in the Premier League on Boxing Day since 2003, winning six and drawing five matches since then.\nWatford have won just two of their last 14 league matches played on Boxing Day (won two, drew five, lost seven).\nThe Hornets have already won more points in 2015-16 than in any of their previous two Premier League campaigns (29).\nDiego Costa scored his first Premier League brace since 17 January versus Swansea City and it was only the second time that he scored more than once in a single Premier League game at Stamford Bridge.\nWillian - who assisted Costa's second goal - has had a hand in 10 goals in all competitions for Chelsea this season (seven goals, three assists).\nOdion Ighalo is the first Watford player to score in five successive top-flight games.\nTroy Deeney has been directly involved in six goals in his last seven Premier League appearances (five goals, one assist).\nDeeney's strike was Watford's first goal at Stamford Bridge since Allan Smart in February 2000 - they had failed to score in their last four competitive trips there.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea go to Manchester United on Monday, without the suspended Diego Costa, while Watford host Tottenham."

Virgil van Dijk had a header ruled out for offside, while Dusan Tadic's dipping strike was pushed away by Cech.\nRelive Southampton's win over Arsenal on Boxing Day\nSuper Saints but Gunners sinners\nArsenal had lost just one of their previous 11 league games and recorded an impressive victory over Manchester City on Monday but Arsene Wenger's side could not back that performance up with victory on the south coast.\nHaving seen leaders Leicester beaten by Liverpool earlier in the day, the Gunners would have gone top with a win but were resoundingly beaten by a rampant Southampton side.\nPlaymaker Mesut Ozil - who has received plenty of plaudits for his impressive performances this season - was kept quiet by the Southampton midfield, while former Saint Walcott posed little threat, attempting only 20 passes before being substituted.\nGoing into the game, Arsenal had conceded the joint-fewest number of goals (14) in the league this season and their second-half capitulation will be a big worry to Wenger.\nArsenal need to win games against teams in the bottom half of the table if they are to take the title, but did not come close to capitalising on the points dropped by Claudio Ranieri's side.\n'Bully' Wanyama gives Arsenal no respite\nThe pressure was starting to grow on Southampton boss Ronald Koeman after five winless games left them just four points above the relegation zone.\nBut they were marshalled brilliantly in the middle of the park by the superb Victor Wanyama, who made a match-high six tackles and 10 interceptions, often bullying the opposition players.\nThe opening goal was stunning. There seemed to be no danger when defender Per Mertesacker headed the ball away, and Martina steadied himself before unleashing an outside-of-the-foot drive which started wide of the post before swerving into the net.\nArsenal posed little threat and the hosts added to their tally with a slick counter-attacking move.\nThere was a hint of controversy in it though, as Long and Laurent Koscielny came together in the build-up, leaving the Frenchman on the ground, allowing Long to stride forward unchallenged and stroke in from Sadio Mane's pass.\nDefender Fonte added a bullet header and Long grabbed his second to complete a comprehensive victory for Southampton who managed their first clean sheet in six games.\nMan of the match - Shane Long\nWhat they said:\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"You don't expect a 4-0 win against Arsenal. Of course we have a good football team, but we have struggled in recent weeks. But the second half was perfect. It was a tough night for Arsenal, we caused them a lot of problems. It was an amazing result.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"We lost too many challenges and that explains why we lost the game. But that's one aspect, so well done to them.\n\"The second aspect is that on the first three goals we were really unlucky with the decision of the referee. The first goal was offside, the second goal was a foul and the third goal was a goal kick, so if you're a bit below par and on top of that you have the first three goals against you in the decision-making then it's even more difficult.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis was Arsenal's heaviest Premier League defeat since a 6-0 away loss at Chelsea in March 2014\nArsenal have conceded five Premier League goals from outside the box in 2015-16 so far; two more than in the whole of the 2014-15 season\nSouthampton winger Sadio Mane has six assists in 18 Premier League appearances this season - he had only three in 30 league games last season\nShane Long has scored five and assisted two more goals in his last seven Premier League starts for Southampton\nWhat next?\nIt's a quick turnaround for both sides.

We had the best chances, but we're disappointed not to have worked their keeper more.\"\nPalace resolute on the road again\nWhile this was hardly a vintage performance from the Eagles, it did demonstrate many of the qualities that have made them such a formidable proposition on the road.\nScott Dann and Damien Delaney gave a typically commanding performance at the back as they totally snuffed out the threat of former Palace striker Glenn Murray and ensured Palace's tally of goals conceded away - seven - remains the lowest in the league.\nAnd in front of the back four James McArthur was excellent, making a team-high four tackles and winning possession on nine occasions - more than anyone else on the pitch.\nThat solidity was crucial as Palace earned a 36th away point of 2015 - second only to Arsenal.\nMan of the match - Scott Dann\nWhat they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was a real battle, Palace are a very good side, very physical and we certainly knew we were in a game. But the most pleasing aspect from my perspective was the way we fought and defended set plays, with the aerial threat they've got.\n\"We're harder to beat now, that's six games unbeaten, confidence is improving and belief is growing. We probably created the best chances but didn't take them. We're now moving into a tough period when we know we'll have to be even better.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: \"Physically and mentally, it was a tough game - you have to take your hat off to Bournemouth as they're relentless. I had to bring on Yohan Cabaye [at half-time] to get some of the ball, and in the last six minutes I think it showed, as Bournemouth couldn't raise a leg by then. But I'm full of admiration for what they [Bournemouth] did. We'll take the point, it moves us up a place, the unbeaten run goes on, we go to the next game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nBournemouth have lost only one of their last nine Boxing Day matches (won five, drew three, lost one), a run that has seen them play in all four tiers of English football.\nThe Cherries ended a run of 29 league games without a goalless draw, since their game against Blackburn in February.\nPalace are unbeaten in five Premier League games, their best run since April 2014.\nAfter drawing none of their first 14 Premier League away games under Alan Pardew, the Eagles have drawn two of their last three.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth visit Arsenal on Monday, while Palace face Swansea."

I wanted to win. A draw was not the goal for this game.\n\"We only missed the points. What we put into this game was probably the best we can do. I think we deserved more than we got. I am frustrated and also a bit sad for my players.\n\"We are still in a very bad position but when I see my team play it's very encouraging. The performance we gave was not a bottom one. We have to score goals and be more efficient in the offensive parts.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic on Villa's penalty: \"I am not happy with that of course. From my point of view I saw Rudy Gestede was pulling Ogbonna's shirt. With that it gained him an advantage and he got in front of Angelo. For me it was a foul.\n\"He gave a penalty but if he gave that he should have given a penalty for one of the handballs for us. Unfortunately, he didn't.\n\"It's mixed emotions for us. When you are leading 1-0 at half-time against a team which is fighting for their lives and nervous, you expect to win the game.\n\"They scored a penalty and then got the momentum so it was a fair point. With the injuries and everything that happened we showed good character. We got a point away from home which is good. Hopefully we will have a few players back very soon.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAston Villa are now winless in 17 Premier League games - only four teams have ever had a longer run in the division (Derby 32, Sunderland 26, Norwich 21 and Nottingham Forest 19 - QPR also had a run of 17).\nWest Ham have recorded five successive top-flight draws for the first time since October 1968.\nAaron Cresswell scored his first Premier League goal since April and his first for the Hammers away from Upton Park.\nAston Villa have won just one of their past 15 games on Boxing Day (Won 1, Drawn 5, Lost 9).\nThe Hammers have earned 16 points on the road so far this season, the same tally as in the whole of last season.\nWhat next?\nPrior to this match, Garde had said his team needed \"at least 10 victories\" from their remaining 21 matches to avoid relegation, and one of those victories must surely come against fellow strugglers Norwich on Monday.\nOn the same day, West Ham will hope to end their eight-match winless run against a Southampton side which enjoyed a thumping 4-0 win over Arsenal on Boxing Day.",

That's the question many sceptics have been asking about the surprise leaders.\nAfter a toothless display at Anfield, where they managed just three shots on target, Leicester will have to improve dramatically if they are to maintain their lofty position.\n\"We have to clean this result away and restart,\" said Ranieri afterwards.\nVardy and Mahrez fail to shine\nTwo of the brightest stars in Leicester's resurgence have been England striker Jamie Vardy and Algeria playmaker Riyad Mahrez.\nThe two men have contributed 29 of Leicester's 37 Premier League goals this season, as well as providing 10 assists for each other or their team-mates.\nBut neither made an impact against Liverpool, with Ranieri revealing afterwards that Vardy played with a fever and Mahrez was \"very tired\".\nAs a team, Leicester lacked their usual energy and managed to muster just seven attempts at the Liverpool goal.\nBelgian pair boost the Reds\nLiverpool's revival under Jurgen Klopp has showed signs of slowing down in recent weeks, with the Reds picking up just one point in their three previous Premier League matches.\nFollowing the 3-0 defeat at Watford, Klopp decided to recall Belgium striker Divock Origi to provide more pace and movement as the focal point of his attack.\nOrigi's speed caused problems for the Leicester defence in the opening half an hour, as the hosts began at a brisk tempo.\nBut a hamstring injury curtailed Origi's afternoon, meaning his international colleague Benteke was summoned from the bench.\nBenteke, a \u00a332m summer signing from Aston Villa, had not scored a Premier League goal in six appearances and wastefully headed over an early second-half opportunity.\nHowever, he clinically finished when it mattered - sliding in the winner as Liverpool moved up to eighth.\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson\nPost-match reaction\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"After four games with no result, that was very important today.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Liverpool 1-0 Leicester City\nLeaders Leicester saw their nine-match unbeaten Premier League run ended by Liverpool substitute Christian Benteke's second-half winner.\nThe Reds dominated the first half at Anfield, but failed to fully test Foxes keeper Kasper Schmeichel.\nThey were rewarded when Roberto Firmino's pull-back from the left was steered in by a stretching Benteke.\nLeicester offered little threat, Nathan Dyer going closest as they failed to score for the first time this season.\nHow the action unfolded at Anfield\nFestive woe for Foxes\nLeicester spent Christmas Day on top of the Premier League, capping a marvellous turnaround after being bottom of the table 12 months ago.\nTheir first league defeat since losing 5-2 at home to Arsenal on 26 September left them vulnerable to be overtaken by the Gunners later on Saturday.\nBut Arsene Wenger's men failed to capitalise after a 4-0 loss at Southampton, meaning the Foxes are still two points clear at the summit.\nCan Claudio Ranieri's side react positively to defeat? That's the question many sceptics have been asking about the surprise leaders.\nAfter a toothless display at Anfield, where they managed just three shots on target, Leicester will have to improve dramatically if they are to maintain their lofty position.\n\"We have to clean this result away and restart,\" said Ranieri afterwards.\nVardy and Mahrez fail to shine\nTwo of the brightest stars in Leicester's resurgence have been England striker Jamie Vardy and Algeria playmaker Riyad Mahrez.\nThe two men have contributed 29 of Leicester's 37 Premier League goals this season, as well as providing 10 assists for each other or their team-mates.\nBut neither made an impact against Liverpool, with Ranieri revealing afterwards that Vardy played with a fever and Mahrez was \"very tired\".\nAs a team, Leicester lacked their usual energy and managed to muster just seven attempts at the Liverpool goal.\nBelgian pair boost the Reds\nLiverpool's revival under Jurgen Klopp has showed signs of slowing down in recent weeks, with the Reds picking up just one point in their three previous Premier League matches.\nFollowing the 3-0 defeat at Watford, Klopp decided to recall Belgium striker Divock Origi to provide more pace and movement as the focal point of his attack.\nOrigi's speed caused problems for the Leicester defence in the opening half an hour, as the hosts began at a brisk tempo.\nBut a hamstring injury curtailed Origi's afternoon, meaning his international colleague Benteke was summoned from the bench.\nBenteke, a \u00a332m summer signing from Aston Villa, had not scored a Premier League goal in six appearances and wastefully headed over an early second-half opportunity.\nHowever, he clinically finished when it mattered - sliding in the winner as Liverpool moved up to eighth.\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson\nPost-match reaction\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"After four games with no result, that was very important today. Everybody knows of the quality of Leicester and what we had to do today was play simple football.\n\"The first half was really good and then we had to change. Christian Benteke was not warm, it's not easy to come into the game.\n\"We made the goal, it was a brilliant situation where the boys showed their quality in small situations. We were never really under pressure.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We started to play too late. Liverpool pushed from the beginning and for this reason they deserved to win.\n\"We tried to do our best but maybe in the first half we were too nervous to play our football. The second half was much better.\"\nWhat's next?\nAnother big match for the Foxes - the visit of third-placed Manchester City on Tuesday. Liverpool return to action on Wednesday, when they travel to struggling Sunderland.\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past seven league games against the Foxes, winning five and drawing two.\nThe Reds are also unbeaten at home in the Premier League on Boxing Day, winning six and drawing three.\nClaudio Ranieri's side lost their first away match of the season, last losing on the road in the Premier League in March (4-3 at Tottenham).\nChristian Benteke scored his first Premier League goal since Liverpool's 3-1 win against Chelsea in October.\nLeicester have won just one of their past 11 top-flight Boxing Day fixtures, drawing three and losing seven.\nLiverpool kept their first clean sheet in the Premier League since November, having conceded at least twice in each of their last three fixtures before Saturday."

I was happy when the referee blew, because they could have been 2-0 up.\n\"At half-time we made some changes but it was a change of character, of approach, of determination and will. They did try in the first half, but this was a different West Ham.\n\"We equalised and continued to chase, and at the end of the day we were rewarded for everything we did in the second half.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"The second half was totally different to the first. We had to score more than one in the first half, because otherwise you expect their reaction in the second. If you score only one they still have belief.\n\"The first half was the level of the Arsenal game. It was one team on the pitch playing football. But out of a better second half they scored two goals, and from a fantastic first we scored one.\n\"If you are the dominant side you have to score more than one goal, and that was the problem.\"\nWhat next?\nWest Ham play Liverpool at home in a 12:45 GMT kick-off on Saturday, when Southampton travel to Norwich for a 15:00 start.",

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester United 0-0 Chelsea\nManchester United provided some respite for manager Louis van Gaal with a much-improved performance as they were held to a draw by Chelsea at Old Trafford.\nVan Gaal's future was shrouded in uncertainty after a run of four straight defeats - and while a draw offers minor relief, United were still unable to secure the victory the 64-year-old Dutchman so desperately needs.\nUnited's luck was out as both Juan Mata and Anthony Martial struck the woodwork inside the first 15 minutes and only a brilliant reflex save from Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois stopped Ander Herrera from six yards after the break.\nChelsea, under the temporary control of Van Gaal's fellow countryman Guus Hiddink, had chances of their own and United needed the brilliance of keeper David de Gea as he saved athletically from John Terry's early header then made a double save from Pedro and Cesar Azpilicueta after the break.\nAnd as United ran out of momentum and ideas - although they were unlucky not to get a penalty when Willian handled - Nemanja Matic missed the best chance of the game when he raced clear, only to shoot hopelessly over the top.\nRead about how Manchester United's draw with Chelsea unfolded.\n, external\nReaction to Monday's Premier League results.\n, external\nNo reason to resign - Van Gaal\n, external\nVan Gaal feels Old Trafford support\nThe merchandisers outside Old Trafford may have been hawking scarves proclaiming Jose Mourinho as the next Manchester United manager, but those inside 'The Theatre Of Dreams' gave their embattled manager commendable support.\nFew Mourinho scarves were on view and Van Gaal was able to acknowledge warm applause from plenty of United fans as he made his way from the tunnel at the Stretford End to his technical area before kick-off.\nUnited's vibrant start, out of character with the timidity of recent weeks, instantly lifted the spirits and volume of support that were out-of-sorts and subdued before the start, and the fans remained solidly behind their team throughout.\nThere was certainly no hostility on view towards Van Gaal, although there were some signs of frustration as the game edged into the last 20 minutes with no sign of a breakthrough.\nThe final whistle was greeted with some jeers but this was more out of frustration that United could not find a winner, which also saw Wayne Rooney miss a late chance.\nVan Gaal's name was not heard in any chants but there was no groundswell of hostility towards the United manager fighting for his job.\nDaring Manchester United\nVan Gaal complained that United did not \"dare\" to play football in the Boxing Day defeat at Stoke City - suggesting they were so gripped by fear and a lack of confidence in the current slump that they were simply unable to play their natural game.\nHere, for the first hour at least, United delivered the sort of swift attacking football Old Trafford demands and a level of performance that would not have Van Gaal in such a hole had it been reproduced regularly this season.\nUnited had more chances here than in their previous six games and was in stark contrast to a run that has left them without a win since the 2-1 victory at Watford on 21 Nov.\nThey were desperately unlucky that the woodwork denied Mata and Martial - but the sign of that fragile confidence was shown in the way they ran out of ideas and inspiration in the last 30 minutes.\nHiddink must earn his money\nWhen Guus Hiddink walked in at Chelsea in February 2009 to succeed the sacked Luiz Felipe Scolari, it was simply a case of keeping a well-drilled and experienced side ticking over and perhaps adding a dash of his own quality and experience.\nIt worked well as the 69-year-old Dutchman guided Chelsea to an FA Cup final win against Everton, and the Blues were only denied a place in the Champions League final against Manchester United by a goal deep into injury time by Barcelona at Stamford Bridge.\nHiddink had a perfectly-tuned Chelsea side built around the spine of keeper Petr Cech, captain John Terry, midfield marksman Frank Lampard and a match-winning striker in Didier Drogba.\nNot so this time - and Hiddink will need all his acumen to revitalise a Chelsea side struggling to find any of the power, rhythm and fluency that made them Premier League champions in May.\nTerry is willing but reaching the end of his career, while inspiration is in short supply elsewhere despite the presence of players such as Eden Hazard, Willian and Oscar.\nHe also has to prove he still possesses his old authority after a barren spell in his career with failures in charge of Russia, Turkey and in a second spell with the Netherlands.\nIn other words, Hiddink has a serious job on his hands.\nMan of the match: David de Gea (Manchester United)\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester United have now gone eight games without victory in all competitions, their worst run since January 1990 (also eight games).\nLouis van Gaal has overseen 11 goalless draws as Manchester United boss, six of those coming since 27 October.\nGuus Hiddink has not lost any of his last five competitive contests with Louis van Gaal (W4 D1).\nThe Red Devils have kept seven clean sheets and conceded just three goals in their nine Premier League home games in 2015-16.\nThe Blues are unbeaten in their last six Premier League meetings with Man Utd (W3 D3).\nThis is United's lowest points total after 19 games of a league season since 1990 (22 points then, 30 this season).\nWhat they said\nChelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink: \"On the one hand, I am happy with a point because we had a difficult game, but on the other, we had two big chances to get three points. We were lacking some attacking players and had to adapt. In general I'm happy.\n\"Matic tells me when everyone expects him to make a goal, he doesn't and the other way round. I told him that I didn't expect him to score, so why didn't he?\n\"The team is showing ambition to get away from the relegation zone as soon as possible.\"\nWhat next?\nManchester United host Swansea on Saturday, 2 January while Chelsea travel to Crystal Palace on the following day.",

We've lost him for a key game. Fans pay a lot of money to see players like that, and the referee's taken him out of the game.\n\"A mistimed challenge is not a yellow card. It's a deliberate tackle to stop someone progressing down the pitch. Brede Hangeland escapes a booking for a far worse challenge.\n\"We want great players on the pitch. Stop handing out yellow cards.\"\nSwansea caretaker manager Alan Curtis: \"It was an excellent point against a very good Crystal Palace team. They showed today why they are where they are in the table.\n\"We're unbeaten in three with three clean sheets. That's a huge improvement on where we've been of late.\n\"I thought Ashley was brilliant. He's been the rock of the side for any number of seasons. Ashley epitomised the spirit of the team.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nCrystal Palace have won one of their last nine league matches against Swansea (W1 D4 L4).\nSwansea have conceded just three goals in those nine meetings.\nPalace's run of six league games without defeat is their best in the top flight since April 1993.\nSwansea have managed victory in just one of their last 11 Premier League trips to London (W1 D3 L7).\nThe Swans have won just one away league game all season, at Aston Villa on 24 October.\nCrystal Palace have not won their final league game of a calendar year since 2011.\nWhat next?\nSwansea face an intriguing trip to Manchester United on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Crystal Palace - minus the suspended Cabaye - host Chelsea on Sunday (13:30 GMT)"

It was difficult. We played well, we created some chances. I wanted to see how my players responded after the Liverpool defeat and they responded well.\n\"Every match is difficult for us. This league is very crazy...nobody wants to win the league. It's very strange. We're the basement and the other teams are a villa with a swimming pool. It's not easy for us but we want to fight with everybody. It's a miracle what we're doing.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"I think we did more than Leicester to win the game. We had more possession, more attempts, more options but it was a tough game against a tough team playing away. This is a crucial period. I think at the end of January we will know exactly what position we are in. \"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have extended their winless run on the road in the Premier League to six games, something they last achieved in April 2011.\nPellegrini's side have scored just one goal in their last five Premier League away games.\nLeicester City failed to score at home in the Premier League for the first time in 15 games.\nManchester City kept their first clean sheet of the season without Vincent Kompany in the line-up.\nUp next?\nLeicester host Bournemouth - who have one defeat in seven - on Saturday, while Manchester City play the first of seven games they contest in January by travelling to Watford for a 17:30 GMT kick-off.",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Everton 3-4 Stoke City\nXherdan Shaqiri scored one of the goals of the season as Stoke earned a thrilling win at Everton through Marko Arnautovic's injury-time penalty.\nThe Potters led through Shaqiri early on and after Romelu Lukaku levelled from eight yards, the Swiss looped a stunning half-volley over Tim Howard.\nLukaku struck again after the break and Gerard Deulofeu tapped Everton ahead.\nBut Joselu volleyed his first Premier League goal and Arnautovic won it after being brought down by John Stones.\nRelive Stoke's dramatic win at Goodison Park\nFollow all the reaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nShaqiri underlines the wow factor\nArnautovic - impressive himself throughout - will be deemed the match winner, but Shaqiri's strike will capture copious column inches in the aftermath of a win which moves Stoke two places above Everton and into ninth.\nAn ex-Inter Milan and Bayern Munich forward, summer-signing Shaqiri perhaps symbolises the ambition Mark Hughes' side now have and his first goals for the club will raise hopes of many more to come.\nStoke kept eight clean sheets in the 11 league games leading up to this win and although their frugal side went missing at Goodison Park, flair at the other end was on show throughout.\nShaqiri's first from six yards saw the combination of Bojan and Arnautovic craft a sublime team goal, while his second - from a wonderful Bojan pass - saw him reach for the ball and clip it over Tim Howard and into the top corner from 18 yards.\n\"That is the best goal I have seen this season,\" said Final Score pundit Garth Crooks. \"He knew exactly what he was doing, it is absolutely sublime.\"\nStoke punish in a way Everton could not\nEverton had lost just once in eight league games before kick-off but with no back-to-back wins in the league this season, their fans could be forgiven for wishing their side packed the killer punch Stoke mustered on Merseyside.\nHughes made no changes to his squad despite a 48-hour turnaround from Saturday's win over Manchester United but the likes of Ibrahim Afellay and Glenn Whelan delivered displays of note, both completing 95% of their passes.\nIt briefly appeared that substituting Bojan moments before Lukaku pulled a long ball down to fire Everton level at 2-2 would prove key, but after falling behind, Stoke's fresh legs earned their manager a fifth league win in eight games.\nArnautovic delivered a telling cross for substitute Joselu to smash a smart volley home and picked himself up to slam a penalty down the middle despite slipping before making contact.\nIt was a fitting reward as no Stoke player completed more sprints than the Austrian's 54 in the game and although Shaqiri's brilliance will overshadow such work ethic, the Potters admirably married graft with quality.\nHome failure again for Toffees\nEverton's industry and spirit are tough to question after they fought back to lead late on but they will rue the chance to close out the victory having led with just 10 minutes to spare.\nThere may be some contention around the winning penalty - referee Mark Clattenburg took an age to point to the spot - but even allowing Stoke back into the game having fought so hard to earn a lead was sloppy.\nIn all, Everton had 15 shots and as many crosses but the end result smacks of the inconsistency which continues to hamper their hopes of a push for a top-four spot.\nAt the halfway stage of the campaign, they are five points worse off than they were at the same point last season and the gap to Manchester City in fourth is now nine points.\nWill Roberto Martinez regret making four changes to the side which won at Newcastle on Boxing Day? His introduction of James McCarthy into the side after a month out injured backfired as the midfielder limped off early on.\nIn Lukaku, they now boast the Premier League's joint top scorer with Jamie Vardy on 15, but three wins from 10 home matches this season is a damning statistic they must improve quickly if their final league position is to match their ambitions.\nMan of the match - Xherdan Shaqiri\nManager reaction\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez on Stoke's penalty: \"Looking at the replay it shows John Stones touches the ball. That decision is hard to take. To get a decision wrong like that so late in the game makes you feel furious and is unacceptable.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"The only thing lacking up until today for Shaqiri was goals - performances had been fine - but now he has added that. He has that quality - it's his first mark in terms of goals and I'm sure there will be more to come. It was end to end and I thought both sides came out with great credit.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton scored with all three of their shots on target.\nThe Toffees have not won at home since 21 November, a 4-0 win over Aston Villa.\nStoke have conceded 19 goals this season, only four sides have leaked less.\nStoke are four points better off than at the halfway stage last season.\nUp next\nStoke can make it three wins from three if they win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday while Everton host Tottenham 24 hours later."

The Birmingham club, who have not been out of the top flight since 1988, rarely looked like ending a club-record run of 17 matches without a league win.\nVilla went into the game on the back of successive draws against Newcastle and West Ham United, but realistically needed all three points against Norwich, who occupied 17th place at kick-off, to begin bridging an already formidable gap.\nDespite showing some early signs of promise, the Premier League's lowest scorers mustered only three shots on target - they have scored 15 goals in 18 top-flight matches this season, with Jordan Ayew contributing a third of that total.\nAnd had the Ghana international directed his 16th-minute header either side of Rudd - after finding space inside the home penalty area - the game would have had a different look.\nHowever, Villa rarely looked like rescuing even a point once Howson met Nathan Redmond's clipped cross for the opener.\nEven manager Remi Garde, who has not won in eight attempts since replacing Tim Sherwood, admitted afterwards his team did not deserve to leave with a point.\nMan of the match - Dieumerci Mbokani\nManager reaction\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"I think getting the three points is the priority, but it was great to back that up with a clean sheet.\n\"Once we got the first goal, we settled down and it allowed us to be compact and try to catch Villa on the counter attack. Thankfully we got a second goal, which killed the game off.\n\"I am delighted for the players - they have worked extremely hard this year. We know we could have done better in the 19 games, so hopefully we will do better in the next 19. If we can do that, we will be fine.\"\nAston Villa boss Remi Garde: \"I would like to say we deserved a point but at the end I think Norwich deserved the win. Nothing more to say.\n\"We did not play as well as we did in the last two games. We tried to do our best, of course, but did not create many chances. If you don't score in a game, you don't deserve to win.\n\"I will be the last man not to believe we can still win games. It is my job to make the players believe we will win the next one. I know it has been a long time for them to win, me as well, but we have the quality to win games.\n\"Sometimes in football you have to cope with this kind of situation. January will be important.\"\nStats of the day\nNorwich have won as many Premier League games in their last three as they did in their previous 14 combined - two\nWes Hoolahan has now provided more assists for Norwich City in the Premier League than any other player (17)\nThe Canaries have scored in all but two of their 28 league meetings with Aston Villa at home\nOnly Sunderland (six in 2005-06) and Derby (seven in 2007-08) have had fewer points at the halfway stage than Villa this season\nSince winning away at Bournemouth on the opening day, Villa have picked up just two points in nine Premier League away games\nVilla have now gone nine games without a Premier League clean sheet away from home, keeping just one clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games overall\nWhat's next?\nVilla are back on the road - again going to one of their closest relegation rivals. Garde's team travel to second-bottom Sunderland on Saturday, 2 January.\nNorwich will be aiming to move further away from the relegation zone when they host Southampton on the same day.",

I was happy when the referee blew, because they could have been 2-0 up.\n\"At half-time we made some changes but it was a change of character, of approach, of determination and will. They did try in the first half, but this was a different West Ham.\n\"We equalised and continued to chase, and at the end of the day we were rewarded for everything we did in the second half.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"The second half was totally different to the first. We had to score more than one in the first half, because otherwise you expect their reaction in the second. If you score only one they still have belief.\n\"The first half was the level of the Arsenal game. It was one team on the pitch playing football. But out of a better second half they scored two goals, and from a fantastic first we scored one.\n\"If you are the dominant side you have to score more than one goal, and that was the problem.\"\nWhat next?\nWest Ham play Liverpool at home in a 12:45 GMT kick-off on Saturday, when Southampton travel to Norwich for a 15:00 start."

Sakho stayed on and finished the match.\nKlopp said: \"I don't want to say now, 'Come on, give him a red card'. I have no problem with this player, but if you go like that, everything can happen. That's not allowed. For me, that's a red card, finish, that's it.\"\nAllardyce responded: \"It's not a red card, it's a yellow. It's a foul.\n\"There was some foul and abusive language towards my staff that I didn't like. It was all right, though, because we all shook hands and got on with it, which is what we have got to do.\"\nMan of the match - Emre Can\nWhat they said\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"There is some encouragement - seeing the lads battling and fighting for themselves and trying to get a win or at least a point - but a bit of misfortune just after half-time took it away from us. I thought the lads tried their best and you can't ask for more than that.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"It is not the best we can do, we know this, but we had to fight. We knew about Sunderland's situation. Everyone wants to end the year positively. We can and Sunderland can't but we take these points, go home, sleep two times and onto the next game.\"\nWhat next?\nSecond-bottom Sunderland host bottom side Aston Villa on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Liverpool travel to West Ham on the same day (12:45).\nThe stats you need to know\nBenteke's goal was the quickest second-half goal scored in the Premier League this season (22 seconds)\nLiverpool have won five games 1-0 this season, a Premier League joint-high along with West Brom\nSunderland have taken just two points from their past seven Premier League meetings with Liverpool\nThe Black Cats are now on their worst run of Premier League defeats since April 2014",

It was difficult. We played well, we created some chances. I wanted to see how my players responded after the Liverpool defeat and they responded well.\n\"Every match is difficult for us. This league is very crazy...nobody wants to win the league. It's very strange. We're the basement and the other teams are a villa with a swimming pool. It's not easy for us but we want to fight with everybody. It's a miracle what we're doing.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"I think we did more than Leicester to win the game.

We've lost him for a key game. Fans pay a lot of money to see players like that, and the referee's taken him out of the game.\n\"A mistimed challenge is not a yellow card. It's a deliberate tackle to stop someone progressing down the pitch. Brede Hangeland escapes a booking for a far worse challenge.\n\"We want great players on the pitch. Stop handing out yellow cards.\"\nSwansea caretaker manager Alan Curtis: \"It was an excellent point against a very good Crystal Palace team. They showed today why they are where they are in the table.\n\"We're unbeaten in three with three clean sheets.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 0-0 Chelsea\nManchester United provided some respite for manager Louis van Gaal with a much-improved performance as they were held to a draw by Chelsea at Old Trafford.\nVan Gaal's future was shrouded in uncertainty after a run of four straight defeats - and while a draw offers minor relief, United were still unable to secure the victory the 64-year-old Dutchman so desperately needs.\nUnited's luck was out as both Juan Mata and Anthony Martial struck the woodwork inside the first 15 minutes and only a brilliant reflex save from Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois stopped Ander Herrera from six yards after the break.\nChelsea, under the temporary control of Van Gaal's fellow countryman Guus Hiddink, had chances of their own and United needed the brilliance of keeper David de Gea as he saved athletically from John Terry's early header then made a double save from Pedro and Cesar Azpilicueta after the break.\nAnd as United ran out of momentum and ideas - although they were unlucky not to get a penalty when Willian handled - Nemanja Matic missed the best chance of the game when he raced clear, only to shoot hopelessly over the top.\nRead about how Manchester United's draw with Chelsea unfolded.\n, external\nReaction to Monday's Premier League results.\n, external\nNo reason to resign - Van Gaal\n, external\nVan Gaal feels Old Trafford support\nThe merchandisers outside Old Trafford may have been hawking scarves proclaiming Jose Mourinho as the next Manchester United manager, but those inside 'The Theatre Of Dreams' gave their embattled manager commendable support.\nFew Mourinho scarves were on view and Van Gaal was able to acknowledge warm applause from plenty of United fans as he made his way from the tunnel at the Stretford End to his technical area before kick-off.\nUnited's vibrant start, out of character with the timidity of recent weeks, instantly lifted the spirits and volume of support that were out-of-sorts and subdued before the start, and the fans remained solidly behind their team throughout.\nThere was certainly no hostility on view towards Van Gaal, although there were some signs of frustration as the game edged into the last 20 minutes with no sign of a breakthrough.\nThe final whistle was greeted with some jeers but this was more out of frustration that United could not find a winner, which also saw Wayne Rooney miss a late chance.\nVan Gaal's name was not heard in any chants but there was no groundswell of hostility towards the United manager fighting for his job.\nDaring Manchester United\nVan Gaal complained that United did not \"dare\" to play football in the Boxing Day defeat at Stoke City - suggesting they were so gripped by fear and a lack of confidence in the current slump that they were simply unable to play their natural game.\nHere, for the first hour at least, United delivered the sort of swift attacking football Old Trafford demands and a level of performance that would not have Van Gaal in such a hole had it been reproduced regularly this season.\nUnited had more chances here than in their previous six games and was in stark contrast to a run that has left them without a win since the 2-1 victory at Watford on 21 Nov.\nThey were desperately unlucky that the woodwork denied Mata and Martial - but the sign of that fragile confidence was shown in the way they ran out of ideas and inspiration in the last 30 minutes.\nHiddink must earn his money\nWhen Guus Hiddink walked in at Chelsea in February 2009 to succeed the sacked Luiz Felipe Scolari, it was simply a case of keeping a well-drilled and experienced side ticking over and perhaps adding a dash of his own quality and experience.\nIt worked well as the 69-year-old Dutchman guided Chelsea to an FA Cup final win against Everton, and the Blues were only denied a place in the Champions League final against Manchester United by a goal deep into injury time by Barcelona at Stamford Bridge.\nHiddink had a perfectly-tuned Chelsea side built around the spine of keeper Petr Cech, captain John Terry, midfield marksman Frank Lampard and a match-winning striker in Didier Drogba.\nNot so this time - and Hiddink will need all his acumen to revitalise a Chelsea side struggling to find any of the power, rhythm and fluency that made them Premier League champions in May.\nTerry is willing but reaching the end of his career, while inspiration is in short supply elsewhere despite the presence of players such as Eden Hazard, Willian and Oscar.\nHe also has to prove he still possesses his old authority after a barren spell in his career with failures in charge of Russia, Turkey and in a second spell with the Netherlands.\nIn other words, Hiddink has a serious job on his hands.\nMan of the match: David de Gea (Manchester United)\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester United have now gone eight games without victory in all competitions, their worst run since January 1990 (also eight games).\nLouis van Gaal has overseen 11 goalless draws as Manchester United boss, six of those coming since 27 October.\nGuus Hiddink has not lost any of his last five competitive contests with Louis van Gaal (W4 D1).\nThe Red Devils have kept seven clean sheets and conceded just three goals in their nine Premier League home games in 2015-16.\nThe Blues are unbeaten in their last six Premier League meetings with Man Utd (W3 D3).\nThis is United's lowest points total after 19 games of a league season since 1990 (22 points then, 30 this season).\nWhat they said\nChelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink: \"On the one hand, I am happy with a point because we had a difficult game, but on the other, we had two big chances to get three points. We were lacking some attacking players and had to adapt. In general I'm happy.\n\"Matic tells me when everyone expects him to make a goal, he doesn't and the other way round. I told him that I didn't expect him to score, so why didn't he?\n\"The team is showing ambition to get away from the relegation zone as soon as possible.\"\nWhat next?\nManchester United host Swansea on Saturday, 2 January while Chelsea travel to Crystal Palace on the following day."

His introduction of James McCarthy into the side after a month out injured backfired as the midfielder limped off early on.\nIn Lukaku, they now boast the Premier League's joint top scorer with Jamie Vardy on 15, but three wins from 10 home matches this season is a damning statistic they must improve quickly if their final league position is to match their ambitions.\nMan of the match - Xherdan Shaqiri\nManager reaction\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez on Stoke's penalty: \"Looking at the replay it shows John Stones touches the ball. That decision is hard to take. To get a decision wrong like that so late in the game makes you feel furious and is unacceptable.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"The only thing lacking up until today for Shaqiri was goals - performances had been fine - but now he has added that. He has that quality - it's his first mark in terms of goals and I'm sure there will be more to come. It was end to end and I thought both sides came out with great credit.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton scored with all three of their shots on target.\nThe Toffees have not won at home since 21 November, a 4-0 win over Aston Villa.\nStoke have conceded 19 goals this season, only four sides have leaked less.\nStoke are four points better off than at the halfway stage last season.\nUp next\nStoke can make it three wins from three if they win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday while Everton host Tottenham 24 hours later.",

Trippier's crosses from the right had caused the hosts problems throughout and it was his delivery that led to Son's clincher.\nThere was a suggestion of offside in the build-up to the goal, but referee Anthony Taylor allowed it to stand.\nShould Ake have been sent off?\nAke caught Lamela studs first and high on the leg as he attempted to get to a bouncing ball.\nTaylor took his time before producing his red card to the apparent bemusement of the Watford left-back and the home dugout.\n\"My view was amazing but I don't like to talk about the referees.

Jack Colback and Wijnaldum were particularly outstanding in the middle of the park, winning more than 70% of their battles.\nNewcastle need to hit the January sales\nDefence? Fine. Midfield? Excellent. Strikers? Hmm...\nThe Magpies looked a threat in attack in their past three outings, but Steve McClaren's forwards have been misfiring terribly. From their 32 efforts on goal, they have only managed to find the target once. Newcastle have only scored 19 times this season - the third-lowest total in the league.\nSerbia striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, who cost \u00a313m in the summer, was supposed to arrest the problem of last season, but has yet to settle.

However, United's captain improvised brilliantly to flick Martial's cross round his standing leg and into the far corner past a rooted Fabianski for the winner.\nAs well as delivering three points for his team, the strike gave Rooney sole possession of second place on the all-time goalscoring lists of the Premier League - on 188, 72 behind Alan Shearer - and Manchester United - on 238, 11 behind Sir Bobby Charlton.\nWidth + crosses = goals\nThe home fans' relief was palpable on the final whistle as Manchester United secured their first win since beating Watford away on 21 November.\nHowever, the half-time whistle had mostly been greeted with a bemused silence after a toothless first-half performance.\nThe one consistent source of danger for the hosts was right-winger Ashley Young. His pace and trickery gave Neil Taylor a testing afternoon and his consistently accurate delivery into the box was rewarded when Martial met a cross with a powerful header just after half-time.\nThe winner also came from the flanks as Martial drifted wide to turn provider for Rooney.\nFabianski almost provides stunning climax\nSince losing his first match in charge across the city at Etihad Stadium last month, caretaker boss Alan Curtis had overseen three successive clean sheets to keep Swansea clear of the relegation zone.\nAnd having kept United at bay for large spells in a tight and tidy performance, their discipline was almost rewarded in extraordinary style when Fabianski climbed highest after coming up for the final corner of the match and sent a header just wide.\nMan of the match - Ashley Young\nManager reaction\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I am very happy for the players because they had to play under big pressure and now we have won. We are still near the top of the league and the gap is less. So that's football.\n\"That's a season. A season takes eight months or something like that and not one month.\n\"I think we played a very risky system against Swansea because they had a shape with four midfielders in a diamond.\n\"I hope this is a fantastic starting point for us in the New Year and we can continue against Sheffield United.\"\nSwansea caretaker boss Alan Curtis: \"Funnily enough, Lukasz Fabianski had asked a couple of minutes earlier to go up for a similar situation. I told him to stay back. I wish I'd asked him to go up earlier.\n\"We had to get back into the game. We were comfortable with the midfield diamond when it was 0-0, but once we went behind, we had to change things, so we put two wingers on to get back into it.\n\"We grew into the game after that, and we were unlucky not to get something.\"\nStats you need to know\nRooney ended a run of 553 minutes without a goal for the club.\nManchester United have now failed to score in their last nine first halves at Old Trafford. The last player to score a first half goal at Old Trafford in all competitions was Juan Mata v Wolfsburg in September.\nGylfi Sigurdsson has scored twice and assisted twice in his last four league games versus Manchester United.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United face Sheffield United in the FA Cup third round on Saturday, before a trip to Newcastle on Tuesday, 12 January in their next league outing. Swansea travel to Oxford in the FA Cup on Sunday, before playing Sunderland in a potentially vital match on the following Wednesday."

A paltry two attempts on target underlines the fact many of their efforts came from long distance or were half-chances.\nWith more than half an hour to go when Francis was dismissed, Claudio Ranieri's side had a golden chance to stay level on points with Arsenal; instead they now have just two points from three games, in which they have managed one goal.\nQuestions will be asked. Is this the start of a decline expected by many?\nVardy, though full of running as ever, should have scored when he struck the woodwork from eight yards. He drew a fine save from Boruc shortly before the penalty with a strike from 20 yards but has now gone four games without a goal.\nOn the plus side, Leicester now have the 40 points Ranieri targeted to ensure Premier League survival and the Italian said it would be \"Champagne for my players\" after the stalemate.\nHe could also be celebrating a new signing, with Birmingham winger Demarai Gray reportedly having a medical at the King Power Stadium.\nBut will the acquisition of Gray - who may in any case be loaned back to Birmingham for the season - be enough to propel the Foxes out of their first sticky patch of the campaign? Vardy and Mahrez need someone to share the burden as, in truth, when they could not deliver, no-one else looked like doing so.\nEarly style becomes dogged grit\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe confronted referee Andre Marriner on the pitch after the game in what appeared to be a protest against the sending-off of Francis.\nIt looked an incredibly close call, with the central defender appearing to get a slight touch on the ball as he made contact with Vardy right on the edge of the area.\nThe Cherries side of eight weeks ago may have gone under when faced with the territorial pressure that followed, but Howe's side have now lost just one match in eight.\nThey have run further than their opponents in every fixture this season and did so again at the King Power Stadium, though it would be unfair to brand this a backs-to-the-wall display as they looked threatening in the first half.\nDan Gosling fizzed a shot over the bar after good work by Joshua King, but when the south coast side did have to dig in, the likes of Steve Cook excelled. The centre-back made 15 clearances in all, eight more than anyone else on the field.\nMan of the match - Artur Boruc\nManager reaction\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We knew it was a difficult match and we started playing too late. Bournemouth moved the ball very quickly but in the second half we were much better.\n\"We hit the post, we missed a penalty and had some good chances. We have not scored for three games but we have had chances. Sometimes everything is right but now some things are wrong. The performance was good, a fantastic effort.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe on Simon Francis' red card: \"I didn't think it was a foul from my angle - he definitely touched the ball. It was a great recovery tackle. It's not a foul, a penalty or a sending-off.\n\"It was a very even game before that point, a high-tempo game and very high quality. We had some great chances in the first half but when we went down to 10 men we showed character and it's a great point for us. We won't appeal the red card as it's a one-game ban and the FA Cup is coming up.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJamie Vardy has won seven Premier League penalties since the start of 2014-15, two more than any other player in this period\nAfter a run of scoring in 18 successive Premier League matches from May-December 2015, Leicester City have now failed to score in each of their past three\nBournemouth did not attempt a single shot on target in this match - the 11th occasion that a side have failed to attempt one in a Premier League game this season and the first time Bournemouth have failed to do so\nUp next\nBournemouth entertain Championship side Birmingham City as FA Cup duties take over next Saturday, while Leicester brace themselves for a trip to Tottenham in the third round a day later.",

However, West Ham showed more attacking threat and more energy, and were just as impressive as they were when they defeated Brendan Rodgers' Reds 3-0 in August.\nDay for Carroll to remember, Benteke to forget\nCarroll has endured some dark days at West Ham since joining for \u00a315m in June 2013 thanks to injuries, but this was an afternoon to remember for the former Reds player, who remains Liverpool's record signing.\nHe produced a trademark header to meet a wonderfully weighted cross, Clyne again beaten in the air as he was for Antonio's goal. Carroll celebrated as though his goal had decided the title.\nIn contrast, Christian Benteke - Liverpool's second costliest player - endured a miserable day as his first touch deserted him time and again. He was played through in the 25th minute but allowed James Tomkins to whip the ball off his toes before ballooning a 58th-minute chance over the bar.\nHow far can West Ham go this season?\nHammers boss Slaven Bilic was not even born the last time West Ham did the double over Liverpool. As poor as the Reds were, West Ham were impressive.\nJames Collins was excellent at the back as West Ham recorded a fifth clean sheet in seven games, Noble produced a performance full of grit and determination in midfield and Antonio, who started the season at Nottingham Forest, was lively on the wing and fully deserved his second goal in two games.\nLiverpool join Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea and Southampton on the list of scalps West Ham have claimed in the Premier League this season.\nWill they be starting life at the Olympic Stadium next season in European competition? You would not rule it out at this stage.\nLanzini set for a spell out?\nThe Hammers were able to welcome back key man Dimitri Payet from injury as a second-half substitute - but did lose Manuel Lanzini in the 39th minute.\nLanzini had hit the post with a swerving drive before going down with a muscle injury which could keep him out for some time.\nBilic said after the game that it was a tendon problem, while co-chairman David Gold tweeted that he could be out for four to six weeks.\nLanzini will have a scan on Monday.\nMan of the Match - Michail Antonio (West Ham)\nWhat the managers said\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"We created many not only on the break but from open play and we could have scored more. To keep a clean sheet at home to Liverpool is brilliant for the fans and it's a brilliant start to the New Year.\n\"We played a really good game - especially in the second half. Of course Liverpool had their moments because they are a good passing team but we defended really well as a team.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"The game was decided by two crosses and two headers. At the end of the first half we had our moments but it was not enough.\n\"We always had the ball. We could have made more chances but we didn't so we have to accept that again we didn't play like we should.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Ham are now unbeaten in eight Premier League home games and have not lost at Upton Park since 22 August\nAndy Carroll has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since January 2015\nThe Hammers have scored five league goals against Liverpool in a single season for the first time since 1930-31\nLiverpool have mustered just one goal in their past four Premier League away games\nThere were 41 shots (including blocked attempts) in this match - only Leicester v Arsenal (43) in September has seen more in the Premier League this season\nWhat next?\nWest Ham's next match is an FA Cup third-round home tie with Wolverhampton Wanderers (15:00 GMT) next Saturday before travelling to Bournemouth (19:45 GMT) in the Premier League on 12 January.\nLiverpool have two cup ties before their next Premier League game at home to Arsenal (20:00 GMT) on 13 January. They are at Stoke City (20:00 GMT) in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday, then travel to Devon to face League Two Exeter City (19:55 GMT) in the FA Cup third round on Friday.\nListen - every manager in football would 'consider' West Ham, says co-owner David Gold"

He hit the target with three of them, scored twice, and had a late goal disallowed for offside.\nHow Aston Villa could do with such clinical finishing.\nHave Villa any hope?\nThere are few - if any - signs of encouragement for Aston Villa, who look doomed to life in the Championship next season.\nWhile there are still 54 points to play for, a club record 18 league matches without a win is hardly the form to suggest they are capable of any 'great escape'.\nThey produced some nice football at times but seemed short of confidence in attack.\nAside from a brilliant equaliser, the closest Villa came to scoring was Veretout's first-half effort as they finished with just three shots on target.\nHaving scored only 16 league goals this season - the lowest total in the top flight - Villa remain 11 points from safety.\nMan of the match - Jermain Defoe\nWhat they said\nSunderland boss Sam Allardyce: \"I was very pleased with everyone holding their nerve, fans included. When Villa scored we could have gone under. But we kept it tight at the back.\n\"You need anxiety to play football but if it goes too far into fear you can lose your nerve. When you're confident, things come naturally. But when you want to take an extra touch or an extra second to pass, with that fear, you give the ball away. The only way to dismiss that fear is to win games.\n\"Thank God for Jermain Defoe and his finishing qualities. He turned the game back in our favour.\"\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"I'm going to try [to sign players]. In life and football you have to believe - if you don't you have no chance. But it's more and more difficult.\n\"But every season in every league, a side can keep losing and suddenly win four, five or six in a row. But for that probably we will need to bring in one, two or three new players.\n\"Today I didn't see a side who didn't give everything they could. When you concede so many goals it's difficult to win games. You cannot be positive when you lose. I'm not here to lose - I'm here to try to make the team win.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nVilla have taken eight points from their opening 20 games - only two Premier League sides have claimed fewer points (Sunderland had six in 2005-06 and Derby had seven in 2007-08)\nVilla have gone 10 games without a Premier League clean sheet away from home and have kept just one clean sheet in their past 19 overall\nPatrick van Aanholt has scored two goals in his past seven Premier League appearances, after failing to score in his first 42\nCarles Gil scored the 500th goal of the 2015-16 Premier League season\nDefoe scored more than once in a single Premier League game for the first time since 1 December 2012\nAston Villa's Premier League winless run now stands at 19 games (D5 L14) - the joint fourth worst run in the history of the competition\nWhat next?\nSunderland have a trip to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round on Saturday, before playing at Swansea in the Premier League on 13 January.

They are unbeaten in five at home, and their form at Carrow Road could prove to be vital as the season progresses.\nMan of the match\nManager reaction\nAlex Neil: \"When Vadis came on, I thought he really injected some quality and creativity going forward, and he created the goal for us.\n\"I'm over the moon with the boys in particular, because when you are going through difficult spells, there have been questions posed about them and me - and the best way to deal with it is to win games.\n\"We've won some crucial games now and kept two clean sheets as well, so there are a lot of positives to take.\"\nRonald Koeman: \"I'm angry about the second yellow card from Victor because a player with his experience needs to know if you already have a yellow in a game, that you cannot do that tackle in that position on the pitch.\n\"I agree that we were the dominant team, that we had the best chance in the game when Shane Long was put through, and we played some good football.\n\"But it's so unnecessary what happened because with 11 against 11, still we are stronger than we showed here and we know we are in a difficult situation.\"\nThe stats you may have missed\nNorwich have kept back-to-back clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since January 2014\nThey have won three of their last four Premier League games, the same amount they had won in their previous 23\nThe Canaries have won back-to-back home games in the top flight for the first time since November 2013\nAfter a run of six unbeaten, Saints have lost their last four Premier League games away from home\nVictor Wanyama picked up his second red card of the season, more than any other Premier League player\nAlexander Tettey scored with Norwich's only shot on target of the game\nWhat's next?\nAfter hosting Manchester City in the FA Cup on 9 January, Norwich will return to Premier League action at Stoke on Wednesday, 13 January.\nSouthampton begin a run of three home games in a week against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup, then they host Watford and West Brom.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Watford 1-2 Manchester City\nBrilliant late goals from Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero rescued Manchester City as they came from behind to beat Watford in an entertaining finale.\nWatford went ahead after the break when Aleksandar Kolarov headed Ben Watson's corner beyond Joe Hart, who had the situation covered, for an own goal.\nWith defeat looming, Toure side-foot volleyed Kolarov's corner into the near post to level.\nAnd Aguero headed Bacary Sagna's fine cross home to secure a rare away win.\nThe title contenders were eight minutes from falling six points behind league leaders Arsenal, before Toure and Aguero struck for goals which could prove pivotal this season.\nAguero returning to top form - Pellegrini.\nCity end their away Blues\nIt was a first away victory for City since Kelechi Iheanacho scored a late winner against Crystal Palace on 12 September.\nCity manager Manuel Pellegrini had said that his team's troublesome away form would get better once his players improved their finishing, but until the final 10 minutes there was little evidence to suggest they had turned into ruthless goal-poachers away from the Etihad.\nFernandinho had twice gone close, while Toure and Kevin de Bruyne tested Heurelho Gomes from distance before the Ivory Coast midfielder sparked an unlikely comeback with his third goal in his last four Premier League games.\nIn just two minutes and 36 seconds, City turned the game around when Aguero - starved of chances in the match and having failed to score in his last five appearances - applied the coupe de grace with a clinical finish.\nCity will hope the Argentine's goal, his first away from home this season, will spark a return to form for a player who is crucial to his team's title hopes.\nDefence still a worry for City\nIn the absence of their captain and best defender Vincent Kompany with a persistent calf problem, City still have issues to address in defence.\nAt times Nicolas Otamendi was sloppy in possession and was outmuscled early on by the impressive Odion Ighalo, who forced Joe Hart into a fine save after easily turning the defender inside the box. Eliaquim Mangala also gave a nervy display.\nWatford would not have scored their opening goal had Kolarov not flicked Watson's corner towards the far post, but the newly promoted side nevertheless deserved to go ahead.\nIghalo and Troy Deeney have formed a partnership which has seen 20 goals in 20 matches, and they were their usual dynamic selves as the hosts confidently attacked throughout.\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores said conceding two late goals was tough to take, but his team can take heart from being comfortably in the top 10 having faced Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and City in their last four fixtures.\nMan of the match - Yaya Toure\nWhat the managers said\nCity manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"I've always said this team has character, we never give up.\n\"I think we were unlucky to be losing the game. It wasn't a corner and then it was an own goal. But we kept our minds and made some changes, always thinking we are able to turn the corner - and we did.\n\"It was a very close game and tough for both teams but if you see the statistics we deserved to win, we had more shots on target and possession.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It was very difficult to accept. We played really well but we lost our concentration on a set-piece and gave them the opportunity to come back. I'm really pleased with our performance.\n\"Against very big teams we have been unlucky. Every time we have been close to positive results. It's very difficult to explain to the players why we haven't won. We did everything we could. Ben Watson was perfect. It's a very sad day, the players deserved more.\n\"It's a big reference for us. Four months ago when we played Manchester City, we played to protect the team and not concede a lot of goals but today we played to win the match.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nYaya Toure has scored three times in the last four Premier League games, having scored one in 13 prior to that.\nSergio Aguero has now scored against 24 of the 28 different Premier League teams he has faced.\nAll seven of Watford's Premier League defeats this season have come against the current top seven in the table.\nManchester City have lost just one of last 15 Premier League games versus newly promoted teams (W12 D2 L1).\nMan City secured their first Premier League away victory in seven attempts (W1 D3 L3).\nWhat next?\nManchester City have a packed fixture list, playing Everton in the League Cup semi-final on Wednesday before travelling to Norwich three days later for the FA Cup third round. Their next league fixture, however, will be at home on 16 January against Crystal Palace. Watford, meanwhile, have a week to recover before facing Newcastle in the FA Cup."

Eliaquim Mangala also gave a nervy display.\nWatford would not have scored their opening goal had Kolarov not flicked Watson's corner towards the far post, but the newly promoted side nevertheless deserved to go ahead.\nIghalo and Troy Deeney have formed a partnership which has seen 20 goals in 20 matches, and they were their usual dynamic selves as the hosts confidently attacked throughout.\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores said conceding two late goals was tough to take, but his team can take heart from being comfortably in the top 10 having faced Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and City in their last four fixtures.\nMan of the match - Yaya Toure\nWhat the managers said\nCity manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"I've always said this team has character, we never give up.\n\"I think we were unlucky to be losing the game. It wasn't a corner and then it was an own goal. But we kept our minds and made some changes, always thinking we are able to turn the corner - and we did.\n\"It was a very close game and tough for both teams but if you see the statistics we deserved to win, we had more shots on target and possession.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It was very difficult to accept. We played really well but we lost our concentration on a set-piece and gave them the opportunity to come back. I'm really pleased with our performance.\n\"Against very big teams we have been unlucky. Every time we have been close to positive results. It's very difficult to explain to the players why we haven't won. We did everything we could. Ben Watson was perfect. It's a very sad day, the players deserved more.\n\"It's a big reference for us. Four months ago when we played Manchester City, we played to protect the team and not concede a lot of goals but today we played to win the match.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nYaya Toure has scored three times in the last four Premier League games, having scored one in 13 prior to that.\nSergio Aguero has now scored against 24 of the 28 different Premier League teams he has faced.\nAll seven of Watford's Premier League defeats this season have come against the current top seven in the table.\nManchester City have lost just one of last 15 Premier League games versus newly promoted teams (W12 D2 L1).\nMan City secured their first Premier League away victory in seven attempts (W1 D3 L3).\nWhat next?\nManchester City have a packed fixture list, playing Everton in the League Cup semi-final on Wednesday before travelling to Norwich three days later for the FA Cup third round. Their next league fixture, however, will be at home on 16 January against Crystal Palace. Watford, meanwhile, have a week to recover before facing Newcastle in the FA Cup.",

Goodison is a very tough place to come, Everton are a tough team. We need to feel proud. We always try and win the game, sometimes in football it is not possible.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"I feel satisfied. We saw two very good teams who want to play in a similar manner.\n\"The first half we gave the ball away too much but we had a good defensive intensity and concentration. The important aspect was the way we responded in the second half\n\"We never lost the defensive intensity. It is not something we have had at home and it has cost us points, but my players were immense in that respect. They just could not find the final pass in certain moments when maybe they could get the winning goal.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton scored with their first shot of the game.\nLennon scored his first Premier League goal for Everton at Goodison Park in his 12th appearance there for the Toffees.\nRomelu Lukaku has been directly involved in 10 goals in his past six Premier League games at Goodison Park (seven goals, three assists).\nDele Alli has scored or assisted six goals in his past seven Premier League appearances (three goals, three assists).\nSpurs are unbeaten in their past nine top-flight games on the road, winning four and drawing five.\nEverton have won just three of their past 13 Premier League games (W3 D6 L4).\nThese two sides have both drawn a league-high nine Premier League games this season."

However, United's captain improvised brilliantly to flick Martial's cross round his standing leg and into the far corner past a rooted Fabianski for the winner.\nAs well as delivering three points for his team, the strike gave Rooney sole possession of second place on the all-time goalscoring lists of the Premier League - on 188, 72 behind Alan Shearer - and Manchester United - on 238, 11 behind Sir Bobby Charlton.\nWidth + crosses = goals\nThe home fans' relief was palpable on the final whistle as Manchester United secured their first win since beating Watford away on 21 November.\nHowever, the half-time whistle had mostly been greeted with a bemused silence after a toothless first-half performance.\nThe one consistent source of danger for the hosts was right-winger Ashley Young. His pace and trickery gave Neil Taylor a testing afternoon and his consistently accurate delivery into the box was rewarded when Martial met a cross with a powerful header just after half-time.\nThe winner also came from the flanks as Martial drifted wide to turn provider for Rooney.\nFabianski almost provides stunning climax\nSince losing his first match in charge across the city at Etihad Stadium last month, caretaker boss Alan Curtis had overseen three successive clean sheets to keep Swansea clear of the relegation zone.\nAnd having kept United at bay for large spells in a tight and tidy performance, their discipline was almost rewarded in extraordinary style when Fabianski climbed highest after coming up for the final corner of the match and sent a header just wide.\nMan of the match - Ashley Young\nManager reaction\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I am very happy for the players because they had to play under big pressure and now we have won. We are still near the top of the league and the gap is less. So that's football.\n\"That's a season. A season takes eight months or something like that and not one month.\n\"I think we played a very risky system against Swansea because they had a shape with four midfielders in a diamond.\n\"I hope this is a fantastic starting point for us in the New Year and we can continue against Sheffield United.\"\nSwansea caretaker boss Alan Curtis: \"Funnily enough, Lukasz Fabianski had asked a couple of minutes earlier to go up for a similar situation. I told him to stay back. I wish I'd asked him to go up earlier.\n\"We had to get back into the game. We were comfortable with the midfield diamond when it was 0-0, but once we went behind, we had to change things, so we put two wingers on to get back into it.\n\"We grew into the game after that, and we were unlucky not to get something.\"\nStats you need to know\nRooney ended a run of 553 minutes without a goal for the club.\nManchester United have now failed to score in their last nine first halves at Old Trafford. The last player to score a first half goal at Old Trafford in all competitions was Juan Mata v Wolfsburg in September.\nGylfi Sigurdsson has scored twice and assisted twice in his last four league games versus Manchester United.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United face Sheffield United in the FA Cup third round on Saturday, before a trip to Newcastle on Tuesday, 12 January in their next league outing.

He hit the target with three of them, scored twice, and had a late goal disallowed for offside.\nHow Aston Villa could do with such clinical finishing.\nHave Villa any hope?\nThere are few - if any - signs of encouragement for Aston Villa, who look doomed to life in the Championship next season.\nWhile there are still 54 points to play for, a club record 18 league matches without a win is hardly the form to suggest they are capable of any 'great escape'.\nThey produced some nice football at times but seemed short of confidence in attack.\nAside from a brilliant equaliser, the closest Villa came to scoring was Veretout's first-half effort as they finished with just three shots on target.\nHaving scored only 16 league goals this season - the lowest total in the top flight - Villa remain 11 points from safety.\nMan of the match - Jermain Defoe\nWhat they said\nSunderland boss Sam Allardyce: \"I was very pleased with everyone holding their nerve, fans included. When Villa scored we could have gone under. But we kept it tight at the back.\n\"You need anxiety to play football but if it goes too far into fear you can lose your nerve. When you're confident, things come naturally. But when you want to take an extra touch or an extra second to pass, with that fear, you give the ball away. The only way to dismiss that fear is to win games.\n\"Thank God for Jermain Defoe and his finishing qualities. He turned the game back in our favour.\"\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"I'm going to try [to sign players]. In life and football you have to believe - if you don't you have no chance. But it's more and more difficult.\n\"But every season in every league, a side can keep losing and suddenly win four, five or six in a row. But for that probably we will need to bring in one, two or three new players.\n\"Today I didn't see a side who didn't give everything they could. When you concede so many goals it's difficult to win games. You cannot be positive when you lose. I'm not here to lose - I'm here to try to make the team win.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nVilla have taken eight points from their opening 20 games - only two Premier League sides have claimed fewer points (Sunderland had six in 2005-06 and Derby had seven in 2007-08)\nVilla have gone 10 games without a Premier League clean sheet away from home and have kept just one clean sheet in their past 19 overall\nPatrick van Aanholt has scored two goals in his past seven Premier League appearances, after failing to score in his first 42\nCarles Gil scored the 500th goal of the 2015-16 Premier League season\nDefoe scored more than once in a single Premier League game for the first time since 1 December 2012\nAston Villa's Premier League winless run now stands at 19 games (D5 L14) - the joint fourth worst run in the history of the competition\nWhat next?\nSunderland have a trip to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round on Saturday, before playing at Swansea in the Premier League on 13 January. Aston Villa travel to League Two Wycombe in the FA Cup on Saturday before a home league match against Crystal Palace on 12 January."

The closest they came prior to that was Jordon Ibe's low shot in the fourth minute which whistled just wide.\nLucas then had a header cleared off the line by Mark Noble at 2-0 and substitute Joe Allen wasted a great chance late on. However, West Ham showed more attacking threat and more energy, and were just as impressive as they were when they defeated Brendan Rodgers' Reds 3-0 in August.\nDay for Carroll to remember, Benteke to forget\nCarroll has endured some dark days at West Ham since joining for \u00a315m in June 2013 thanks to injuries, but this was an afternoon to remember for the former Reds player, who remains Liverpool's record signing.\nHe produced a trademark header to meet a wonderfully weighted cross, Clyne again beaten in the air as he was for Antonio's goal. Carroll celebrated as though his goal had decided the title.\nIn contrast, Christian Benteke - Liverpool's second costliest player - endured a miserable day as his first touch deserted him time and again. He was played through in the 25th minute but allowed James Tomkins to whip the ball off his toes before ballooning a 58th-minute chance over the bar.\nHow far can West Ham go this season?\nHammers boss Slaven Bilic was not even born the last time West Ham did the double over Liverpool. As poor as the Reds were, West Ham were impressive.\nJames Collins was excellent at the back as West Ham recorded a fifth clean sheet in seven games, Noble produced a performance full of grit and determination in midfield and Antonio, who started the season at Nottingham Forest, was lively on the wing and fully deserved his second goal in two games.\nLiverpool join Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea and Southampton on the list of scalps West Ham have claimed in the Premier League this season.\nWill they be starting life at the Olympic Stadium next season in European competition? You would not rule it out at this stage.\nLanzini set for a spell out?\nThe Hammers were able to welcome back key man Dimitri Payet from injury as a second-half substitute - but did lose Manuel Lanzini in the 39th minute.\nLanzini had hit the post with a swerving drive before going down with a muscle injury which could keep him out for some time.\nBilic said after the game that it was a tendon problem, while co-chairman David Gold tweeted that he could be out for four to six weeks.\nLanzini will have a scan on Monday.\nMan of the Match - Michail Antonio (West Ham)\nWhat the managers said\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"We created many not only on the break but from open play and we could have scored more. To keep a clean sheet at home to Liverpool is brilliant for the fans and it's a brilliant start to the New Year.\n\"We played a really good game - especially in the second half. Of course Liverpool had their moments because they are a good passing team but we defended really well as a team.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"The game was decided by two crosses and two headers. At the end of the first half we had our moments but it was not enough.\n\"We always had the ball. We could have made more chances but we didn't so we have to accept that again we didn't play like we should.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Ham are now unbeaten in eight Premier League home games and have not lost at Upton Park since 22 August\nAndy Carroll has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since January 2015\nThe Hammers have scored five league goals against Liverpool in a single season for the first time since 1930-31\nLiverpool have mustered just one goal in their past four Premier League away games\nThere were 41 shots (including blocked attempts) in this match - only Leicester v Arsenal (43) in September has seen more in the Premier League this season\nWhat next?\nWest Ham's next match is an FA Cup third-round home tie with Wolverhampton Wanderers (15:00 GMT) next Saturday before travelling to Bournemouth (19:45 GMT) in the Premier League on 12 January.\nLiverpool have two cup ties before their next Premier League game at home to Arsenal (20:00 GMT) on 13 January. They are at Stoke City (20:00 GMT) in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday, then travel to Devon to face League Two Exeter City (19:55 GMT) in the FA Cup third round on Friday.\nListen - every manager in football would 'consider' West Ham, says co-owner David Gold",

Jack Colback and Wijnaldum were particularly outstanding in the middle of the park, winning more than 70% of their battles.\nNewcastle need to hit the January sales\nDefence? Fine. Midfield? Excellent. Strikers? Hmm...\nThe Magpies looked a threat in attack in their past three outings, but Steve McClaren's forwards have been misfiring terribly. From their 32 efforts on goal, they have only managed to find the target once. Newcastle have only scored 19 times this season - the third-lowest total in the league.\nSerbia striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, who cost \u00a313m in the summer, was supposed to arrest the problem of last season, but has yet to settle. Perez has been in and out of the side, while Papiss Cisse is inconsistent and often injured - as was the case on Saturday.\nDoes Magpies' owner Mike Ashley, who spent north of \u00a360m in the summer, have any money left in the kitty?\nMan of the match - Daryl Janmaat (Newcastle)\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We were not at our best but we had to dig deep and we can do that when needed.\n\"If you are down there then those are the matches you lose but they will not stay down there - they are a good team.\n\"It was about solidarity, tired legs and taking a chance from a set piece. We were not at our best today, but over Christmas in four games we took nine points so we can look back and say we did 75% of our job as we lost at Southampton.\"\nAsked if his side would be signing anyone in the transfer window, Wenger replied: \"Imminent, no, but we will look.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren: \"The players can't believe it, we controlled and dominated the game after the first 10 minutes.\n\"We asked for a performance and the players gave it, but we conceded one soft goal and lost the game. You can't fault the performance, we just have to be more ruthless at both ends.\n\"We caused them so many problems and controlled them at the back and we're bewildered how we have not got anything.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal have won nine successive Premier League games against Newcastle\nThe Magpies have scored just six goals in their last 16 Premier League away trips\nKoscielny has scored three goals against Newcastle, more than he has any other Premier League opponent\nWenger has won 11 of his 12 Premier League meetings with Steve McClaren, losing the other\nThe Gunners are unbeaten in nine Premier League home games, winning seven and drawing two\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host Sunderland at home in the FA Cup next week before a trip to Liverpool. The Magpies are at Watford in the cup next Saturday and then return to league action at home to Manchester United."

Goodison is a very tough place to come, Everton are a tough team. We need to feel proud. We always try and win the game, sometimes in football it is not possible.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"I feel satisfied. We saw two very good teams who want to play in a similar manner.\n\"The first half we gave the ball away too much but we had a good defensive intensity and concentration. The important aspect was the way we responded in the second half\n\"We never lost the defensive intensity. It is not something we have had at home and it has cost us points, but my players were immense in that respect. They just could not find the final pass in certain moments when maybe they could get the winning goal.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton scored with their first shot of the game.\nLennon scored his first Premier League goal for Everton at Goodison Park in his 12th appearance there for the Toffees.\nRomelu Lukaku has been directly involved in 10 goals in his past six Premier League games at Goodison Park (seven goals, three assists).\nDele Alli has scored or assisted six goals in his past seven Premier League appearances (three goals, three assists).\nSpurs are unbeaten in their past nine top-flight games on the road, winning four and drawing five.\nEverton have won just three of their past 13 Premier League games (W3 D6 L4).\nThese two sides have both drawn a league-high nine Premier League games this season.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Leicester City 0-0 Bournemouth\nRiyad Mahrez saw a second-half penalty saved as Leicester could only draw with Bournemouth to fall two points behind Arsenal at the top of the table.\nMoments after Bournemouth captain Simon Francis was sent off for denying Jamie Vardy a goalscoring chance, Artur Boruc denied Mahrez with a two-handed save.\nVardy had struck a post when well-placed in an even first half, but the red card left the Cherries hanging on.\nBoruc again denied Mahrez late on, but the visitors deservedly earned a point.\nLeicester agree deal for winger Gray\nRelive Leicester's meeting with Bournemouth\nVardy blank, Leicester blank (again)\nThough the stats said Leicester led 16 shots to nine, the home side failed to make their one-man advantage count. A paltry two attempts on target underlines the fact many of their efforts came from long distance or were half-chances.\nWith more than half an hour to go when Francis was dismissed, Claudio Ranieri's side had a golden chance to stay level on points with Arsenal; instead they now have just two points from three games, in which they have managed one goal.\nQuestions will be asked. Is this the start of a decline expected by many?\nVardy, though full of running as ever, should have scored when he struck the woodwork from eight yards. He drew a fine save from Boruc shortly before the penalty with a strike from 20 yards but has now gone four games without a goal.\nOn the plus side, Leicester now have the 40 points Ranieri targeted to ensure Premier League survival and the Italian said it would be \"Champagne for my players\" after the stalemate.\nHe could also be celebrating a new signing, with Birmingham winger Demarai Gray reportedly having a medical at the King Power Stadium.\nBut will the acquisition of Gray - who may in any case be loaned back to Birmingham for the season - be enough to propel the Foxes out of their first sticky patch of the campaign? Vardy and Mahrez need someone to share the burden as, in truth, when they could not deliver, no-one else looked like doing so.\nEarly style becomes dogged grit\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe confronted referee Andre Marriner on the pitch after the game in what appeared to be a protest against the sending-off of Francis.\nIt looked an incredibly close call, with the central defender appearing to get a slight touch on the ball as he made contact with Vardy right on the edge of the area.\nThe Cherries side of eight weeks ago may have gone under when faced with the territorial pressure that followed, but Howe's side have now lost just one match in eight.\nThey have run further than their opponents in every fixture this season and did so again at the King Power Stadium, though it would be unfair to brand this a backs-to-the-wall display as they looked threatening in the first half.\nDan Gosling fizzed a shot over the bar after good work by Joshua King, but when the south coast side did have to dig in, the likes of Steve Cook excelled. The centre-back made 15 clearances in all, eight more than anyone else on the field.\nMan of the match - Artur Boruc\nManager reaction\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We knew it was a difficult match and we started playing too late. Bournemouth moved the ball very quickly but in the second half we were much better.\n\"We hit the post, we missed a penalty and had some good chances. We have not scored for three games but we have had chances. Sometimes everything is right but now some things are wrong. The performance was good, a fantastic effort.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe on Simon Francis' red card: \"I didn't think it was a foul from my angle - he definitely touched the ball. It was a great recovery tackle. It's not a foul, a penalty or a sending-off.\n\"It was a very even game before that point, a high-tempo game and very high quality. We had some great chances in the first half but when we went down to 10 men we showed character and it's a great point for us. We won't appeal the red card as it's a one-game ban and the FA Cup is coming up.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJamie Vardy has won seven Premier League penalties since the start of 2014-15, two more than any other player in this period\nAfter a run of scoring in 18 successive Premier League matches from May-December 2015, Leicester City have now failed to score in each of their past three\nBournemouth did not attempt a single shot on target in this match - the 11th occasion that a side have failed to attempt one in a Premier League game this season and the first time Bournemouth have failed to do so\nUp next\nBournemouth entertain Championship side Birmingham City as FA Cup duties take over next Saturday, while Leicester brace themselves for a trip to Tottenham in the third round a day later."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Swansea City 2-4 Sunderland\nJermain Defoe struck a hat-trick as Sunderland dragged 10-man Swansea closer to the bottom three in a game packed with refereeing controversy.\nDefoe pounced on Lukasz Fabianski's mistake to score, but Swansea equalised with Gylfi Sigurdsson's penalty.\nKyle Naughton was controversially sent off for a foul on Yann M'Vila but Andre Ayew put the Swans ahead by half-time.\nPatrick van Aanholt's deflected shot levelled and Defoe struck twice to secure a second successive league win.\nRelive Sunderland's victory at the Liberty Stadium.\nSunderland have now leapfrogged arch rivals Newcastle into 18th in the Premier League table, just one point and one place below Swansea.\nDespite Defoe's heroics, it was referee Graham Scott who found himself as the centre of attention, with doubts hanging over three of the six goals as well as the seemingly harsh dismissal of Naughton.\nFury in the stands and on the touchline\nJoining the select group of Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Harry Redknapp and David Moyes, Sunderland's Sam Allardyce became only the fifth manager to reach 450 Premier League games.\nThe former Bolton and Newcastle boss did not have to wait long to celebrate the landmark, as Defoe put Sunderland ahead after just three minutes.\nFabianski inexplicably hit his goal-kick straight to Adam Johnson and was then only able to parry Fabio Borini's shot, allowing Defoe to tap in from what appeared to be an offside position.\nAllardyce's elation soon turned to anger, however, as Swansea equalised in similarly dubious fashion.\nReferee Scott awarded the hosts a penalty for what seemed like a Wes Brown trip on Ayew, but replays appeared to show the Ghanaian forward had fallen over his own feet.\nSigurdsson confidently converted the spot-kick, much to Allardyce's visible fury on the touchline.\nScott on the spot\nIf Defoe's opener and Sigurdsson's equaliser were debatable, Naughton's dismissal was a controversial flashpoint which prompted a vitriolic backlash from the home crowd.\nThe Swansea right-back won the ball from M'Vila but, having done so with studs showing, Scott showed him a red card.\nSwansea interim manager Alan Curtis - who waited to confront the official at the interval - claimed Scott got \"all the major incidents wrong\", adding Naughton \"clearly won the ball\".\nDespite the setback, his side initially responded well to their numerical disadvantage as Ayew latched on to Fabianski's clearance and scored with a powerful drive.\nThe Swans were not ahead for long though, as four minutes after the restart Van Aanholt's 20-yard shot deflected off Federico Fernandez and flew into the top corner.\nSwansea's slide continues\nWhile Allardyce was presiding over his Premier League milestone, this was Curtis' first since being named Swansea's manager for the rest of the season.\nCurtis' side defended raggedly throughout and there was a certain inevitability - and, once more, controversy - to Sunderland's third goal.\nDefoe was offside as he collected Johnson's through ball but linesman Mark Perry did not raise his flag and the Sunderland striker finished calmly.\nThe England international striker was then perfectly placed to slide in from Van Aanholt's excellent cross to put the game beyond doubt with his fifth goal in two games.\nSwansea, who are 17th in the Premier League table, remain just one point above Sunderland and Newcastle immediately below them.\nMan of the match - Jermain Defoe\nWhat did the managers say?\nSwansea manager Alan Curtis: \"The first goal and third are clearly offside decisions. You can recover but when you play with 10 men for an hour, that's the one that killed us more than anything.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"We manipulated or played with the situation as it panned out. That's all we can do. We have taken the opportunity rightly or wrongly to win the game. For us it's an unbelievable win. Today it's an enormous, enormous, enormous three points to give us encouragement and hope going forward.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is just the second time in 16 league meetings that Sunderland have beaten Swansea. The Black Cats last won in the Welsh city in 1963.\nJermain Defoe has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since February 2015, when he also scored against Swansea.\nDefoe scored his fourth Premier League hat-trick, only 11 players have more.\nSunderland have scored seven goals in their last two Premier League games, more than their previous eight matches combined (6).\nUp next?\nSunderland will look to make it three Premier League wins from three when they travel to Tottenham on Saturday at lunchtime, while Swansea host Watford at the Liberty Stadium on Monday night."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 3-3 Manchester United\nPaul Dummett's late strike rescued a point for Newcastle as Manchester United missed the chance to go level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham.\nIt was a remarkable end to a game that had seen the away side lead twice.\nWayne Rooney's penalty and Jesse Lingard's finish put them 2-0 up before Georginio Wijnaldum and Aleksandar Mitrovic's penalty levelled the scores.\nRooney's second looked to have won it for Louis van Gaal's side but Dummett salvaged the draw in the last minute.\nThe point earned is not enough to lift Newcastle out of the bottom three - they remain a point and place behind 17th-placed Swansea - but it represents another notable improvement following three successive 1-0 league defeats.\nFor Louis van Gaal's side, it will represent two points lost and a step backwards after back-to-back Premier League and FA Cup victories had offered improvement on a winless December.\nHow the action unfolded at St James' Park\nListen to BBC Radio 5 live commentary of all the goals\n'We always try to play attacking football' - Football Daily podcast\nRelive Tuesday night's Premier League action\nLet us entertain you\nFollowing criticism of Manchester United's attacking prowess, in a season that had seen them score just 24 goals in 20 league games prior to Tuesday, Van Gaal himself admitted on Monday that he has been \"very bored\" at times watching his side.\nHe can have no such complaints after this hugely entertaining, see-saw game, which produced some of their best attacking play of the season.\nRooney was magnificent.\nThe England striker gave them the lead from the spot after Mike Dean's controversial call to award a penalty against Chancel Mbemba after his arm blocked Marouane Fellaini's back-post header from a corner.\nBut it was his role in setting up Lingard for the second - holding the ball up before rolling a perfectly timed pass into the winger's path for a low, angled finish - and his superbly struck 20-yard second, after Memphis Depay's shot had deflected to him, that really showcased the 30-year-old's talent, the latter of which drew a rare smile from his manager.\nHowever, United's attacking display was let down by key misses from Lingard, who blazed over from inside the box at 2-1, and Fellaini, who headed straight at Rob Elliott from point-blank range when his side led 3-2.\nUltimately, though, Van Gaal will be left bemoaning an area in which his side have largely excelled this season, as a series of defensive lapses cost them victory.\nResilient Newcastle show improvement\nNewcastle have been one of the early movers in this transfer window, signing midfielders Henri Saivet and Jonjo Shelvey, both of whom greeted the crowd before kick-off.\nBut on the evidence of this display, at least, the current squad is not lacking in fight.\nAt 2-0 down they refused to crumble, hitting back soon after Lingard's goal as Wijnaldum - who had earlier seen a 12-yard shot saved by David de Gea - made no mistake from a similar range after latching on to Mitrovic's downward header.\nThe supplier turned scorer after the break to make it 2-2, dusting himself off after being grappled to the ground by Chris Smalling in the box to roll in his fourth goal of the season from the penalty spot.\nEven when they fell behind again with 11 minutes to go, Newcastle dug deep and were rewarded when the away side failed to properly clear a ball into the box and Dummett's fierce strike from the edge of the box found the net via Smalling's chest.\nAnalysis - former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer\n\"What a fantastic match. Credit to both sets of players and managers as they both wanted to win and gambled to win. I think a draw was a fair result.\n\"How on earth can you work football out?\n\"Newcastle got some confidence and they shoved themselves 10 yards up the pitch, particularly in the first half. They got the goal just before half-time and I'm sure Steve McClaren told them to do the same as they had in the last 10 minutes of the first half.\n\"It was a great atmosphere in the stadium and I just wanted more.\n\"The one concern is that we have seen Newcastle performances like this against Tottenham and Liverpool but what they have to do now is go into games against lesser teams and produce that kind of performance.\"\nMan of the match - Wayne Rooney\nWhat they said...\nNewcastle United boss Steve McClaren: \"The crowd responded magnificently and we wanted to show everyone what we are about.\n\"People said that United were boring and that we lack character - but we kept fighting until the end and we have got a goal that feels like a winner.\n\"People thought it would be a 0-0 and it was a classic at 3-3. It must have been a great game for the neutral - it was a heart attack for the coaches.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"Of course it feels like a defeat.\n\"We have given it away - I have told that to my players. When the referee gives a penalty for nothing - it is a duel I think and you cannot decide who is worse - but we gave it away.\n\"We could have scored six goals easily here and we did not. If we had, it would have been three successive wins at the start of the year going into Liverpool.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nRooney has also assisted eight Premier League goals against Newcastle, his most against a single opponent\nRooney's penalty goal was his 19th in the Premier League for Man United, putting him ahead of Ruud van Nistelrooy (18)\nThis is only the second time this season that Manchester United have scored twice in the first half of a Premier League game (also two v Everton in October)\nNewcastle recovered from a two-goal deficit to avoid defeat for the first time in a Premier League game since September 2014 against Hull (a 2-2 draw)\nThe Magpies scored more than twice in a Premier League game this season for only the second time (also 6-2 against Norwich)\nWhat next?\nNewcastle are at home again on Saturday, with West Ham the visitors to St James' Park.\nManchester United travel to Anfield to face Liverpool on Sunday in a 14:05 GMT kick-off.",

A clean-sheet gives everybody a good boost.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores:\n\"We didn't hit the level of other matches. We didn't play well.

Boof.\"\nEx-Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann: \"It's a blip for Spurs. They're still in a good position and favourites to reach the Champions League. The worry is the lack of form from Christian Eriksen, who hasn't scored in the league since October. They are over-reliant on Harry Kane. If he gets injured they'll be in trouble.\"\n'So much work to do'\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri told BBC Match of the Day: \"We wanted to win but we knew it was a difficult match. Tottenham started very well and put us under pressure but we didn't lose our confidence or shape and it was difficult for them.\n\"In the second half it was an open match.

Yet Robert Huth's late winner for Leicester City at Tottenham and Allen's late strike left Arsenal only ahead of the Foxes on goal difference.\nRelive the drama from Anfield\nFootball Daily podcast - Does anyone want to win the league?\nArsenal pay the price for frailty\nThe visitors looked to have finally established supremacy in this topsy-turvy encounter when Giroud turned to put them ahead 10 minutes after the break - but then failed to press home the advantage and paid a heavy price.\nAnd it will be a matter of concern to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger that on nights like this at places like Anfield, they did not show the necessary ruthlessness to close out a game that was within their grasp.\nThe Reds deserve great credit for the way they responded to the disappointment of going behind after leading twice - but Arsenal showed no assurance or authority when the pressure mounted in the closing stages and there was an inevitability about Allen's equaliser.\nArsenal, when they should have been pressuring a desperately poor and under-strength Liverpool defence, instead allowed themselves to be pushed back. This was two points lost and Klopp will be the much happier manager.\nTwo sides to Olivier Giroud\nFor such a regular goalscorer, Giroud remains a maligned figure by some Arsenal fans who regard him as just short of the highest class - and yet his strike rate speaks eloquently on his behalf.\nHe showed a poacher's instinct to touch home his first from Ramsey's corner then showed good awareness and movement to turn Kolo Toure and score his second.\nAnd yet those who remain unconvinced by Giroud will point to his astonishing first-half miss when he somehow failed to convert Hector Bellerin's pass from a matter of inches in front of the Kop.\nHere, though, he demonstrated again that he will get goals and that is the best answer he can give to those who still doubt the France striker's pedigree.\nMignolet on borrowed time\nLiverpool keeper Simon Mignolet is poised to sign a new five-year contract at Anfield and has won the consistent backing of manager Klopp despite his fragile form.\nAnd yet he was once again a very obvious weakness behind a Liverpool defence that was an accident waiting to happen for large portions of this enthralling game.\nThe 27-year-old Belgian was beaten too easily inside his near post when Ramsey equalised after Firmino's opener, then was hopelessly stranded as Giroud's faint touch allowed a corner to sneak in. It was desperately poor keeping.\nFor all Klopp's public assurances - he would not do otherwise - he must surely be concerned at Mignolet's obvious frailty, alongside the glaring inadequacy of his deputy Adam Bogdan, as proved by his errors at Watford and Exeter City.\nLiverpool have recalled 22-year-old Welsh keeper Danny Ward from a successful loan spell at Aberdeen so he is now in the mix - but Klopp has to consider a more reliable, experienced long-term solution after Mignolet's latest blunders.\nMan of the match - Roberto Firmino (Liverpool)\nWhat the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"We started so good and played good football. It showed all of us how good we could be.\n\"Then we concede a goal from a set play and we have to work at it. Organisation is one thing and sometimes we have a little problem with concentration.\n\"We gave them two easy goals after we had to work really hard for our goals.

Credit to both sets of players and managers as they both wanted to win and gambled to win. I think a draw was a fair result.\n\"How on earth can you work football out?\n\"Newcastle got some confidence and they shoved themselves 10 yards up the pitch, particularly in the first half. They got the goal just before half-time and I'm sure Steve McClaren told them to do the same as they had in the last 10 minutes of the first half.\n\"It was a great atmosphere in the stadium and I just wanted more.\n\"The one concern is that we have seen Newcastle performances like this against Tottenham and Liverpool but what they have to do now is go into games against lesser teams and produce that kind of performance.\"\nMan of the match - Wayne Rooney\nWhat they said...\nNewcastle United boss Steve McClaren: \"The crowd responded magnificently and we wanted to show everyone what we are about.\n\"People said that United were boring and that we lack character - but we kept fighting until the end and we have got a goal that feels like a winner.\n\"People thought it would be a 0-0 and it was a classic at 3-3. It must have been a great game for the neutral - it was a heart attack for the coaches.\"\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"Of course it feels like a defeat.\n\"We have given it away - I have told that to my players. When the referee gives a penalty for nothing - it is a duel I think and you cannot decide who is worse - but we gave it away.\n\"We could have scored six goals easily here and we did not. If we had, it would have been three successive wins at the start of the year going into Liverpool.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nRooney has also assisted eight Premier League goals against Newcastle, his most against a single opponent\nRooney's penalty goal was his 19th in the Premier League for Man United, putting him ahead of Ruud van Nistelrooy (18)\nThis is only the second time this season that Manchester United have scored twice in the first half of a Premier League game (also two v Everton in October)\nNewcastle recovered from a two-goal deficit to avoid defeat for the first time in a Premier League game since September 2014 against Hull (a 2-2 draw)\nThe Magpies scored more than twice in a Premier League game this season for only the second time (also 6-2 against Norwich)\nWhat next?\nNewcastle are at home again on Saturday, with West Ham the visitors to St James' Park.\nManchester United travel to Anfield to face Liverpool on Sunday in a 14:05 GMT kick-off."

They've got pace as well so we had to be vigilant. But in the end we saw the game out quite comfortably.\n\"If we continue in this run then who knows where we can get to. We have just got to keep close to the guys in front.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil:\n\"Up to the sending-off we performed very well and had the best chance through Ryan Bennett. But after that point it becomes tough.\n\"After conceding the opener we showed character to equalise, but we didn't squeeze the ball quick enough for their second goal.\n\"When you're drawing the game you've got something to hang on to and I think Stoke were getting agitated.\"\nWhat's next?\nStoke are back at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday when they welcome Premier League leaders Arsenal.\nNorwich face another important away trip on Saturday, going to a Bournemouth side which is one place and two points behind them in the top-flight table.\nStats of the day\nJonathan Walters has scored in three of his last four appearances for Stoke - after going nine games in a row without scoring\nNorwich are the only side to not keep a clean sheet away from home in the Premier League this season.\nJonny Howson has scored in successive Premier League away games at the Britannia Stadium versus Stoke for Norwich.\nNorwich have been given the most red cards away from home in the Premier League this season (3).",

You can recover but when you play with 10 men for an hour, that's the one that killed us more than anything.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"We manipulated or played with the situation as it panned out. That's all we can do. We have taken the opportunity rightly or wrongly to win the game. For us it's an unbelievable win. Today it's an enormous, enormous, enormous three points to give us encouragement and hope going forward.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is just the second time in 16 league meetings that Sunderland have beaten Swansea. The Black Cats last won in the Welsh city in 1963.\nJermain Defoe has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since February 2015, when he also scored against Swansea.\nDefoe scored his fourth Premier League hat-trick, only 11 players have more.\nSunderland have scored seven goals in their last two Premier League games, more than their previous eight matches combined (6).\nUp next?\nSunderland will look to make it three Premier League wins from three when they travel to Tottenham on Saturday at lunchtime, while Swansea host Watford at the Liberty Stadium on Monday night.",

He could not have hoped for an easier reintroduction.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Southampton)\nWhat the managers said\nSouthampton's Ronald Koeman:\n\"We had really big chances, Sadio had two big chances. The team was aggressive and superb.\n\"The centre-backs did a great job, with Matt Targett on the left and Cedric Soares on the right. There was also good movement from midfielder Steven Davis - he was one of the best of the night. Watford only had one good chance.\n\"It makes everybody proud that Fraser [Forster] is back. A clean-sheet gives everybody a good boost.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores:\n\"We didn't hit the level of other matches. We didn't play well.

We've got Sunderland next week and the games just keep getting bigger.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil said: \"We didn't deserve anything from the game, but we won't start buying people left, right and centre just because we lost the match.\n\"The transfer plans are in place, and we don't make decisions like that on the back of one game.\n\"Bournemouth were the better side. We didn't do enough with the ball and we got caught out by a couple of things we spoke about before the game, so that's disappointing.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nBournemouth have scored more goals in the opening 15 minutes of Premier League games (seven) than any other side this season.\nNorwich are the only Premier League side yet to keep a clean sheet away from home this season.\nDan Gosling has scored three goals in the Premier League this season, his best tally in a single Premier League campaign.\nNorwich City have conceded a league-high 14 goals from crosses this season.\nRobert Madley has awarded 10 penalties in 15 Premier League games this season, more than any other referee.\nBournemouth have been awarded 20 penalties in league football since the start of 2014-15, more than any other team in the top-four tiers of English football.\nBenik Afobe has scored 33 league goals since the start of 2014-15 - only Sergio Aguero (36) and Daryl Murphy (35) have more in the top four tiers in this period (Harry Kane, Odion Ighalo and Andre Gray also have 33).\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to 19th-placed Sunderland on Saturday, in another big relegation game.

That will be good. Will someone be sold? No. Nobody is for sale in January.\"\nThe other side of West Brom\nThe Baggies' showing at St Mary's was a world away from the dogged away performance that earned a 2-2 draw against Chelsea on Wednesday.\nThere was little of the determined harrying that unsettled the home side at Stamford Bridge, with Southampton at times afforded far too much time on the ball.\nThe highlight of the away side's opening 45 minutes was a back-heeled clearance off the goalline by James McClean to block Targett's low shot - denying the 20-year-old a deserved goal for his excellent overall performance.\nIn West Brom's defence there was an improvement after Pulis' attack-minded substitutions at the break, but Southampton were intelligent in the way they protected the lead, and ruthless in the way they extended it.\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)\nWhat the managers said\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"Ward-Prowse's early free-kick opened the game. It gave us confidence, meant we could control the game.\n\"It's important to score early against a side like West Brom, as it gives you the patience to try and score the second.

The players looked more confident than they have done recently. We totally deserved the win.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"You've got to give Southampton credit, they were the better team and deserved to win the game.\n\"It would be interesting to see how many teams played away midweek and then picked up points away from home this weekend, because our players did look leggy.\n\"It just wasn't our day. All season we've done well away from home. Today we didn't and got punished.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Brom didn't manage a single shot on target for the third time this Premier League season - more than any other side\nJames Ward-Prowse was the first Southampton player to score a Premier League goal from a direct free-kick since Rickie Lambert in February 2014\nWard-Prowse scored more goals in this match than he had in his previous 92 Premier League appearances for Southampton\nDusan Tadic now has more goals this season than he managed in 2014-15, with four goals\nWhat next?\nWest Brom play away at Bristol City in an FA Cup third-round replay on Tuesday before hosting Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday.\nSouthampton's next match is at Manchester United in the league, also on Saturday."

We talked beforehand about the need to pick up three points. I thought in the first half in particular we were excellent. Over the course of the 90 minutes, we deserved it.\n\"We got a little bit edgy in the second half - that's probably more the situation we find ourselves in. I thought the players were fantastic.\n\"It takes us out of the bottom three and psychologically that will give us a big lift.\"\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores:\n\"We are not happy with the first half. We had to correct at half-time. In terms of the attack, it was too bad. We were playing against very good players.\n\"In the second half, we didn't lose the ball, we created attempts. The players are human beings and the last match was very tough against Southampton.\n\"I don't like to lose, players don't like to lose\u2026 All the teams are tough for us. I am really happy with my squad. Twelfth in the table is a very good position.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea have scored 79 Premier League goals since their last by a defender in the top flight - Williams' against Everton in March 2014.\nThe Swans secured their first win in their past four top-flight games and only their second in their past 12 (D3 L7).\nWatford have now lost four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since May 2000.\nAfter winning four Premier League games in a row, the Hornets have picked up just one point in their past five top-flight games.\nBafetimbi Gomis has been flagged offside 33 times in the Premier League this season, 12 more than any other player.\nSwansea have hit the woodwork a 14 times this season (the joint-highest in the Premier League with Arsenal).",

The 23-year-old midfielder, signed for \u00a312m from Swansea, showed the kind of passing, creativity and energy which helped him break into the England squad earlier this season.\nWith just six minutes on the clock, Shelvey found Wijnaldum, who laid the ball off for Perez to open the scoring.\nThe new signing then helped set up his side's second with a raking 60-yard ball to Daryl Janmaat, who crossed for Wijnaldum to score his ninth Magpies goal of the season.\nVictory moved Newcastle out of the relegation zone at the expense of Swansea, where Shelvey said he had been \"hung out to dry\".\n\"I've enjoyed every minute I've been up here,\" said Shelvey. \"It's nice to get out there and show what I am about.\n\"It's not about me. It is about the team. We are out of the relegation zone and it's onwards and upwards from here.\n\"I'm very shocked this team is in and around the relegation places.

We kept playing, we had chances that we didn't take but defended well and saw the game through.\n\"Jonjo is a very, very good player with real potential and it will suit him playing in this team, a team of footballers.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"They scored two goals very early and it gave them confidence, but from the first minute of the game they were getting to second balls and looked hungrier, sharper, quicker.\n\"In the second half, we improved a lot. In the end we could have nicked a point when we had a great chance to equalise. But, overall, they deserved to beat us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Ham have won just one of their past 13 Premier League trips to St James' Park (W1 D5 L7).\nAll nine of Wijnaldum's league goals this season have come at St James' Park.\nPerez has scored in four of Newcastle's five Premier League wins in 2015-16.\nNewcastle attempted 23 shots (including blocked) in this match - their highest tally in a single Premier League game this season and the most they have had in a top-flight game since September 2014.\nJelavic scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham and his first in the competition since February 2015.\nWhat next?\nNewcastle are away at Watford on 23 January, while West Ham play host to Manchester City on the same day."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Stoke City 0-0 Arsenal\nArsenal returned to the top of the Premier League thanks to a point from a goalless draw at Stoke.\nArsene Wenger's side missed the creativity of Mesut Ozil, who was injured, but had chances to win the game only to be denied by Jack Butland.\nThe England goalkeeper tipped over Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's long-range strike, before denying Olivier Giroud's header.\nStoke finished strongly as Jon Walters had a late header cleared off the line by Aaron Ramsey.\nThe draw means Arsenal move ahead of Leicester on goal difference. Stoke remain seventh.\nAnalysis: Arsenal pass title test - Alan Shearer\nNo Ozil, no party\nArsenal have started 2016 well poised to challenge for a first league title in 12 years, and key to their impressive form this season has been Ozil.\nThe German tops the Premier League assist chart with 16, so his absence on Sunday because of a foot injury was undoubtedly a big blow for the Gunners.\nIt did, however, provided Oxlade-Chamberlain with the chance to step up.\nHe certainly looked like he had a point to prove, forcing Butland into a fine one-handed save with a curling strike midway through the first half.\nHowever, he was also guilty of losing possession at times and became increasingly anonymous as the game wore on.\nIf he is to prove himself an able deputy for Ozil, he will need to a show a lot more than he did on Sunday.\nMust do better?\nArsenal may never get as good a chance to win the league as they will this season, with the challenge from their traditional title rivals faltering.\nArsene Wenger's side had lost just once in the eight games prior to the trip to Stoke, but Gunners fans might have been forgiven for feeling a little uneasy about their recent away form - they have now picked up just six points from a possible 18.\nArsenal were looking for their first win at the Britannia Stadium since 2010, so a victory at Stoke - especially without their talisman Ozil - would certainly have underlined their credentials as genuine title contenders.\nIn the opening stages of the game, however, they were second best, struggling to match Stoke's neat passing.\nThey improved as the game wore on, but not by much. Giroud's header - well saved by Butland - was their only effort on target in the second half.\nButland brilliant again\nStoke's attacking talent has, quite rightly, been getting plenty of praise this season but Butland has been just as impressive in the Potters' goal.\nHis total of 81 is more saves than any other goalkeeper has made in the Premier League this season and he was key to Stoke's frustrating of Arsenal.\nHis saves from Oxlade-Chamberlain and Giroud kept his side in the game, allowing them to press in the closing stages as the visitors retreated, opting to protect the point.\nAs a consequence, Stoke could have snatched all three points just before full-time, but Walters' header from a corner was kept out by Ramsey, before Petr Cech blocked Joselu's follow-up.\nMan of the match - Jack Butland\nWhat they said\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"It was a game between evenly matched sides. Both teams approached the game in the right manner and created chances. All-in-all we're pleased. It shows our progress. Teams have found it difficult to get points here.\n\"We are showing everyone we have belief in our ability. There was a period where Arsenal had some play around the box without creating too much. It was a similar story at the other end.\n\"It was a competitive game. At times, there were good opportunities to put the ball in the box and so the only criticism I would have is that we were reluctant to do that.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"Maybe we had a better opportunities to score, they played very well, very physical and were very direct, which is an unusual style for them.\n\"We needed to be strong physically and had a great spirit, we fought very hard but couldn't take our chances. It is a hard fought 0-0. We have done better than years before at this ground and showed we can fight even when we miss certain players.\n\"It shows the spirit in the team, the desire and togetherness. We were less creative but on the physical front we did well.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMark Hughes is unbeaten on home soil as an opposition coach against Arsene Wenger in his past eight Premier League matches (W5 D3), spread across five clubs.\nStoke City have lost just one of their eight Premier League games at the Britannia Stadium against Arsenal (W4 D3 L1).\nIt's the first time since November 2012 versus Aston Villa that Arsenal have drawn 0-0 away from home in the Premier League.\nThe Gunners have won just one of their past six Premier League away games (D3 L2).\nWhat next?\nStoke travel to high-flying Leicester on Saturday. Arsenal host Chelsea the following day."

Having made a mistake in their defeat by bottom side Aston Villa in midweek, goalkeeper Hennessey was again at fault for City's opener.\nManager Pardew was unhappy with the Welshman's performance - but he has problems at both ends of the field.\nPardew has admitted he needs to bring in a striker in the transfer window, and neither the hard-working Connor Wickham nor the ineffectual Marouane Chamakh forced Hart into a save.\nPalace's best chance came in the second minute. Had skipper Delaney scored with his header, it could have been a different story, but their wait for a goal and a point continues.\nMan of the match - David Silva\nWhat they said\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"Was it comfortable? No, because you never know in this game. The first half, the two goals gave us more space as they've had to go for the draw. That allowed us to use that space and score two more.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew on the performance of goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey: \"Wayne is going to have to show me this week in training. A mistake at Villa, he needed to respond today and made another mistake.\n\"The ball is in his court to keep out the other two goalkeepers but I need to see it in training. I need to see a reaction from him.\"\nWhat next?\nManchester City travel to West Ham next Saturday (17:30 GMT), while Crystal Palace host fellow Londoners Tottenham (15:00 GMT) on the same day.\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have netted a league-high 11 goals from outside the box this season, four more than any other side\nSince coming to the Premier League in the summer of 2011, Sergio Aguero has bagged 88 goals, 10 more than any other player\nKevin de Bruyne has registered 11 goals and 11 assists in 29 appearances in all competitions for Manchester City this season\nCrystal Palace have failed to score in five successive top-flight matches for the first time since February 1998",

Hopefully he learns from today.\"\n'Outstanding' Pickford makes fine Premier League debut\nSunderland keeper Pickford spent the first half of the season on loan at Championship club Preston and Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce said it would have been wrong not to recall him as he \"made such an outstanding impact\".\nAllardyce hopes he can follow England Under-21 international predecessors Joe Hart and Jack Butland in graduating to the full national team and, despite conceding four goals, he made an impressive league debut, replacing Vito Mannone.\nThe 21-year-old, who has been on loan at six different clubs over the past four years, made superb saves at full stretch in the first half to deny Kane and Eriksen.\nPickford made further stops from Kane and Rose in the second period and was not at fault for any of the goals.\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen\nManager reaction\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"It was a good response to the Leicester defeat. I'm very pleased. We need to be patient.\n\"We had a lot of shots on target - their goalkeeper was fantastic. I feel very pleased in the last few games. The belief is fantastic. We have a very good, strong squad - today was a good example.\"\nSunderland boss Sam Allardyce told BBC Sport: \"Our players put themselves in one fantastic position and then in the space of a minute conceded. It's one of the reasons we ended up losing.\n\"If we came in at half-time 1-0 up we could have built on that. It was a really sloppy thing to do. We ran out of legs in the end. In the last quarter, physically we were tiring.\n\"I changed the shape but that didn't work. The scoreline, 4-1, looks more comfortable than it was.\"\nOn Jordan Pickford: \"Playing a keeper at a young age is not an easy decision to make. But I thought he handled it well. He might not play too many more games this season because Vito Mannone has done a fantastic job. The rest of the team up to 65 minutes were doing the job right but in the last 20 they failed miserably.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChristian Eriksen has now scored in all four of his Premier League appearances against Sunderland (five goals).\nHarry Kane has now scored 11 goals in his past 13 Premier League appearances.\nEach of Sunderland's three goalkeepers (Costel Pantilimon, Mannone and Pickford) have conceded four goals in their first Premier League appearance of 2015-16.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to Leicester for an FA Cup third-round replay on Wednesday (19:45 GMT), which is live on BBC One, before a league trip to Crystal Palace next Saturday (15:00 GMT). Sunderland host fellow strugglers Bournemouth on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

That will be good. Will someone be sold? No. Nobody is for sale in January.\"\nThe other side of West Brom\nThe Baggies' showing at St Mary's was a world away from the dogged away performance that earned a 2-2 draw against Chelsea on Wednesday.\nThere was little of the determined harrying that unsettled the home side at Stamford Bridge, with Southampton at times afforded far too much time on the ball.\nThe highlight of the away side's opening 45 minutes was a back-heeled clearance off the goalline by James McClean to block Targett's low shot - denying the 20-year-old a deserved goal for his excellent overall performance.\nIn West Brom's defence there was an improvement after Pulis' attack-minded substitutions at the break, but Southampton were intelligent in the way they protected the lead, and ruthless in the way they extended it.\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)\nWhat the managers said\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"Ward-Prowse's early free-kick opened the game. It gave us confidence, meant we could control the game.\n\"It's important to score early against a side like West Brom, as it gives you the patience to try and score the second. At 1-0, we could be more patient.\n\"Now we are back playing our own way, how we like to play. Everyone looked very comfortable today - that's the most important thing. The players looked more confident than they have done recently. We totally deserved the win.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"You've got to give Southampton credit, they were the better team and deserved to win the game.\n\"It would be interesting to see how many teams played away midweek and then picked up points away from home this weekend, because our players did look leggy.\n\"It just wasn't our day. All season we've done well away from home. Today we didn't and got punished.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Brom didn't manage a single shot on target for the third time this Premier League season - more than any other side\nJames Ward-Prowse was the first Southampton player to score a Premier League goal from a direct free-kick since Rickie Lambert in February 2014\nWard-Prowse scored more goals in this match than he had in his previous 92 Premier League appearances for Southampton\nDusan Tadic now has more goals this season than he managed in 2014-15, with four goals\nWhat next?\nWest Brom play away at Bristol City in an FA Cup third-round replay on Tuesday before hosting Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday.\nSouthampton's next match is at Manchester United in the league, also on Saturday.",

Hopefully he learns from today.\"\n'Outstanding' Pickford makes fine Premier League debut\nSunderland keeper Pickford spent the first half of the season on loan at Championship club Preston and Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce said it would have been wrong not to recall him as he \"made such an outstanding impact\".\nAllardyce hopes he can follow England Under-21 international predecessors Joe Hart and Jack Butland in graduating to the full national team and, despite conceding four goals, he made an impressive league debut, replacing Vito Mannone.\nThe 21-year-old, who has been on loan at six different clubs over the past four years, made superb saves at full stretch in the first half to deny Kane and Eriksen.\nPickford made further stops from Kane and Rose in the second period and was not at fault for any of the goals.\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen\nManager reaction\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"It was a good response to the Leicester defeat. I'm very pleased. We need to be patient.\n\"We had a lot of shots on target - their goalkeeper was fantastic. I feel very pleased in the last few games. The belief is fantastic. We have a very good, strong squad - today was a good example.\"\nSunderland boss Sam Allardyce told BBC Sport: \"Our players put themselves in one fantastic position and then in the space of a minute conceded. It's one of the reasons we ended up losing.\n\"If we came in at half-time 1-0 up we could have built on that. It was a really sloppy thing to do. We ran out of legs in the end. In the last quarter, physically we were tiring.\n\"I changed the shape but that didn't work. The scoreline, 4-1, looks more comfortable than it was.\"\nOn Jordan Pickford: \"Playing a keeper at a young age is not an easy decision to make. But I thought he handled it well. He might not play too many more games this season because Vito Mannone has done a fantastic job. The rest of the team up to 65 minutes were doing the job right but in the last 20 they failed miserably.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChristian Eriksen has now scored in all four of his Premier League appearances against Sunderland (five goals).\nHarry Kane has now scored 11 goals in his past 13 Premier League appearances.\nEach of Sunderland's three goalkeepers (Costel Pantilimon, Mannone and Pickford) have conceded four goals in their first Premier League appearance of 2015-16.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to Leicester for an FA Cup third-round replay on Wednesday (19:45 GMT), which is live on BBC One, before a league trip to Crystal Palace next Saturday (15:00 GMT). Sunderland host fellow strugglers Bournemouth on the same day (15:00 GMT).",

We've got Sunderland next week and the games just keep getting bigger.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil said: \"We didn't deserve anything from the game, but we won't start buying people left, right and centre just because we lost the match.\n\"The transfer plans are in place, and we don't make decisions like that on the back of one game.\n\"Bournemouth were the better side. We didn't do enough with the ball and we got caught out by a couple of things we spoke about before the game, so that's disappointing.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nBournemouth have scored more goals in the opening 15 minutes of Premier League games (seven) than any other side this season.\nNorwich are the only Premier League side yet to keep a clean sheet away from home this season.\nDan Gosling has scored three goals in the Premier League this season, his best tally in a single Premier League campaign.\nNorwich City have conceded a league-high 14 goals from crosses this season.\nRobert Madley has awarded 10 penalties in 15 Premier League games this season, more than any other referee.\nBournemouth have been awarded 20 penalties in league football since the start of 2014-15, more than any other team in the top-four tiers of English football.\nBenik Afobe has scored 33 league goals since the start of 2014-15 - only Sergio Aguero (36) and Daryl Murphy (35) have more in the top four tiers in this period (Harry Kane, Odion Ighalo and Andre Gray also have 33).\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to 19th-placed Sunderland on Saturday, in another big relegation game. Norwich host Liverpool on the same day, looking to avoid a third consecutive defeat in the league."

The 23-year-old midfielder, signed for \u00a312m from Swansea, showed the kind of passing, creativity and energy which helped him break into the England squad earlier this season.\nWith just six minutes on the clock, Shelvey found Wijnaldum, who laid the ball off for Perez to open the scoring.\nThe new signing then helped set up his side's second with a raking 60-yard ball to Daryl Janmaat, who crossed for Wijnaldum to score his ninth Magpies goal of the season.\nVictory moved Newcastle out of the relegation zone at the expense of Swansea, where Shelvey said he had been \"hung out to dry\".\n\"I've enjoyed every minute I've been up here,\" said Shelvey. \"It's nice to get out there and show what I am about.\n\"It's not about me. It is about the team. We are out of the relegation zone and it's onwards and upwards from here.\n\"I'm very shocked this team is in and around the relegation places. Normally it is hard coming into a new team and slotting straight in, but credit to the players and staff here.\"\nMcClaren finally beats Bilic\nSteve McClaren was cruelly dubbed the 'wally with the brolly' when his England side were beaten by a Croatia team managed by Slaven Bilic in 2007.\nThat defeat ended England's hopes of qualifying for Euro 2008, and McClaren duly lost his job.\nBilic also came out on top when the Hammers won the reverse fixture earlier this season, but McClaren deservedly emerged victorious this time.\nThe visitors were overwhelmed in the first half and, despite improving after the break, would have been beaten more convincingly had it not been for Adrian.\nMan of the match - Jonjo Shelvey\n'It shouldn't have been close'\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren: \"They must have gone in at half-time thinking 'wow, get in' because it was only 2-0.\n\"Then we gifted them a goal, but we didn't get nervous. We kept playing, we had chances that we didn't take but defended well and saw the game through.\n\"Jonjo is a very, very good player with real potential and it will suit him playing in this team, a team of footballers.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"They scored two goals very early and it gave them confidence, but from the first minute of the game they were getting to second balls and looked hungrier, sharper, quicker.\n\"In the second half, we improved a lot. In the end we could have nicked a point when we had a great chance to equalise. But, overall, they deserved to beat us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Ham have won just one of their past 13 Premier League trips to St James' Park (W1 D5 L7).\nAll nine of Wijnaldum's league goals this season have come at St James' Park.\nPerez has scored in four of Newcastle's five Premier League wins in 2015-16.\nNewcastle attempted 23 shots (including blocked) in this match - their highest tally in a single Premier League game this season and the most they have had in a top-flight game since September 2014.\nJelavic scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham and his first in the competition since February 2015.\nWhat next?\nNewcastle are away at Watford on 23 January, while West Ham play host to Manchester City on the same day.",

Stoke remain seventh.\nAnalysis: Arsenal pass title test - Alan Shearer\nNo Ozil, no party\nArsenal have started 2016 well poised to challenge for a first league title in 12 years, and key to their impressive form this season has been Ozil.\nThe German tops the Premier League assist chart with 16, so his absence on Sunday because of a foot injury was undoubtedly a big blow for the Gunners.\nIt did, however, provided Oxlade-Chamberlain with the chance to step up.\nHe certainly looked like he had a point to prove, forcing Butland into a fine one-handed save with a curling strike midway through the first half.\nHowever, he was also guilty of losing possession at times and became increasingly anonymous as the game wore on.\nIf he is to prove himself an able deputy for Ozil, he will need to a show a lot more than he did on Sunday.\nMust do better?\nArsenal may never get as good a chance to win the league as they will this season, with the challenge from their traditional title rivals faltering.\nArsene Wenger's side had lost just once in the eight games prior to the trip to Stoke, but Gunners fans might have been forgiven for feeling a little uneasy about their recent away form - they have now picked up just six points from a possible 18.\nArsenal were looking for their first win at the Britannia Stadium since 2010, so a victory at Stoke - especially without their talisman Ozil - would certainly have underlined their credentials as genuine title contenders.\nIn the opening stages of the game, however, they were second best, struggling to match Stoke's neat passing.\nThey improved as the game wore on, but not by much. Giroud's header - well saved by Butland - was their only effort on target in the second half.\nButland brilliant again\nStoke's attacking talent has, quite rightly, been getting plenty of praise this season but Butland has been just as impressive in the Potters' goal.\nHis total of 81 is more saves than any other goalkeeper has made in the Premier League this season and he was key to Stoke's frustrating of Arsenal.\nHis saves from Oxlade-Chamberlain and Giroud kept his side in the game, allowing them to press in the closing stages as the visitors retreated, opting to protect the point.\nAs a consequence, Stoke could have snatched all three points just before full-time, but Walters' header from a corner was kept out by Ramsey, before Petr Cech blocked Joselu's follow-up.\nMan of the match - Jack Butland\nWhat they said\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"It was a game between evenly matched sides. Both teams approached the game in the right manner and created chances. All-in-all we're pleased. It shows our progress. Teams have found it difficult to get points here.\n\"We are showing everyone we have belief in our ability. There was a period where Arsenal had some play around the box without creating too much. It was a similar story at the other end.\n\"It was a competitive game. At times, there were good opportunities to put the ball in the box and so the only criticism I would have is that we were reluctant to do that.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"Maybe we had a better opportunities to score, they played very well, very physical and were very direct, which is an unusual style for them.\n\"We needed to be strong physically and had a great spirit, we fought very hard but couldn't take our chances. It is a hard fought 0-0. We have done better than years before at this ground and showed we can fight even when we miss certain players.\n\"It shows the spirit in the team, the desire and togetherness. We were less creative but on the physical front we did well.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMark Hughes is unbeaten on home soil as an opposition coach against Arsene Wenger in his past eight Premier League matches (W5 D3), spread across five clubs.\nStoke City have lost just one of their eight Premier League games at the Britannia Stadium against Arsenal (W4 D3 L1).\nIt's the first time since November 2012 versus Aston Villa that Arsenal have drawn 0-0 away from home in the Premier League.\nThe Gunners have won just one of their past six Premier League away games (D3 L2).\nWhat next?\nStoke travel to high-flying Leicester on Saturday. Arsenal host Chelsea the following day.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 3-3 Everton\nJohn Terry scored a controversial 98th-minute equaliser to earn Chelsea a point in a thriller against Everton.\nThe Toffees took the lead when Terry put through his own net, and Ross Barkley hit a post for Everton before Kevin Mirallas put the visitors 2-0 up.\nDiego Costa reduced the margin and Cesc Fabregas's deflected shot made it 2-2.\nRamiro Funes Mori restored Everton's lead in the 90th minute only for Terry to back-heel in from close range - although he was a yard offside.\nRelive the drama from Stamford Bridge\nEverton undone by defensive failings\nEverton's players were angry Terry's goal was allowed to stand while manager Roberto Martinez was also furious referee Mike Jones played more than the seven additional minutes indicated.\nYet in a pulsating game the visitors, who lost defender Bryan Oviedo to injury, only had themselves to blame for blowing a 2-0 lead.\nThey appeared to be coasting to a first win in four league outings when Mirallas doubled the lead with a crisp shot after Leighton Baines' cross.\nBaines had also been instrumental in the first goal, Terry getting his feet into an awful tangle while attempting to clear his cross.\nCosta comfortably rounded Howard to make it 2-1 after Phil Jagielka failed to deal with a long ball forward by Fabregas, who made it 2-2 with a deflected shot which deceived Howard.\nCosta worry for Chelsea\nThere are signs Costa could be returning to his best form. The Spain international has five goals in his last four league and cup outings, but is he facing a spell on the sidelines?\nHe was involved in a couple of minor rows with Everton players after Chelsea fell 2-0 behind but he launched his side's fightback after a determined run which ended in him beating Howard and rolling the ball home.\nHowever, the Spaniard missed a great chance at 2-2 from six yards out and then limped off with a shin injury after a foul and went to hospital. Chelsea's interim boss Guus Hiddink will be hoping he will be back on his feet sooner rather than later.\nChelsea turning into draw specialists\nChelsea started the day six points above the relegation zone and with Hiddink warning that the threat of relegation was hanging over the club.\nWhile Terry's dramatic late goal sparked jubilant scenes at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea will be just four points above the relegation places should Swansea win at home to Watford on Monday.\nThis was their fourth draw in five Premier League games since Hiddink returned to Stamford Bridge last month. The Blues are still without a home league win under the interim manager and have conceded five goals in the last two games.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea)\nWhat the managers said\nChelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink: \"I took some risks [at 2-0 down] and it paid off in a spectacular way. The team is very resilient.\n\"Of course I'm not happy with the goals conceded but very happy with the attitude.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"It's a difficult game to analyse. When we were 2-0 up we would have liked to have controlled the game more. We deserved the three points.\n\"We were part of an exciting game of football. Once we got a 2-0 lead it became a little bit too open.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nRoberto Martinez managed his 250th Premier League game, becoming the 21st manager to reach this landmark in the competition.\nJohn Terry made his 700th appearance for Chelsea in all competitions.\nTerry has now registered four Premier League own-goals for Chelsea, more than any other player for the club.\nTerry is the third player to score at both ends in a Premier League game this season, after Troy Deeney v Manchester United and Olivier Giroud v Sunderland.\nTerry's goal (97 minutes 53 seconds) was the latest scored in a Premier League game since Yakubu's for Blackburn vs. Wigan (98:14) in November 2011.\nKevin Mirallas has scored three goals in his last five appearances for Everton in all competitions after netting just once in his previous 15 for the club.\nDiego Costa has scored five goals in his five appearances under Guus Hiddink this season.\nCesc Fabregas' goal was his first in the Premier League since he scored against QPR on 12 April 2015, ending a drought of 1,991 goalless minutes.\nSince 28 November, Everton have dropped a league-high 11 points from leading positions in nine Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea have a full week to recover before making the journey across London to face leaders Arsenal on 24 January (16:00 GMT). On the same day, Everton host Martinez's former club Swansea City (13:30 GMT)."

Wenger has lost five and drawn six of eleven league meetings with his old adversary.\nAnd yet it was the same old story for Arsenal as the frustration of their players and fans inside the Emirates reached boiling point long before the final whistle.\nThere was no shortage of spirit and endeavour from Arsenal in the face of the numerical disadvantage inflicted on them after Mertesacker's early red card.\nIf anything, it was inspiration and a little self-belief Arsenal lacked against a side that looked physically stronger in a game where Wenger's side was missing a warrior who could get in and among the visitors in those exchanges.\nTheir best effort of the match fell to Mathieu Flamini who attempted to convert Aaron Ramsey's through-ball with a kung-fu kick, where a header might have been more appropriate.\nThe result is hardly a terminal blow to Arsenal's ambitions but a wound inflicted in familiar fashion. It now remains to be seen how much of an after-effect there is.\nCosta revival sparks Chelsea\nDiego Costa suffered the abuse of Chelsea's fans in the aftermath of Jose Mourinho's sacking as they regarded his poor form and attitude as a key factor in the sacking of \"The Special One\".\nThe relationship is repaired now, with Costa regaining that mixture of marksmanship and menace that made him so significant in last season's Premier League title win.\nCosta's near-post finish from Ivanovic's delivery was his sixth in eight games since Mourinho left - and it was not just that quality that helped Chelsea look much more like their old selves.\nHe got under the skin of Arsenal's players and fans, although he could hardly be blamed for his involvement in Mertesacker's red card when he was unceremoniously bundled over as he tried to race clear.\nCosta departed to the resounding jeers of Arsenal's fans and cheers of Chelsea's supporters when he was replaced by Loic Remy after 68 minutes - job done and proof Hiddink's side are so much more effective when the Premier League's pantomime villain is on song.\nSanchez key to Arsenal title hopes\nHaving talked about the lack of warriors in Arsenal's line-up, one look at Alexis Sanchez back in action shows how he can fit the bill.\nThe huge roar that swirled around the Emirates when he emerged after 57 minutes to replace Joel Campbell was not simply out of a growing desperation as Arsenal struggled against Chelsea - it was a signal that so much of the rest of the Gunners' season rests on the shoulders of the world-class Chilean.\nIt was his first appearance since sustaining a hamstring injury at Norwich City on 29 November and it was understandable he looked a little rusty, but the strength, perseverance and sheer force of will to influence a game were still in evidence in this cameo.\nThis was a major setback for Arsenal's title hopes - but the return of Sanchez confirms all is not lost if they keep him fit.\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal have now gone nine hours and 32 minutes without a Premier League goal against Chelsea\nChelsea are unbeaten in nine Premier League meetings with Arsenal (W6 D3)\nCosta has scored six goals in six games under Guus Hiddink (all competitions)\nChelsea have won back-to-back Premier League away games for the first time this season\nThe Blues are on the current longest unbeaten run in the Premier League (W3 D4)\nThe Gunners have failed to score in consecutive league games for the first time since August 2012\nWhat next?\nThe Gunners are at home to Burnley in the FA Cup next weekend, and the Blues are away at the MK Dons in the same competition.",

They have now gone eight hours and 26 minutes without scoring in the first 45 minutes of games at Old Trafford.\nVan Gaal's side are now five points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who won 3-1 at Crystal Palace on Saturday.\nSouthampton are now just four points and three league places behind United, having won their past three matches. The win also ends a four-match losing streak away from St Mary's for Ronald Koeman's team.\nFollow all of Saturday's post-match reaction here\nRelive Saturday's action from Old Trafford\nFootball Daily Podcast: Premier League round-up\nAustin's dream debut\nSouthampton paid QPR just \u00a34m to sign Austin on 16 January - a figure more representative of the length of time left on his contract with the Championship club than his ability.\nIn the 2014-15 season, the striker scored 18 Premier League goals, then added 10 in 16 Championship matches prior to his move back to the top flight.\nAnd it took him just seven minutes to pick up where he left off as he found space in the box to meet fellow substitute James Ward-Prowse's free-kick and bury a header past David de Gea.\nPrior to that, the Saints were comfortable, working hard to disrupt United's rhythm, managing possession well and looking to hit on the break.\nThey produced the best of what were few chances in the game, but Sadio Mane fluffed a shot from the edge of the box and Shane Long and Victor Wanyama headed wide from successive corners.\nTame United fail to threaten\nUnited came into the game off the back of two encouraging performances - an improved attacking display at Newcastle and a confidence-boosting win at Liverpool.\nBut they were unable to build on those, producing a tame 90 minutes strewn with errors and completely lacking in speed of thought or movement.\nIt made Southampton's containment job an easy one and left them vulnerable to the kind of late sting they had inflicted at Anfield last Sunday.\nVan Gaal and his team were booed off at the end of a first half in which Saints keeper Fraser Forster was only tested once - from an optimistic 40-yard shot from Daley Blind - and Wayne Rooney, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard all shot woefully wide.\nThe jeers and abuse were far more ferocious at the end of a second half that United began more encouragingly following the introduction of Juan Mata, but quickly faded after Southampton had seen off their initial charge.\nIs this the end?\nThe defeat is sure to intensify the pressure on Van Gaal.\nThe 64-year-old had suggested last week's win at Liverpool could be \"fantastic starting point\" for his side in 2016, but he has now led United to their lowest ever Premier League points tally (37) after 23 games.\nAfter the match, the Dutchman admitted that the home supporters were right to boo, adding: \"In better or worse we have to stick together.\n\"You have to meet expectation and expectations are very high, that gives a lot of pressure for the players.\n\"We are working very hard but we have a lot of injuries. That you cannot change.\"\nMan of the match - Victor Wanyama\nThe stats you need to know...\nSouthampton have won back-to-back away games at Old Trafford against Man United for the first time since 1969.\nCharlie Austin has scored four times in his last five league games. It was his first Premier League goal since the final day of last season, meaning he's scored in back-to-back Premier League games.\nOld Trafford has seen just three first half goals scored in 11 Premier League games this season; fewer than any other stadium. Only one of those has been scored by a United player (Memphis v Sunderland).\nUnited have managed just one shot on target in their last two home league games to Southampton.\nWhat they said...\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I had a feeling they could score only from a set-play. Our defence in set-plays was weaker because I changed Fellaini and had to change Darmian. Every change was a weakness in defence.\n\"I wanted to win this game and that's why I changed Cameron Borthwick-Jackson for Adnan Januzaj. That is a risk you take, it was a poor game and we didn't create so much and neither did our opponent.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"We played very good. Our organisation was good, we were very compact, we had good pressing.\n\"We stayed in the game, controlled the game and you saw more nerves in the Man Utd team and finally we score from a corner kick.\n\"We showed spirit today, it was an amazing result for the second time here.\"\nWhat next?\nManchester United are away at Championship side Derby in the fourth round of the FA Cup next Friday evening. Southampton's next match is in the league - a tough trip to Arsenal on Tuesday, 2 February."

In front of them, N'Golo Kante's vigour epitomised the team's performance.\nDrinkwater's effort was their first from outside the box this season, while Vardy netted his first goal in six league games, before Ulloa struck after sublime skills from Riyad Mahrez.\nLeicester's record of one defeat in their last 16 league games will be firmly put to the test in their next three matches against Liverpool, title rivals Arsenal and Manchester City - games which will define whether they are title pretenders.\nOne eye on the cup?\nStoke's problems lie in front of goal, having not scored in nine of their 23 league games this season.

It's really difficult looking for glasses without glasses.\"\nCatch your breath\nThe contrast in emotion on the touchline was as pronounced as anything the season has delivered so far and Norwich will have to recover before Tuesday's trip to Tottenham.\nTheir record now stands at 32 Premier League games without a win in matches where they have fallen behind - but having been 3-1 up, few will sting like this.\nThe first five shots on target in this game found the net and neither side could claim to have deserved a win, with each guilty of lapses which at times led to chaos and resulted in just the fourth 5-4 result in Premier League history.\nRussell Martin will feel worse than most after gifting Milner the chance to put Liverpool 4-3 up with a weak, blind backpass.\nAnd though Bassong's crisp strike from 20 yards appeared to have reprieved his fellow defender, substitute Lallana's first league goal of the season capped a frenzied finish.\nReds must buy to relieve the stress\nThe Reds are four points worse off than at this stage last season but could this win be a catalyst for a spell of consistency and a move higher than seventh place?\nOne wonders what reception Liverpool's players would have got from Klopp had it stayed 4-4, such was his demeanour, and his side masked some common inefficiencies in taking three points.\nMbokani's brilliant back-heeled finish arrived after failing to clear a corner, meaning the Reds have conceded eight goals from corners this season - a league high.\nTheir passing - at 75% accuracy - was not at its best, their defending was sometimes rash but they found key goals, despite having scored fewer times than relegation-threatened Sunderland before kick-off.\nMuch has been made of the need to sign a striker but after such a result, neglecting their defensive issues seems a big risk for Klopp who will surely be keen to have less stressful afternoons in the dugout.\nPain comes from the back\n\"When you concede five goals you deserve to lose the game,\" concluded Norwich boss Alex Neil after the match.\nThe Scot admitted defensive errors have been his side's \"downfall\" this season and the 43 goals they have leaked in 23 games paints a damning picture - and only Sunderland (45) have let in more.\nHowever, the performance of Naismith at the other end does offer something positive to take forward.\nMaking his debut alongside full-back Ivo Pinto - who had a tough afternoon - Naismith showed quality throughout.\nHe managed 18 goals in 52 league starts at Everton but may need to adopt the role of talisman rather than impact substitute at Norwich if they are to survive.\nThat said, they have now conceded 11 goals in three games - a stat which must improve if any Naismith contribution is to prove telling.\nMan of the match - Roberto Firmino\nThe stats you need to know\nSteven Naismith has now scored his first Premier League goal for both Everton and Norwich against Liverpool.\nLiverpool have conceded from their first shot on target faced in all four of their Premier League games in 2016.\nThe Canaries have conceded a league-high 21 Premier League goals in the last half hour of games this season, six more than any other team.\nThis is only the third time in Premier League history that Liverpool have recovered from two goals behind to win an away game - also against Manchester City in October 2008 and Fulham in October 2004.\nUp next\nNorwich travel to Tottenham in the Premier League on Tuesday and Liverpool will be in action at the same time as they try to protect their 1-0 League Cup semi-final first-leg lead against Stoke City."

I'm so proud of our team and Man City. There was everything in it. Four goals, chances, yellow cards and a penalty.\n\"We were a little bit disappointed, but I said to the players they shouldn't be. But if you are disappointed after playing Man City then that's good.\n\"We defended well and created many chances.\"\nMan City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It [a draw] was not what we wanted before the game.

In another situation we might be happy with a point but we need more points than that. We tried, we did our best, especially in the second half, but they defended well.\n\"If you see the team playing now, we look more like a team now than we used to. Players have the right attitude, but sometimes we miss talent or quality to score goals.\n\"Should Jordan Ayew have been awarded a first-half penalty? Maybe.\n\"I talked with the referee and he told me he didn't see it like that. Even without a penalty we created many chances and with more accuracy could have scored.\"\nWest Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis:\n\"We had to grind it out, it was a typical derby game, very ferocious, with effort and commitment. We've had eight games in four weeks and although people might be disappointed, the effort and commitment put in was first class.\n\"We need every point to maintain our Premier League status - and that's what we've done.\n\"I don't think Villa should have been given a penalty.

They were frustrated by a well-organised Palace team, who took a shock lead through Vertonghen's first-half own goal.\nBut three pieces of skill saw Spurs fight back for the win. Kane's header maintained a remarkable run of form that has now seen him score 12 times in his past 14 Premier League appearances.\nAlli, who is only 19, showed wonderful composure to take a touch 25 yards out, flick the ball back over his head to deceive Palace's Mile Jedinak, and then volley past Wayne Hennessey.\nA third goal, a stunning finish from Chadli, in the third minute of injury time made the match look a bit more comfortable then it was and was harsh on a battling home side.\nPalace's season continues to unravel\nIt is now six league games without a win for Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace, although they did manage to end one poor run as their goal was the side's first in 482 minutes - though it was scored by Tottenham's Vertonghen.\nHowever, Pardew can remain upbeat. With the score at 1-1 his side forced Hugo Lloris into a fine save to deny Wilfried Zaha.\nThe Eagles then hit the woodwork twice in a matter of seconds as Scott Dann headed Jason Puncheon's free-kick against the underside of the bar, before substitute Mile Jedinak also hit the crossbar with a shot on the turn.\nPalace's defeat sees them drop to 11th and Pardew thinks a new signing would lift their spirits. \"We're looking to bring a player in and there's no doubt about that,\" he said.\n\"The boys would like to see someone else enter the dressing room.\"\n'People will see that goal around the world'\nTottenham and England midfielder Dele Alli described his goal by saying: \"It was natural instinct. It was a great ball and I just took a touch and hit it,\" said the 19-year-old.\n\"It all came naturally. I didn't have time to think. I didn't know what to do in my celebration!\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"Dele Alli's goal was fantastic and it showed his quality. It is a goal that will be seen around the world on television.

We've gained a result from going a goal behind, and that shows a bit of character from the players. They overcame their fears and came back strongly.\n\"It's a precious point. We've showed a lot of nerve to come through our bad spell and if we continue like that we're going to be fine.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We dominated the early stages, we were in total control. Today was a real number nine's goal from Benik Afobe and he was a real handful.\n\"We just lost our grip. We craved the second goal, we were so on top, and the second goal eluded us.\n\"The pleasing thing is the resilience we showed in the second half. There are positives to take - we've only lost two games in 11 now. But today we were the dominant team and that's the disappointment.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland have conceded the most goals in the opening 15 minutes of games this season (eight) while Bournemouth have scored the most (nine).\nOnly Sergio Aguero (36) and Daryl Murphy (35) have more league goals in the top four tiers since the start of the 2014/15 season than Benik Afobe (34).\nVan Aanholt is the first Sunderland defender to score in back to back Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nSunderland host Manchester City on Tuesday, while Bournemouth visit Crystal Palace.",

I'm so proud of our team and Man City. There was everything in it. Four goals, chances, yellow cards and a penalty.\n\"We were a little bit disappointed, but I said to the players they shouldn't be. But if you are disappointed after playing Man City then that's good.\n\"We defended well and created many chances.\"\nMan City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It [a draw] was not what we wanted before the game.

They have now gone eight hours and 26 minutes without scoring in the first 45 minutes of games at Old Trafford.\nVan Gaal's side are now five points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who won 3-1 at Crystal Palace on Saturday.\nSouthampton are now just four points and three league places behind United, having won their past three matches. The win also ends a four-match losing streak away from St Mary's for Ronald Koeman's team.\nFollow all of Saturday's post-match reaction here\nRelive Saturday's action from Old Trafford\nFootball Daily Podcast: Premier League round-up\nAustin's dream debut\nSouthampton paid QPR just \u00a34m to sign Austin on 16 January - a figure more representative of the length of time left on his contract with the Championship club than his ability.\nIn the 2014-15 season, the striker scored 18 Premier League goals, then added 10 in 16 Championship matches prior to his move back to the top flight.\nAnd it took him just seven minutes to pick up where he left off as he found space in the box to meet fellow substitute James Ward-Prowse's free-kick and bury a header past David de Gea.\nPrior to that, the Saints were comfortable, working hard to disrupt United's rhythm, managing possession well and looking to hit on the break.\nThey produced the best of what were few chances in the game, but Sadio Mane fluffed a shot from the edge of the box and Shane Long and Victor Wanyama headed wide from successive corners.\nTame United fail to threaten\nUnited came into the game off the back of two encouraging performances - an improved attacking display at Newcastle and a confidence-boosting win at Liverpool.\nBut they were unable to build on those, producing a tame 90 minutes strewn with errors and completely lacking in speed of thought or movement.\nIt made Southampton's containment job an easy one and left them vulnerable to the kind of late sting they had inflicted at Anfield last Sunday.\nVan Gaal and his team were booed off at the end of a first half in which Saints keeper Fraser Forster was only tested once - from an optimistic 40-yard shot from Daley Blind - and Wayne Rooney, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard all shot woefully wide.\nThe jeers and abuse were far more ferocious at the end of a second half that United began more encouragingly following the introduction of Juan Mata, but quickly faded after Southampton had seen off their initial charge.\nIs this the end?\nThe defeat is sure to intensify the pressure on Van Gaal.\nThe 64-year-old had suggested last week's win at Liverpool could be \"fantastic starting point\" for his side in 2016, but he has now led United to their lowest ever Premier League points tally (37) after 23 games.\nAfter the match, the Dutchman admitted that the home supporters were right to boo, adding: \"In better or worse we have to stick together.\n\"You have to meet expectation and expectations are very high, that gives a lot of pressure for the players.\n\"We are working very hard but we have a lot of injuries. That you cannot change.\"\nMan of the match - Victor Wanyama\nThe stats you need to know...\nSouthampton have won back-to-back away games at Old Trafford against Man United for the first time since 1969.\nCharlie Austin has scored four times in his last five league games. It was his first Premier League goal since the final day of last season, meaning he's scored in back-to-back Premier League games.\nOld Trafford has seen just three first half goals scored in 11 Premier League games this season; fewer than any other stadium. Only one of those has been scored by a United player (Memphis v Sunderland).\nUnited have managed just one shot on target in their last two home league games to Southampton.\nWhat they said...\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I had a feeling they could score only from a set-play. Our defence in set-plays was weaker because I changed Fellaini and had to change Darmian. Every change was a weakness in defence.\n\"I wanted to win this game and that's why I changed Cameron Borthwick-Jackson for Adnan Januzaj. That is a risk you take, it was a poor game and we didn't create so much and neither did our opponent.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"We played very good.

In front of them, N'Golo Kante's vigour epitomised the team's performance.\nDrinkwater's effort was their first from outside the box this season, while Vardy netted his first goal in six league games, before Ulloa struck after sublime skills from Riyad Mahrez.\nLeicester's record of one defeat in their last 16 league games will be firmly put to the test in their next three matches against Liverpool, title rivals Arsenal and Manchester City - games which will define whether they are title pretenders.\nOne eye on the cup?\nStoke's problems lie in front of goal, having not scored in nine of their 23 league games this season. Striker Bojan was kept on the bench, perhaps with their League Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool on Tuesday in mind.\nThey managed just two shots on target against the Foxes, with neither effort testing goalkeeper Schmeichel, who had an easy afternoon.\nPlaymaker Xherdan Shaqiri was kept quiet and things were made worse when skipper Ryan Shawcross hobbled off with an injury in the first half.\nWithout their leader at the back, Stoke's hopes of finishing in a European spot were dented as they drop to ninth in the table.\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante\nWhat they said:\nLeicester City boss Claudio Ranieri: \"Nobody can believe it.

They were frustrated by a well-organised Palace team, who took a shock lead through Vertonghen's first-half own goal.\nBut three pieces of skill saw Spurs fight back for the win. Kane's header maintained a remarkable run of form that has now seen him score 12 times in his past 14 Premier League appearances.\nAlli, who is only 19, showed wonderful composure to take a touch 25 yards out, flick the ball back over his head to deceive Palace's Mile Jedinak, and then volley past Wayne Hennessey.\nA third goal, a stunning finish from Chadli, in the third minute of injury time made the match look a bit more comfortable then it was and was harsh on a battling home side.\nPalace's season continues to unravel\nIt is now six league games without a win for Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace, although they did manage to end one poor run as their goal was the side's first in 482 minutes - though it was scored by Tottenham's Vertonghen.\nHowever, Pardew can remain upbeat. With the score at 1-1 his side forced Hugo Lloris into a fine save to deny Wilfried Zaha.\nThe Eagles then hit the woodwork twice in a matter of seconds as Scott Dann headed Jason Puncheon's free-kick against the underside of the bar, before substitute Mile Jedinak also hit the crossbar with a shot on the turn.\nPalace's defeat sees them drop to 11th and Pardew thinks a new signing would lift their spirits. \"We're looking to bring a player in and there's no doubt about that,\" he said.\n\"The boys would like to see someone else enter the dressing room.\"\n'People will see that goal around the world'\nTottenham and England midfielder Dele Alli described his goal by saying: \"It was natural instinct. It was a great ball and I just took a touch and hit it,\" said the 19-year-old.\n\"It all came naturally. I didn't have time to think. I didn't know what to do in my celebration!\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"Dele Alli's goal was fantastic and it showed his quality. It is a goal that will be seen around the world on television. We knew he was a player of unbelievable potential, but today he showed unbelievable maturity and quality.\"\nTottenham striker Harry Kane: \"I've never scored a goal like that and I haven't seen one as good as that for a long time.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: \"It was horrible to watch, and I don't often say that about a beautiful goal. As soon as he flicked the ball over his head I feared the worst. It was a great moment for him and he is a great talent.\"\nMan of the match - Dele Alli (Tottenham)\nWhat they said\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: \"We wouldn't have lost the game if it hadn't been for their goalkeeper. At 1-1 he made two great saves and it was just not our day.\n\"Wilfried Zaha was a problem for them and on another day we could've won this game.\n\"We haven't done much wrong, but they have great individual talent and they won it with a couple of special moments.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"After the first half I was a bit disappointed but we sorted out some problems and with the maturity we showed in the second half we fully deserved the win.\n\"After 95 minutes the result was fair. It was a fantastic performance.\n\"We have the youngest squad in the Premier League, but the way the players showed their maturity it looked like the oldest.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nCrystal Palace have won just two of their past 10 matches against Tottenham in all competitions (won two, drawn two, lost six).\nPalace have won just four of their 12 home league matches this season.\nTottenham are now unbeaten in 11 matches away from home in the Premier League.\nTottenham have won 14 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season; more than any other team.\nWhat next?\nIt is FA Cup fourth-round action next up for both of these sides.

We've gained a result from going a goal behind, and that shows a bit of character from the players. They overcame their fears and came back strongly.\n\"It's a precious point. We've showed a lot of nerve to come through our bad spell and if we continue like that we're going to be fine.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We dominated the early stages, we were in total control. Today was a real number nine's goal from Benik Afobe and he was a real handful.\n\"We just lost our grip. We craved the second goal, we were so on top, and the second goal eluded us.\n\"The pleasing thing is the resilience we showed in the second half. There are positives to take - we've only lost two games in 11 now. But today we were the dominant team and that's the disappointment.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland have conceded the most goals in the opening 15 minutes of games this season (eight) while Bournemouth have scored the most (nine).\nOnly Sergio Aguero (36) and Daryl Murphy (35) have more league goals in the top four tiers since the start of the 2014/15 season than Benik Afobe (34).\nVan Aanholt is the first Sunderland defender to score in back to back Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nSunderland host Manchester City on Tuesday, while Bournemouth visit Crystal Palace."

In another situation we might be happy with a point but we need more points than that. We tried, we did our best, especially in the second half, but they defended well.\n\"If you see the team playing now, we look more like a team now than we used to. Players have the right attitude, but sometimes we miss talent or quality to score goals.\n\"Should Jordan Ayew have been awarded a first-half penalty? Maybe.\n\"I talked with the referee and he told me he didn't see it like that. Even without a penalty we created many chances and with more accuracy could have scored.\"\nWest Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis:\n\"We had to grind it out, it was a typical derby game, very ferocious, with effort and commitment. We've had eight games in four weeks and although people might be disappointed, the effort and commitment put in was first class.\n\"We need every point to maintain our Premier League status - and that's what we've done.\n\"I don't think Villa should have been given a penalty. Jonas Olsson might have touched him, but the ball is rolling out and the lad's gone down too easily.\"\nWhat's next?\nA break from the Premier League. Both teams will now prepare for FA Cup home ties next weekend, with Albion hosting League One side Peterborough and Villa entertaining Manchester City.\nStats of the day\nVilla's tally of 15 shots is their highest number in a Premier League away game this season\nWest Brom had only four shots, equalling their lowest tally at the Hawthorns this season\nThe Baggies have failed to have a shot on target in four Premier League games this season - more than any other team\nVilla have kept two clean sheets in their last three Premier League games after keeping two in their previous 20\nVilla have made the joint third worst start to a Premier League season after 23 games - the only side to stay up with 13 points at this stage was West Brom in 2004-05",

His under-hit back-pass allowed Ayew to nip in and draw a foul from Tim Howard for the penalty, then his sliding attempt to block the Ghana forward's shot took it past the keeper for the second.\nSwansea rode their luck on occasion as Everton went in search of an equaliser after the break, but they showed discipline and determination that will stand them in good stead for a relegation battle.\nEverton their own worst enemy\nEverton were on the wrong end of a couple of referee decisions on Sunday - a handball by Ashley Williams to set up the move from which Ayew scored Swansea's second and a dismissed claim for a penalty when Neil Taylor blocked Coleman's cross with his arm.\nThey were also unlucky to suffer two injuries in the first half, which deprived them of Kevin Mirallas and Muhamed Besic, who had hit the post with the first shot of the game.\nUltimately, though, the home side have only themselves to blame for their failure to gain at least a point from the game.\nStones' error and misfortune helped the Swans score their goals, while the Toffees' own wastefulness prevented them adding to their leveller, which found the far corner of the net off Cork after Barry had flicked on a Deulofeu corner.\nSpanish winger Deulofeu delivered several crosses from the right that his team-mates were unable to convert, Romelu Lukaku twice headed over and Coleman dragged a shot wide before somehow side-footing over from just a few yards out in the final minute of added time.\nMan of the match - Andre Ayew\nManager reaction\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We were very slow in our performance - pedestrian - but two aspects affected our momentum which was the two injuries.\n\"The first half and second half performance were very contrasting.\n\"We created enough chances to win the game. The fearful aspect of our performance was a real shame.\"\nSwansea manager Francesco Guidolin: \"Six points in two matches is very important for us because the table was not good.\n\"Now it is not very good. I hope to have the possibility to go up in the table.\n\"In this moment I am very happy. This is the first match in Premier League for me. I dreamed of working in Premier League but I didn't dream of winning the first match.\n\"I must understand what happens in this day because I am surprised. It is new for me.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea won their first ever league match against Everton, at the 22nd attempt (D8 L13).\nGoodison Park has now seen 46 Premier League goals this season, more than any other ground.\nTim Howard has given away the most penalties in the Premier League since August 2013 (5, level with Jose Fonte).\nThe Swans picked up their first away win in six Premier League games (D1 L4).\nFrancesco Guidolin emulated Michael Laudrup and Garry Monk by winning his first Premier League game in charge of the Swans.\nFour of Gylfi Sigurdsson's five Premier League goals this season have come from a set-piece situation (3 penalties, 1 direct free-kick).\nWhat next?\nEverton have a cup double next. They are in Capital Cup action, taking a 2-1 lead to Manchester City for the second leg of the semi-final on Wednesday before then going to Carlisle in the fourth round of the FA Cup next Sunday.\nSwansea travel to West Brom - who are now just three points above them - for another big Premier League fixture on Tuesday, 2 February."

The 26-year-old checked his run before latching onto Deeney's pass and rounding keeper Rob Elliot to score.\nThe Magpies started with Aleksandar Mitrovic in attack - their \u00a313m summer signing, who arrived to a fanfare from Anderlecht, but has repeatedly misfired.\nIn the first half, he found himself one-on-one with the final defender but did not have a guile to pass him. He also had another sidefoot effort saved by the foot of Heurelho Gomes.\nWhile Ighalo would have blocked those missed chances from his mind, Mitrovic retreated into his shell after the break. It's now only four goals in 25 matches for the Serb.\nThe Magpies might need to spend again on a striker.\n'We've got to get it right at both ends'\nThat is what Newcastle head coach Steve McClaren said after the match.\nBut this is a club who have spent about \u00a380m in two transfer windows, so why is there still a problem in attack and defence?\nAside from Mitrovic, another summer signing midfielder Florian Thauvin has been a flop, while 21-year-old central defender Chancel Mbemba has barely had time to find his feet after been given the task of partnering Fabricio Coloccini, whose form has been inconsistent. The Argentine was at fault for Ighalo's goal today.\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores brought in 16 players in the summer, and has managed to produce a side who look as if they have played with each other for several seasons.\nThe Hornets will be glad to have ended their winless run, and are now only five points off fifth. With this spirited team, Flores will fancy his chances of finishing in a European spot.\nMan of the match - Odion Ighalo (Watford)\nManager reaction\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We played very well - it was an energetic team. It was difficult against Newcastle.\n\"It was a crucial match during the season - Newcastle are trying to avoid the same position as us [relegation].

The two goals really killed us. It's disappointing - we fought and came back. We threw everything at them - it wasn't our day.\n\"We talked about focus and the first 10 minutes being important - [referring to the first goal]. The second goal was from an aimless cross into the box. We then had a mountain to climb.\n\"Apart from the two goals - the performance was terrific. We've got to get it right at both ends.

Wenger has lost five and drawn six of eleven league meetings with his old adversary.\nAnd yet it was the same old story for Arsenal as the frustration of their players and fans inside the Emirates reached boiling point long before the final whistle.\nThere was no shortage of spirit and endeavour from Arsenal in the face of the numerical disadvantage inflicted on them after Mertesacker's early red card.\nIf anything, it was inspiration and a little self-belief Arsenal lacked against a side that looked physically stronger in a game where Wenger's side was missing a warrior who could get in and among the visitors in those exchanges.\nTheir best effort of the match fell to Mathieu Flamini who attempted to convert Aaron Ramsey's through-ball with a kung-fu kick, where a header might have been more appropriate.\nThe result is hardly a terminal blow to Arsenal's ambitions but a wound inflicted in familiar fashion. It now remains to be seen how much of an after-effect there is.\nCosta revival sparks Chelsea\nDiego Costa suffered the abuse of Chelsea's fans in the aftermath of Jose Mourinho's sacking as they regarded his poor form and attitude as a key factor in the sacking of \"The Special One\".\nThe relationship is repaired now, with Costa regaining that mixture of marksmanship and menace that made him so significant in last season's Premier League title win.\nCosta's near-post finish from Ivanovic's delivery was his sixth in eight games since Mourinho left - and it was not just that quality that helped Chelsea look much more like their old selves.\nHe got under the skin of Arsenal's players and fans, although he could hardly be blamed for his involvement in Mertesacker's red card when he was unceremoniously bundled over as he tried to race clear.\nCosta departed to the resounding jeers of Arsenal's fans and cheers of Chelsea's supporters when he was replaced by Loic Remy after 68 minutes - job done and proof Hiddink's side are so much more effective when the Premier League's pantomime villain is on song.\nSanchez key to Arsenal title hopes\nHaving talked about the lack of warriors in Arsenal's line-up, one look at Alexis Sanchez back in action shows how he can fit the bill.\nThe huge roar that swirled around the Emirates when he emerged after 57 minutes to replace Joel Campbell was not simply out of a growing desperation as Arsenal struggled against Chelsea - it was a signal that so much of the rest of the Gunners' season rests on the shoulders of the world-class Chilean.\nIt was his first appearance since sustaining a hamstring injury at Norwich City on 29 November and it was understandable he looked a little rusty, but the strength, perseverance and sheer force of will to influence a game were still in evidence in this cameo.\nThis was a major setback for Arsenal's title hopes - but the return of Sanchez confirms all is not lost if they keep him fit.\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal have now gone nine hours and 32 minutes without a Premier League goal against Chelsea\nChelsea are unbeaten in nine Premier League meetings with Arsenal (W6 D3)\nCosta has scored six goals in six games under Guus Hiddink (all competitions)\nChelsea have won back-to-back Premier League away games for the first time this season\nThe Blues are on the current longest unbeaten run in the Premier League (W3 D4)\nThe Gunners have failed to score in consecutive league games for the first time since August 2012\nWhat next?\nThe Gunners are at home to Burnley in the FA Cup next weekend, and the Blues are away at the MK Dons in the same competition."

His under-hit back-pass allowed Ayew to nip in and draw a foul from Tim Howard for the penalty, then his sliding attempt to block the Ghana forward's shot took it past the keeper for the second.\nSwansea rode their luck on occasion as Everton went in search of an equaliser after the break, but they showed discipline and determination that will stand them in good stead for a relegation battle.\nEverton their own worst enemy\nEverton were on the wrong end of a couple of referee decisions on Sunday - a handball by Ashley Williams to set up the move from which Ayew scored Swansea's second and a dismissed claim for a penalty when Neil Taylor blocked Coleman's cross with his arm.\nThey were also unlucky to suffer two injuries in the first half, which deprived them of Kevin Mirallas and Muhamed Besic, who had hit the post with the first shot of the game.\nUltimately, though, the home side have only themselves to blame for their failure to gain at least a point from the game.\nStones' error and misfortune helped the Swans score their goals, while the Toffees' own wastefulness prevented them adding to their leveller, which found the far corner of the net off Cork after Barry had flicked on a Deulofeu corner.\nSpanish winger Deulofeu delivered several crosses from the right that his team-mates were unable to convert, Romelu Lukaku twice headed over and Coleman dragged a shot wide before somehow side-footing over from just a few yards out in the final minute of added time.\nMan of the match - Andre Ayew\nManager reaction\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We were very slow in our performance - pedestrian - but two aspects affected our momentum which was the two injuries.\n\"The first half and second half performance were very contrasting.\n\"We created enough chances to win the game. The fearful aspect of our performance was a real shame.\"\nSwansea manager Francesco Guidolin: \"Six points in two matches is very important for us because the table was not good.\n\"Now it is not very good. I hope to have the possibility to go up in the table.\n\"In this moment I am very happy. This is the first match in Premier League for me. I dreamed of working in Premier League but I didn't dream of winning the first match.\n\"I must understand what happens in this day because I am surprised. It is new for me.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea won their first ever league match against Everton, at the 22nd attempt (D8 L13).\nGoodison Park has now seen 46 Premier League goals this season, more than any other ground.\nTim Howard has given away the most penalties in the Premier League since August 2013 (5, level with Jose Fonte).\nThe Swans picked up their first away win in six Premier League games (D1 L4).\nFrancesco Guidolin emulated Michael Laudrup and Garry Monk by winning his first Premier League game in charge of the Swans.\nFour of Gylfi Sigurdsson's five Premier League goals this season have come from a set-piece situation (3 penalties, 1 direct free-kick).\nWhat next?\nEverton have a cup double next. They are in Capital Cup action, taking a 2-1 lead to Manchester City for the second leg of the semi-final on Wednesday before then going to Carlisle in the fourth round of the FA Cup next Sunday.\nSwansea travel to West Brom - who are now just three points above them - for another big Premier League fixture on Tuesday, 2 February.",

The 26-year-old checked his run before latching onto Deeney's pass and rounding keeper Rob Elliot to score.\nThe Magpies started with Aleksandar Mitrovic in attack - their \u00a313m summer signing, who arrived to a fanfare from Anderlecht, but has repeatedly misfired.\nIn the first half, he found himself one-on-one with the final defender but did not have a guile to pass him. He also had another sidefoot effort saved by the foot of Heurelho Gomes.\nWhile Ighalo would have blocked those missed chances from his mind, Mitrovic retreated into his shell after the break. It's now only four goals in 25 matches for the Serb.\nThe Magpies might need to spend again on a striker.\n'We've got to get it right at both ends'\nThat is what Newcastle head coach Steve McClaren said after the match.\nBut this is a club who have spent about \u00a380m in two transfer windows, so why is there still a problem in attack and defence?\nAside from Mitrovic, another summer signing midfielder Florian Thauvin has been a flop, while 21-year-old central defender Chancel Mbemba has barely had time to find his feet after been given the task of partnering Fabricio Coloccini, whose form has been inconsistent. The Argentine was at fault for Ighalo's goal today.\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores brought in 16 players in the summer, and has managed to produce a side who look as if they have played with each other for several seasons.\nThe Hornets will be glad to have ended their winless run, and are now only five points off fifth. With this spirited team, Flores will fancy his chances of finishing in a European spot.\nMan of the match - Odion Ighalo (Watford)\nManager reaction\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We played very well - it was an energetic team. It was difficult against Newcastle.\n\"It was a crucial match during the season - Newcastle are trying to avoid the same position as us [relegation]. We have got more of a gap to Newcastle now.\n\"Half time today is the period where we tried to correct things. It was important to score quick and then score the second goal.\n\"Deeney and Ighalo always play well. Today it was important to play Deeney, Ighalo and Jose Manuel Jurado together.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren: \"We started the game so well and looked in control. The two goals really killed us. It's disappointing - we fought and came back. We threw everything at them - it wasn't our day.\n\"We talked about focus and the first 10 minutes being important - [referring to the first goal]. The second goal was from an aimless cross into the box. We then had a mountain to climb.\n\"Apart from the two goals - the performance was terrific. We've got to get it right at both ends. We've had a tough Christmas. The last few results we've been growing and getting better. We lick our wounds and go again.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nIghalo's goal was the third quickest second half goal scored in the Premier League in 2015-16 (45:44)\nIghalo has scored seven goals in his last seven Premier League appearances at Vicarage Road\nDeeney has assisted six of Ighalo's Premier League goals this season - no player has assisted more for another player\nThe Magpies have scored just seven goals in their last 17 Premier League away matches.\nThis is the first time that Watford have conceded in a competitive home game this season and not lost (six matches).\nWhat next?\nThe Hornets are away to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup next weekend, while the Magpies are back in action on 3 February away at Everton."

Sunday's meeting with Leicester should provide an ideal environment to see if minds are on a future under Guardiola.\nHave Sunderland bought enough?\nSunderland manager Allardyce said he had to act in the January transfer window in order to battle the drop, and he gave debuts to signings Kone, and substitutes Dame N'Doye and Whabi Khazri.\nIn return he got what he says was the \"best performance since I've been here\".\nThe Black Cats have conceded more goals than anyone in the league, but Kone seemed to add some steel and should have levelled affairs when he headed wide while unmarked.\nAnother January acquisition Jan Kirchhoff impressed in a holding role - touching the ball more than anyone on the pitch - so on early inspection, supporters should feel buoyed by the new blood.\nIn contrast to their usual issues at the back, it was at the other end where shortcomings were exposed. Chances largely fell to defensive players, with John O'Shea guiding an effort over from 10 yards late on.\nPerhaps most encouraging for home fans was the spirit and belief in their side as attacks flowed in a frantic finale, and Otamendi brilliantly blocked an N'Doye effort before clearing from the line.\nThe result may be in keeping with Sunderland's season but the display seemed to show the January window could prove a welcome turning point.\nMan of the match - Nicolas Otamendi\nManager reaction\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It was a tough game. This is a team who are fighting relegation. They will play every game like a final. It is not our style to play with nine defenders but it was our third game in a week and it was impossible to have a high pace with all our injuries. It was better to defend well and concentrate.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"We missed too many chances today and when you play a Manchester City side and have better chances than them, it shows the level of our performance. There's no result for us, the points aren't there, but the positives are. While this performance was the best since I've been here, we're in big trouble now when you look at the other results tonight.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis was Pellegrini's 100th Premier League match and his 65th win. Only Jose Mourinho (73) has won more of his opening 100.\nAguero has 12 goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances.\nCity picked up three yellow cards in second half injury time, two of them for time wasting.\nMan City had only six shots all game and only one in the second half. Six is their joint-lowest in a Premier League game this season.\nUp next?\nCity's home fixture with Leicester on Saturday lunchtime looks key as the title race enters its closing stages, while Sunderland know defeat when they host Liverpool hours later could see them slip further away from safety.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Leicester City 2-0 Liverpool\nJamie Vardy scored twice as Leicester beat Liverpool to stay three points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nThe England striker opened the scoring with a brilliant 25-yard strike over goalkeeper Simon Mignolet from Riyad Mahrez's long ball forward.\nAnd he sealed the victory when he turned home Shinji Okazaki's deflected shot from close range.\nThe Foxes fully deserved their victory, with Mignolet touching an Okazaki header onto the bar in the first half.\nFoxes move closer to history\nLeicester's title bid is unique in the Premier League age and with each victory, they move one game closer to winning their first ever top-flight title.\nThere was a feeling the next two weeks could define Leicester's season - this game against Liverpool is followed by trips to title rivals Manchester City and Arsenal.\nBut they came through the first of those three games in style. Vardy caught Mignolet off his line with his goal-of-the-season contender and then added a second 11 minutes later.\nThe Foxes had most of the game's big chances, Mignolet brilliantly denying a Mahrez curling strike as well as touching Okazaki's effort onto the crossbar. Moments before Vardy's second, the hosts should have had a penalty when Mamadou Sakho brought down Okazaki.\nFoxes midfielder Danny Drinkwater said: \"We're staying on the ground but if we carry on the way we are then why not have the belief [to win the league]? It would go down in history surely.\"\nHow man-of-the-match Vardy scored his goal\nVardy - who is set to sign a new three-and-a-half-year deal with the Foxes - had never scored a Premier League goal from outside the box with his first 21 top-flight attempts.\nHe let Mahrez's long ball bounce before smashing it over Mignolet. After the game he revealed he had seen the keeper stray off his line on previous occasions and decided to try his luck.\n'Goal sums his season up'\nLeicester midfielder Drinkwater told BBC Match of the Day: \"His first goal was incredible. You think he's going to square it but he hits it top corner. It sums his season up. He can turn an average ball into a great ball.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri said: \"Amazing. The first goal was unbelievable. Jamie is very fast and can create a lot but it was unbelievable how Mahrez found him and how he had the time to see the keeper out of the goal and score a fantastic goal.\"\nReds look out of form\nLiverpool, who are now eighth and 16 points off top, look a long way from the side who beat Manchester City 4-1 and Southampton 6-1 in November and December.\nWith Daniel Sturridge frequently injured and Christian Benteke out of favour, the Reds started with Roberto Firmino as their central forward but the Brazilian only had two efforts, one blocked and one off target.\nWhen BBC Match of the Day's Jonathan Pearce praised Liverpool's work ethic to Reds boss Jurgen Klopp, the German replied: \"It's rare a journalist says something more positive than the manager.\n\"I'm not too fine with our game today. We could have played much better. We had a few shots where we could pass and a few passes where we could shoot. We created half chances but not real chances. Today would have been a good day to show we are ready for this. I need a few more seconds to calm down. I have to watch it again.\"\nWhat's up next?\nLeicester's next game is their biggest of the season to date. They visit second-placed Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime, knowing they could either be knocked off top - or go six points clear.\n\"The team is in good condition,\" said Ranieri. \"Now it is important to recover the energy because we have to run a lot against Manchester City. We are free of pressure. The players have a good feeling.\"\nLiverpool are at home to second-from-bottom Sunderland.\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool prevented the opposition scoring with their first shot on target for the first time in 2016 in the Premier League.\nMahrez and Vardy have combined for seven Premier League goals this season - the joint most with Ozil/Giroud and Ighalo/Deeney.\nVardy has 18 league goals for the season, only one fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez.\nLeicester have 50 points, only five short of their all-time top-flight record total (55 in 1999-2000).\nLiverpool have conceded 13 goals in their past six Premier League away games."

Hopefully he gets back to full fitness.\"\nGuidolin getting to grips with Swans\nGuidolin has changed little in the way Swansea play during his two games in charge, as his side persisted with the possession football they have become known for.\nBut it was a forced change before half-time that put the Welsh club into the ascendancy, when a head injury to Ki Sung-yueng saw new signing Alberto Paloschi come on and make an instant impression.\nThe January arrival from Italian side Chievo, who made a name for himself as a 17-year-old by scoring 20 seconds into his AC Milan debut, added the power and hold-up play Swansea have often been lacking.\nHe forced the Swans' goal by hassling Baggies defender Gareth McAuley, who could only divert Leon Britton's pass into the path of Sigurdsson for the opener, and hit the post with his own effort minutes later.\nBut the late equaliser and the relinquishing of two points means Guidolin's side are placed precariously, just five points above the relegation zone.\nMan of the match - Alberto Paloschi\nWhat they said\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis:\n\"I think their keeper made some great saves and we had wonderful opportunities. Fletcher could have had four by himself.\n\"We're relieved we got something out of it but we really should have won the game.\n\"We're not on a bad run, the problem is we're not winning games, we're drawing games. We're a point closer to 40 points.\"\nSwansea boss Francesco Guidolin:\n\"At the beginning of the night 1-1 could be a good result but at the end I'm disappointed.\n\"My team played very well for all the match. I can look at the positives. We had a victory sensation but this is football.\n\"Paloschi is a good player and he played very well. I know his ambition and that he has quality. I hope he can score many goals for us.\"\nWhat's up next?\nBoth sides are in action again on Saturday, with West Brom travelling to relegation-threatened Newcastle and Swansea hosting Crystal Palace.\nThe stats you need to know\nGylfi Sigurdsson netted his fourth goal in five games and his seventh Premier League goal of the season for Swansea.\nSigurdsson has scored in three consecutive away league games for Swansea (three goals), as many goals as he had scored in his previous 13 away trips.\nThis is the first time in 10 Premier League meetings that there has been a draw between the sides.\nSalomon Rondon scored his first Premier League goal since October 2015, ending a run of nine games without a goal.\nSwansea conceded only their fourth goal in the final 15 minutes of a Premier League game this season, a joint Premier League low (alongside West Ham and Man City).\nThe Baggies are unbeaten in four Premier League games at the Hawthorns for the first time since February 2014 (six games)."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Leicester City 2-0 Liverpool\nJamie Vardy scored twice as Leicester beat Liverpool to stay three points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nThe England striker opened the scoring with a brilliant 25-yard strike over goalkeeper Simon Mignolet from Riyad Mahrez's long ball forward.\nAnd he sealed the victory when he turned home Shinji Okazaki's deflected shot from close range.\nThe Foxes fully deserved their victory, with Mignolet touching an Okazaki header onto the bar in the first half.\nFoxes move closer to history\nLeicester's title bid is unique in the Premier League age and with each victory, they move one game closer to winning their first ever top-flight title.\nThere was a feeling the next two weeks could define Leicester's season - this game against Liverpool is followed by trips to title rivals Manchester City and Arsenal.\nBut they came through the first of those three games in style. Vardy caught Mignolet off his line with his goal-of-the-season contender and then added a second 11 minutes later.\nThe Foxes had most of the game's big chances, Mignolet brilliantly denying a Mahrez curling strike as well as touching Okazaki's effort onto the crossbar. Moments before Vardy's second, the hosts should have had a penalty when Mamadou Sakho brought down Okazaki.\nFoxes midfielder Danny Drinkwater said: \"We're staying on the ground but if we carry on the way we are then why not have the belief [to win the league]? It would go down in history surely.\"\nHow man-of-the-match Vardy scored his goal\nVardy - who is set to sign a new three-and-a-half-year deal with the Foxes - had never scored a Premier League goal from outside the box with his first 21 top-flight attempts.\nHe let Mahrez's long ball bounce before smashing it over Mignolet. After the game he revealed he had seen the keeper stray off his line on previous occasions and decided to try his luck.\n'Goal sums his season up'\nLeicester midfielder Drinkwater told BBC Match of the Day: \"His first goal was incredible. You think he's going to square it but he hits it top corner. It sums his season up. He can turn an average ball into a great ball.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri said: \"Amazing. The first goal was unbelievable. Jamie is very fast and can create a lot but it was unbelievable how Mahrez found him and how he had the time to see the keeper out of the goal and score a fantastic goal.\"\nReds look out of form\nLiverpool, who are now eighth and 16 points off top, look a long way from the side who beat Manchester City 4-1 and Southampton 6-1 in November and December.\nWith Daniel Sturridge frequently injured and Christian Benteke out of favour, the Reds started with Roberto Firmino as their central forward but the Brazilian only had two efforts, one blocked and one off target.\nWhen BBC Match of the Day's Jonathan Pearce praised Liverpool's work ethic to Reds boss Jurgen Klopp, the German replied: \"It's rare a journalist says something more positive than the manager.\n\"I'm not too fine with our game today. We could have played much better. We had a few shots where we could pass and a few passes where we could shoot. We created half chances but not real chances. Today would have been a good day to show we are ready for this. I need a few more seconds to calm down. I have to watch it again.\"\nWhat's up next?\nLeicester's next game is their biggest of the season to date. They visit second-placed Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime, knowing they could either be knocked off top - or go six points clear.\n\"The team is in good condition,\" said Ranieri. \"Now it is important to recover the energy because we have to run a lot against Manchester City. We are free of pressure. The players have a good feeling.\"\nLiverpool are at home to second-from-bottom Sunderland.\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool prevented the opposition scoring with their first shot on target for the first time in 2016 in the Premier League.\nMahrez and Vardy have combined for seven Premier League goals this season - the joint most with Ozil/Giroud and Ighalo/Deeney.\nVardy has 18 league goals for the season, only one fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez.\nLeicester have 50 points, only five short of their all-time top-flight record total (55 in 1999-2000).\nLiverpool have conceded 13 goals in their past six Premier League away games.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Sunderland 0-1 Manchester City\nManchester City responded to the news of manager Manuel Pellegrini's summer departure with a hard-earned win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.\nPellegrini - who will be replaced by Pep Guardiola - saw Sergio Aguero gather a deflected cross to coolly finish with the outside of his foot.\nSunderland rallied, debutant Lamine Kone heading wide before Billy Jones hit the post just before the break.\nJones forced a Joe Hart save late on as City - sluggish on the night - held on.\nRelive how City edged out Sunderland\nListen: How Pep almost played for City\nThey remain three points adrift of leaders Leicester City, while Sunderland stay four points from safety in 19th.\nSam Allardyce's side can, however, take pride in their display, and only a Nicolas Otamendi header on the goal line in injury time denied them a deserved point.\nThe Pep effect\nCity's backs-to-the wall display in the second half was surprising for a team unbeaten in six league games before kick-off.\nThe home side had more possession after the break and played the game almost entirely in the away half as City looked happy to take what Aguero's well-taken effort had earned them.\nSo was this a City hangover from Monday's news of Pellegrini's future exit? \"We're here to win titles,\" said City keeper Hart afterwards. \"Yesterday's news was never going to be a distraction.\"\nHart's key save from Jermain Defoe before the break saw Jones strike the woodwork from the follow up as Sunderland seized momentum in the match.\nThey ran 6km further than Pellegrini's side and had five more shots on the night, falling short as they lacked a player with the instinct Aguero showcased.\nCity's attitude will remain under the microscope after a defiant, if somewhat unconvincing display. Sunday's meeting with Leicester should provide an ideal environment to see if minds are on a future under Guardiola.\nHave Sunderland bought enough?\nSunderland manager Allardyce said he had to act in the January transfer window in order to battle the drop, and he gave debuts to signings Kone, and substitutes Dame N'Doye and Whabi Khazri.\nIn return he got what he says was the \"best performance since I've been here\".\nThe Black Cats have conceded more goals than anyone in the league, but Kone seemed to add some steel and should have levelled affairs when he headed wide while unmarked.\nAnother January acquisition Jan Kirchhoff impressed in a holding role - touching the ball more than anyone on the pitch - so on early inspection, supporters should feel buoyed by the new blood.\nIn contrast to their usual issues at the back, it was at the other end where shortcomings were exposed. Chances largely fell to defensive players, with John O'Shea guiding an effort over from 10 yards late on.\nPerhaps most encouraging for home fans was the spirit and belief in their side as attacks flowed in a frantic finale, and Otamendi brilliantly blocked an N'Doye effort before clearing from the line.\nThe result may be in keeping with Sunderland's season but the display seemed to show the January window could prove a welcome turning point.\nMan of the match - Nicolas Otamendi\nManager reaction\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It was a tough game. This is a team who are fighting relegation. They will play every game like a final. It is not our style to play with nine defenders but it was our third game in a week and it was impossible to have a high pace with all our injuries. It was better to defend well and concentrate.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"We missed too many chances today and when you play a Manchester City side and have better chances than them, it shows the level of our performance. There's no result for us, the points aren't there, but the positives are. While this performance was the best since I've been here, we're in big trouble now when you look at the other results tonight.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis was Pellegrini's 100th Premier League match and his 65th win. Only Jose Mourinho (73) has won more of his opening 100.\nAguero has 12 goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances.\nCity picked up three yellow cards in second half injury time, two of them for time wasting.\nMan City had only six shots all game and only one in the second half. Six is their joint-lowest in a Premier League game this season.\nUp next?\nCity's home fixture with Leicester on Saturday lunchtime looks key as the title race enters its closing stages, while Sunderland know defeat when they host Liverpool hours later could see them slip further away from safety."

He departed to a deserved standing ovation with 11 minutes left.\nSome of United's work in the transfer market since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson has been justifiably criticised - not a bit of it with Martial.\nRelief at last for Van Gaal\nManchester United's 64-year-old manager has been a besieged figure this season, seemingly facing a crisis and an uncertain future on a weekly basis, scrutinised once more on Monday when neighbours Manchester City announced the world's most coveted coach, Pep Guardiola, would be joining them in the summer.\nHe received a subdued welcome as he made his way down the Old Trafford touchline to his technical area before kick-off, acknowledging a smattering of applause with a couple of waves.\nVan Gaal was able to make the return journey at the final whistle with cheers ringing around Old Trafford after their most impressive performance in months, a display designed to support his theory that things will eventually get better.\nIt has been a good few days for Van Gaal, with a potentially hazardous FA Cup fourth-round trip to Derby County safely negotiated last Friday and now this convincing victory.\nOld Trafford elated\nWhen Lingard stooped to head in Borthwick-Jackson's superb cross after 14 minutes, the roar that went around Old Trafford was tinged with relief and delight.\nHow United and Van Gaal needed that. The first groans of frustration had surfaced moments earlier when Chris Smalling drove into Stoke City's half but lost momentum because of lack of movement from his team-mates - but the pressure valve was released by Lingard's goal.\nOld Trafford was in buoyant mood for the rest of game, United's supporters able to sit back and enjoy their team exerting total control and playing with a fluency rarely seen this season.\nMan of the match - Anthony Martial\nWhat they said:\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"I think we have played in the first half attacking- wise very good. In the second half we were more controlling and we didn't give any chances away against a team like Stoke. That is remarkable because they always make it difficult.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We didn't start in the right manner. We conceded early on, were too passive and for the first goal we didn't get close enough to people. Avoiding going 1-0 down early on is what you talk about before coming to Old Trafford, and unfortunately we conceded another poor goal for the second.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester United travel to Chelsea on Sunday (16:00 kick-off), while Stoke host Everton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nThe stats you need to know:\nJesse Lingard scored Manchester United's first first-half goal at Old Trafford since they netted one against Wolfsburg in the Champions League in September 2015\nIt was the first time since April 2015 against Manchester City that the Red Devils had scored twice in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game at home\nWayne Rooney scored his 99th Premier League goal at Old Trafford\nRooney scored and provided an assist at Old Trafford in a Premier League game for the first time since Boxing Day 2014 against Newcastle",

The poise he showed when chipping the ball delicately home was the exclamation point in a vital win for the home side.\nMan of the match - Ross Barkley (Everton)\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"It's fair to say we are learning from painful lessons.\n\"There have been times where opponents score too easily when they come into a game but we were compact.\n\"The second goal was decisive. Scoring the second goal made it a different game and allowed us to control things.\n\"We showed a mature way of playing. Back-to-back clean sheets now and the team has the intent to please our fans and show what we can do.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren: \"In the first half you could see that the Everton players and supporters were nervous, we didn't take advantage of that, we weren't aggressive enough.\n\"In the second half we had a go but it wasn't enough. Too many players were below par.\n\"We can't play like that in front of 52,000 fans on Saturday, we need a reaction, we have to do better than that.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nBarkley has scored in four of his six Premier League games against Newcastle United [five goals].\nThe 22-year-old made his 100th Premier League appearance, becoming the second-youngest player to reach the landmark for Everton, after Michael Ball.\nNewcastle have conceded a league-high eight goals from outside the box in the Premier League this season.\nThe Magpies have gone nine league games without a clean sheet. Only Sunderland, without a clean sheet in 10 matches, have a worse record\nEverton won their first league game at Goodison Park since 21 November when they beat Aston Villa 4-0. It was also their first clean sheet at home since then.\nWhat next?\nEverton are away at Stoke in a 15:00 GMT kick-off in the Premier League on Saturday, when Newcastle play at home to 14th-placed West Brom."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "West Bromwich Albion 1-1 Swansea City\nSalomon Rondon's injury-time goal rescued a point for West Brom and denied Francesco Guidolin a second Premier League win as Swansea boss.\nGylfi Sigurdsson's second-half strike from 12 yards looked to have secured victory for the visitors.\nBut Albion, with Saido Berahino on the bench a day after Newcastle had a \u00a321m offer rejected for the striker, scrambled in a 92nd-minute leveller.\nIt moved the Baggies up to 13th, while Swansea drop to 16th.\nIt had looked an unlikely win for the hosts, as Tony Pulis's side failed to apply late pressure after Sigurdsson's tidy finish past goalkeeper Ben Foster.\nBut a penalty-area scramble was kept alive by a brave header from substitute Victor Anichebe, and even though Sigurdsson cleared Darren Fletcher's shot off the line, Venezuelan Rondon was on hand to bundle in his fifth goal of the season.\nThe battle of Berahino\nScotland international Darren Fletcher had been West Brom's biggest goal threat up until that point, squandering three headed chances, and Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski made a string of impressive saves, including a sharp stop from Anichebe.\nBut it was the introduction of Berahino just after the hour mark which brought the home support to life, with a noticeable chorus of boos accompanying the 22-year-old's arrival, although their disapproval was aimed at Pulis for removing Stephane Sessegnon, who had been one of the Baggies' most forward-thinking players on the night.\nIn fact, fans had been chanting for the introduction of Berahino, who damaged his relationship with The Hawthorns contingent by saying he would never play for them again when he was denied a move in the summer.\nAnd even though Monday's big-money offer from Newcastle was rejected, and despite coming into the game with a dead leg, he looked lively and committed for the Albion cause.\n\"I'm pleased the window is over,\" said Pulis, who received boos again at the final whistle by fans who perceive his style of play as too negative. \"It's been speculation after speculation and he's a young boy who watches the TV and sees all the internet stuff. Hopefully he gets back to full fitness.\"\nGuidolin getting to grips with Swans\nGuidolin has changed little in the way Swansea play during his two games in charge, as his side persisted with the possession football they have become known for.\nBut it was a forced change before half-time that put the Welsh club into the ascendancy, when a head injury to Ki Sung-yueng saw new signing Alberto Paloschi come on and make an instant impression.\nThe January arrival from Italian side Chievo, who made a name for himself as a 17-year-old by scoring 20 seconds into his AC Milan debut, added the power and hold-up play Swansea have often been lacking.\nHe forced the Swans' goal by hassling Baggies defender Gareth McAuley, who could only divert Leon Britton's pass into the path of Sigurdsson for the opener, and hit the post with his own effort minutes later.\nBut the late equaliser and the relinquishing of two points means Guidolin's side are placed precariously, just five points above the relegation zone.\nMan of the match - Alberto Paloschi\nWhat they said\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis:\n\"I think their keeper made some great saves and we had wonderful opportunities. Fletcher could have had four by himself.\n\"We're relieved we got something out of it but we really should have won the game.\n\"We're not on a bad run, the problem is we're not winning games, we're drawing games. We're a point closer to 40 points.\"\nSwansea boss Francesco Guidolin:\n\"At the beginning of the night 1-1 could be a good result but at the end I'm disappointed.\n\"My team played very well for all the match. I can look at the positives. We had a victory sensation but this is football.\n\"Paloschi is a good player and he played very well. I know his ambition and that he has quality. I hope he can score many goals for us.\"\nWhat's up next?\nBoth sides are in action again on Saturday, with West Brom travelling to relegation-threatened Newcastle and Swansea hosting Crystal Palace.\nThe stats you need to know\nGylfi Sigurdsson netted his fourth goal in five games and his seventh Premier League goal of the season for Swansea.\nSigurdsson has scored in three consecutive away league games for Swansea (three goals), as many goals as he had scored in his previous 13 away trips.\nThis is the first time in 10 Premier League meetings that there has been a draw between the sides.\nSalomon Rondon scored his first Premier League goal since October 2015, ending a run of nine games without a goal.\nSwansea conceded only their fourth goal in the final 15 minutes of a Premier League game this season, a joint Premier League low (alongside West Ham and Man City).\nThe Baggies are unbeaten in four Premier League games at the Hawthorns for the first time since February 2014 (six games).",

I cannot fault the team on that front. It is not only luck. I don't believe too much in luck. We feel disappointed and guilty. In a game like that when you create chances you want to win. We had the chances to win it. But their keeper kept them in it.\n\"You have to always think the opponent will play well and despite that still score. We had all kind of chances and it looked like it would come. But sometimes you lose these games.\"\nSouthampton boss Ronald Koeman: \"One point away at Arsenal is a good result. To get a good result you need to be lucky and we had that on our side. We had good defending and great goalkeeper. But we needed to create more.\n\"He is a fantastic goalkeeper. Sometimes you think you can't score because he is massive. Maybe today was his best performance.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Arsenal 0-0 Southampton\nArsenal lost further ground in the Premier League title race as they were held to a goalless draw by Southampton.\nThe Gunners had numerous chances but were unable to break down a resilient Saints side, who have now gone four games without conceding.\nAway keeper Fraser Forster was superb, making a string of impressive saves, including two to deny Mesut Ozil.\nArsenal are now winless in four league games and drop to fourth in the table, five points behind leaders Leicester.\nText commentary of Arsenal's draw with Southampton\nTuesday night's Premier League action\nArsene Wenger's side are also now two points behind both second-placed Manchester City and north London rivals Tottenham, who are third and have a superior goal difference.\nWorryingly for the Gunners boss, who opted not to recruit another striker in the recent transfer window, his side have now gone three Premier League games without scoring.\nThe result is further proof of the resilience Ronald Koeman has instilled in Southampton, who won 1-0 at Manchester United 10 days ago and are seventh in the table after picking up 10 points in their last four matches.\nArsenal make it three games without a goal\nOn Boxing Day, Arsenal lost 4-0 at Southampton - their only truly heavy defeat of this league campaign and a result that cost them the chance to go top of the Premier League at Leicester's expense.\nThe Foxes' victory over Liverpool on Tuesday meant that Arsenal would not have gone top even with a win over Southampton, but this will be just as frustrating a result as the one they suffered at St Mary's.\nCredit must go to Koeman's side for their defensive display but that does not excuse the Gunners for their pedestrian start and the chances they missed.\nOzil should have scored twice in the first half but Forster was alert and nimble to block his close-range shots and in the second half a host of players had good opportunities, including Olivier Giroud, who had a shot and header tipped away, and Laurent Koscielny who headed over from six yards out.\nAlexis Sanchez was typically lively in his first league start since the end of November, but was also unable to find a way past the Saints keeper as the Gunners made it three games without a goal for the first time since February 2009.\nForster again shows his quality\nIt is no coincidence that Southampton's recent resurgence and newfound resilience began with the recovery of Forster from injury.\nPrior to the England keeper's return, the Saints had lost eight of 10 games in all competitions, conceding 19 goals, but have since kept three clean sheets in winning three and drawing the other of their four matches.\nOn the evidence of his stellar performance at the Emirates, the 27-year-old will be challenging Joe Hart for a starting spot in the England team at this summer's Euro 2016.\nDuring the course of the game he made 10 big saves and dominated his area.\nIn front of him, Jose Fonte and Virgil van Dijk were also superb, keeping the physical Giroud at bay while Victor Wanyama and Oriol Romeu restricted the space available to Ozil, Sanchez and Joel Campbell, who was later replaced by the equally anonymous Theo Walcott.\nThe only negative in Southampton's performance was their inability to make the most of their chances to attack, with Sadio Mane particularly wasteful in a performance that stretches his run of games without a goal to 10 in all competitions.\nMan of the match - Fraser Forster\nWhat they said...\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We put the energy level in and created chances. I cannot fault the team on that front. It is not only luck. I don't believe too much in luck. We feel disappointed and guilty. In a game like that when you create chances you want to win. We had the chances to win it. But their keeper kept them in it.\n\"You have to always think the opponent will play well and despite that still score. We had all kind of chances and it looked like it would come. But sometimes you lose these games.\"\nSouthampton boss Ronald Koeman: \"One point away at Arsenal is a good result. To get a good result you need to be lucky and we had that on our side. We had good defending and great goalkeeper. But we needed to create more.\n\"He is a fantastic goalkeeper. Sometimes you think you can't score because he is massive. Maybe today was his best performance. We are happy he is the keeper of Southampton.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThe Gunners' last three top-flight games have produced a total of just one goal.\nThe north Londoners have now gone four Premier League games without enjoying a win for the first time since April 2014.\nSouthampton have registered four consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since November 2014.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal are away at Bournemouth in the Premier League next Sunday, while Southampton host West Ham the day before."

He got involved in an angry exchange with Juan Carlos Paredes that led to both players been booked.\nThe start of the farewell tour?\nChelsea defender John Terry caused a bit of a stir on Sunday when he announced that he will leave the club this summer, saying he had not been offered a new deal.\nHiddink suggested on Tuesday that the Stamford Bridge door was not closed, however, and fans who travelled to Vicarage Road showed their support for their long-serving captain.\nThere was a loud cheer when his name was read out before kick-off, while some fans held up banners with the words \"Captain, Leader, Legend\" on them.\nGenerally, the 35-year-old was solid against Watford, although a misjudged jump in his attempt to clear a cross for Odion Ighalo hinted at why his time at the heart of the Chelsea defence could be coming to an end.\nMan of the match - Heurelho Gomes\nWhat they said\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We're happy. We've shown we can get points against the big teams - you see it against Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham.\n\"The competitive level of the team is very high.\"\nChelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink on incident involving Costa and Watford's Paredes: \"It was clear and in front of our eyes. Costa was punched in the back and then he stumbled and brought his hands to his head. I was trying to protect my player because he was provoked.\n\"This league is physical. When you see our central defenders and our opponent's central defenders. He [Costa] likes to go physical but he must do within the rules. Some times players get physical and he has to get used to that.\"\nOn Terry: \"First we'll see him often this season.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 3-0 Stoke City\nManchester United kept in contention for a top-four Premier League place and gave manager Louis van Gaal a rare night of relaxation as Stoke City were outclassed at Old Trafford.\nVan Gaal and his players were jeered after defeat by Southampton in their previous home game - but it was all a sharp contrast here as United, inspired by youngster Antony Martial, won at a canter.\nJesse Lingard headed in Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's perfect delivery after 14 minutes to end a shocking sequence of 11 matches without a first-half goal at home stretching over a period of eight hours 40 minutes.\nMartial scored the goal his performance merited with a fine curled finish shortly after before setting up the third for Wayne Rooney from close range eight minutes after the break.\nIt was a win United's performance fully deserved and the victory margin could have been even greater, leaving them in fifth place, five points behind fourth-placed Arsenal.\nRelive all the action from an exciting match at Old Trafford\nReaction: Van Gaal hopes Rooney's form continues\nMagnificent Martial\nAs Manchester United have struggled through this colourless, painful season there has been one shaft of light offering real hope for the present and the future.\nAnthony Martial's \u00a336.5m signing from Monaco, when he was only 19, in September was regarded as a gamble by Van Gaal.\nOn this night of rejuvenation at Old Trafford it looks even more like money well spent.\nThe wisdom is that the rangy youngster will end up playing as a central striker, but Van Gaal has used him regularly from wide positions and, stationed on the left flank here, he tortured Stoke's defence and made former England defender Glen Johnson's night a misery.\nHe showed all the pace and athleticism that will be an asset to United for years to come as he was a threat all night, showing wonderful technique and composure to curl in a right-foot shot for the second goal then showed calmness and vision to lay the third on a plate for Rooney.\nIt was his sixth goal and third assist in the league, with the promise of plenty more to come. He departed to a deserved standing ovation with 11 minutes left.\nSome of United's work in the transfer market since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson has been justifiably criticised - not a bit of it with Martial.\nRelief at last for Van Gaal\nManchester United's 64-year-old manager has been a besieged figure this season, seemingly facing a crisis and an uncertain future on a weekly basis, scrutinised once more on Monday when neighbours Manchester City announced the world's most coveted coach, Pep Guardiola, would be joining them in the summer.\nHe received a subdued welcome as he made his way down the Old Trafford touchline to his technical area before kick-off, acknowledging a smattering of applause with a couple of waves.\nVan Gaal was able to make the return journey at the final whistle with cheers ringing around Old Trafford after their most impressive performance in months, a display designed to support his theory that things will eventually get better.\nIt has been a good few days for Van Gaal, with a potentially hazardous FA Cup fourth-round trip to Derby County safely negotiated last Friday and now this convincing victory.\nOld Trafford elated\nWhen Lingard stooped to head in Borthwick-Jackson's superb cross after 14 minutes, the roar that went around Old Trafford was tinged with relief and delight.\nHow United and Van Gaal needed that. The first groans of frustration had surfaced moments earlier when Chris Smalling drove into Stoke City's half but lost momentum because of lack of movement from his team-mates - but the pressure valve was released by Lingard's goal.\nOld Trafford was in buoyant mood for the rest of game, United's supporters able to sit back and enjoy their team exerting total control and playing with a fluency rarely seen this season.\nMan of the match - Anthony Martial\nWhat they said:\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"I think we have played in the first half attacking- wise very good. In the second half we were more controlling and we didn't give any chances away against a team like Stoke. That is remarkable because they always make it difficult.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We didn't start in the right manner. We conceded early on, were too passive and for the first goal we didn't get close enough to people. Avoiding going 1-0 down early on is what you talk about before coming to Old Trafford, and unfortunately we conceded another poor goal for the second.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester United travel to Chelsea on Sunday (16:00 kick-off), while Stoke host Everton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nThe stats you need to know:\nJesse Lingard scored Manchester United's first first-half goal at Old Trafford since they netted one against Wolfsburg in the Champions League in September 2015\nIt was the first time since April 2015 against Manchester City that the Red Devils had scored twice in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game at home\nWayne Rooney scored his 99th Premier League goal at Old Trafford\nRooney scored and provided an assist at Old Trafford in a Premier League game for the first time since Boxing Day 2014 against Newcastle"

They controlled the game with early possession before catching Bournemouth with a pair of swift strikes which rendered the contest a foregone conclusion.\nOzil set the Gunners on their way with a powerful shot after Olivier Giroud had headed Aaron Ramsey's long pass into the German's feet.\nAnd Arsene Wenger's pre-match assertion that Oxlade-Chamberlain was in form and would offer good balance on the right proved prophetic when the winger came inside and his low shot went in via the far post.\nAgain, Ramsey had a hand in the goal - the Welshman pulling the strings for the Gunners and giving Bournemouth a lesson in turning some eye-catching moves into ruthless attacks.\nNo finishing touch\nDespite chasing the game in the second half, it took until stoppage time for Bournemouth to test Petr Cech, when the Arsenal keeper made a fine double save to deny Steve Cook and Harry Arter from low shots.\nUntil then, it had been a succession of wayward pops at goal and intricate, but not incisive, approach play.\nBournemouth should be applauded for their desire to pass the ball, create space and use the flanks but they lacked any presence up front.\nLone striker Benik Afobe, who was signed from Wolves for a fee of about \u00a310m, had scored in his last three games for the Cherries but failed to register a single effort on goal against his former club, before he was substituted after 76 minutes.\nMan of the match - Aaron Ramsey\nWhat the managers said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were slow out the blocks today, which is unlike us.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 1-0 West Bromwich Albion\nNewcastle produced one of their best displays of the season as they beat West Brom to move out of the Premier League bottom three.\nAleksandar Mitrovic scored the only goal in the 32nd minute, when he slotted in from inside the area.\nNewcastle also went close through Andros Townsend, whose shot hit the post, while Ben Foster denied Mitrovic.\nWest Brom's best chance fell to James McClean, whose goal-bound shot was brilliantly blocked by Steven Taylor.\nVictory moved the Magpies up to 17th - one point above Norwich in 18th.\nRe-live the action from St James' Park\nReaction from the Saturday's other Premier League matches\nTownsend gives Magpies extra dimension\nIt was no surprise that the former Tottenham player came off the St James' Park pitch to a standing ovation in the 88th minute.\nThe England midfielder produced the sort of effervescent display on his home debut that Magpies fans never saw from \u00a312m fellow winger Florian Thauvin.\nHe had four shots and produced four key passes - more than any of his team-mates - with his dummy and effort that hit the post the highlight of his afternoon. As a claim for a place in England's Euro 2016 squad, this was the perfect audition.\nThe slight disappointment for the Magpies was that they scored only once from 19 chances created, after enjoying 69% of possession.\nAgainst a side less lackadaisical than West Brom, they would have been punished.\nWest Brom can't go down, surely?\nWe have seen it before - team sits comfortable in mid-table at the turn of the year, eases off the gas and, before you know it, gets dragged into the relegation fight.\nNewcastle have first-hand experience of this apocalyptic scenario, but could it befall the Baggies?\nThey were atrocious today. Had it not been for Foster, who made a brilliant save from Mitrovic, Cheick Tiote having a wonder-goal questionably disallowed and Newcastle's profligacy then the scoreline would have been at least 4-0.\nOr perhaps that should be 4-1. What is almost guaranteed when playing Newcastle is that they have defensive lapses.\nAside from Taylor's great block to deny McClean, West Brom did not seriously threaten Rob Elliot's goal until stoppage time when Saido Berahino would have surely scored had fellow substitute Salomon Rondon found him with a simple square ball.\nAs it is, the Baggies have now failed to win in five games and are six points above the drop-zone.\nMan of the match - Andros Townsend (Newcastle)\nWhat the managers said\nNewcastle head coach Steve McClaren:\n\"The first five minutes today, you could see we were really up for this game. For 95 minutes we were relentless in attack, and we should have scored more.\n\"As a manager you do worry as the game goes on, but you just have to sit down and pray it's just your day.\n\"Townsend will get better and better, the fitter he gets. When he picks up the ball he's so dangerous. He is so positive and deserved a goal. That was good, and we had a number of heroes today.\n\"We knew that if we won today we'd be out of the bottom three. Now we'll get players fit over the next few weeks, and I hope we'll get better, stronger, as the season concludes.\n\"The players have been great - good, attacking football. We've shown what this team is capable of doing, and it's all about doing that consistently.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis:\n\"Since I have been here, that's our worst performance playing away from home. It could have been more than 1-0. But they are a great group of lads - we'll have to take this on the chin and work this out.\n\"Only in the last 15 minutes did we have a couple of opportunities to score. The goal was a poor one to concede, and it pushed them on. But we weren't at the races from the beginning.\n\"Newcastle have got good players, and look at what they have recruited. But like all teams in this league you need a little luck. Today they didn't need luck though - they were better than us, full-stop.\n\"We know the number of points we have to get, and we need a couple of players back. But every game is tough and there are no easy games in the Premier League.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle have won back-to-back games at home in the Premier League for the first time since December 2014.\nWest Brom have won none of their last seven Premier League away trips (W0 D3 L4).\nShelvey has recorded as many assists in his four Premier League games with Newcastle as he did in 16 with Swansea this season (two for each side in 20 PL games)\nNewcastle ended a run of nine Premier League games without a clean sheet. It was their first clean sheet in the competition since the start of December.\nWest Brom have won just one of their 10 away trips to St James' Park in the Premier League (D2 L7).\nThe Baggies have failed to score in three of their last four games in the Premier League.\nNewcastle attempted more shots in this match (19, incl. blocked) than they did in their last two Premier League games combined (18, incl. blocked).\nWhat next?\nThe Magpies are at Chelsea next Saturday, and the Baggies have an FA Cup replay against Peterborough on Wednesday before they travel to Everton next weekend."

We had many possibilities to score.\n\"We controlled the game, which is not easy with the weather. Crystal Palace is a good team and they played well, but we played better.\n\"It was another good performance, I think it's the best in my period at the club. We can have confidence because the team is good, the fitness is good. We must work to improve in set-piece situations.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew:\n\"The point today is so important. We knew we had to get something today, so that was a very good result. It was really tough, with a lot of energy and a lot of commitment from both teams.\n\"We were playing with our brakes on but we had a reaction to the chat at half-time. Swansea have been in good form and we came back, which makes it all the sweeter.\n\"[Emmanuel] Adebayor had a couple of moments that were top-drawer - you can see that he's going to add something. We still look a bit like we need a bit more going forward at this level. [Yohan] Cabaye was terrific. There's a bit of relief on our side and we take that into the Watford game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSince his debut in January 2012, only Tottenham's Christian Eriksen (six) has scored more free-kick goals in the Premier League than Sigurdsson (five).\nScott Dann has scored five Premier League goals in 2015-16 - this after having scored six in 125 Premier League games before this season.\nDann's goal was the eighth by a Crystal Palace defender in the league this season, more than any other team.\nCrystal Palace became the final team in the top four tiers of English football to register a league point in 2016.\nThe Swans have netted 58% of their goals in the first half of games this season, the highest proportion in the top flight.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea host Southampton next Saturday, while Crystal Palace entertain Watford.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Watford\nTottenham moved into second place in the Premier League table as Kieran Trippier's first goal for the club sealed a dominant win over Watford.\nThe former Burnley full-back was in the right place to tap in substitute Dele Alli's fine low cross.\nSpurs were always in control against a lacklustre Watford side, but were continually denied by their former goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes.\nThe Hornets failed to record a shot on target and fall to 10th in the table.\nSpurs were always well on top, having 26 efforts on goal, but lacked the killer touch until Alli came off the bench to continue his superb season and tee up Trippier for the winner.\nAlli was left out after feeling unwell during the 3-0 win at Norwich in midweek but quickly made the difference for Mauricio Pochettino's side once more.\nSpurs under the radar?\nYou would have been forgiven for thinking on Saturday morning that the Premier League title was a two-horse race, such was the focus on leaders Leicester's trip to Manchester City.\nBut Spurs, with just three league defeats all season and seven wins from their last nine games, have crept under the radar to move into a great position to fight for their first title since 1961.\nThey have not finished second since 1963 but now have a squad who look capable of pushing Leicester and Manchester City all the way.\nLeicester's stunning lunchtime win meant Spurs kicked off in the knowledge that a win would put them second overnight.\nAnd their win against the Hornets would have been secured far earlier had Gomes - who had an eventful six-year stay at White Hart Lane - not made eight saves.\nSpurs may be five points behind the Foxes but with Leicester facing Arsenal next weekend, while Spurs take on City, that could soon change.\nFull-backs key for Spurs\nPochettino rotated his full-backs. leaving out Danny Rose and Kyle Walker, with Ben Davies and Trippier starting instead.\nAnd both players fully justified their selection with superb attacking displays, providing the width in a patient, but attacking display.\nIn the first half Davies was twice denied by Gomes' reflex saves, and Trippier - who made 10 crosses from right-back - popped up in space to grab the winner when Alli's cross with the outside of his boot picked him out at the far post.\nFriends reunited?\nFor Watford it was largely a day to forget. A damaging run of four straight defeats was arrested at the end of January but there was no sign of a side who had held Chelsea in midweek.\nManager Quique Sanchez Flores chose to split up his 20-goal strike partnership of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo, with Deeney tired after a gruelling run of games, but the change in system only served to leave Ighalo woefully isolated in the first half. Ighalo had the fewest touches (14) of any outfield player before Deeney came on at the break.\nThe captain's return made little difference though, as the Hornets ended the game without a single effort on target.\nMan of the match - Heurelho Gomes (Watford)\n'We need to be calm'\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I feel very proud of the players.\n\"We need to be calm. We are in a very good position in the league but the philosophy from the beginning of the season has been to go step by step. We are a very young squad so it is important to keep going and take every game and competition and be ready to compete.\n\"We still need to be more clinical, we created a lot of chances but need to score more.\"\n'It was completely difficult'\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It was completely difficult. We expected a tough match. Tottenham play really quick, play intelligent balls, they have a lot of good players so it was very difficult to stop their attacks.\n\"Tottenham have improved since the last time we played. They have more confidence and they are one of the best teams. They have the chance to win the league.\n\"Playing against Chelsea and Tottenham in four days is too much. We did all the best we could but it was not enough.\"\nWhat next?\nTottenham could put a gap between themselves and third-placed Manchester City with a win at the Etihad next Sunday, while Watford face a short trip to freefalling Crystal Palace.\nThe stats you need to know\nSpurs have had a league-high 72 shots in the first half of games in 2016 so far but they have scored with just four of those.\nKieran Trippier bagged his first Premier League goal in his 43rd appearance.\nDele Alli assisted Trippier's goal just 176 seconds after entering the field of play.\nAlli has had a hand in 11 goals in his last 14 Premier League games for Spurs (six goals, five assists).\nSpurs had 26 shots, their joint-most in a Premier League game this season - level with their tally against Sunderland at home in January.\nThe Hornets have failed to score in four of their last five Premier League games.\nWatford have mustered just one shot on target in their two Premier League games against Spurs in 2015-16."

Lescott's downward header from Carles Gil's free-kick went in via two deflections - a scruffy goal typical of a poor opening 45 minutes.\nAfter Agbonlahor's second there was much greater fluency though, and few of the nerves you might expect of a side with just two wins from 24 games.\nNorwich made three attacking substitutions as the game wore on, but Villa defended soundly and could have added a third had Leandro Bacuna not blazed wildly over.\nNorwich lose... again\nTwo weeks ago in the early kick-off, Norwich saw a 3-1 lead over Liverpool transformed into a 5-4 loss when seeking a much-needed win following defeats by Stoke and Bournemouth.\nThe Canaries were resoundingly beaten by Tottenham in midweek, and now find themselves in serious trouble despite a positive start to the campaign.\nTheir defending was their undoing at Villa Park. The shape of the back line and Rudd's decision to come off his line for Agbonlahor's second goal was particularly poor, but nor did they offer much of an attacking threat.\nSebastien Bassong saw a downward header bounce over the bar, Dieumerci Mbokani's tame efforts were easy to deal with, and Steven Naismith was bright without creating too much danger.\nPatrick Bamford - who came on for his Norwich debut - was denied by Jores Okore's brilliant saving challenge, but had the Chelsea loanee turned in with just minutes to play it surely would only have been a consolation.\nMan of the match - Carles Gil\n'Football is strange'\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"Football is strange. Today we didn't play as well as in some games that we lost. Our football is improving, not only today but for a while now, but we haven't been getting what we deserve.\n\"We are still a way away from where we would like to be but we still believe. The way the players fought on the field today means a lot to me.\n\"Everyone was very committed, and behaving in that way we still have a chance.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"Goals change games. The first was poor defending from us, and before that we had opportunities to score but didn't take them.\n\"We didn't defend our box from a set piece, and we gifted the second goal away - it was a basic decision at the back. We huffed and puffed but ultimately didn't do enough to get ourselves back in the game.\n\"This is a test of character. The rest of the season will show whether we have enough character in the group.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAgbonlahor has now scored in 11 successive Premier League seasons for Villa.\nRemi Garde's side scored their first first-half goal in the Premier League since December versus Southampton, also scored by Lescott.\nNorwich are the only Premier League side yet to keep a clean sheet on the road this season.\nVilla have won two of their three league home games in 2016 so far - they won three of 19 throughout the whole of 2015.\nNorwich have won just one of their last 12 Premier League away games (W1 D2 L9).\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa host Liverpool in a 16:00 GMT kick-off in the Premier League next Sunday, while Norwich are at home to West Ham next Saturday.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Southampton 1-0 West Ham United\nSouthampton earned their fourth win in five matches, despite a third red card of the season for midfielder Victor Wanyama.\nSaints started strongly and took the lead when Maya Yoshida smashed home Sadio Mane's centre.\nWanyama received a straight red from referee Mark Clattenburg for diving in on West Ham midfielder Dimitri Payet.\nThe hosts survived a late scare when defender Cedric sliced a clearance narrowly past his own post.\nStriker Emmanuel Emenike - a January arrival on loan from Fenerbahce - made his debut for the Hammers, but he missed the opportunity to earn a point for his side when he headed wide from Enner Valencia's cross.\nThe victory lifts Southampton to seventh in the Premier League table, just one place and two points behind their opponents.\nWanyama's moment of madness\nWest Ham will be disappointed not to take anything from the game after playing the last 37 minutes with an extra man.\nWanyama - in his third season at St Mary's - is one of Southampton's senior players and can be a highly effective operator at the base of midfield, but his appetite for a tackle can also be his undoing.\nHaving already been dismissed against Bournemouth and Norwich this season, Wanyama became the first player since Wes Brown in 2013-14 to receive three red cards in the same season.\nIn truth, it was perhaps a case of the player's reputation preceding him, as Wanyama's challenge didn't appear to make significant contact with Payet, but Mark Clattenburg - whose tally of five red cards this season is the second-highest among referees - decided that the tackle was worthy of a straight red.\nSaints defence stands firm again\nThat Southampton were able to see out the remainder of the match with 10 men owed much to another excellent performance from their back four, plus goalkeeper Fraser Forster.\nSince Forster returned from patellar tendon surgery last month, the team has recorded five clean sheets in a row - roughly seven and a half hours of football without conceding.\nIt wasn't one of Forster's busier evenings - though he did show his class with a brilliant reflex stop from a Winston Reid header - as centre-backs Virgil van Dijk and Jose Fonte dominated Hammers strikers Enner Valencia and substitutes Emenike and Andy Carroll.\nMissed opportunity for wasteful Hammers\nFor West Ham, this was a missed opportunity to overhaul Manchester United in fifth place - and the Hammers will rue their profligacy in front of goal.\nSlaven Bilic's side had 18 shots - but only found the target with two.\nEnner Valencia had been in excellent form, with four goals in his previous four games, but here the Ecuadorian striker was uncharacteristically wayward, shanking an effort wide from the edge of the area when well placed.\nMan of the match - Maya Yoshida\nWhat they said\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"I'm very pleased with the final result. It was a difficult game from the start, more difficult after the red card to Victor Wanyama.\n\"But even with one less on the pitch we had the best chances to score a second. We showed very good defensive composure, good defending. I don't remember one big chance [for West Ham].\"\nOn Wanyama's sending off: \"You can't do that tackle. It's a hard tackle. You give the referee the possibility to give the red card.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"First I would like to congratulate Southampton. They were very good at defending in the box. They deserve this.\n\"We did not create enough. Our crosses were quite poor, they defended really well. When you lose a game like this, we are gutted.\n\"For me it was a red card. When that second leg comes... it was a reckless challenge.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTwo of Maya Yoshida's three Premier League goals have been against West Ham United.\nVictor Wanyama is the seventh player to be sent off three times in the same Premier League season, joining Vinnie Jones, David Batty, Slaven Bilic, Craig Short, Frank Queudrue and Wes Brown.\nThere has been a Premier League high of 10 red cards in West Ham games this season (four for them, six for the opposition).\nFraser Forster's clean-sheet percentage is the best of any goalkeeper with 30 or more Premier League appearances, with 18 clean sheets from his 35 games (51.4%).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton visit Swansea next Saturday, while West Ham travel to Norwich."

We had many possibilities to score.\n\"We controlled the game, which is not easy with the weather. Crystal Palace is a good team and they played well, but we played better.\n\"It was another good performance, I think it's the best in my period at the club. We can have confidence because the team is good, the fitness is good. We must work to improve in set-piece situations.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew:\n\"The point today is so important. We knew we had to get something today, so that was a very good result. It was really tough, with a lot of energy and a lot of commitment from both teams.\n\"We were playing with our brakes on but we had a reaction to the chat at half-time. Swansea have been in good form and we came back, which makes it all the sweeter.\n\"[Emmanuel] Adebayor had a couple of moments that were top-drawer - you can see that he's going to add something. We still look a bit like we need a bit more going forward at this level. [Yohan] Cabaye was terrific. There's a bit of relief on our side and we take that into the Watford game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSince his debut in January 2012, only Tottenham's Christian Eriksen (six) has scored more free-kick goals in the Premier League than Sigurdsson (five).\nScott Dann has scored five Premier League goals in 2015-16 - this after having scored six in 125 Premier League games before this season.\nDann's goal was the eighth by a Crystal Palace defender in the league this season, more than any other team.\nCrystal Palace became the final team in the top four tiers of English football to register a league point in 2016.\nThe Swans have netted 58% of their goals in the first half of games this season, the highest proportion in the top flight.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea host Southampton next Saturday, while Crystal Palace entertain Watford.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Southampton 1-0 West Ham United\nSouthampton earned their fourth win in five matches, despite a third red card of the season for midfielder Victor Wanyama.\nSaints started strongly and took the lead when Maya Yoshida smashed home Sadio Mane's centre.\nWanyama received a straight red from referee Mark Clattenburg for diving in on West Ham midfielder Dimitri Payet.\nThe hosts survived a late scare when defender Cedric sliced a clearance narrowly past his own post.\nStriker Emmanuel Emenike - a January arrival on loan from Fenerbahce - made his debut for the Hammers, but he missed the opportunity to earn a point for his side when he headed wide from Enner Valencia's cross.\nThe victory lifts Southampton to seventh in the Premier League table, just one place and two points behind their opponents.\nWanyama's moment of madness\nWest Ham will be disappointed not to take anything from the game after playing the last 37 minutes with an extra man.\nWanyama - in his third season at St Mary's - is one of Southampton's senior players and can be a highly effective operator at the base of midfield, but his appetite for a tackle can also be his undoing.\nHaving already been dismissed against Bournemouth and Norwich this season, Wanyama became the first player since Wes Brown in 2013-14 to receive three red cards in the same season.\nIn truth, it was perhaps a case of the player's reputation preceding him, as Wanyama's challenge didn't appear to make significant contact with Payet, but Mark Clattenburg - whose tally of five red cards this season is the second-highest among referees - decided that the tackle was worthy of a straight red.\nSaints defence stands firm again\nThat Southampton were able to see out the remainder of the match with 10 men owed much to another excellent performance from their back four, plus goalkeeper Fraser Forster.\nSince Forster returned from patellar tendon surgery last month, the team has recorded five clean sheets in a row - roughly seven and a half hours of football without conceding.\nIt wasn't one of Forster's busier evenings - though he did show his class with a brilliant reflex stop from a Winston Reid header - as centre-backs Virgil van Dijk and Jose Fonte dominated Hammers strikers Enner Valencia and substitutes Emenike and Andy Carroll.\nMissed opportunity for wasteful Hammers\nFor West Ham, this was a missed opportunity to overhaul Manchester United in fifth place - and the Hammers will rue their profligacy in front of goal.\nSlaven Bilic's side had 18 shots - but only found the target with two.\nEnner Valencia had been in excellent form, with four goals in his previous four games, but here the Ecuadorian striker was uncharacteristically wayward, shanking an effort wide from the edge of the area when well placed.\nMan of the match - Maya Yoshida\nWhat they said\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"I'm very pleased with the final result. It was a difficult game from the start, more difficult after the red card to Victor Wanyama.\n\"But even with one less on the pitch we had the best chances to score a second. We showed very good defensive composure, good defending. I don't remember one big chance [for West Ham].\"\nOn Wanyama's sending off: \"You can't do that tackle. It's a hard tackle. You give the referee the possibility to give the red card.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"First I would like to congratulate Southampton. They were very good at defending in the box. They deserve this.\n\"We did not create enough. Our crosses were quite poor, they defended really well. When you lose a game like this, we are gutted.\n\"For me it was a red card. When that second leg comes... it was a reckless challenge.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nTwo of Maya Yoshida's three Premier League goals have been against West Ham United.\nVictor Wanyama is the seventh player to be sent off three times in the same Premier League season, joining Vinnie Jones, David Batty, Slaven Bilic, Craig Short, Frank Queudrue and Wes Brown.\nThere has been a Premier League high of 10 red cards in West Ham games this season (four for them, six for the opposition).\nFraser Forster's clean-sheet percentage is the best of any goalkeeper with 30 or more Premier League appearances, with 18 clean sheets from his 35 games (51.4%).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton visit Swansea next Saturday, while West Ham travel to Norwich."

Manchester United did a good job in the first half and in the beginning of the second, they are not an easy team to beat.\n\"But we deserved a point. We dropped too far back after the first 20 minutes when they dominated us but later on we closed a little more.\n\"They made a beautiful goal - without good marking from our side - but after I think the team reacted very well.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal:\n\"I feel we didn't reward ourselves with a victory because we were the better team. Until the last quarter we played very well and could have scored more goals. But you have to control the game better and we did not do that.\n\"It isn't a lack of concentration it is not being composed when you are defending. When we have the ball we have to keep the ball.\n\"You need to give the right pass at the right moment and we did not do that [before Chelsea scored]. Chelsea are a very good team and you play like we played and don't reward yourself, it is frustrating.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDespite still being unbeaten under Guus Hiddink this season, Chelsea are winless in four consecutive Premier League home games for the first time since November 2012.\nIndeed, it is the first time they have ever drawn four consecutive home games in the Premier League.\nJesse Lingard has scored three goals from his last four shots on target in the Premier League.\nUp next?\nBoth teams are in Premier League action on Saturday at different times of the day. While Chelsea entertain struggling Newcastle United (17:30 GMT), Manchester United travel to Wearside to face relegation-threatened Sunderland (12:45 GMT).",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Newcastle United 1-0 West Bromwich Albion\nNewcastle produced one of their best displays of the season as they beat West Brom to move out of the Premier League bottom three.\nAleksandar Mitrovic scored the only goal in the 32nd minute, when he slotted in from inside the area.\nNewcastle also went close through Andros Townsend, whose shot hit the post, while Ben Foster denied Mitrovic.\nWest Brom's best chance fell to James McClean, whose goal-bound shot was brilliantly blocked by Steven Taylor.\nVictory moved the Magpies up to 17th - one point above Norwich in 18th.\nRe-live the action from St James' Park\nReaction from the Saturday's other Premier League matches\nTownsend gives Magpies extra dimension\nIt was no surprise that the former Tottenham player came off the St James' Park pitch to a standing ovation in the 88th minute.\nThe England midfielder produced the sort of effervescent display on his home debut that Magpies fans never saw from \u00a312m fellow winger Florian Thauvin.\nHe had four shots and produced four key passes - more than any of his team-mates - with his dummy and effort that hit the post the highlight of his afternoon. As a claim for a place in England's Euro 2016 squad, this was the perfect audition.\nThe slight disappointment for the Magpies was that they scored only once from 19 chances created, after enjoying 69% of possession.\nAgainst a side less lackadaisical than West Brom, they would have been punished.\nWest Brom can't go down, surely?\nWe have seen it before - team sits comfortable in mid-table at the turn of the year, eases off the gas and, before you know it, gets dragged into the relegation fight.\nNewcastle have first-hand experience of this apocalyptic scenario, but could it befall the Baggies?\nThey were atrocious today. Had it not been for Foster, who made a brilliant save from Mitrovic, Cheick Tiote having a wonder-goal questionably disallowed and Newcastle's profligacy then the scoreline would have been at least 4-0.\nOr perhaps that should be 4-1. What is almost guaranteed when playing Newcastle is that they have defensive lapses.\nAside from Taylor's great block to deny McClean, West Brom did not seriously threaten Rob Elliot's goal until stoppage time when Saido Berahino would have surely scored had fellow substitute Salomon Rondon found him with a simple square ball.\nAs it is, the Baggies have now failed to win in five games and are six points above the drop-zone.\nMan of the match - Andros Townsend (Newcastle)\nWhat the managers said\nNewcastle head coach Steve McClaren:\n\"The first five minutes today, you could see we were really up for this game. For 95 minutes we were relentless in attack, and we should have scored more.\n\"As a manager you do worry as the game goes on, but you just have to sit down and pray it's just your day.\n\"Townsend will get better and better, the fitter he gets. When he picks up the ball he's so dangerous. He is so positive and deserved a goal. That was good, and we had a number of heroes today.\n\"We knew that if we won today we'd be out of the bottom three. Now we'll get players fit over the next few weeks, and I hope we'll get better, stronger, as the season concludes.\n\"The players have been great - good, attacking football. We've shown what this team is capable of doing, and it's all about doing that consistently.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis:\n\"Since I have been here, that's our worst performance playing away from home. It could have been more than 1-0. But they are a great group of lads - we'll have to take this on the chin and work this out.\n\"Only in the last 15 minutes did we have a couple of opportunities to score. The goal was a poor one to concede, and it pushed them on. But we weren't at the races from the beginning.\n\"Newcastle have got good players, and look at what they have recruited. But like all teams in this league you need a little luck. Today they didn't need luck though - they were better than us, full-stop.\n\"We know the number of points we have to get, and we need a couple of players back. But every game is tough and there are no easy games in the Premier League.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle have won back-to-back games at home in the Premier League for the first time since December 2014.\nWest Brom have won none of their last seven Premier League away trips (W0 D3 L4).\nShelvey has recorded as many assists in his four Premier League games with Newcastle as he did in 16 with Swansea this season (two for each side in 20 PL games)\nNewcastle ended a run of nine Premier League games without a clean sheet. It was their first clean sheet in the competition since the start of December.\nWest Brom have won just one of their 10 away trips to St James' Park in the Premier League (D2 L7).\nThe Baggies have failed to score in three of their last four games in the Premier League.\nNewcastle attempted more shots in this match (19, incl. blocked) than they did in their last two Premier League games combined (18, incl. blocked).\nWhat next?\nThe Magpies are at Chelsea next Saturday, and the Baggies have an FA Cup replay against Peterborough on Wednesday before they travel to Everton next weekend."

They controlled the game with early possession before catching Bournemouth with a pair of swift strikes which rendered the contest a foregone conclusion.\nOzil set the Gunners on their way with a powerful shot after Olivier Giroud had headed Aaron Ramsey's long pass into the German's feet.\nAnd Arsene Wenger's pre-match assertion that Oxlade-Chamberlain was in form and would offer good balance on the right proved prophetic when the winger came inside and his low shot went in via the far post.\nAgain, Ramsey had a hand in the goal - the Welshman pulling the strings for the Gunners and giving Bournemouth a lesson in turning some eye-catching moves into ruthless attacks.\nNo finishing touch\nDespite chasing the game in the second half, it took until stoppage time for Bournemouth to test Petr Cech, when the Arsenal keeper made a fine double save to deny Steve Cook and Harry Arter from low shots.\nUntil then, it had been a succession of wayward pops at goal and intricate, but not incisive, approach play.\nBournemouth should be applauded for their desire to pass the ball, create space and use the flanks but they lacked any presence up front.\nLone striker Benik Afobe, who was signed from Wolves for a fee of about \u00a310m, had scored in his last three games for the Cherries but failed to register a single effort on goal against his former club, before he was substituted after 76 minutes.\nMan of the match - Aaron Ramsey\nWhat the managers said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were slow out the blocks today, which is unlike us. If you give a team like Arsenal time on the ball they will punish you.\n\"We were much-improved in the second half without getting that goal to put them under pressure. We kept going, kept fighting, and if we had got that goal back with say 20 minutes to go, it would have made for an interesting finish. We got into some really good positions without the cutting edge we have had in recent weeks.\"\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We had a strong start, with good finishing and we controlled the game. We beat a good side, it was three difficult points but three very important points for us because we had not won for a while.\n\"We lost a bit of our urgency in the second half. We lost the killer instinct to get the third goal and on top of that Bournemouth are physically a strong team.\"\nStats of the day\nArsenal are unbeaten in 23 fixtures against newly-promoted sides, winning 19 and drawing four.\nMesut Ozil has now scored in both Premier League matches versus Bournemouth this season with both goals having been assisted by Olivier Giroud.\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored his first Premier League goal in 38 appearances. It was his first goal involvement in 26 Premier League games.\nComing up next\nArsenal host fellow title challengers Leicester City on Sunday (12:00 GMT), while Bournemouth, who are five points above the drop zone, welcome Stoke City to Vitality Stadium on Saturday (15:00).",

Lescott's downward header from Carles Gil's free-kick went in via two deflections - a scruffy goal typical of a poor opening 45 minutes.\nAfter Agbonlahor's second there was much greater fluency though, and few of the nerves you might expect of a side with just two wins from 24 games.\nNorwich made three attacking substitutions as the game wore on, but Villa defended soundly and could have added a third had Leandro Bacuna not blazed wildly over.\nNorwich lose... again\nTwo weeks ago in the early kick-off, Norwich saw a 3-1 lead over Liverpool transformed into a 5-4 loss when seeking a much-needed win following defeats by Stoke and Bournemouth.\nThe Canaries were resoundingly beaten by Tottenham in midweek, and now find themselves in serious trouble despite a positive start to the campaign.\nTheir defending was their undoing at Villa Park. The shape of the back line and Rudd's decision to come off his line for Agbonlahor's second goal was particularly poor, but nor did they offer much of an attacking threat.\nSebastien Bassong saw a downward header bounce over the bar, Dieumerci Mbokani's tame efforts were easy to deal with, and Steven Naismith was bright without creating too much danger.\nPatrick Bamford - who came on for his Norwich debut - was denied by Jores Okore's brilliant saving challenge, but had the Chelsea loanee turned in with just minutes to play it surely would only have been a consolation.\nMan of the match - Carles Gil\n'Football is strange'\nAston Villa manager Remi Garde: \"Football is strange. Today we didn't play as well as in some games that we lost. Our football is improving, not only today but for a while now, but we haven't been getting what we deserve.\n\"We are still a way away from where we would like to be but we still believe. The way the players fought on the field today means a lot to me.\n\"Everyone was very committed, and behaving in that way we still have a chance.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"Goals change games. The first was poor defending from us, and before that we had opportunities to score but didn't take them.\n\"We didn't defend our box from a set piece, and we gifted the second goal away - it was a basic decision at the back.

Conceding a goal from a set piece after two minutes was very important for the game.\n\"We had chances but it was a difficult game. I expected more from the beginning because it was very important, we are at home and playing top of the table, but we couldn't do it.\n\"There are 36 points to play for, nothing is finished. It is important for us to recover our players and I am continuing to not give up because we got an unexpected defeat but we must continue.\"\n'We play without pressure' - Ranieri\nRanieri saluted his side's defensive discipline at the final whistle, telling BBC Sport: \"We played very, very compact and believed everything could be possible.\n\"We play without pressure because we don't have to win the league. We must enjoy. This league is so strange and now it is important to think about Arsenal.\n\"I want to wait until the end of April because I know the last matches are very tough. This is a fantastic moment for the Premier League, nobody knows who can win it.\"\nWhat next?\nWhile Leicester head for the Emirates and another test of their title mettle, Manchester City must pick themselves up for the visit of another in-form team, Tottenham, before starting a run of fixtures that sees them play in the FA Cup, Champions League and the Capital One Cup final in the space of a week.\nBBC Radio 5 live In Short: Leicester City: Champions League to Championship?\nThe stats you need to know\nRobert Huth has scored more goals in his last five Premier League appearances (3) as he had in his previous 86 in the competition (2).\nThis was only the second time in his Premier League career that he's scored more than once in a game, with the German last scoring two in February 2011 for Stoke v Sunderland.\nRiyad Mahrez (14 goals, 10 assists) became the first player to reach double figures in terms of both goals and assists in the Premier League this season.\nMahrez ended a personal Premier League goal drought of 11 hours and two minutes with his strike in this match.\nManchester City have not beaten any side currently in the top six of the league this season (W0 D3 L4).\nManchester City have lost as many league home games this season (3) as they had in 2014-15 and 2013-14 combined under Manuel Pellegrini (3).\nLeicester City have lost just one of their last 16 league away games (W10 D5 L1).",

A damaging run of four straight defeats was arrested at the end of January but there was no sign of a side who had held Chelsea in midweek.\nManager Quique Sanchez Flores chose to split up his 20-goal strike partnership of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo, with Deeney tired after a gruelling run of games, but the change in system only served to leave Ighalo woefully isolated in the first half. Ighalo had the fewest touches (14) of any outfield player before Deeney came on at the break.\nThe captain's return made little difference though, as the Hornets ended the game without a single effort on target.\nMan of the match - Heurelho Gomes (Watford)\n'We need to be calm'\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I feel very proud of the players.\n\"We need to be calm. We are in a very good position in the league but the philosophy from the beginning of the season has been to go step by step. We are a very young squad so it is important to keep going and take every game and competition and be ready to compete.\n\"We still need to be more clinical, we created a lot of chances but need to score more.\"\n'It was completely difficult'\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It was completely difficult. We expected a tough match. Tottenham play really quick, play intelligent balls, they have a lot of good players so it was very difficult to stop their attacks.\n\"Tottenham have improved since the last time we played. They have more confidence and they are one of the best teams. They have the chance to win the league.\n\"Playing against Chelsea and Tottenham in four days is too much. We did all the best we could but it was not enough.\"\nWhat next?\nTottenham could put a gap between themselves and third-placed Manchester City with a win at the Etihad next Sunday, while Watford face a short trip to freefalling Crystal Palace.\nThe stats you need to know\nSpurs have had a league-high 72 shots in the first half of games in 2016 so far but they have scored with just four of those.\nKieran Trippier bagged his first Premier League goal in his 43rd appearance.\nDele Alli assisted Trippier's goal just 176 seconds after entering the field of play.\nAlli has had a hand in 11 goals in his last 14 Premier League games for Spurs (six goals, five assists).\nSpurs had 26 shots, their joint-most in a Premier League game this season - level with their tally against Sunderland at home in January.\nThe Hornets have failed to score in four of their last five Premier League games.\nWatford have mustered just one shot on target in their two Premier League games against Spurs in 2015-16."

But from 2-0 up at home and with the way the game was going we should have seen it out.\n\"We will take a lot from the performance but we are disappointed we let a lead slip.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We are never happy with a point, we are not buzzing. But when that point comes after being 2-0 down it gives us confidence and satisfaction.\n\"After Tuesday night (the FA Cup fourth-round replay against Liverpool) when we played 120 minutes, to show that kind of strength, resilience, character and quality makes us happy.\"\n'Psychological damage'\nFormer Norwich striker Chris Sutton said he felt his ex-club would go down if they did not get a win against West Ham. He added: \"I just think if you look at Liverpool when they were 3-1 up and lose, two goals up today, this will do Norwich so much damage psychologically.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Ham have won just one of their last nine Premier League away matches (won one, drew four, lost four).\nNorwich have won none of their last six Premier League games conceding at least twice in each of those games.\nNorwich have conceded 50 Premier League goals this season - a joint-high alongside Sunderland.\nDimitri Payet has scored or assisted 12 Premier League goals this season - twice as many as any other West Ham player.\nBoth of Robbie Brady's Premier League goals for Norwich have been against West Ham.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic is keen for his side to go all out in the FA Cup and their next game sees the Hammers face a trip to Blackburn on Sunday, 21 February (14:00 GMT) in the fifth round of the competition.

The result has done nothing either to boost his chances of keeping his job.\nUnited dominated the final stages of the first half, but other than that they were matched or outplayed by Sunderland, who could have scored more.\nAlan Shearer's verdict on Match of the Day\n\"Manchester United are no further forward than when Louis van Gaal arrived at the club. There has been no progression whatsoever.\n\"So many media outlets have been going on about Jose Mourinho, Not one person from the club has denied it. That must be worrying.\"\nLove appears on Valentine's weekend\nManchester United now have seven defenders injured after they lost Matteo Darmian to a shoulder injury during the first half.\nOn Saturday, the day before Valentine's Day, Van Gaal brought on the appropriately named Donald Love, a Scotland Under-21 international. The former Wigan loanee had a solid performance on his debut at right-back.\nThe 21-year-old joined in United's attack at will and showed he was not overawed when he screamed at captain Wayne Rooney for over-hitting the return ball of a one-two.\nMan of the match - Wahbi Khazri\nThe 25-year-old was brilliant throughout, and caused United plenty of problems even outside of the two goals. On several occasions he dropped back and helped intercept attacks.\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland recorded their first ever Premier League win against Manchester United at the Stadium of Light in their 14th attempt.\nUnited have earned fewer points this season than in any other Premier League campaign after 26 games (41).\nUnited have won none of the past seven league games where they conceded the first goal (D1 L6).\nSunderland attempted more shots (including blocks) versus United than in any other league game this season (21 shots).\nThe Red Devils have collected just six points from their past seven league away games (W1 D3 L3).\nOnly Wayne Rooney (18) has scored or assisted more goals in all competitions for United this season than Anthony Martial (15 - 10 goals, five assists).\nSunderland have gone 12 games without a clean sheet in the league, the longest current run in the division.\n'We deserved to win'\nSunderland boss Sam Allardyce told BBC Match of the Day: \"I thought the result was right. On the balance of chances created, a 2-1 win was no more than we deserved.\n\"It shows the importance of set plays. We've found a lad who delivers a great ball. One, he's scored himself and the second ball for Lamine's goal was quality.\n\"I thought Jermain Defoe was going to make it 2-0 and then Dame N'Doye got in one-on-one. We all prayed he would score. When he missed I wondered if it would be one of those days.\n\"Everyone is very happy at the moment. I've sensed a commitment and a desire and will to get out of the problems.\"\nNext up for both sides...\nSunderland have two weeks until their next game, away to West Ham, and are heading to Dubai next week for warm weather training.\nUnited will have no such luxury, as they face Danish side Midtjylland on Thursday in the Europa League, before an FA Cup tie with Shrewsbury the following Monday and the reverse European tie three days later.\nUnited's next league involvement is at home to Arsenal on Sunday, 28 February."

We couldn't get going in the first half.\nOn Watford penalty: \"We have had situations where Scott Dann is dragged to the ground on regular occasions but nothing given, I am not going to say it was not holding, but to have it on the first corner at the first play was tough.\n\"We know we are on a tricky run and these things go against you on these runs.

It was a fantastic performance.\n\"It was a well deserved three points. We have a great run at the moment. It's a pity we have a break. But it looks like a great season again for us.\"\nSwansea coach Francesco Guidolin: \"Southampton are a strong team in a good period. They played well, with enthusiasm and calm. It's difficult to score a goal against them at the moment. We had a few situations but we deserved only one point today.\"\nAsked about Swansea's late penalty appeal for Yoshida's challenge on Paloschi, he said: \"I don't like speaking about the referee because it's a difficult job.\"\nWhat's coming next?\nSwansea have a two-week break before facing Tottenham away on Sunday, 28 February (14:05 GMT), which is immediately followed by another trip to north London to take on Arsenal on 2 March. Southampton host Chelsea on Saturday, 27 February at 15:00 and then make the short journey to Bournemouth on 1 March.\nThe stats you need to know:\nFraser Forster has a 100% saves-to-shots ratio, the highest of any goalkeeper to have faced 15 or more shots on target.\nSwansea have had just six different scorers in the Premier League this season, fewer than any other team.\nSouthampton have gone nine hours and 14 minutes since they last conceded a Premier League goal.\nSwansea City have hit the woodwork more often than any other team in the league this season (15).",

He was right, but not in the way he would have wanted.\nBy then, his side had suffered a complete collapse at the back which was summed up by Chelsea's second goal.\nThat came from a Newcastle free-kick near the home side's corner flag that was cleared to the halfway line before Aarons' horrendous cross-field pass allowed Pedro to gallop clear.\nMcClaren's side never looked capable of a second-half comeback as they slipped to a fifth successive away defeat.\nAfter the break, Cesc Fabregas set up Pedro for his second and Bertrand Traore turned in Cesar Azpilicueta's cross.\nAndros Townsend's trademark run and finish for his first goal since his \u00a312m move from Tottenham reduced the damage at the end.\nBut Newcastle's goal-difference still took a battering and at -22 it is now the worst in the top flight.\nChelsea's injury problems continue\nChelsea's own defensive problems were of a very different sort.\nWith Kurt Zouma out for the season, the last thing Hiddink needed before a busy fortnight was to see Terry limp off.\nTerry appeared to fall awkwardly after a clash with Magpies striker Aleksandar Mitrovic and will have a scan to assess the severity of his hamstring injury.\nGary Cahill only returned to the starting line-up on Saturday because of Zouma's serious knee injury, but could end up being a key figure at the back for his side in the next few weeks.\nMan of the match - Chelsea's Diego Costa\nHe was playing with a broken nose, but Chelsea's man in the mask did not miss his mark.\nAlong with the impressive Willian, Costa scored one goal and made another but he edged the individual accolade because of his delightful finish to give his side an early lead.\nManager reaction\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"We can be pleased with the performance of the guys. We tried to surprise them in the beginning. Happily it worked out.\n\"It's important for the way we played, not just in attack. The players also have to do defensive work and that is where we are aiming and then the quality comes out.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve McClaren: \"We got exposed on quite a few occasions in terms of defensive frailties. Rolando Aarons had to play at left-back and it was Steven Taylor's second game in six months.\n\"We caused our own problems. We knew Chelsea would come out quick. They wanted to win that game by half-time with the week they have ahead of them.\n\"You get one or two of these games a season. I've told the players don't let that derail us. It was damage limitation by half-time.\n\"I just wanted to make sure we scored a goal and stayed in the game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea are on the current longest unbeaten run in the Premier League - 10 games (won four, drew six).\nNewcastle United have won only two of their last 20 Premier League away games (drew two, lost 16).\nPedro has scored as many Premier League goals versus Newcastle in this match as he did in his previous 19 apps combined (two).\nAll four of Cesc Fabregas' PL assists this season have arrived at Stamford Bridge.\nBertrand Traore is the first player from Burkina Faso to score in the Premier League.\nWhat next?\nNewcastle are out of the FA Cup and their Premier League game with Manchester City on 28 February has been postponed because City are in the Capital One Cup final.\nSo the Magpies do not have a game for 18 days until they travel to Stoke on 2 March, and are heading for a training camp in Spain.\nIn that time, Chelsea play four matches, starting with Tuesday's trip to Paris."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Arsenal 2-1 Leicester City\nDanny Welbeck threw the Premier League title race wide open when he scored a dramatic winner with only seconds left as Arsenal beat leaders Leicester City.\nThe Foxes looked set to hold out for a vital draw as a thrilling game went into injury time, despite being reduced to 10 men after Danny Simpson was sent off for a second yellow card early in the second half.\nThis was until Welbeck, playing his first competitive game since April last year, glanced Mesut Ozil's free-kick past the magnificent Kasper Schmeichel to spark wild celebrations at Emirates Stadium as Leicester lost in the league for just the third time this season.\nJamie Vardy gave the Foxes the lead with a hotly-disputed penalty on the stroke of half-time after he tumbled over Nacho Monreal's outstretched leg.\nSubstitute Theo Walcott then set up a frantic final 20 minutes with a side-foot finish from Olivier Giroud's superb knockdown.\nLeicester still lead the table - but Arsenal's win leaves them only two points clear.\nA decisive day for the title?\nIn those closing seconds, with the Emirates awash with tension and anxiety, it looked like Leicester would secure a point that would feel like a victory to manager Claudio Ranieri and his players.\nIt would have been a draw achieved with a numerical disadvantage at the home of a title rival - and would have given them four precious points from visits to Manchester City and Arsenal.\nInstead, Welbeck's intervention left Ranieri and his men desolate after an outstanding backs-to-the-wall performance, exemplified by the brilliance of keeper Schmeichel as he kept Arsenal at bay, with one late save from Giroud world-class especially notable.\nNow they must bounce back at home to Norwich City in their next game - but why should we question them after what they have shown us this season?\nAs for Arsenal, this result will revive their title hopes as the impact will be just as dramatic for them. It would have felt like a defeat had they not beaten a Leicester side reduced to 10 men for 36 minutes.\nSo the title landscape has changed - but it is still Leicester at the top of the table.\nWelbeck revives Arsenal's challenge\nAs Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger rightly said after the match, his team were looking down the barrel when they trailed at half-time.\nAt that point, they were eight points adrift of the Foxes with only 12 games left after this one - a daunting gap.\nWalcott's equaliser and that injury-time winner from Welbeck, who has been out for almost a year with a knee injury, was reward for their persistence and effort in the second half.\nIt was not just vital in the context of this game, it was crucial in the wider context after a poor run of home form which had seen the Gunners fail to win in four league games - with three draws and a defeat - before last week's win at Bournemouth.\nKante simply outstanding\nN'Golo Kante arrived at Leicester City in early August as an under-the-radar \u00a36m signing from French side Caen - he should now be a contender for Player of the Year.\nWhen Rio Ferdinand is moved to tweet, \"right now Kante is the best tackler/retriever of the ball on the planet\",\n, external\nyou get some idea of just how good he was at the Emirates.\nIn the first 45 minutes in particular, the Paris-born 24-year-old gave a masterclass in the arts Ferdinand was talking about. While the likes of Vardy and Riyad Mahrez have rightly claimed the limelight, Kante has been just as influential in the manner in which he retains and regains possession, helping Leicester to set up those trademark counter-attacks.\nTough day for Atkinson\nReferee Martin Atkinson was left to handle a tidal wave of pressure and emotion, especially after awarding Leicester that penalty.\nIt was a tough call, with Vardy clearly accepting the invitation literally extended by Monreal's outstretched leg.\nVardy bought the penalty but it was understandable to see why he gave it - and it is worth noting former Arsenal legends Lee Dixon and David Seaman tweeted their agreement with the decision.\nArsenal fans were demanding every decision after that - and most supporters around the country would be the same - but Atkinson's decision to send Simpson off for two soft fouls was also correct.\nIt is not just players under stress on these occasions.\nMan of the match - Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester City)\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester still have not won a league game against Arsenal since November 1994 (P19 W0 D6 L13).\nVardy has won six penalties in the Premier League this season; twice as many as any other player. In fact, Vardy has won more penalties alone than all of the other 19 Premier League teams this season.\nThis was the ninth time this season that Vardy has scored the opening goal of a Premier League game - the most of all PL players.\nWalcott's 70th-minute goal was Arsenal's first shot on target in this match, while Welbeck scored their sixth and final effort on target in this game.\nLeicester named an unchanged starting XI for the sixth successive league game - the longest run this season and the longest in the competition since Arsenal (six games) in May 2015.\nWelbeck's goal was Arsenal's 100th goal scored in 90+ minutes of a Premier League game; more than any other side.\nWhat the managers said...\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The effort, energy, intensity was all good. Leicester defended very well but we had bad luck to be 1-0 down at half-time. We were relentless after that - we should have scored more goals.\n\"It was a pivotal moment today because the mathematics meant it could be eight points or it could be two points. That is a great change.\n\"There's a long way to go, we play a lot of big teams. But we had a bad spell where we couldn't win for four games and have now won two on the bounce. We have come out of that bad spell and still have a good chance.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It was a fantastic match, very fast. I don't know if in a normal match that our two yellows cards was a sending off. They were normal fouls, but not yellow cards. I think the referee was too severe to us for the sending off. 11 v 11, I'm sure we win the match. The match was full of fouls so why send off a player? Come on.\n\"We know Arsenal are a fantastic team, they move the ball quickly and have skill, but we had to concentrate. We tried to counter-attack and we controlled the match very well.\n\"We are still top of the table, got two points more - we must carry on and smile. We lost to our opponents - we must say well done.\"\nWhat next?\nArsenal face two cup games in a row as they host Hull in the FA Cup fifth round next Saturday (12:45 GMT) before the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Barcelona at the Emirates the following Tuesday.\nLeicester, who are out of the FA Cup, face Norwich at the King Power Stadium in the Premier League on Saturday, 27 February (15:00 GMT).",

But from 2-0 up at home and with the way the game was going we should have seen it out.\n\"We will take a lot from the performance but we are disappointed we let a lead slip.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We are never happy with a point, we are not buzzing. But when that point comes after being 2-0 down it gives us confidence and satisfaction.\n\"After Tuesday night (the FA Cup fourth-round replay against Liverpool) when we played 120 minutes, to show that kind of strength, resilience, character and quality makes us happy.\"\n'Psychological damage'\nFormer Norwich striker Chris Sutton said he felt his ex-club would go down if they did not get a win against West Ham. He added: \"I just think if you look at Liverpool when they were 3-1 up and lose, two goals up today, this will do Norwich so much damage psychologically.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Ham have won just one of their last nine Premier League away matches (won one, drew four, lost four).\nNorwich have won none of their last six Premier League games conceding at least twice in each of those games.\nNorwich have conceded 50 Premier League goals this season - a joint-high alongside Sunderland.\nDimitri Payet has scored or assisted 12 Premier League goals this season - twice as many as any other West Ham player.\nBoth of Robbie Brady's Premier League goals for Norwich have been against West Ham.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic is keen for his side to go all out in the FA Cup and their next game sees the Hammers face a trip to Blackburn on Sunday, 21 February (14:00 GMT) in the fifth round of the competition. Norwich are not in action until Saturday, 27 February, when they visit Leicester in a 15:00 GMT kick-off."

That is not pessimistic, that is the truth.\n\"It is hard work and you need to be ready for it. We want to change things with work and this was good for the soul. We have needed 26 games to get a positive goal difference.\"\nWhat next?\nLiverpool are next in action when they resume their Europa League campaign with a trip to Augsburg on Thursday, 18 February for the first leg of their last-32 tie.

Only six of those were on target and they have now lost six games at home in the league.\nHaving had 76% possession, they could count themselves unlucky when striking the woodwork twice, but top scorer Romelu Lukaku failed to add to his 16 goals in the top flight, being well shackled by the visitor's defence.\nBarkley tried to exert his influence but with the opposition back line sitting deep, the England international was made to shoot from long range.\nThere were a smattering of boos from the home supporters at the final whistle, frustrated that their side failed to build on their recent good form and dropping to 10th in the table.\nBaggies bounce back with much-needed win\nTony Pulis's side went into the game on the back of a poor run which had seen them looking over their shoulder at the relegation zone, but they did manage to scrape past Peterborough on penalties in the fourth round of the FA Cup in their last game.\nA disciplined display against wave after wave of Everton attacks saw them pick up three points and climb up to 13th in the league, eight points above the drop zone.\nCentre-back Jonas Olsson was the bedrock on which their clean sheet was based, thwarting the Merseysiders throughout the game. The Swede made a match-high 17 clearances and six blocks.\nHaving gone three of their past four games without a shot on target, they needed just one in this match, as Rondon's opportunistic effort from the goalline in the 14th minute gave them victory.\nMan of the match - Jonas Olsson\nWhat they said:\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"We didn't do anything wrong.

The depth of quality within the club is fantastic, they had a great performance to beat Stoke last week and to come here and put in that performance is fantastic.\n\"We played Everton at the beginning of the season and we were 2-0 up and they scored three late goals.

We couldn't get going in the first half.\nOn Watford penalty: \"We have had situations where Scott Dann is dragged to the ground on regular occasions but nothing given, I am not going to say it was not holding, but to have it on the first corner at the first play was tough.\n\"We know we are on a tricky run and these things go against you on these runs. We just have to focus now and get out of this run.

The result has done nothing either to boost his chances of keeping his job.\nUnited dominated the final stages of the first half, but other than that they were matched or outplayed by Sunderland, who could have scored more.\nAlan Shearer's verdict on Match of the Day\n\"Manchester United are no further forward than when Louis van Gaal arrived at the club.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Arsenal 2-1 Leicester City\nDanny Welbeck threw the Premier League title race wide open when he scored a dramatic winner with only seconds left as Arsenal beat leaders Leicester City.\nThe Foxes looked set to hold out for a vital draw as a thrilling game went into injury time, despite being reduced to 10 men after Danny Simpson was sent off for a second yellow card early in the second half.\nThis was until Welbeck, playing his first competitive game since April last year, glanced Mesut Ozil's free-kick past the magnificent Kasper Schmeichel to spark wild celebrations at Emirates Stadium as Leicester lost in the league for just the third time this season.\nJamie Vardy gave the Foxes the lead with a hotly-disputed penalty on the stroke of half-time after he tumbled over Nacho Monreal's outstretched leg.\nSubstitute Theo Walcott then set up a frantic final 20 minutes with a side-foot finish from Olivier Giroud's superb knockdown.\nLeicester still lead the table - but Arsenal's win leaves them only two points clear.\nA decisive day for the title?\nIn those closing seconds, with the Emirates awash with tension and anxiety, it looked like Leicester would secure a point that would feel like a victory to manager Claudio Ranieri and his players.\nIt would have been a draw achieved with a numerical disadvantage at the home of a title rival - and would have given them four precious points from visits to Manchester City and Arsenal.\nInstead, Welbeck's intervention left Ranieri and his men desolate after an outstanding backs-to-the-wall performance, exemplified by the brilliance of keeper Schmeichel as he kept Arsenal at bay, with one late save from Giroud world-class especially notable.\nNow they must bounce back at home to Norwich City in their next game - but why should we question them after what they have shown us this season?\nAs for Arsenal, this result will revive their title hopes as the impact will be just as dramatic for them. It would have felt like a defeat had they not beaten a Leicester side reduced to 10 men for 36 minutes.\nSo the title landscape has changed - but it is still Leicester at the top of the table.\nWelbeck revives Arsenal's challenge\nAs Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger rightly said after the match, his team were looking down the barrel when they trailed at half-time.\nAt that point, they were eight points adrift of the Foxes with only 12 games left after this one - a daunting gap.\nWalcott's equaliser and that injury-time winner from Welbeck, who has been out for almost a year with a knee injury, was reward for their persistence and effort in the second half.\nIt was not just vital in the context of this game, it was crucial in the wider context after a poor run of home form which had seen the Gunners fail to win in four league games - with three draws and a defeat - before last week's win at Bournemouth.\nKante simply outstanding\nN'Golo Kante arrived at Leicester City in early August as an under-the-radar \u00a36m signing from French side Caen - he should now be a contender for Player of the Year.\nWhen Rio Ferdinand is moved to tweet, \"right now Kante is the best tackler/retriever of the ball on the planet\",\n, external\nyou get some idea of just how good he was at the Emirates.\nIn the first 45 minutes in particular, the Paris-born 24-year-old gave a masterclass in the arts Ferdinand was talking about. While the likes of Vardy and Riyad Mahrez have rightly claimed the limelight, Kante has been just as influential in the manner in which he retains and regains possession, helping Leicester to set up those trademark counter-attacks.\nTough day for Atkinson\nReferee Martin Atkinson was left to handle a tidal wave of pressure and emotion, especially after awarding Leicester that penalty.\nIt was a tough call, with Vardy clearly accepting the invitation literally extended by Monreal's outstretched leg.\nVardy bought the penalty but it was understandable to see why he gave it - and it is worth noting former Arsenal legends Lee Dixon and David Seaman tweeted their agreement with the decision.\nArsenal fans were demanding every decision after that - and most supporters around the country would be the same - but Atkinson's decision to send Simpson off for two soft fouls was also correct.\nIt is not just players under stress on these occasions.\nMan of the match - Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester City)\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester still have not won a league game against Arsenal since November 1994 (P19 W0 D6 L13).\nVardy has won six penalties in the Premier League this season; twice as many as any other player. In fact, Vardy has won more penalties alone than all of the other 19 Premier League teams this season.\nThis was the ninth time this season that Vardy has scored the opening goal of a Premier League game - the most of all PL players.\nWalcott's 70th-minute goal was Arsenal's first shot on target in this match, while Welbeck scored their sixth and final effort on target in this game.\nLeicester named an unchanged starting XI for the sixth successive league game - the longest run this season and the longest in the competition since Arsenal (six games) in May 2015.\nWelbeck's goal was Arsenal's 100th goal scored in 90+ minutes of a Premier League game; more than any other side.\nWhat the managers said...\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The effort, energy, intensity was all good. Leicester defended very well but we had bad luck to be 1-0 down at half-time. We were relentless after that - we should have scored more goals.\n\"It was a pivotal moment today because the mathematics meant it could be eight points or it could be two points. That is a great change.\n\"There's a long way to go, we play a lot of big teams. But we had a bad spell where we couldn't win for four games and have now won two on the bounce. We have come out of that bad spell and still have a good chance.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It was a fantastic match, very fast. I don't know if in a normal match that our two yellows cards was a sending off. They were normal fouls, but not yellow cards. I think the referee was too severe to us for the sending off. 11 v 11, I'm sure we win the match. The match was full of fouls so why send off a player? Come on.\n\"We know Arsenal are a fantastic team, they move the ball quickly and have skill, but we had to concentrate. We tried to counter-attack and we controlled the match very well.\n\"We are still top of the table, got two points more - we must carry on and smile. We lost to our opponents - we must say well done.\"\nWhat next?\nArsenal face two cup games in a row as they host Hull in the FA Cup fifth round next Saturday (12:45 GMT) before the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Barcelona at the Emirates the following Tuesday.\nLeicester, who are out of the FA Cup, face Norwich at the King Power Stadium in the Premier League on Saturday, 27 February (15:00 GMT)."

It has hit him on the elbow.\"\nHowever, in a match of few chances, City should ask questions defensively as they levelled before leaving themselves wide open seven minutes from time for Eriksen, on his 24th birthday, to win the match.\nSpoilt for choice, Roy?\nEngland manager Roy Hodgson was at the Etihad and would have welcomed the earlier news of scoring returns for Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge.\nIn the first two games of the day, six of the nine goals scored had been netted by English players and his options before Euro 2016 were further demonstrated in Manchester as Kane scored his 16th Premier League goal of the season.\nThe 11.9km covered by England's 19-year-old midfielder Dele Alli was more than all but one of Manchester City's side, as he continues to impress, while compatriot Eric Dier, 22, was solid in the holding midfield role.\nAnother England forward, Sterling, was quiet for the most part for City, although he did almost break the deadlock with a volley that was bravely blocked by Rose early on.\nMan of the match: Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur)\nManager reaction\nMan City boss Manuel Pellegrini told BBC Sport: \"It was a penalty that referee Mark Clattenburg wanted to sign for and he gave the sign. It was absolutely the wrong decision, it hit the back of Raheem Sterling then his elbow. Sterling was not even seeing the ball. It was the same referee in the first game where there were two clear goals in offside and we lost 4-1.\n\"It was the key moment that decided thee game; before that they did not shoot towards our goal and did not have any chances. We took the risks, the spirit of the team was good but it was not enough.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"I think that it was a game that was very important. You could feel it was not a normal game and a real test for us; for that we feel very pleased for the players.\n\"The mentality was good and a perfect performance against a team with a lot of quality players who are top class. Full credit to my players.\n\"From my point of view, I did not see the penalty incident.

It was a fantastic performance.\n\"It was a well deserved three points. We have a great run at the moment. It's a pity we have a break. But it looks like a great season again for us.\"\nSwansea coach Francesco Guidolin: \"Southampton are a strong team in a good period. They played well, with enthusiasm and calm. It's difficult to score a goal against them at the moment. We had a few situations but we deserved only one point today.\"\nAsked about Swansea's late penalty appeal for Yoshida's challenge on Paloschi, he said: \"I don't like speaking about the referee because it's a difficult job.\"\nWhat's coming next?\nSwansea have a two-week break before facing Tottenham away on Sunday, 28 February (14:05 GMT), which is immediately followed by another trip to north London to take on Arsenal on 2 March. Southampton host Chelsea on Saturday, 27 February at 15:00 and then make the short journey to Bournemouth on 1 March.\nThe stats you need to know:\nFraser Forster has a 100% saves-to-shots ratio, the highest of any goalkeeper to have faced 15 or more shots on target.\nSwansea have had just six different scorers in the Premier League this season, fewer than any other team.\nSouthampton have gone nine hours and 14 minutes since they last conceded a Premier League goal.\nSwansea City have hit the woodwork more often than any other team in the league this season (15)."

So with a estimated \u00a3100m guaranteed for retaining top-flight status, you cannot blame Quique Sanchez Flores' men for appearing to drop down a gear.\nNevertheless, there is pride at stake, and for Ighalo, the honour of finishing as the division's top scorer. The Nigerian has 14 goals - five goals fewer than Leicester's Jamie Vardy - but has not found the net only once in the league since 28 December.\nHad the 26-year-old been at his sharpest he would have scored inside the first minute instead of firing at Boruc. He also headed over inexplicably in the second half and then again missed the target after Ben Watson's quick thinking from a free-kick gave him another good opportunity.\nWhen will his rotten run come to an end?\nCherries could have nicked it\nFlores will no doubt think his side should have won the match, but so will counterpart Eddie Howe.\nGradel, who came on for the injured Junior Stanislas in the 21st minute, had a header and looping shot saved by Gomes. The Brazilian keeper then made a fantastic stop to prevent Harry Arter's swerving shot from bursting the net.\nOne incident that is certain to be discussed was the handball by Watford's Valon Behrami from a corner. Intentional? Referee Anthony Taylor did not think so.\nThe point moves Bournemouth further away from the bottom three. Aside from good forward play, the defence limited Watford to few clear-cut chances. Repeat all-round displays should see them safe.\nMan of the match - Heurelho Gomes (Watford)\nManager reaction\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe:\n\"We should have won. We were excellent in long spells of the game. But it's a clean sheet and a point.\n\"Any point gained away from home is a valuable one. However, Gomes did make some wonderful saves today.\n\"I thought it was a penalty when Behrami handled. The ref had a good game though. The speed of which the ball flies around you, you have sympathy. But from my angle it looked a penalty.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores:\n\"When you don't win it's important to get a point. We are closer to the 40-point mark.\n\"I don't worry about Ighalo not scoring. He gets chances. All the players do need to contribute but we are creating chances - 0-0 is fair enough.\n\"Our next match is against Man United. They are strong. We have to go into the match knowing this will be tough.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford had just one shot on target against Bournemouth; only against Southampton (0) in August have they attempted fewer at Vicarage Road this season\nThe Hornets have failed to score in five of their last seven Premier League matches\nBournemouth have lost just one of their last eight Premier League away games (W3 D4 L1)\nWatford recorded just their second clean sheet in 10 Premier League games\nKeeper Gomes made more passes than any other Watford player versus Bournemouth (37)\nWhat next?\nWatford are at Manchester United on Wednesday 2 March, and Bournemouth host south coast rivals Southampton a day earlier.",

The linesman is the closest to the situation. If it is a fault by Kenedy then you have to listen to the linesman. That's why you have linesmen - to help you,\" Koeman said.\nWhen asked about his view, Hiddink said: \"There are many duels and referees in England usually let a lot of duels go.\"\nMan of the match - Branislav Ivanovic\nManager reaction:\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"I think it was a deserved win for us.

We were well organised and then got the goals.\"\nOn replacing Baba Rahman, whose mistake led to Southampton's goal, at half-time: \"I don't want to make a fake injury.

As the clock ticked down, the hosts had only managed two shots on target - both from distance, both dealt with by John Ruddy.\nEnter Ulloa, who arrived at the back post to convert into an empty net after Albrighton's low cross had crucially been poked past Ruddy by Jamie Vardy.\nIf champions find a way to win when they are not at their best, then Leicester have hinted at another reason why the Premier League title could be coming their way.\nCruel on the Canaries\nIt was so cruel on Norwich, who arrived at the King Power with the perfect plan to prevent Leicester from the sort of pacy counter-attacks that have carried them to the top of the league.\nVardy was given no space behind the defence and was largely anonymous, while the tricky Mahrez, bar a couple of jinking runs, was often crowded out.\nBut Norwich did not only defend - they had opportunities to win it.\nJerome should have scored when he climbed highest to meet a first-half corner, while Redmond fizzed a shot past the post from long range with home goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel beaten.\nMore of the same?\nWhile Leicester can revel in a dramatic win that keeps their unlikely title bid on track, they must also consider how to better cope when teams set up in the same manner as the Canaries.\nThis was only the third time this season that Leicester had the most possession in a Premier League match as Norwich were happy to concede the ball in order to not leave the sort of space in which Vardy and Mahrez have thrived.\nIn their final 11 fixtures, Leicester will face only three clubs in the current top nine, and perhaps plenty of others willing to follow the template set by the Canaries.\nUlloa's late winner was further evidence of the momentum and belief that has carried Claudio Ranieri's men this far in a remarkable story, but problems that the Foxes may yet encounter had already been revealed.\nMan of the match - Leonardo Ulloa\nWhat they said\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"It was a difficult match. Norwich played well and closed the space, but we believed until the end. This victory was very important to restart after the Arsenal defeat.\n\"I said before the Arsenal match that Norwich would be more difficult. Both teams could have scored a goal in the final 20 minutes.\n\"The conclusion I have drawn from this is that my players believe until the end. That, for me, is very important. If the other teams start to win, they can win all the matches. But for us, the next match is always the final match. That is our mentality.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"I don't think we deserved that. In the game we had good chances and defensively we were solid.\n\"We kept Vardy and Mahrez quiet and we certainly deserved something. There are a lot of things to take from it.\n\"We have a game on Tuesday and we'll get it out of our system before then.\"\nThe stats\nLeicester did not record a shot on target until the 58th minute\nNorwich's only shot on target in this game came in the 43rd minute\nLeicester have won four of their last five games\nTwo of Leonardo Ulloa's three Premier League goals this season have come as a sub\nNorwich have taken one point from their last seven Premier League games\nThe Canaries have gone 14 Premier League games on the road without a clean sheet\nLeicester have conceded only four goals in their last nine Premier League games\nWhat next?\nLeicester welcome West Brom to the King Power on Tuesday, while Norwich entertain Chelsea on the same night.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "West Bromwich Albion 3-2 Crystal Palace\nSaido Berahino scored his first Premier League goal since October as West Brom held on to win against Crystal Palace.\nThe Baggies forward, who apologised on Friday for his strike threat earlier in the season, scored a cushioned volley from Stephane Sessegnon's pass.\nThat put the hosts in charge after Craig Gardner tucked in a rebound and Craig Dawson's header.\nConnor Wickham scored twice to make it a nervy ending but Palace's winless league run now stretches to 10 games.\nWest Brom dominated the first half, but in a fluctuating game Palace almost stole a point when Scott Dann's late header was cleared off the line by Gardner.\nAlan Pardew's side have only won games in the FA Cup in 2016, and despite an improved second half at the Hawthorns, where they also had two penalty appeals turned down, they ultimately paid for a poor start.\nAfter going through their own sticky patch, Tony Pulis' team have now strung together consecutive league victories for the first time since the turn of the year.\nRelive West Brom's dramatic win over Palace\nWere West Brom galvanised by Brunt incident?\nUnlike Palace, the Baggies were knocked out of the FA Cup by Reading, a defeat which was soured when Chris Brunt was hit by a coin thrown by a West Brom fan.\nThat led to supporters rallying around the Northern Irish international by collecting money for a charity of Brunt's choice before this match and singing his name in the 11th minutes to coincide with his shirt number.\nBut those cheers were overshadowed when the hosts took the lead as Berahino played in Salomon Rondon, whose shot was saved by Wayne Hennessey before Gardner tucked in.\nSessegnon then helped push West Brom further ahead. First he won the free-kick which Gardner curled on to the head of Dawson.\nThe Benin international's sumptuous pass then found Berahino for a goal which went some way to making up for his petulant behaviour over the course of the season.\nThe only blot in an almost-perfect first half for West Brom was the sight of Brunt being taken off after he seemed to jar his knee while racing for the ball.\nPalace improve but slump continues\nLast time Palace won a Premier League fixture - on 19 December - they were sixth in the table with commentators speculating about their European ambitions.\nSince then, their league form has been terrible, recording only three draws in a 10-game winless run.\nWest Brom's front three did combine successfully in the first half but the Palace defence offered little resistance, and Emmanuel Adebayor was replaced at the break after a limited contribution.\nPalace's toils have coincided with a hip injury to Yannick Bolasie, and once he came on at half-time the game swung in the visitors' favour.\nMuch of that was down to Olsson's error after the centre-back misjudged Joe Ledley's deep header before it reached goalkeeper Ben Foster, allowing Wickham to nip in and score his second of the season.\nDespite the Baggies twice hitting the woodwork through Gardner and Berahino, Palace will argue they had two penalty appeals waved away. First, Gareth McAuley pushed over Scott Dann as he jumped for a header and Darren Fletcher seemed to bump into Bolasie.\nOnce Wickham fired in wonderfully following a deep free-kick it looked like they might force an equaliser, but West Brom stood firm.\nMan of the match - Stephane Sessegnon\nManager reaction\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"For the first 30 minutes they swamped us with aggression and power. Their front two caused us problems but our front two didn't and our distribution wasn't good.\n\"The first half was a shock to me, the goals went in quickly, and it knocked our confidence. In the second half we were a completely different side.\"\nOn the penalty appeals: \"[The Scott Dann push] was a blatant penalty, I could see it from where I was. Scott was barged in the back, but we never seem to get those calls as we are a big side. Yannick Bolasie was good when he came on and he let it run across him [for his penalty appeal] but the guy took his legs.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"We have 11 games to get over the line and it's been an eventful season in many ways.\n\"Saido has taken most of the time with what has happened and we have missed him and James Morrison and now Chris Brunt. Overall, the team have done fantastically to get to 35 points with 11 games to go.\"\nStats you need to know\nWest Brom scored as many goals in the opening 20 minutes v Palace (two) as they had in their previous five Premier League games\nThe Baggies scored three-plus goals in a Premier League game for only the second time in their last 59 attempts\nIn his 240th Premier League appearance, Craig Gardner has scored and assisted in the same game for the first time\nConnor Wickham scored more than once in a Premier League game for the first time since April 2014\nAlan Pardew's teams have only kept three clean sheets in his last 34 post-New Year games in the Premier League\nWhat next?\nWest Brom face a tough trip to table-toppers Leicester on Tuesday before a home game against Manchester United the following Sunday.

While they did pull one goal back when Bacuna slotted in as Stoke appealed for handball against Rudy Gestede in the build-up, they never looked like taking anything from the game.\nApart from Bacuna's strike, the only occasions when a Villa player looked like putting the ball in the net was when defender Jores Okore twice nearly scored own goals, both times being spared by excellent saves from Mark Bunn.\nIt might be stating the obvious but relegation is surely a certainty.\nStoke stay on course for successive top-10 finishes\nMark Hughes' side went into this game on the same points total as this stage last season and the victory keeps them on target for another top-10 finish.\nAfter three successive 3-0 losses in the league, Stoke have rebounded by beating Bournemouth and Aston Villa and look again like one of the Premier League's most stubborn opponents.\nArnautovic was their catalyst throughout, creating their best openings in a poor first half before netting both their goals as the Potters effectively won the game in the first 15 minutes of the second period.\nWhile Stoke's set-pieces were often poor, they were always a threat from the flanks in open play. Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri - who created the second goal - were frequent providers as the home team sent over 26 crosses.\nHosting Newcastle on Wednesday - another team in the bottom three - gives Stoke the chance to keep up the momentum.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic (Stoke)\nManagers' reaction\nStoke boss Mark Hughes speaking to BBC Sport: \"We needed to be a little more dynamic in the second half and we were.\n\"At 2-0 we were quite comfortable and cruising to a conclusion. The referee should have given a free-kick to ourselves [in the build-up to Aston Villa's goal] but at 2-1... that was a threat to us but all in all I felt we coped with it.\n\"Every time we have had a little blip we have bounced back very quickly and we have done that today.\"\nAston Villa boss Remi Garde, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The players did what they can.\n\"The first 45 minutes we were OK and defended well.

Only six of those were on target and they have now lost six games at home in the league.\nHaving had 76% possession, they could count themselves unlucky when striking the woodwork twice, but top scorer Romelu Lukaku failed to add to his 16 goals in the top flight, being well shackled by the visitor's defence.\nBarkley tried to exert his influence but with the opposition back line sitting deep, the England international was made to shoot from long range.\nThere were a smattering of boos from the home supporters at the final whistle, frustrated that their side failed to build on their recent good form and dropping to 10th in the table.\nBaggies bounce back with much-needed win\nTony Pulis's side went into the game on the back of a poor run which had seen them looking over their shoulder at the relegation zone, but they did manage to scrape past Peterborough on penalties in the fourth round of the FA Cup in their last game.\nA disciplined display against wave after wave of Everton attacks saw them pick up three points and climb up to 13th in the league, eight points above the drop zone.\nCentre-back Jonas Olsson was the bedrock on which their clean sheet was based, thwarting the Merseysiders throughout the game. The Swede made a match-high 17 clearances and six blocks.\nHaving gone three of their past four games without a shot on target, they needed just one in this match, as Rondon's opportunistic effort from the goalline in the 14th minute gave them victory.\nMan of the match - Jonas Olsson\nWhat they said:\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"We didn't do anything wrong. Their one shot on target ends up in the back of the net.\n\"The effort and the way that we play the game I couldn't fault.

As the clock ticked down, the hosts had only managed two shots on target - both from distance, both dealt with by John Ruddy.\nEnter Ulloa, who arrived at the back post to convert into an empty net after Albrighton's low cross had crucially been poked past Ruddy by Jamie Vardy.\nIf champions find a way to win when they are not at their best, then Leicester have hinted at another reason why the Premier League title could be coming their way.\nCruel on the Canaries\nIt was so cruel on Norwich, who arrived at the King Power with the perfect plan to prevent Leicester from the sort of pacy counter-attacks that have carried them to the top of the league.\nVardy was given no space behind the defence and was largely anonymous, while the tricky Mahrez, bar a couple of jinking runs, was often crowded out.\nBut Norwich did not only defend - they had opportunities to win it.\nJerome should have scored when he climbed highest to meet a first-half corner, while Redmond fizzed a shot past the post from long range with home goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel beaten.\nMore of the same?\nWhile Leicester can revel in a dramatic win that keeps their unlikely title bid on track, they must also consider how to better cope when teams set up in the same manner as the Canaries.\nThis was only the third time this season that Leicester had the most possession in a Premier League match as Norwich were happy to concede the ball in order to not leave the sort of space in which Vardy and Mahrez have thrived.\nIn their final 11 fixtures, Leicester will face only three clubs in the current top nine, and perhaps plenty of others willing to follow the template set by the Canaries.\nUlloa's late winner was further evidence of the momentum and belief that has carried Claudio Ranieri's men this far in a remarkable story, but problems that the Foxes may yet encounter had already been revealed.\nMan of the match - Leonardo Ulloa\nWhat they said\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"It was a difficult match. Norwich played well and closed the space, but we believed until the end. This victory was very important to restart after the Arsenal defeat.\n\"I said before the Arsenal match that Norwich would be more difficult. Both teams could have scored a goal in the final 20 minutes.\n\"The conclusion I have drawn from this is that my players believe until the end. That, for me, is very important. If the other teams start to win, they can win all the matches. But for us, the next match is always the final match. That is our mentality.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"I don't think we deserved that. In the game we had good chances and defensively we were solid.\n\"We kept Vardy and Mahrez quiet and we certainly deserved something. There are a lot of things to take from it.\n\"We have a game on Tuesday and we'll get it out of our system before then.\"\nThe stats\nLeicester did not record a shot on target until the 58th minute\nNorwich's only shot on target in this game came in the 43rd minute\nLeicester have won four of their last five games\nTwo of Leonardo Ulloa's three Premier League goals this season have come as a sub\nNorwich have taken one point from their last seven Premier League games\nThe Canaries have gone 14 Premier League games on the road without a clean sheet\nLeicester have conceded only four goals in their last nine Premier League games\nWhat next?\nLeicester welcome West Brom to the King Power on Tuesday, while Norwich entertain Chelsea on the same night.",

The linesman is the closest to the situation. If it is a fault by Kenedy then you have to listen to the linesman. That's why you have linesmen - to help you,\" Koeman said.\nWhen asked about his view, Hiddink said: \"There are many duels and referees in England usually let a lot of duels go.\"\nMan of the match - Branislav Ivanovic\nManager reaction:\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"I think it was a deserved win for us.

Mark Noble's first-half strike was palmed on to the bar after a brilliant reflex save from Mannone while Carroll's fierce shot from close range cannoned off the top of the goal.\n\"They had a couple of chances but if we are counting them, we deserved to win the game,\" Bilic said.\n\"I was hoping to score again so we could play more freely but we didn't. We didn't have a great game but we deserved to win and are happy about it.\"\n'We must get over performing but not winning'\nSunderland came into Saturday's game after a two-week break, having beaten Manchester United 2-1 in their last Premier League outing.\nDespite a warm-weather training trip to Dubai, the Black Cats looked sluggish in the first-half against the Hammers and failed to register a shot on target.\nBut they showed spirit after the break, with Jermain Defoe twice volleying wide early after the restart and Rodwell making an instant impact off the bench.\nAdrian saved well with his leg after Rodwell's first effort, and the England international then saw his strike from close range ricochet off the goalkeeper and on to his arm.\nAnd manager Sam Allardyce, on his return to his former club, was left frustrated by the missed chances.\n\"The bottom line is we haven't scored. Not converting chances is costly and it's a victory lost on chances created,\" said Allardyce. \"Getting back in the game and getting the draw was at least what we deserved.\n\"We've got to get results.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "West Bromwich Albion 3-2 Crystal Palace\nSaido Berahino scored his first Premier League goal since October as West Brom held on to win against Crystal Palace.\nThe Baggies forward, who apologised on Friday for his strike threat earlier in the season, scored a cushioned volley from Stephane Sessegnon's pass.\nThat put the hosts in charge after Craig Gardner tucked in a rebound and Craig Dawson's header.\nConnor Wickham scored twice to make it a nervy ending but Palace's winless league run now stretches to 10 games.\nWest Brom dominated the first half, but in a fluctuating game Palace almost stole a point when Scott Dann's late header was cleared off the line by Gardner.\nAlan Pardew's side have only won games in the FA Cup in 2016, and despite an improved second half at the Hawthorns, where they also had two penalty appeals turned down, they ultimately paid for a poor start.\nAfter going through their own sticky patch, Tony Pulis' team have now strung together consecutive league victories for the first time since the turn of the year.\nRelive West Brom's dramatic win over Palace\nWere West Brom galvanised by Brunt incident?\nUnlike Palace, the Baggies were knocked out of the FA Cup by Reading, a defeat which was soured when Chris Brunt was hit by a coin thrown by a West Brom fan.\nThat led to supporters rallying around the Northern Irish international by collecting money for a charity of Brunt's choice before this match and singing his name in the 11th minutes to coincide with his shirt number.\nBut those cheers were overshadowed when the hosts took the lead as Berahino played in Salomon Rondon, whose shot was saved by Wayne Hennessey before Gardner tucked in.\nSessegnon then helped push West Brom further ahead. First he won the free-kick which Gardner curled on to the head of Dawson.\nThe Benin international's sumptuous pass then found Berahino for a goal which went some way to making up for his petulant behaviour over the course of the season.\nThe only blot in an almost-perfect first half for West Brom was the sight of Brunt being taken off after he seemed to jar his knee while racing for the ball.\nPalace improve but slump continues\nLast time Palace won a Premier League fixture - on 19 December - they were sixth in the table with commentators speculating about their European ambitions.\nSince then, their league form has been terrible, recording only three draws in a 10-game winless run.\nWest Brom's front three did combine successfully in the first half but the Palace defence offered little resistance, and Emmanuel Adebayor was replaced at the break after a limited contribution.\nPalace's toils have coincided with a hip injury to Yannick Bolasie, and once he came on at half-time the game swung in the visitors' favour.\nMuch of that was down to Olsson's error after the centre-back misjudged Joe Ledley's deep header before it reached goalkeeper Ben Foster, allowing Wickham to nip in and score his second of the season.\nDespite the Baggies twice hitting the woodwork through Gardner and Berahino, Palace will argue they had two penalty appeals waved away. First, Gareth McAuley pushed over Scott Dann as he jumped for a header and Darren Fletcher seemed to bump into Bolasie.\nOnce Wickham fired in wonderfully following a deep free-kick it looked like they might force an equaliser, but West Brom stood firm.\nMan of the match - Stephane Sessegnon\nManager reaction\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"For the first 30 minutes they swamped us with aggression and power. Their front two caused us problems but our front two didn't and our distribution wasn't good.\n\"The first half was a shock to me, the goals went in quickly, and it knocked our confidence. In the second half we were a completely different side.\"\nOn the penalty appeals: \"[The Scott Dann push] was a blatant penalty, I could see it from where I was. Scott was barged in the back, but we never seem to get those calls as we are a big side. Yannick Bolasie was good when he came on and he let it run across him [for his penalty appeal] but the guy took his legs.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"We have 11 games to get over the line and it's been an eventful season in many ways.\n\"Saido has taken most of the time with what has happened and we have missed him and James Morrison and now Chris Brunt. Overall, the team have done fantastically to get to 35 points with 11 games to go.\"\nStats you need to know\nWest Brom scored as many goals in the opening 20 minutes v Palace (two) as they had in their previous five Premier League games\nThe Baggies scored three-plus goals in a Premier League game for only the second time in their last 59 attempts\nIn his 240th Premier League appearance, Craig Gardner has scored and assisted in the same game for the first time\nConnor Wickham scored more than once in a Premier League game for the first time since April 2014\nAlan Pardew's teams have only kept three clean sheets in his last 34 post-New Year games in the Premier League\nWhat next?\nWest Brom face a tough trip to table-toppers Leicester on Tuesday before a home game against Manchester United the following Sunday.

Of course, Ferdinand is being facetious. And of course Arsenal want to win the title.\nBut, against an under-strength and youthful home side, the Gunners blew another opportunity to demonstrate their title credentials.\nWith leaders Leicester snatching a late win on Saturday, and second-placed Tottenham fighting back against Swansea, Arsene Wenger's side lost valuable ground on their title rivals.\nAnd it ended a miserable week for the Frenchman, who saw his side falter in three competitions.\nWenger watched his team labour to an FA Cup draw against Championship side Hull, then put themselves on the brink of a Champions League exit at the hands of Barcelona.\n\"This is a fight where you keep going even when disappointment is there. Let's show we are prepared for the fight,\" he said.\nRashford makes his Marc again...\nBarely anyone outside Old Trafford had heard of Marcus Rashford less than week ago - now the teenage United striker is a household name across the country.\nTwo goals on his senior debut in the Europa League against Midtjylland catapulted him into the national spotlight.\nBut, many asked, how would he fare against a league title-chasing side in the heat of a battle between two fierce rivals? Coolly, calmly and clinically, as it turned out.\nRashford showed signs of his youthful exuberance in the early stages, darting inside a pair of Arsenal defenders from the left touchline before being hauled down on the edge of the penalty area.\nThe opportunity of that set-piece was not taken by the Red Devils, but it mattered little as Rashford soon put them into a two-goal lead.\nThe young Mancunian pounced on a poor clearance by Arsenal centre-back Gabriel to slot in his first Premier League goal, then waltzed into space to powerfully head in Jesse Lingard's floated cross.\nBut it was not just his finishing that caught the eye. Rashford showed great awareness and composure to pick out the run of Herrera, whose 20-yard shot took a wicked deflection off Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny.\nNo wonder he was given a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd when he was replaced in the 80th minute.\nVan Gaal takes a tumble\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal fell over in front of the fourth official in what was described as \"the comedy moment of the season\" by BBC Radio 5 live commentator Conor McNamara.\nThe Dutchman, who rarely leaves his seat in the dugout during matches, appeared to be frustrated by an alleged dive by Gunners striker Alexis Sanchez.\n\"I have had a lot of criticism because I am sitting on my bench and now I am off my bench and I have lot of criticism because I'm doing that,\" Van Gaal said.\nGrim up north for the Gunners...\nArsenal have not enjoyed their Premier League visits to Old Trafford in recent seasons, failing to pick up three points there since September 2006.\n, external\nAnd many felt the Gunners needed to finally win at Old Trafford if they are going to end an even longer barren run - becoming the English champions.\nThe opportunity to beat United was probably the easiest for Arsenal than any other time during Arsene Wenger's 20-year reign.\nBut their defensive errors cost them dearly.\n\"I cannot fault the commitment and desire but unfortunately we conceded two easy goals,\" said Wenger afterwards.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford\nStats of the day\nRashford, aged 18 years and 120 days, is exactly the same age as Wayne Rooney was on the day that they both scored their first Premier League brace\nRashford is one of only six players to have had a hand in three goals on their Premier League debut\nArsenal have won none and lost seven of their past nine league trips to Old Trafford\nMesut Ozil assisted for the 18th occasion this season in the league - only Thierry Henry (20 in 2002-03) has more in a single campaign\nOzil scored and assisted in the same league away game for only the second time\nArsenal have only won two of their past eight league away matches (W2 D3 L3) - this following a run of 12 away matches where they won 10\nManchester United have now won back-to-back Premier League home games for the first time since September\nWhat's next?\nA couple of days rest and then straight back into Premier League action.

Pochettino must hope that the midfielder is in better shape for Wednesday's trip to West Ham.\nSwansea show fight\nFrancesco Guidolin will have been cheered with the spirit his side showed - which was just the pick-me-up that the Swansea manager needed as he battles a chest infection.\nHis side showed attacking guile on their occasional breaks forward, while Paloschi took his goal smartly to score for the first time since his move from Chievo in January.\nThat came after Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris made a superb early save to tip over Gylfi Sigurdsson's shot from six yards, and the France international was alert too late in the game to beat out another Paloschi shot.\nGuidolin, though will feel a sense of frustration that his team were unable to get anything from the game after leading with 20 minutes left.\nIt means that, after four league games without victory, Swansea remain only three points above the relegation zone.

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "West Ham United 1-0 Sunderland\nWest Ham extended their unbeaten home run to 13 games with a win over Sunderland, who missed the opportunity to climb out of the relegation zone.\nMichail Antonio's first-half goal, his fifth in 15 starts for the club, proved the difference.\nThe forward weaved into the box and struck low into the bottom corner of Vito Mannone's goal.\nJack Rodwell had the ball in the net for Sunderland in the second half but he handled it in the build-up.\nSubstitute Rodwell also saw a second effort go over the bar after a superb last-ditch tackle from Hammers full-back Sam Byram, while Andy Carroll's volley smashed off the cross bar at the other end.\nIt means Sam Allardyce's side remain second from bottom on 23 points, one behind Newcastle and Norwich.\nWest Ham move up to fifth place on 43 points - their highest total after 27 Premier League games.\nRelive West Ham's win over Sunderland\nSaturday's football action and reaction\nWhy did Antonio celebrate like Homer Simpson?\nDavid Pleat's half-time sing along on Radio 5 live\nA happy home for the Hammers\nWest Ham have only six home games remaining before their move to the Olympic Stadium and they are making the most of their time left at the Boleyn Ground.\nSlaven Bilic's side have won eight and drawn five of their last 13 games on home soil - their last defeat coming against Bournemouth in August.\nIt was not a performance to remember for the Hammers, off the back of their 5-1 demolition of Blackburn in the FA Cup, but Antonio took his goal superbly in the first half and they withstood a Sunderland revival after the break.\nAfter being gifted the ball by a Patrick van Aanholt error, Antonio scrambled his way past the Sunderland defence and switched to his right foot before curling home.\nThe hosts were twice denied by the woodwork as well. Mark Noble's first-half strike was palmed on to the bar after a brilliant reflex save from Mannone while Carroll's fierce shot from close range cannoned off the top of the goal.\n\"They had a couple of chances but if we are counting them, we deserved to win the game,\" Bilic said.\n\"I was hoping to score again so we could play more freely but we didn't. We didn't have a great game but we deserved to win and are happy about it.\"\n'We must get over performing but not winning'\nSunderland came into Saturday's game after a two-week break, having beaten Manchester United 2-1 in their last Premier League outing.\nDespite a warm-weather training trip to Dubai, the Black Cats looked sluggish in the first-half against the Hammers and failed to register a shot on target.\nBut they showed spirit after the break, with Jermain Defoe twice volleying wide early after the restart and Rodwell making an instant impact off the bench.\nAdrian saved well with his leg after Rodwell's first effort, and the England international then saw his strike from close range ricochet off the goalkeeper and on to his arm.\nAnd manager Sam Allardyce, on his return to his former club, was left frustrated by the missed chances.\n\"The bottom line is we haven't scored. Not converting chances is costly and it's a victory lost on chances created,\" said Allardyce. \"Getting back in the game and getting the draw was at least what we deserved.\n\"We've got to get results. We have to catch up as we have no chance otherwise. We've got to get over this trait of performing but not winning.\"\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio\nThe stats you need to know\nMichail Antonio has scored in each of his last three games at Upton Park in all competitions.\nVito Mannone has conceded in all 10 of his appearances for Sunderland this season in all competitions (18 goals).\nThe woodwork was hit three times during the game, the joint-most in a Premier League game this season.\nWest Ham have conceded just four goals in their last eight home games, keeping five clean sheets in that spell.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham welcome Tottenham on Wednesday, while Sunderland host Crystal Palace on Tuesday (both 19:45 GMT)",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Swansea City\nTottenham moved back to within two points of Premier League leaders Leicester after battling back from behind to beat a dogged Swansea side.\nAlberto Paloschi gave the visitors the lead after Angel Rangel's shot fell to him via team-mate Jack Cork.\nSwansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski made a series of superb saves, before Nacer Chadli deflected in Kyle Walker's shot to equalise with 20 minutes left.\nDanny Rose then drove in the winner after Swansea failed to clear a corner.\nSpurs show title character\nHopes have been growing at White Hart Lane of a first league title since 1961, but the pressure was on to beat struggling Swansea after Leicester opened up a five-point lead with a victory over Norwich on Saturday.\nMauricio Pochettino's side were utterly dominant - managing 34 shots at goal to Swansea's 10 - but were frustrated by determined defending and brilliant goalkeeping.\nSpurs could have forgiven for thinking it was not going to be their day, particularly when the outstanding Fabianski dived acrobatically to his right to claw out Christian Eriksen's free-kick early in the second half.\nFabianski had earlier made an excellent stop to deny Harry Kane from close range, but was finally beaten as substitute Chadli struck and Rose added his first goal of the season.\nFor Pochettino, it was a sign that his players have the character to force victories when fortune appears to be against them.\nDele drama\nPochettino's side secured a sixth successive league victory to keep the pressure on Leicester - on a day when neighbours Arsenal lost ground with a defeat at Manchester United.\nThe concern for Tottenham's manager is that his key players steer clear of injury as the attempt to juggle domestic demands with the Europa League.\nEngland forward Kane was patched up to play in a face mask after missing Thursday's victory over Fiorentina with a broken nose.\nThere was concern too before kick-off as midfielder Dele Alli, an inspirational figure for them this season, turned his ankle in the warm-up.\nAlli was able to play the full game, but did not look at his best. Pochettino must hope that the midfielder is in better shape for Wednesday's trip to West Ham.\nSwansea show fight\nFrancesco Guidolin will have been cheered with the spirit his side showed - which was just the pick-me-up that the Swansea manager needed as he battles a chest infection.\nHis side showed attacking guile on their occasional breaks forward, while Paloschi took his goal smartly to score for the first time since his move from Chievo in January.\nThat came after Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris made a superb early save to tip over Gylfi Sigurdsson's shot from six yards, and the France international was alert too late in the game to beat out another Paloschi shot.\nGuidolin, though will feel a sense of frustration that his team were unable to get anything from the game after leading with 20 minutes left.\nIt means that, after four league games without victory, Swansea remain only three points above the relegation zone. Matches against Norwich, Bournemouth and Aston Villa in March will go a long way towards deciding their fate.\nMan of the match\nWhat they said\nTottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino: \"Fabianski was great.

While they did pull one goal back when Bacuna slotted in as Stoke appealed for handball against Rudy Gestede in the build-up, they never looked like taking anything from the game.\nApart from Bacuna's strike, the only occasions when a Villa player looked like putting the ball in the net was when defender Jores Okore twice nearly scored own goals, both times being spared by excellent saves from Mark Bunn.\nIt might be stating the obvious but relegation is surely a certainty.\nStoke stay on course for successive top-10 finishes\nMark Hughes' side went into this game on the same points total as this stage last season and the victory keeps them on target for another top-10 finish.\nAfter three successive 3-0 losses in the league, Stoke have rebounded by beating Bournemouth and Aston Villa and look again like one of the Premier League's most stubborn opponents.\nArnautovic was their catalyst throughout, creating their best openings in a poor first half before netting both their goals as the Potters effectively won the game in the first 15 minutes of the second period.\nWhile Stoke's set-pieces were often poor, they were always a threat from the flanks in open play. Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri - who created the second goal - were frequent providers as the home team sent over 26 crosses.\nHosting Newcastle on Wednesday - another team in the bottom three - gives Stoke the chance to keep up the momentum.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic (Stoke)\nManagers' reaction\nStoke boss Mark Hughes speaking to BBC Sport: \"We needed to be a little more dynamic in the second half and we were.\n\"At 2-0 we were quite comfortable and cruising to a conclusion. The referee should have given a free-kick to ourselves [in the build-up to Aston Villa's goal] but at 2-1... that was a threat to us but all in all I felt we coped with it.\n\"Every time we have had a little blip we have bounced back very quickly and we have done that today.\"\nAston Villa boss Remi Garde, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The players did what they can.\n\"The first 45 minutes we were OK and defended well. We tried to do our best but we started the second half too poorly and when you are 2-0 down it is over.\n\"When you are bottom of the table it is difficult to play with full confidence. The fans were behind the team. We don't have enough quality properly.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMarko Arnautovic has scored six Premier League goals at the Britannia this season, twice as many as any other player.\nThe Potters have now won five of their past six league games against Aston Villa, losing the other.\nLeandro Bacuna scored his first goal in 50 Premier League games, since netting against Cardiff in March 2014.\nBacuna's goal was Villa's only shot on target of the game.\nOnly Leicester (eight) have scored more Premier League penalties than Stoke this season (five).\nVilla did not win a single corner for the second successive game\nWhat next?\nStoke host Newcastle on Wednesday, 2 March (19:45 GMT) before travelling to Chelsea next Saturday (15:00 GMT).

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 5-1 Newcastle United\nNewcastle dropped into the relegation zone on goal difference after three goals in the first 17 minutes set Chelsea on their way to an easy win.\nDiego Costa slid in the opener, a Rolando Aarons error let in Pedro to run clear and fire home, and Costa set up Willian to make it 3-0.\nPedro and Bertrand Traore added further goals in the second half, before Andros Townsend's late consolation.\nThe only thing to spoil Chelsea's night was an injury to captain John Terry.\nThe centre-half limped off with a hamstring injury before half-time and is a doubt for Tuesday's trip to play Paris St-Germain in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie.\nChelsea's interim manager Guus Hiddink remains unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions, and his side are now unbeaten in their past 10 Premier League games.\nMagpies suffer again on the road\nNewcastle have only scored seven goals on their travels this season, the worst record in the top four divisions in England, but it was their defence that let them down at Stamford Bridge.\nMagpies boss Steve McClaren said in his pre-match TV interview that the first 20 minutes would be crucial to the outcome of the match. He was right, but not in the way he would have wanted.\nBy then, his side had suffered a complete collapse at the back which was summed up by Chelsea's second goal.\nThat came from a Newcastle free-kick near the home side's corner flag that was cleared to the halfway line before Aarons' horrendous cross-field pass allowed Pedro to gallop clear.\nMcClaren's side never looked capable of a second-half comeback as they slipped to a fifth successive away defeat.\nAfter the break, Cesc Fabregas set up Pedro for his second and Bertrand Traore turned in Cesar Azpilicueta's cross.\nAndros Townsend's trademark run and finish for his first goal since his \u00a312m move from Tottenham reduced the damage at the end.\nBut Newcastle's goal-difference still took a battering and at -22 it is now the worst in the top flight.\nChelsea's injury problems continue\nChelsea's own defensive problems were of a very different sort.\nWith Kurt Zouma out for the season, the last thing Hiddink needed before a busy fortnight was to see Terry limp off.\nTerry appeared to fall awkwardly after a clash with Magpies striker Aleksandar Mitrovic and will have a scan to assess the severity of his hamstring injury.\nGary Cahill only returned to the starting line-up on Saturday because of Zouma's serious knee injury, but could end up being a key figure at the back for his side in the next few weeks.\nMan of the match - Chelsea's Diego Costa\nHe was playing with a broken nose, but Chelsea's man in the mask did not miss his mark.\nAlong with the impressive Willian, Costa scored one goal and made another but he edged the individual accolade because of his delightful finish to give his side an early lead.\nManager reaction\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"We can be pleased with the performance of the guys. We tried to surprise them in the beginning. Happily it worked out.\n\"It's important for the way we played, not just in attack. The players also have to do defensive work and that is where we are aiming and then the quality comes out.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve McClaren: \"We got exposed on quite a few occasions in terms of defensive frailties. Rolando Aarons had to play at left-back and it was Steven Taylor's second game in six months.\n\"We caused our own problems. We knew Chelsea would come out quick. They wanted to win that game by half-time with the week they have ahead of them.\n\"You get one or two of these games a season. I've told the players don't let that derail us. It was damage limitation by half-time.\n\"I just wanted to make sure we scored a goal and stayed in the game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea are on the current longest unbeaten run in the Premier League - 10 games (won four, drew six).\nNewcastle United have won only two of their last 20 Premier League away games (drew two, lost 16).\nPedro has scored as many Premier League goals versus Newcastle in this match as he did in his previous 19 apps combined (two).\nAll four of Cesc Fabregas' PL assists this season have arrived at Stamford Bridge.\nBertrand Traore is the first player from Burkina Faso to score in the Premier League.\nWhat next?\nNewcastle are out of the FA Cup and their Premier League game with Manchester City on 28 February has been postponed because City are in the Capital One Cup final.\nSo the Magpies do not have a game for 18 days until they travel to Stoke on 2 March, and are heading for a training camp in Spain.\nIn that time, Chelsea play four matches, starting with Tuesday's trip to Paris."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester United 3-2 Arsenal\nTeenager Marcus Rashford scored twice and set up the third as Manchester United derailed Arsenal's Premier League title challenge at Old Trafford.\nRashford, who scored twice on his debut against FC Midtjylland on Thursday, steered in a loose ball for the opener then headed in three minutes later.\nDanny Welbeck nodded Arsenal back into the game, but Rashford picked out Ander Herrera whose shot was deflected in.\nMesut Ozil's volley gave third-placed Arsenal hope, but United held on.\nArsenal - who have not won the title since 2004 - remain in third place, five points adrift of leaders Leicester having now played the same number of matches.\nThe Red Devils moved back into fifth position with their first win in three league games.\nAnalysis: 'Why Arsenal fell short, again' - Ian Wright\nRe-live the five-goal thriller at Old Trafford\nDo Arsenal actually want to win the title?\nThat's the question posed by former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand. Of course, Ferdinand is being facetious. And of course Arsenal want to win the title.\nBut, against an under-strength and youthful home side, the Gunners blew another opportunity to demonstrate their title credentials.\nWith leaders Leicester snatching a late win on Saturday, and second-placed Tottenham fighting back against Swansea, Arsene Wenger's side lost valuable ground on their title rivals.\nAnd it ended a miserable week for the Frenchman, who saw his side falter in three competitions.\nWenger watched his team labour to an FA Cup draw against Championship side Hull, then put themselves on the brink of a Champions League exit at the hands of Barcelona.\n\"This is a fight where you keep going even when disappointment is there. Let's show we are prepared for the fight,\" he said.\nRashford makes his Marc again...\nBarely anyone outside Old Trafford had heard of Marcus Rashford less than week ago - now the teenage United striker is a household name across the country.\nTwo goals on his senior debut in the Europa League against Midtjylland catapulted him into the national spotlight.\nBut, many asked, how would he fare against a league title-chasing side in the heat of a battle between two fierce rivals? Coolly, calmly and clinically, as it turned out.\nRashford showed signs of his youthful exuberance in the early stages, darting inside a pair of Arsenal defenders from the left touchline before being hauled down on the edge of the penalty area.\nThe opportunity of that set-piece was not taken by the Red Devils, but it mattered little as Rashford soon put them into a two-goal lead.\nThe young Mancunian pounced on a poor clearance by Arsenal centre-back Gabriel to slot in his first Premier League goal, then waltzed into space to powerfully head in Jesse Lingard's floated cross.\nBut it was not just his finishing that caught the eye. Rashford showed great awareness and composure to pick out the run of Herrera, whose 20-yard shot took a wicked deflection off Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny.\nNo wonder he was given a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd when he was replaced in the 80th minute.\nVan Gaal takes a tumble\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal fell over in front of the fourth official in what was described as \"the comedy moment of the season\" by BBC Radio 5 live commentator Conor McNamara.\nThe Dutchman, who rarely leaves his seat in the dugout during matches, appeared to be frustrated by an alleged dive by Gunners striker Alexis Sanchez.\n\"I have had a lot of criticism because I am sitting on my bench and now I am off my bench and I have lot of criticism because I'm doing that,\" Van Gaal said.\nGrim up north for the Gunners...\nArsenal have not enjoyed their Premier League visits to Old Trafford in recent seasons, failing to pick up three points there since September 2006.\n, external\nAnd many felt the Gunners needed to finally win at Old Trafford if they are going to end an even longer barren run - becoming the English champions.\nThe opportunity to beat United was probably the easiest for Arsenal than any other time during Arsene Wenger's 20-year reign.\nBut their defensive errors cost them dearly.\n\"I cannot fault the commitment and desire but unfortunately we conceded two easy goals,\" said Wenger afterwards.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford\nStats of the day\nRashford, aged 18 years and 120 days, is exactly the same age as Wayne Rooney was on the day that they both scored their first Premier League brace\nRashford is one of only six players to have had a hand in three goals on their Premier League debut\nArsenal have won none and lost seven of their past nine league trips to Old Trafford\nMesut Ozil assisted for the 18th occasion this season in the league - only Thierry Henry (20 in 2002-03) has more in a single campaign\nOzil scored and assisted in the same league away game for only the second time\nArsenal have only won two of their past eight league away matches (W2 D3 L3) - this following a run of 12 away matches where they won 10\nManchester United have now won back-to-back Premier League home games for the first time since September\nWhat's next?\nA couple of days rest and then straight back into Premier League action. The top flight reconvenes for a full midweek programme, with both teams facing home matches on Wednesday.\nArsenal look to bounce back against 16th-placed Swansea, while United welcome 10th-placed Watford.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Watford 0-0 Bournemouth\nWatford and Bournemouth both missed good chances as their contest at Vicarage Road finished goalless.\nHornets' striker Odion Ighalo had the best of those opportunities when his header from eight yards sailed over the bar.\nHe also fired over the bar from 12 yards from a quick free-kick, and forced Artur Boruc into an early save.\nThe Cherries went close through Max Gradel, who made his first appearance since a ligament injury in August.\nRelive the action from Vicarage Road\nAll the action from the Saturday's Premier League matches\nHornets in a mid-table slumber?\nAnd why not?\nThey have 37 points and might only need about 42 to secure Premier League survival. So with a estimated \u00a3100m guaranteed for retaining top-flight status, you cannot blame Quique Sanchez Flores' men for appearing to drop down a gear.\nNevertheless, there is pride at stake, and for Ighalo, the honour of finishing as the division's top scorer. The Nigerian has 14 goals - five goals fewer than Leicester's Jamie Vardy - but has not found the net only once in the league since 28 December.\nHad the 26-year-old been at his sharpest he would have scored inside the first minute instead of firing at Boruc. He also headed over inexplicably in the second half and then again missed the target after Ben Watson's quick thinking from a free-kick gave him another good opportunity.\nWhen will his rotten run come to an end?\nCherries could have nicked it\nFlores will no doubt think his side should have won the match, but so will counterpart Eddie Howe.\nGradel, who came on for the injured Junior Stanislas in the 21st minute, had a header and looping shot saved by Gomes. The Brazilian keeper then made a fantastic stop to prevent Harry Arter's swerving shot from bursting the net.\nOne incident that is certain to be discussed was the handball by Watford's Valon Behrami from a corner. Intentional? Referee Anthony Taylor did not think so.\nThe point moves Bournemouth further away from the bottom three. Aside from good forward play, the defence limited Watford to few clear-cut chances. Repeat all-round displays should see them safe.\nMan of the match - Heurelho Gomes (Watford)\nManager reaction\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe:\n\"We should have won. We were excellent in long spells of the game. But it's a clean sheet and a point.\n\"Any point gained away from home is a valuable one. However, Gomes did make some wonderful saves today.\n\"I thought it was a penalty when Behrami handled. The ref had a good game though. The speed of which the ball flies around you, you have sympathy. But from my angle it looked a penalty.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores:\n\"When you don't win it's important to get a point. We are closer to the 40-point mark.\n\"I don't worry about Ighalo not scoring. He gets chances. All the players do need to contribute but we are creating chances - 0-0 is fair enough.\n\"Our next match is against Man United. They are strong. We have to go into the match knowing this will be tough.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford had just one shot on target against Bournemouth; only against Southampton (0) in August have they attempted fewer at Vicarage Road this season\nThe Hornets have failed to score in five of their last seven Premier League matches\nBournemouth have lost just one of their last eight Premier League away games (W3 D4 L1)\nWatford recorded just their second clean sheet in 10 Premier League games\nKeeper Gomes made more passes than any other Watford player versus Bournemouth (37)\nWhat next?\nWatford are at Manchester United on Wednesday 2 March, and Bournemouth host south coast rivals Southampton a day earlier."

That is not pessimistic, that is the truth.\n\"It is hard work and you need to be ready for it. We want to change things with work and this was good for the soul. We have needed 26 games to get a positive goal difference.\"\nWhat next?\nLiverpool are next in action when they resume their Europa League campaign with a trip to Augsburg on Thursday, 18 February for the first leg of their last-32 tie. Aston Villa play again on Saturday, 27 February when they visit Stoke.",

It has hit him on the elbow.\"\nHowever, in a match of few chances, City should ask questions defensively as they levelled before leaving themselves wide open seven minutes from time for Eriksen, on his 24th birthday, to win the match.\nSpoilt for choice, Roy?\nEngland manager Roy Hodgson was at the Etihad and would have welcomed the earlier news of scoring returns for Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge.\nIn the first two games of the day, six of the nine goals scored had been netted by English players and his options before Euro 2016 were further demonstrated in Manchester as Kane scored his 16th Premier League goal of the season.\nThe 11.9km covered by England's 19-year-old midfielder Dele Alli was more than all but one of Manchester City's side, as he continues to impress, while compatriot Eric Dier, 22, was solid in the holding midfield role.\nAnother England forward, Sterling, was quiet for the most part for City, although he did almost break the deadlock with a volley that was bravely blocked by Rose early on.\nMan of the match: Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur)\nManager reaction\nMan City boss Manuel Pellegrini told BBC Sport: \"It was a penalty that referee Mark Clattenburg wanted to sign for and he gave the sign. It was absolutely the wrong decision, it hit the back of Raheem Sterling then his elbow. Sterling was not even seeing the ball. It was the same referee in the first game where there were two clear goals in offside and we lost 4-1.\n\"It was the key moment that decided thee game; before that they did not shoot towards our goal and did not have any chances. We took the risks, the spirit of the team was good but it was not enough.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"I think that it was a game that was very important. You could feel it was not a normal game and a real test for us; for that we feel very pleased for the players.\n\"The mentality was good and a perfect performance against a team with a lot of quality players who are top class. Full credit to my players.\n\"From my point of view, I did not see the penalty incident. Sometimes in football it happens, it goes for you and against you in the season.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have won just one of their 10 Premier League games against sides currently in the top eight this season (D3 L6)\nTottenham ended a run of five successive league defeats at Etihad Stadium, earning their first victory there since May 2010\nNo player has scored more goals as a substitute in the Premier League this season than Kelechi Iheanacho (three, level with Steven Naismith, Olivier Giroud and Christian Benteke)\nSince the start of last season, only Sergio Aguero (40) has scored more Premier League goals than Kane (37)\nCity have lost four home games in the Premier League this season, more than they had in Manuel Pellegrini's first two seasons combined (three)\nTottenham have won five consecutive Premier League games for the first time since a run of six in December 2011\nMauricio Pochettino's side are unbeaten in 12 away league games - their longest run since a streak of 16 from November 1984 to August 1985\nWhat next?\nManchester City travel to Chelsea in the FA Cup fifth round next Sunday (16:00 GMT), before a last 16 Champions League tie at Dynamo Kiev the following Wednesday (19:45 GMT).

Time moves on and West Ham have been presented with a perfect opportunity to progress, but night games in particular are very special here in east London.\nThe home fans give the ground a thunderous atmosphere from before kick-off, when the bubbles machine accompanies the club's old anthem 'I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles' and continues non-stop in a relentless, intense environment.\nThe Hammers will lose something when they leave here, as it remains one of the great landmarks of English football.\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio (West Ham United)\nWhat they said...\nWest Ham United manager Slaven Bilic: \"To match Spurs you have to play well, but to outplay them and win was magnificent.\n\"Maybe I'm biased but they should be more happy with the result than us, because it could have been more.\n\"In all aspects of football we were magnificent and I congratulate the players.\"\nTottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"We didn't start well. The first half was poor, we never found solutions to play like we normally play.\n\"We had more freedom in the second half but if you don't score it's difficult to get the points.\n\"We were poor. We know. We are very disappointed. But the way the players fought in the second half was fantastic.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMichail Antonio has scored in six of his past eight appearances at home for West Ham in all competitions.\nTottenham failed to hit a single shot in the first half of a Premier League match for only the second time in the past 13 years.\nThis was Spurs' first defeat in 13 Premier League away games and their first since the opening weekend of the season.\nWest Ham are unbeaten in 12 successive home league games - their best run since April 1998.\nWhat's next\nTottenham will be itching to get back to winning ways but face a tough north London derby at home to Arsenal on Saturday (12:45 GMT).\nOn the same day Slaven Bilic takes his West Ham side to Everton (15:00 GMT) - a place he knows well, having turned out for the Toffees in his playing career.",

Their shortcomings were again laid bare against the Swans as they missed chances and their soft centre again cost them dear.\nShortcomings - we have been here before\nSwansea arrived in north London sporting six changes, with a teenage debutant in Stephen Kingsley at left-back and minus their manager, who is in hospital with a chest infection.\nThe early stages, in which the impressive Campbell - in for Theo Walcott - turned home Sanchez's pass, saw the visitors struggle but then cracks emerged again in Wenger's side.\nWeak play by Mesut Ozil led to Jack Cork being allowed to create the equaliser and Petr Cech must be questioned for the missed punch that allowed Williams to turn in from a yard.\nFormer Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has said Arsenal keep failing to sign leaders\n, external\nand such analysis continues to look more and more astute as at no point did Arsenal pin their visitors back for a long spell.\nThere were inevitable boos and the same old questions will be trotted out. Where is the character? Where is the steel? Arsenal are in danger of failing and suddenly, even a top-four place does not look guaranteed.\nIs it all over?\nSitting third - behind Tottenham - and six points adrift of Leicester, Arsenal may not look out of the title race by any stretch.\nBut a focus on their run-in reveals difficult away trips to Spurs, Everton, West Ham, Sunderland and Manchester City. Such challenges currently look beyond them and with just three wins in 11 matches, the excellent December form that solidified their challenge has disappeared.\nWenger admitted he was \"worried\" about results after this latest loss. Arsenal fans will likely echo his thoughts. News that Cech picked up an injury that rules him out of Saturday's trip to White Hart Lane will only add to their concerns.\nSwans staying up?\nThere were moments where Swansea rode their luck, particularly when Giroud volleyed on to the bar before the break and when Sanchez curled a free-kick on to the woodwork.\nBut with coach Alan Curtis in charge on the night, they grew into the game and could have led late on when substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson rounded Cech but fired wide.\nThe fact they managed 11 shots in a difficult away fixture perhaps underlined the footing they had in the game, with Williams leading the resistance at the other end.\nThe club captain made a game-high nine clearances and, as the only survivor in Swansea's defence from the defeat at Tottenham, marshalled the back four expertly.\nHis late tap-in was perhaps deserved reward and another win against struggling Norwich on Saturday could see this become the week in which Swansea's top-flight status is all but secured.\nMan of the match - Ashley Williams\nThe stats you need to know...\nThis is the first time the Gunners have lost back-to-back Premier League matches since November 2014 - those two games were also against Swansea and Manchester United.\nWayne Routledge scored his first Premier League goal of the season and his first since December 2014.\nAshley Williams has scored two Premier League goals in 2015-16, the same number he had scored in his previous four Premier League seasons.\nUp next?\nArsenal face a north London derby at Tottenham on Saturday in a fixture that looks pivotal at the top of the table, while a few hours later Swansea host Norwich in a game that seems key at the bottom."

They were hungry and winning challenges, we didn't. That's not tactics - that's belief, spirit, character, mentality.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAfter keeping six clean sheets in a row this season in the Premier League, Forster has conceded four goals in his past two games.\nFive of the Cherries' past eight Premier League goals have either been scored or assisted by defenders (one goal by Cook, one goal and three assists by Daniels).\nAfobe has scored four goals in his eight Premier League games this season.\nBournemouth have kept consecutive Premier League clean sheets for the first time this season.\nKoeman's side have scored just three goals in their past seven away league games.\nWhat next?\nBournemouth travel to fellow strugglers Newcastle on Saturday (15:00 GMT) and will hope Southampton, who are home on the same day, can do them a favour by beating Sunderland (15:00 GMT).",

The crowd are chanting 'from European nights to relegation fights - we want Lerner out'. A few fans are pointing fingers at chief executive Tom Fox in the directors' box.\n\"There are hundreds of fans streaming out of Villa Park. There are a lot of people who have paid a lot of money walking out. The Villa fans are voting with their feet. I haven't seen anything like this before at Villa.\n\"I remember the demonstrations against Doug Ellis, but he must seem a great chairman in retrospect. This is the worst team I've seen in 41 years of reporting on Villa, simple as that.\"\nCan Martinez bring success to Everton?\nThere is renewed pressure on Roberto Martinez following the multi-million pound investment in Everton by Iranian billionaire Farhad Moshiri.\nYet if the Spaniard is feeling the heat, he did a great job disguising it, taking time to shake hands with Villa's mascot and sign autographs during the match.\nHis side controlled the game from start to finish, racing into a 2-0 lead as Villa left Funes Mori in space to score before Lennon fired home after being teed up by the impressive Mirallas.\nFunes Mori turned provider as Lukaku's knee helped make it 3-0 and it could have been more - Bryan Oviedo had a shot cleared off the line.\nThere will be much tougher tests for Martinez and Everton but, having climbed above neighbours Liverpool into 10th spot, this was a highly satisfactory night for them.\nMan of the match - Kevin Mirallas (Everton)\nWhat the managers said\nAston Villa boss Remi Garde: \"When you prepare a plan and so early in the game you have to change it, it's very difficult. We were too fragile, we didn't take the advantage of playing at home.\n\"The positive sign is that we never gave up and we reduced the score. But it's difficult to keep a positive mood when you miss chances like we missed today.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We managed the game well - it's always difficult when you're away from home to get a real good composure but we had that. It's a performance that won't get the credit it deserves - Aston Villa had a lot of fight.\n\"I feel that the squad is in a very good moment - we've been very consistent the last six games.

Time moves on and West Ham have been presented with a perfect opportunity to progress, but night games in particular are very special here in east London.\nThe home fans give the ground a thunderous atmosphere from before kick-off, when the bubbles machine accompanies the club's old anthem 'I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles' and continues non-stop in a relentless, intense environment.\nThe Hammers will lose something when they leave here, as it remains one of the great landmarks of English football.\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio (West Ham United)\nWhat they said...\nWest Ham United manager Slaven Bilic: \"To match Spurs you have to play well, but to outplay them and win was magnificent.\n\"Maybe I'm biased but they should be more happy with the result than us, because it could have been more.\n\"In all aspects of football we were magnificent and I congratulate the players.\"\nTottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"We didn't start well. The first half was poor, we never found solutions to play like we normally play.\n\"We had more freedom in the second half but if you don't score it's difficult to get the points.\n\"We were poor. We know. We are very disappointed. But the way the players fought in the second half was fantastic.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMichail Antonio has scored in six of his past eight appearances at home for West Ham in all competitions.\nTottenham failed to hit a single shot in the first half of a Premier League match for only the second time in the past 13 years.\nThis was Spurs' first defeat in 13 Premier League away games and their first since the opening weekend of the season.\nWest Ham are unbeaten in 12 successive home league games - their best run since April 1998.\nWhat's next\nTottenham will be itching to get back to winning ways but face a tough north London derby at home to Arsenal on Saturday (12:45 GMT).\nOn the same day Slaven Bilic takes his West Ham side to Everton (15:00 GMT) - a place he knows well, having turned out for the Toffees in his playing career."

They have scored in just four of their past eight league games and, for all their effort, seem light up front when it matters.\nJerome hit the bar from six yards in the second period when he should have scored and his lack of killer instinct summed up a display which was admirable if uninspiring.\nFellow relegation strugglers Sunderland and Newcastle visit Carrow Road in the run-in, but Norwich - 18th in the table on goal difference - must find their form soon.\nBefore Chelsea's visit they had fewer touches in opponents' area than any other side in the league. So is a change in style needed? Or are Neil's side simply doomed?\nBlame the referee?\nRedmond's strike - from a Wes Hoolahan pass - and performance will be one positive, and perhaps Norwich fans can draw some comfort from their early misfortune.\nReferee Lee Mason was a clear target of home fans' frustration in the opening period as a succession of 50-50 calls went the way of the champions.\nThibaut Courtois seemed to pick up a clear backpass and Costa was a yard offside in running onto Bertrand Traore's pass in first-half injury time.\nIt proved key and was tough on the Canaries, but they must look at their own shortcomings too as Kenedy's early rocket arrived after the full-back was given plenty of time to fashion his shot.\nBeing undone inside a minute was exactly what Norwich did not need on a night when they were desperate to right a poor run of form. Another worry will be an injury sustained by Alexander Tettey, while Gary O'Neil suffered a head wound as he collided with Robbie Brady.\n\"Gary has a nasty gash and needs a few stitches, Robbie's lost two teeth and Alex is getting an X-ray on his leg,\" Neil said afterwards.\nChelsea have their groove back\nFocus on the relegation zone could overshadow the fact Chelsea - in eighth - are in the top half for the first time since the opening week of the season.\nTheir remarkable slump under Jose Mourinho is long finished, with key players returning to form to fashion a run of 12 league games unbeaten.\nHiddink is yet to lose a league game since returning to the club and deserves praise for starting Kenedy and Traore.\nCosta seems hungry again and has eight goals and four assists in his past 10 league games, while Cesc Fabregas looked in control in midfield throughout.\nHiddink is concerned his side will lose focus in league games with one eye on Champions League commitments but they showed they have the talent to come through such tests when not at their best. A top six-finish looks possible.\n\"Now with the ambition of Chelsea we must set a new target and see what we can do in the direction of Europe,\" Hiddink said afterwards.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas\nWhat the managers said...\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"The first goal is a real disappointment for us. We have six behind the ball and the left back scores. The second is offside and you expect the officials to get that. The fact is we didn't really get exposed for the first goal but didn't deal with it and shut down quick enough.\"\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"We didn't want to go into the battle but they forced us. We were sloppy in the first half, starting well with a beautiful goal and I think we could have finished it in the first half. We were complacent in the last pass.

It was how it should be. I said to the boys that we have to show that we want it more and from the first second on that was exactly the attitude.\n\"I think this was the best pressing performance we have done. City had no time to play football.\n\"For all Liverpool lovers, it was a great night. We have to take this moment, stay angry and strike back. We have lost a few points in games we should nto have so now we have to take them back.\n\"Roberto [Firmino] deserved his goal. The way he is working for the team in the last few weeks is unbelievable.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is difficult to have an excuse but I saw the team was not recovered from the last week.

Their shortcomings were again laid bare against the Swans as they missed chances and their soft centre again cost them dear.\nShortcomings - we have been here before\nSwansea arrived in north London sporting six changes, with a teenage debutant in Stephen Kingsley at left-back and minus their manager, who is in hospital with a chest infection.\nThe early stages, in which the impressive Campbell - in for Theo Walcott - turned home Sanchez's pass, saw the visitors struggle but then cracks emerged again in Wenger's side.\nWeak play by Mesut Ozil led to Jack Cork being allowed to create the equaliser and Petr Cech must be questioned for the missed punch that allowed Williams to turn in from a yard.\nFormer Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has said Arsenal keep failing to sign leaders\n, external\nand such analysis continues to look more and more astute as at no point did Arsenal pin their visitors back for a long spell.\nThere were inevitable boos and the same old questions will be trotted out. Where is the character? Where is the steel? Arsenal are in danger of failing and suddenly, even a top-four place does not look guaranteed.\nIs it all over?\nSitting third - behind Tottenham - and six points adrift of Leicester, Arsenal may not look out of the title race by any stretch.\nBut a focus on their run-in reveals difficult away trips to Spurs, Everton, West Ham, Sunderland and Manchester City. Such challenges currently look beyond them and with just three wins in 11 matches, the excellent December form that solidified their challenge has disappeared.\nWenger admitted he was \"worried\" about results after this latest loss. Arsenal fans will likely echo his thoughts. News that Cech picked up an injury that rules him out of Saturday's trip to White Hart Lane will only add to their concerns.\nSwans staying up?\nThere were moments where Swansea rode their luck, particularly when Giroud volleyed on to the bar before the break and when Sanchez curled a free-kick on to the woodwork.\nBut with coach Alan Curtis in charge on the night, they grew into the game and could have led late on when substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson rounded Cech but fired wide.\nThe fact they managed 11 shots in a difficult away fixture perhaps underlined the footing they had in the game, with Williams leading the resistance at the other end.\nThe club captain made a game-high nine clearances and, as the only survivor in Swansea's defence from the defeat at Tottenham, marshalled the back four expertly.\nHis late tap-in was perhaps deserved reward and another win against struggling Norwich on Saturday could see this become the week in which Swansea's top-flight status is all but secured.\nMan of the match - Ashley Williams\nThe stats you need to know...\nThis is the first time the Gunners have lost back-to-back Premier League matches since November 2014 - those two games were also against Swansea and Manchester United.\nWayne Routledge scored his first Premier League goal of the season and his first since December 2014.\nAshley Williams has scored two Premier League goals in 2015-16, the same number he had scored in his previous four Premier League seasons.\nUp next?\nArsenal face a north London derby at Tottenham on Saturday in a fixture that looks pivotal at the top of the table, while a few hours later Swansea host Norwich in a game that seems key at the bottom.",

They have scored in just four of their past eight league games and, for all their effort, seem light up front when it matters.\nJerome hit the bar from six yards in the second period when he should have scored and his lack of killer instinct summed up a display which was admirable if uninspiring.\nFellow relegation strugglers Sunderland and Newcastle visit Carrow Road in the run-in, but Norwich - 18th in the table on goal difference - must find their form soon.\nBefore Chelsea's visit they had fewer touches in opponents' area than any other side in the league. So is a change in style needed? Or are Neil's side simply doomed?\nBlame the referee?\nRedmond's strike - from a Wes Hoolahan pass - and performance will be one positive, and perhaps Norwich fans can draw some comfort from their early misfortune.\nReferee Lee Mason was a clear target of home fans' frustration in the opening period as a succession of 50-50 calls went the way of the champions.\nThibaut Courtois seemed to pick up a clear backpass and Costa was a yard offside in running onto Bertrand Traore's pass in first-half injury time.\nIt proved key and was tough on the Canaries, but they must look at their own shortcomings too as Kenedy's early rocket arrived after the full-back was given plenty of time to fashion his shot.\nBeing undone inside a minute was exactly what Norwich did not need on a night when they were desperate to right a poor run of form. Another worry will be an injury sustained by Alexander Tettey, while Gary O'Neil suffered a head wound as he collided with Robbie Brady.\n\"Gary has a nasty gash and needs a few stitches, Robbie's lost two teeth and Alex is getting an X-ray on his leg,\" Neil said afterwards.\nChelsea have their groove back\nFocus on the relegation zone could overshadow the fact Chelsea - in eighth - are in the top half for the first time since the opening week of the season.\nTheir remarkable slump under Jose Mourinho is long finished, with key players returning to form to fashion a run of 12 league games unbeaten.\nHiddink is yet to lose a league game since returning to the club and deserves praise for starting Kenedy and Traore.\nCosta seems hungry again and has eight goals and four assists in his past 10 league games, while Cesc Fabregas looked in control in midfield throughout.\nHiddink is concerned his side will lose focus in league games with one eye on Champions League commitments but they showed they have the talent to come through such tests when not at their best. A top six-finish looks possible.\n\"Now with the ambition of Chelsea we must set a new target and see what we can do in the direction of Europe,\" Hiddink said afterwards.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas\nWhat the managers said...\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"The first goal is a real disappointment for us. We have six behind the ball and the left back scores. The second is offside and you expect the officials to get that. The fact is we didn't really get exposed for the first goal but didn't deal with it and shut down quick enough.\"\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"We didn't want to go into the battle but they forced us. We were sloppy in the first half, starting well with a beautiful goal and I think we could have finished it in the first half. We were complacent in the last pass. They made our life difficult.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea have won three successive Premier League games for the first time since April.\nEden Hazard ended a run of 17 Premier League games without an assist by setting up Kenedy for Chelsea's opener.\nNathan Redmond scored his first Premier League goal since October.\nWes Hoolahan has recorded his best season for assists in a Premier League campaign with eight.\nUp next?\nNorwich travel to Swansea - who are three points above them - on Saturday, while Chelsea host Stoke four days before their Champions League last-16 second leg against Paris St-Germain."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester United 1-0 Watford\nJuan Mata's late free-kick earned Manchester United a win over Watford to move them level on points with fourth-placed Manchester City.\nUnited striker Marcus Rashford was quiet in the first half as Watford's Odion Ighalo wasted two good chances.\nBut the hosts improved when Rashford switched places with Anthony Martial and the Frenchman won the free-kick which Mata curled in from 20 yards.\nCity have a game in hand on United, who earned a fourth successive win.\nHad Ighalo not shot wide from Troy Deeney's flick-on or chose to pass to his strike partner when David de Gea thwarted the Nigerian, the story of the match may have been very different.\nBut buoyed by the recent form of Rashford and Mata scoring his eighth goal of the season, the prospect of United reaching next season's Champions League looks a distinct possibility after their city rivals lost 3-0 at Liverpool.\nRelive Manchester United's win over Watford\nHow did United's youngsters perform?\nIt was less than a fortnight ago that the future of United boss Louis van Gaal looked in doubt following an embarrassing defeat at FC Midtjylland in the Europa League.\nSince then the gloom has lifted around Old Trafford with Rashford playing a telling part in previous wins over Arsenal on Sunday and FC Midtjylland the previous Thursday by scoring twice in each game.\nStationed up front for this encounter, he struggled to find time and space to drive at the well-drilled Watford defence, who were superb at blocking the hosts' efforts from distance.\nYet once Martial moved in from the wing, with Rashford replacing him there, the young Mancunian found the byline on several occasions and twice nearly created an opener.\nIt was because of the switch that Martial found himself positioned more centrally, drawing a foul from Miguel Britos as he bore down on goal, with Mata doing the rest.\nElsewhere, Tim Fosu-Mensah looked steady on his first United start in defence. He made several decent challenges and had a running battle with Deeney which he coped with well.\nWas this another boring United win?\nThe hosts chalked up 11 successive goalless first halves at Old Trafford before the run ended on 2 February.\nAnd although this game started the potential for another run to begin, Watford began faster in both halves and capitalised on some sloppy passing at the back from the hosts, which contributed to an absorbing match.\nOnly Watford's profligacy kept the scoreline goalless until Mata's late intervention and Deeney must have been fuming at Ighalo's attempts to end a run of only one league goal in 2016.\nThe defeat means that Watford are yet to register a win over top-five opposition this season, but they will rarely come as close as this as Ben Watson caused danger from several corners and Etienne Capoue, who had a decent penalty appeal, was excellent in midfield.\nPerhaps their best chance came when Sebastian Prodl headed wide from two yards, under pressure from United defender Matteo Darmian.\nThe Hornets have now lost 10 successive games against United but with only three points needed to reach the magic 40-point mark, there is no danger of relegation and if Ighalo finds his range, they can push onto a lofty position in the league after promotion last season.\nMan of the match - Etienne Capoue\nManager reaction\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"I have to give big compliments to our players because when it is physical and you can win at an important moment, when all our competitors are losing, it's very important.\n\"We lost against Sunderland and there was a lot of criticism but that is the strength of the league and now you see we are closer to the fourth position so now we are fighting for it.\"\nOn switching Rashford and Martial, he added: \"That was a better change because Martial was not in the match and Rashford was not in the match and I changed them and they were both in the match. At that time we got the momentum.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We are a little bit disappointed, we try to be happy because the performance was amazing. We played with high personality and we tried to control the match. [United] played well in the last matches, so we prepared well but it was a special moment which decided the match.\n\"We are supporting Ighalo a lot because he is a little bit confused [with the fact he hasn't scored a lot recently], but he has had an amazing season.\"\nStats you need to know\nManchester United named their fourth-youngest starting XI in Premier League history (23 years, 222 days old on average).\nMata scored his first direct free-kick in the Premier League since December 2014 (versus Stoke).\nThe Hornets have failed to score in six of their last eight Premier League matches.\nOdion Ighalo has scored just one goal in nine Premier League appearances so far in 2016, despite attempting 27 shots (inc. blocked).\nUnited won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since 21 November 2015 - a day on which they also defeated Watford (away).\nWhat next?\nManchester United are away at West Brom on Sunday before they travel to Anfield for the first leg of their Europa League tie the following Thursday. Watford can have their say in the title race as they host table-topping Leicester on Saturday.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Leicester City 2-2 West Bromwich Albion\nLeicester missed the chance to go five points clear at the top of the Premier League as West Brom came from behind to claim a thrilling draw.\nSalomon Rondon shrugged off Robert Huth to give West Brom the lead, but a Danny Drinkwater deflected shot levelled it.\nAndy King finished a wonderful move to put Leicester ahead only for Craig Gardner to equalise with a free-kick.\nLeicester twice hit the bar at a raucous King Power Stadium, but could not find a winner.\nThe draw leaves the Foxes three points ahead of Tottenham, who can go top with victory at West Ham on Wednesday, and six ahead of Arsenal, who face Swansea.\nWest Brom, who have now lost only two of their past 10 league games, stay 13th - 12 points clear of the relegation zone.\nRelive Leicester's thrilling draw with West Brom\nNo more late drama\nLeicester were below their best on Saturday but still managed to beat Norwich thanks to a late winner - here they were much improved, but could not conjure similar drama despite laying siege to the West Brom goal.\nWest Brom may have planned to concede possession and defend deep, and they were duly bombarded by wave after wave of Leicester attacks, mainly down the flanks through the excellent pair of Riyad Mahrez and Marc Albrighton.\nOn Saturday, the Foxes had 13 attempts on goal - here they had 22, with headers from Jamie Vardy and Shinji Okazaki hitting the woodwork.\nBen Foster also saved well from Jeffrey Schlupp and Wes Morgan, while Leonardo Ulloa could not repeat his weekend heroics when the ball flashed across the face of goal in the very last minute.\nBaggies forced out of their shell\nWest Brom could have been forgiven for thinking that allowing Leicester the lion's share of possession was a sound approach.\nAgainst Norwich, Leicester had the majority of the ball for only the third time this season and struggled. Whether by design or necessity, the Baggies were happy to sit back in the first period, especially after Rondon got on the end of Darren Fletcher's through ball to put the visitors ahead.\nHowever, even with nine red shirts behind the ball, Leicester still found a way to lead, meaning West Brom had to make more of the play in the second half. It worked to their advantage as, after Mahrez needlessly handballed, Gardner curled in a sublime free-kick.\nRondon could even have won it but somehow turned over from inside the six-yard box, and the Baggies ultimately needed some fortune to hang on at the end of a breathless night.\nKing of the King Power\nKing was making only his seventh league start of the season, in the side for the injured N'Golo Kante.\nThe Welsh midfielder is the only member of the Foxes squad remaining from their time in the third tier seven years ago and has winners' medals from both League One and the Championship.\nHere he looked to have taken a stride towards adding a Premier League medal when he met Mahrez's athletic back-heel to finish sharply past Foster.\nBut in the end the odds on King completing an unlikely hat-trick lengthened - and Leicester could be back to second in the table as early as Wednesday night.\nMan of the match\nWhat they said\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"I am very pleased with our performance. They played so well - there was no panic after the first goal. We played much better than against Norwich. I am satisfied with the performance. Just sometimes you can do everything but the ball doesn't want to go in.\n\"I want to create a lot of chances and sooner or later we score. Tonight wasn't the right moment but we are alive and we fight to the end. Everybody is ready to fight, to play well, to create chances. Only the victory was missing.\n\"We tried to do everything and well done to my players. We never never give up. We always try the best in every situation. Every team plays football and we have to find the solution and try to win. It is important not to lose the match too as they could have counter-attacked.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"Leicester are a good side. They ask questions of you.\n\"It's another point on the way for us. It's important for us to get to 40 points and we are happy with the way things are going. We need the hunger and desire to get to 40 points. We should have kept the ball better tonight. I'm really pleased with the players though.\n\"I'd love to see Leicester win the title.\"\nThe stats\nLeicester are the first Premier League team this season to score 50+ goals in the competition.\nTwo of Leicester's three top-flight goals from outside the area this season have been scored by Danny Drinkwater.\nLeicester's record as the only Premier League side not to concede at home in 2016 ended.\nRiyad Mahrez has had a part in a league-high 25 Premier League goals this season (14 goals, 11 assists).\nSalomon Rondon has scored in three of his past five Premier League games, having failed to score in his previous nine in the competition.\nAndy King is the fourth Welshman to score on St David's Day in Premier League history (also Pembridge, Saunders and Collison).\nCraig Gardner has had a role in three of the Baggies' last five Premier League goals (scored two, assisted one).\nGardner has also scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since last April (also v Palace and Leicester).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Watford on Saturday, while West Brom welcome Manchester United on Sunday."

The Premier League is about goals like that.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"It's a game we deserved to win and looked like we had won.\n\"A substitute who's fresh hits it in the only place it will go in.

It was how it should be. I said to the boys that we have to show that we want it more and from the first second on that was exactly the attitude.\n\"I think this was the best pressing performance we have done. City had no time to play football.\n\"For all Liverpool lovers, it was a great night. We have to take this moment, stay angry and strike back. We have lost a few points in games we should nto have so now we have to take them back.\n\"Roberto [Firmino] deserved his goal. The way he is working for the team in the last few weeks is unbelievable.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is difficult to have an excuse but I saw the team was not recovered from the last week. We played Champions League and then the League Cup final and I saw the team was not fresh and Liverpool played better.\n\"The last two days we work very light, just try to recover the players but from beginning they won all the balls and had a high pace - more pace than our team.\n\"We didn't attack well and create chances and didn't have fresh legs to play like we can.\n\"It seems like the Premier League continues being the same from the start and very close. We will continue fighting.\"\nThe stats you need to know...\nKolo Toure made his 300th Premier League start in this match - the first African player to reach this landmark in the competition.\nJames Milner has now scored in 41 different Premier League matches and never lost - only Darius Vassell (46 games) has a superior record to this in the competition.\nRoberto Firmino has both scored and assisted in three of his last five Premier League appearances for Liverpool.\nThere have been 37 goals scored in the last 10 meetings in all competitions between these two sides (3.7 per game).\nSergio Aguero has scored just one goal in eight Premier League appearances in the month of March, despite playing 606 minutes.\nWhat next?\nLiverpool are away at Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday (13:30 GMT), while Manchester City host bottom club Aston Villa the day before (15:00 GMT)."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Leicester City 2-2 West Bromwich Albion\nLeicester missed the chance to go five points clear at the top of the Premier League as West Brom came from behind to claim a thrilling draw.\nSalomon Rondon shrugged off Robert Huth to give West Brom the lead, but a Danny Drinkwater deflected shot levelled it.\nAndy King finished a wonderful move to put Leicester ahead only for Craig Gardner to equalise with a free-kick.\nLeicester twice hit the bar at a raucous King Power Stadium, but could not find a winner.\nThe draw leaves the Foxes three points ahead of Tottenham, who can go top with victory at West Ham on Wednesday, and six ahead of Arsenal, who face Swansea.\nWest Brom, who have now lost only two of their past 10 league games, stay 13th - 12 points clear of the relegation zone.\nRelive Leicester's thrilling draw with West Brom\nNo more late drama\nLeicester were below their best on Saturday but still managed to beat Norwich thanks to a late winner - here they were much improved, but could not conjure similar drama despite laying siege to the West Brom goal.\nWest Brom may have planned to concede possession and defend deep, and they were duly bombarded by wave after wave of Leicester attacks, mainly down the flanks through the excellent pair of Riyad Mahrez and Marc Albrighton.\nOn Saturday, the Foxes had 13 attempts on goal - here they had 22, with headers from Jamie Vardy and Shinji Okazaki hitting the woodwork.\nBen Foster also saved well from Jeffrey Schlupp and Wes Morgan, while Leonardo Ulloa could not repeat his weekend heroics when the ball flashed across the face of goal in the very last minute.\nBaggies forced out of their shell\nWest Brom could have been forgiven for thinking that allowing Leicester the lion's share of possession was a sound approach.\nAgainst Norwich, Leicester had the majority of the ball for only the third time this season and struggled. Whether by design or necessity, the Baggies were happy to sit back in the first period, especially after Rondon got on the end of Darren Fletcher's through ball to put the visitors ahead.\nHowever, even with nine red shirts behind the ball, Leicester still found a way to lead, meaning West Brom had to make more of the play in the second half. It worked to their advantage as, after Mahrez needlessly handballed, Gardner curled in a sublime free-kick.\nRondon could even have won it but somehow turned over from inside the six-yard box, and the Baggies ultimately needed some fortune to hang on at the end of a breathless night.\nKing of the King Power\nKing was making only his seventh league start of the season, in the side for the injured N'Golo Kante.\nThe Welsh midfielder is the only member of the Foxes squad remaining from their time in the third tier seven years ago and has winners' medals from both League One and the Championship.\nHere he looked to have taken a stride towards adding a Premier League medal when he met Mahrez's athletic back-heel to finish sharply past Foster.\nBut in the end the odds on King completing an unlikely hat-trick lengthened - and Leicester could be back to second in the table as early as Wednesday night.\nMan of the match\nWhat they said\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"I am very pleased with our performance. They played so well - there was no panic after the first goal. We played much better than against Norwich. I am satisfied with the performance. Just sometimes you can do everything but the ball doesn't want to go in.\n\"I want to create a lot of chances and sooner or later we score. Tonight wasn't the right moment but we are alive and we fight to the end. Everybody is ready to fight, to play well, to create chances. Only the victory was missing.\n\"We tried to do everything and well done to my players. We never never give up. We always try the best in every situation. Every team plays football and we have to find the solution and try to win. It is important not to lose the match too as they could have counter-attacked.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"Leicester are a good side. They ask questions of you.\n\"It's another point on the way for us. It's important for us to get to 40 points and we are happy with the way things are going. We need the hunger and desire to get to 40 points. We should have kept the ball better tonight. I'm really pleased with the players though.\n\"I'd love to see Leicester win the title.\"\nThe stats\nLeicester are the first Premier League team this season to score 50+ goals in the competition.\nTwo of Leicester's three top-flight goals from outside the area this season have been scored by Danny Drinkwater.\nLeicester's record as the only Premier League side not to concede at home in 2016 ended.\nRiyad Mahrez has had a part in a league-high 25 Premier League goals this season (14 goals, 11 assists).\nSalomon Rondon has scored in three of his past five Premier League games, having failed to score in his previous nine in the competition.\nAndy King is the fourth Welshman to score on St David's Day in Premier League history (also Pembridge, Saunders and Collison).\nCraig Gardner has had a role in three of the Baggies' last five Premier League goals (scored two, assisted one).\nGardner has also scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since last April (also v Palace and Leicester).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Watford on Saturday, while West Brom welcome Manchester United on Sunday.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 1-0 Watford\nJuan Mata's late free-kick earned Manchester United a win over Watford to move them level on points with fourth-placed Manchester City.\nUnited striker Marcus Rashford was quiet in the first half as Watford's Odion Ighalo wasted two good chances.\nBut the hosts improved when Rashford switched places with Anthony Martial and the Frenchman won the free-kick which Mata curled in from 20 yards.\nCity have a game in hand on United, who earned a fourth successive win.\nHad Ighalo not shot wide from Troy Deeney's flick-on or chose to pass to his strike partner when David de Gea thwarted the Nigerian, the story of the match may have been very different.\nBut buoyed by the recent form of Rashford and Mata scoring his eighth goal of the season, the prospect of United reaching next season's Champions League looks a distinct possibility after their city rivals lost 3-0 at Liverpool.\nRelive Manchester United's win over Watford\nHow did United's youngsters perform?\nIt was less than a fortnight ago that the future of United boss Louis van Gaal looked in doubt following an embarrassing defeat at FC Midtjylland in the Europa League.\nSince then the gloom has lifted around Old Trafford with Rashford playing a telling part in previous wins over Arsenal on Sunday and FC Midtjylland the previous Thursday by scoring twice in each game.\nStationed up front for this encounter, he struggled to find time and space to drive at the well-drilled Watford defence, who were superb at blocking the hosts' efforts from distance.\nYet once Martial moved in from the wing, with Rashford replacing him there, the young Mancunian found the byline on several occasions and twice nearly created an opener.\nIt was because of the switch that Martial found himself positioned more centrally, drawing a foul from Miguel Britos as he bore down on goal, with Mata doing the rest.\nElsewhere, Tim Fosu-Mensah looked steady on his first United start in defence. He made several decent challenges and had a running battle with Deeney which he coped with well.\nWas this another boring United win?\nThe hosts chalked up 11 successive goalless first halves at Old Trafford before the run ended on 2 February.\nAnd although this game started the potential for another run to begin, Watford began faster in both halves and capitalised on some sloppy passing at the back from the hosts, which contributed to an absorbing match.\nOnly Watford's profligacy kept the scoreline goalless until Mata's late intervention and Deeney must have been fuming at Ighalo's attempts to end a run of only one league goal in 2016.\nThe defeat means that Watford are yet to register a win over top-five opposition this season, but they will rarely come as close as this as Ben Watson caused danger from several corners and Etienne Capoue, who had a decent penalty appeal, was excellent in midfield.\nPerhaps their best chance came when Sebastian Prodl headed wide from two yards, under pressure from United defender Matteo Darmian.\nThe Hornets have now lost 10 successive games against United but with only three points needed to reach the magic 40-point mark, there is no danger of relegation and if Ighalo finds his range, they can push onto a lofty position in the league after promotion last season.\nMan of the match - Etienne Capoue\nManager reaction\nManchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"I have to give big compliments to our players because when it is physical and you can win at an important moment, when all our competitors are losing, it's very important.\n\"We lost against Sunderland and there was a lot of criticism but that is the strength of the league and now you see we are closer to the fourth position so now we are fighting for it.\"\nOn switching Rashford and Martial, he added: \"That was a better change because Martial was not in the match and Rashford was not in the match and I changed them and they were both in the match. At that time we got the momentum.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We are a little bit disappointed, we try to be happy because the performance was amazing. We played with high personality and we tried to control the match. [United] played well in the last matches, so we prepared well but it was a special moment which decided the match.\n\"We are supporting Ighalo a lot because he is a little bit confused [with the fact he hasn't scored a lot recently], but he has had an amazing season.\"\nStats you need to know\nManchester United named their fourth-youngest starting XI in Premier League history (23 years, 222 days old on average).\nMata scored his first direct free-kick in the Premier League since December 2014 (versus Stoke).\nThe Hornets have failed to score in six of their last eight Premier League matches.\nOdion Ighalo has scored just one goal in nine Premier League appearances so far in 2016, despite attempting 27 shots (inc. blocked).\nUnited won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since 21 November 2015 - a day on which they also defeated Watford (away).\nWhat next?\nManchester United are away at West Brom on Sunday before they travel to Anfield for the first leg of their Europa League tie the following Thursday. Watford can have their say in the title race as they host table-topping Leicester on Saturday."

But they have since earned wins against the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United and now find themselves 11 points clear of the drop-zone.\nThere is a strong team spirit instilled by Howe, which was evident once again at St James' Park.\nThe influence of Max Gradel, who only recently returned from a serious knee injury suffered in August, was integral to their success today.\nHe fed the ball to King that led to the own-goal and went close himself with a deflected shot that looped narrowly wide. King himself had one of his best games of the season, producing a confident finish to give his side a two-goal cushion.\nFor Howe, a manager with a huge future, he can just about relax in the knowledge that he has almost secured his side's Premier League future.\nMan of the match - Max Gradel (Bournemouth)\nManager reaction\nNewcastle boss Steve McClaren: \"I'm very disappointed. That was definitely a poor performance and 'going down' material. The only positive is that we have 10 games to go.\n\"We have got to find the fighters in the team and the performance today did not epitomise that. We cannot play like that and hope to stay up.\n\"But we are fortunate that we've got 10 games and that's enough. It's a four-team league now and we play everyone around us.\n\"There was a certain edginess and you could see that in our play. We lost our shape. Normally we are a good attacking team, but today we were poor on the ball. You can only say that the pressure got to them.\n\"I can't see any positives but we have to stick together as a staff and as a team, and fight.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"That's a big win for us and I thought it was thoroughly deserved. It was a bit nervy at the end but it was great to get a third goal to seal it.\n\"It was tighter perhaps than it should have been but I was very pleased with a great performance. We had a real threat about us going forward. It was great to see us score three away from home.\n\"I think the crowd here can work one of two ways. We wanted to dominate the ball and thankfully we got on top.\n\"It's a good position to be in and we want to just finish the job that we have started. But we have some massive games to come and it's not over yet.\n\"It would mean everything for us [to stay up].

Striker Diego Costa, who had a minor tendon injury, was not risked, while midfielder Cesc Fabregas was left on the bench.\nBurkina Faso forward Traore started centrally, with recognised strikers Loic Remy and Alexandre Pato on the bench, and his goal was the one real moment of quality in the game.\nHe found space outside the box before firing a great shot past Jack Butland - his fourth goal in five games.\nHowever, he had a mixed game, failing to control the ball in the box on a couple of occasions and being caught offside needlessly.\nHe was replaced after 68 minutes by Remy, who made little impact.\nChelsea could have had a penalty when Marc Muniesa leaned on Oscar in the box but there were only muted appeals for a spot-kick.\nStoke show their form is no fluke\nThe Potters had won their previous three Premier League games and started the day five points off the Champions League places.\nMark Hughes named an attacking line-up at the home of the soon-to-be dethroned champions, with Ibrahim Afellay, Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic starting behind Diouf. When Bojan replaced Glenn Whelan, they had five forwards on the pitch.\nAnd just when it looked like their luck might be out - Courtois had done well to deny Shaqiri and Arnautovic - they got their reward.\nWith Joselu waiting on the touchline to replace Diouf, the Senegal striker headed home after Courtois failed to adequately deal with Shaqiri's cross. That was his last touch.\nHughes told BBC Sport: \"That's the bit of luck you need. He put a great shift in. He was looking a bit tired so I thought I'd freshen it up. Luckily he scored just before I brought him off.\"\nManager reaction: 'Stoke deserved to win'\nStoke boss Mark Hughes told BBC Sport: \"We're grateful to equalise but we deserved more from the game. It was an excellent away performance - we took the game to Chelsea. We were encouraged by the team they picked.\n\"I was a bit surprised with their team. I thought they had a chance to get in the Champions League.\n\"We're really pleased with the performance. Their goal came out of the blue, it was a great bit of individual skill. I felt we were a strong team and made things happen.\"\nChelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink told BBC Sport: \"Stoke play well and creatively and they pushed us back. The first goal we got after a sloppy start, it was a beautiful goal.\n\"We should have got a penalty for a foul on Oscar. Any referee would have given a free-kick if it was outside the box.

It was so important to see this game out. We know how important three points would have been.\n\"If we'd have got the win, we'd have had a gap for next weekend when we're not playing. We dropped a massive clanger in those last few seconds. With the amount of people we had in that box, it's baffling.\n\"We didn't have the composure to keep the ball, play out and see the game out properly. We paid a very heavy price.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"For 85 minutes, we were not at the level I expect of Southampton. I think we lack confidence at the moment. They made it very difficult with their defensive organisation.\n\"We played better football with one player less on the pitch.\n\"The red card was a one-on-one situation. If it's a foul, then it's a red card. You have to accept that.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDefoe scored his 23rd Premier League goal as a substitute; more than any other player.\nSouthampton received their fifth red card of the season in the Premier League, more than any other team.\nJose Fonte was shown his first red card in the Premier League in what was his 129th appearance in the competition.\nSunderland have gone 15 games without a clean sheet, the longest run of any team in the Premier League this season.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton, with just one point from a possible nine, travel to in-form Stoke City on 12 March.\nSunderland do not play next weekend as scheduled opponents Everton are still involved in the FA Cup.\nNext up for Allardyce's men is a crucial derby at fellow strugglers Newcastle United on 20 March."

But they have since earned wins against the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United and now find themselves 11 points clear of the drop-zone.\nThere is a strong team spirit instilled by Howe, which was evident once again at St James' Park.\nThe influence of Max Gradel, who only recently returned from a serious knee injury suffered in August, was integral to their success today.\nHe fed the ball to King that led to the own-goal and went close himself with a deflected shot that looped narrowly wide. King himself had one of his best games of the season, producing a confident finish to give his side a two-goal cushion.\nFor Howe, a manager with a huge future, he can just about relax in the knowledge that he has almost secured his side's Premier League future.\nMan of the match - Max Gradel (Bournemouth)\nManager reaction\nNewcastle boss Steve McClaren: \"I'm very disappointed. That was definitely a poor performance and 'going down' material. The only positive is that we have 10 games to go.\n\"We have got to find the fighters in the team and the performance today did not epitomise that. We cannot play like that and hope to stay up.\n\"But we are fortunate that we've got 10 games and that's enough. It's a four-team league now and we play everyone around us.\n\"There was a certain edginess and you could see that in our play. We lost our shape. Normally we are a good attacking team, but today we were poor on the ball. You can only say that the pressure got to them.\n\"I can't see any positives but we have to stick together as a staff and as a team, and fight.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"That's a big win for us and I thought it was thoroughly deserved. It was a bit nervy at the end but it was great to get a third goal to seal it.\n\"It was tighter perhaps than it should have been but I was very pleased with a great performance. We had a real threat about us going forward. It was great to see us score three away from home.\n\"I think the crowd here can work one of two ways. We wanted to dominate the ball and thankfully we got on top.\n\"It's a good position to be in and we want to just finish the job that we have started. But we have some massive games to come and it's not over yet.\n\"It would mean everything for us [to stay up]. There's a lot of pressure on us but so far we are coping quite well.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThe Cherries are unbeaten in all five of their away Premier League games in 2016 (W2 D3).\nThe Magpies suffered their first defeat at St James' Park since Boxing Day.\nMatt Ritchie now has 25 assists in league football for Bournemouth, nine more than any other player at the club since he signed in January 2013.\nKing scored his first Premier League goal since his strike against Man United in December.\nTaylor scored his first own goal in the Premier League since December 2006.\nNewcastle's record of 24 points from 28 games is their lowest in Premier League history.\nWhat now?\nPerhaps that should read \"where now?\" for Newcastle. The Magpies - with McClaren at the helm or otherwise - are at title-chasing Leicester on Monday, 14 March.\nAs for Bournemouth, they are at home to Swansea next Saturday."

And they emerged with credit.\nThe tide was flowing fast against them after Coquelin drew a stupid yellow card. It would have been easy to feel it was not their day but the Gunners hung in and their persistence was rewarded.\nWenger may feel his side might have gone on to win had they not been left with a numerical disadvantage - and they had a genuine grievance when referee Michael Oliver inexplicably failed to give Spurs' Eric Dier a second yellow card for a crude shirt-pull on Olivier Giroud.\nIn many respects, this game was about avoiding defeat for Arsenal and they dug deep to stop the rot.\nSpurs miss a big chance\nSpurs could have no complaints when they lost at West Ham United on Wednesday. They were beaten by the better side, something that will happen in the fierce competition of the Premier League.\nIt was a case of not too much harm done with Arsenal and Manchester City also losing - but here they missed a real opportunity.\nSpurs had that precious lead with Arsenal on the back foot and reduced to 10 men. All the momentum was with them as White Hart Lane sensed their old rivals were there for the taking.\nInstead, with Lloris the culprit and Gunners understudy Ospina superb, they let Arsenal back in.\nThe chance to go top of the table, even for a few hours, was gone and while they remain three points ahead of their rivals in second place, Spurs will feel they should have extended the advantage.\nMan of the match - David Ospina\nThe stats you need to know\nTottenham have lost just one of their past eight Premier League games against the Gunners at White Hart Lane (W4 D3 L1)\nThere have been 137 goals scored in this fixture in the Premier League; more than any other fixture in the competition\nHarry Kane has now scored 14 goals in 18 Premier League London derbies\nDavid Ospina made nine saves in this match for Arsenal, the most by a Gunners' goalkeeper in a Premier League game since Lukasz Fabianski (also 9) v Liverpool in April 2009\nUp next?\nArsenal face an FA Cup replay at Hull on Tuesday before hosting West Brom next weekend, while Tottenham have a Europa League trip to Borussia Dortmund on Thursday before Sunday's game at Aston Villa."

Now there will be only battles for everybody not just for us. A tough match. We created four or five chances, they created two or three. We are so happy now.\n\"The title is not ours. We have to fight a lot, step by step and keep our feet on the ground. At the end we can see what happens. I'm sorry, we know every team can win or lose so it has to be slowly slowly.\"\nOn Riyad Mahrez hamstring: \"No injury, he was tired and had a little cramp so I changed him in the late minutes. His goal was so important.\"\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It was very difficult, they defended very well, lots of intensity through the middle. We created some attempts, we make one mistake and when they score first it is very difficult.\"\nOn his strikers' goal drought: \"Of course. We have problems to score in the last matches. For me it will be interesting not to look at the strikers in this case, it's important to get goals from the other lines, I don't want to put pressure on the strikers.\"\nStats you need to know\nLeicester have won 31 points away from home this season in the Premier League; five more than any other team.\nEleven of Mahrez's 15 Premier League goals for Leicester City this season have come away from home.\nLeicester have scored 33 goals in the second half of Premier league games in this campaign - two more than any other side.\nWatford have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 14 matches in all competitions against the Foxes.\nWatford have conceded a league-high proportion of their goals in the second half of matches (73%).\nWhat next?\nLeicester now have a nine-day break until they host Premier League strugglers Newcastle at home, while Watford face either Arsenal or Hull in the FA Cup quarter-finals next weekend before hosting Stoke in the league the following weekend.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Everton 2-0 Chelsea\nChelsea striker Diego Costa was at the centre of a biting controversy as Romelu Lukaku wrecked what was left of his former club's season to secure Everton's place in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley.\nCosta appeared to make contact with the neck of Everton's Gareth Barry at the end of a running battle between the pair as he received his first red card in English football - although managers Guus Hiddink and Roberto Martinez later refused to condemn the striker.\nEverton were leading through Lukaku's superb 77th-minute solo goal - reminiscent of Ricky Villa's famous weaving run for Spurs in the 1981 FA Cup final against Manchester City - and the Belgian's low drive when Costa was dismissed by referee Michael Oliver.\nIt was Lukaku's brilliance which decided this stormy quarter-final - and there was still time for Barry to be sent off after receiving a second yellow card for a foul on Cesc Fabregas.\nThat could not stop the elation sweeping around an ecstatic Goodison Park as manager Martinez, under the watchful eye of Everton's new majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, celebrated a hugely significant victory.\nLukaku's touch of class\nThis was the day Chelsea would have had to acknowledge the error of their ways for their lack of patience in refusing to persist with Lukaku, 22, who is now approaching world class.\nHe has scored 25 goals this season and the goal that changed the direction of this feisty FA Cup tie was a thing of power and beauty.\nLukaku picked up Ross Barkley's pass on the left flank and embarked on a run that simply possessed too much power and skill for four Chelsea defenders before he had the composure to slide a finish under Thibaut Courtois.\nAnd as Chelsea now look at a major rebuilding job under owner Roman Abramovich's next managerial appointment, how they must wish they had a player of Lukaku's potential to act as the centrepiece.\nAs for Everton, the fact they do have the giant Belgian means they have a potent match-winning spearhead.\nCosta sums up Chelsea's woes\nThe sight of Costa, with the mockery of almost 40,000 Everton fans ringing in his ears, sloping off after a red card encapsulated a week of abject misery for the Stamford Bridge club.\nChelsea were well beaten by Paris St-Germain and now this FA Cup exit means they have nothing left to fight for and no Champions League football to look forward to next season for the first time since Abramovich took charge in July 2003.\nIt was as if all those frustrations poured out of Costa, who was agitating for a battle from the first whistle and found an opponent in Barry who was more than happy to oblige.\nCosta finally boiled over in a close range, head-to-head spat with Barry and Chelsea's chances of getting back into this game went with him.\nWith a new manager to be appointed, captain John Terry facing an uncertain future, and a squad needing urgent rebuilding, this day almost felt like the end of an era for Chelsea.\nMoshiri's first impression\nEverton's new majority shareholder Moshiri, who saw his 49.9% stake in the club approved by the Premier League, was attending his first game since effectively taking control of the club.\nAnd while he confirmed the issue of Everton's ground is high on his agenda, he sampled this glorious old arena at its finest - a bear-pit from first to last and resounding to raucous sounds of victory at the final whistle.\nIn a message in the match programme, Moshiri also revealed he has pledged funds to keep Everton's best players.\nWhat price Lukaku?\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku\nWhat they said...\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"My interpretation is I don't think it was a key moment [involving Costa]. It was an emotional game and rightly so.\n\"Diego Costa had a fighting spirit and I would like to praise the referee. The sending-off of Costa was right.\n\"The sending-off of Gareth Barry was right and the referee never allowed those emotions to stop the fluency.\n\"Whatever happens with Diego Costa I am sure the two players shook it off. From where it was he moved his head towards Gareth Barry and I lost sight of that action.\n\"I thought it was a second yellow. It was a moment that didn't have an impact on the scoreline.\"\nChelsea boss Guus Hiddink: \"I try to be fair in my judgement [on Diego Costa], I haven't seen it and it is difficult for me to say yes or no [if he had bitten Barry].\n\"He was chased a bit in the game. They went after him. They knew it. It is within the rules.\n\"I like him still going towards the edge but you also have to take into consideration he was desperate to play today.\n\"It would have been better to rest him but it is not the type of game you rest players.\n\"It is all the combination; not fully physically fit and all the provocations and he has to take responsibility for the incident.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nGareth Barry was sent off for the second time this season - he was also red-carded against Chelsea last season.\nThe Toffees have reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time since 2011-12, where they were eliminated by Liverpool.\nGuus Hiddink lost his first FA Cup match as Chelsea manager, having won all six of his games previous to this.\nWhat next?\nEverton play Arsenal at Goodison Park in the 12:45 GMT kick-off next Saturday, while Chelsea host West Ham in the Premier League on the same day at 15:00 GMT."

Striker Diego Costa, who had a minor tendon injury, was not risked, while midfielder Cesc Fabregas was left on the bench.\nBurkina Faso forward Traore started centrally, with recognised strikers Loic Remy and Alexandre Pato on the bench, and his goal was the one real moment of quality in the game.\nHe found space outside the box before firing a great shot past Jack Butland - his fourth goal in five games.\nHowever, he had a mixed game, failing to control the ball in the box on a couple of occasions and being caught offside needlessly.\nHe was replaced after 68 minutes by Remy, who made little impact.\nChelsea could have had a penalty when Marc Muniesa leaned on Oscar in the box but there were only muted appeals for a spot-kick.\nStoke show their form is no fluke\nThe Potters had won their previous three Premier League games and started the day five points off the Champions League places.\nMark Hughes named an attacking line-up at the home of the soon-to-be dethroned champions, with Ibrahim Afellay, Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic starting behind Diouf. When Bojan replaced Glenn Whelan, they had five forwards on the pitch.\nAnd just when it looked like their luck might be out - Courtois had done well to deny Shaqiri and Arnautovic - they got their reward.\nWith Joselu waiting on the touchline to replace Diouf, the Senegal striker headed home after Courtois failed to adequately deal with Shaqiri's cross. That was his last touch.\nHughes told BBC Sport: \"That's the bit of luck you need. He put a great shift in. He was looking a bit tired so I thought I'd freshen it up. Luckily he scored just before I brought him off.\"\nManager reaction: 'Stoke deserved to win'\nStoke boss Mark Hughes told BBC Sport: \"We're grateful to equalise but we deserved more from the game. It was an excellent away performance - we took the game to Chelsea. We were encouraged by the team they picked.\n\"I was a bit surprised with their team. I thought they had a chance to get in the Champions League.\n\"We're really pleased with the performance. Their goal came out of the blue, it was a great bit of individual skill. I felt we were a strong team and made things happen.\"\nChelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink told BBC Sport: \"Stoke play well and creatively and they pushed us back. The first goal we got after a sloppy start, it was a beautiful goal.\n\"We should have got a penalty for a foul on Oscar. Any referee would have given a free-kick if it was outside the box. That was a key point. Stoke got some encouragement after that.\n\"We have rested one or two players but it's good to see the players who came in, especially the young ones, like Traore and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, do well.\n\"Everyone knows in December we were one point off the relegation zone. There was a little bit of panic. Through a lot of draws at the beginning, we moved away and then we had to make the next step with victories, which we did.\"\nMan of the match: Giannelli Imbula\nMatch stats: Hiddink makes history\nHiddink is the first manager to go 12 Premier League games unbeaten from the beginning of a single managerial spell at a club, overtaking Frank Clark's record of 11 games set back in 1994 at Nottingham Forest.\nTraore has scored in each of his past three appearances at Stamford Bridge.\nMatic assisted his first goal since the final day of the 2014-15 season.\nDiouf scored his first goal since September and ended a run of 12 league games without a goal.\nIt was Stoke's first time avoiding defeat at Stamford Bridge in the league since December 1984 - ending a run of eight consecutive defeats.\nHughes has failed to win any of his past 35 Premier League visits to Anfield, Emirates/Highbury, Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, losing 30 and drawing five.\nWhat's up next?

Their next Premier League match is away to Southampton on Sunday, 20 March.\nCrystal Palace's sights now turn to their first FA Cup quarter-final final for 21 years. On Friday, they are away to Reading, the only non-Premier League club left in the competition.",

We watched Liverpool go down to 10 before this game and they won 2-1. You're never comfortable against top teams with pace up front and they have pace. Once we got the goal we kind of settled down.\n\"Second half we were definitely off the pace a bit but the goal was a smashing finish [by Rondon]. It has taken him time to settle in and he has had ups and downs but they love him to death here.\n\"At the start of the season before the nonsense with Saido I was looking forward to them playing together. Since Saido has come back in the two of them have looked really lively together and we look a threat.\n\"The most important thing is the next game - as you've seen this year, results have been off the radar. Let's get 40 points, I think that's definitely enough to be safe.\"\nStats of the day\nAll 10 of West Brom's Premier League wins this season have been by a one-goal margin.\nRondon is Albion's top scorer in all competitions this season with eight goals\nManchester United have won just one of their last eight Premier League away games, drawing three and losing four\nMata picked up two yellow cards just 26 minutes from the kick-off, faster than any player in the Premier League since Swansea defender Chico was sent off for two bookings in April 2014.\nWhat's next?\nThe Baggies are back in Premier League action on Saturday, travelling to title-chasing Arsenal knowing that a win could move them into the top half.\nMeanwhile, Manchester United's attention switches to the Europa League and the away leg of their last-16 tie against Liverpool.

We tried to be aggressive with and without the ball. We had a good attitude but we could not create space.\n\"Of course we should create more in the last third. We were static up front. Every time that you drop points it is harder but you must continue thinking in a positive way. We must always try to win the title while we mathematically can.\"\nNorwich City boss Alex Neil: \"We will see at the end of the season how significant that point was.\n\"We had much better decision-making. Last time Norwich got relegated they were five points above the relegation zone with seven games to play so there's no reason why we can't catch some of those above us.\"\nPundit analysis\nFormer Norwich striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live: \"This is the end for Manchester City now, they are not going to win the title. Absolutely done. They have been like it all season. They just haven't shown enough urgency or real effort to win.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have scored just eight goals in their past 12 Premier League away matches.\nThis is Man City's lowest points tally (51) after 29 games of a Premier League season since 2008-09 (35).\nThis is Norwich's worst run in the Premier League (10 games without a win) within a single Premier League campaign since November 2004 (13 games).\nNorwich failed to have a single shot on target in this match - the first time they have done so this season in the Premier League and the first time in the competition since April 2013.\nMartin made his 120th Premier League appearance for Norwich in this game and became the player to make the most appearances in the competition for the club ahead of Mark Bowen (119).\nWhat next?\nManchester City will take a 3-1 lead into the home leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday (19:45 GMT). Norwich's fight for survival sees them visit West Brom on Saturday, 19 March (15:00 GMT) in their next game."

We hit the post twice and didn't have the luck. But we have to fight against that.\n\"It is hard but then it is still mathematically possible so we need to fight. The situation is awful and it is massive challenge to win enough games to stay up. But you have to be proud and fight until the last minute.\n\"I love football and hate defeat. Five in a row.

It was so important to see this game out. We know how important three points would have been.\n\"If we'd have got the win, we'd have had a gap for next weekend when we're not playing. We dropped a massive clanger in those last few seconds. With the amount of people we had in that box, it's baffling.\n\"We didn't have the composure to keep the ball, play out and see the game out properly. We paid a very heavy price.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"For 85 minutes, we were not at the level I expect of Southampton. I think we lack confidence at the moment. They made it very difficult with their defensive organisation.\n\"We played better football with one player less on the pitch.\n\"The red card was a one-on-one situation. If it's a foul, then it's a red card. You have to accept that.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDefoe scored his 23rd Premier League goal as a substitute; more than any other player.\nSouthampton received their fifth red card of the season in the Premier League, more than any other team.\nJose Fonte was shown his first red card in the Premier League in what was his 129th appearance in the competition.\nSunderland have gone 15 games without a clean sheet, the longest run of any team in the Premier League this season.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton, with just one point from a possible nine, travel to in-form Stoke City on 12 March.\nSunderland do not play next weekend as scheduled opponents Everton are still involved in the FA Cup.\nNext up for Allardyce's men is a crucial derby at fellow strugglers Newcastle United on 20 March."

It was an emotional game and rightly so.\n\"Diego Costa had a fighting spirit and I would like to praise the referee. The sending-off of Costa was right.\n\"The sending-off of Gareth Barry was right and the referee never allowed those emotions to stop the fluency.\n\"Whatever happens with Diego Costa I am sure the two players shook it off. From where it was he moved his head towards Gareth Barry and I lost sight of that action.\n\"I thought it was a second yellow. It was a moment that didn't have an impact on the scoreline.\"\nChelsea boss Guus Hiddink: \"I try to be fair in my judgement [on Diego Costa], I haven't seen it and it is difficult for me to say yes or no [if he had bitten Barry].\n\"He was chased a bit in the game. They went after him. They knew it. It is within the rules.\n\"I like him still going towards the edge but you also have to take into consideration he was desperate to play today.\n\"It would have been better to rest him but it is not the type of game you rest players.\n\"It is all the combination; not fully physically fit and all the provocations and he has to take responsibility for the incident.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nGareth Barry was sent off for the second time this season - he was also red-carded against Chelsea last season.\nThe Toffees have reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time since 2011-12, where they were eliminated by Liverpool.\nGuus Hiddink lost his first FA Cup match as Chelsea manager, having won all six of his games previous to this.\nWhat next?\nEverton play Arsenal at Goodison Park in the 12:45 GMT kick-off next Saturday, while Chelsea host West Ham in the Premier League on the same day at 15:00 GMT.",

We hit the post twice and didn't have the luck. But we have to fight against that.\n\"It is hard but then it is still mathematically possible so we need to fight.

We watched Liverpool go down to 10 before this game and they won 2-1. You're never comfortable against top teams with pace up front and they have pace.

It has taken him time to settle in and he has had ups and downs but they love him to death here.\n\"At the start of the season before the nonsense with Saido I was looking forward to them playing together. Since Saido has come back in the two of them have looked really lively together and we look a threat.\n\"The most important thing is the next game - as you've seen this year, results have been off the radar. Let's get 40 points, I think that's definitely enough to be safe.\"\nStats of the day\nAll 10 of West Brom's Premier League wins this season have been by a one-goal margin.\nRondon is Albion's top scorer in all competitions this season with eight goals\nManchester United have won just one of their last eight Premier League away games, drawing three and losing four\nMata picked up two yellow cards just 26 minutes from the kick-off, faster than any player in the Premier League since Swansea defender Chico was sent off for two bookings in April 2014.\nWhat's next?\nThe Baggies are back in Premier League action on Saturday, travelling to title-chasing Arsenal knowing that a win could move them into the top half.\nMeanwhile, Manchester United's attention switches to the Europa League and the away leg of their last-16 tie against Liverpool. Their next league game is a trip to neighbours City on Sunday, 20 March."

That is something we could not afford in our situation and unfortunately that is the end.\"\n\"We deserved a bit more. When we controlled the game, we were not dangerous enough to score a goal. I didn't think they were very threatening for us.\"\nOn the departures of chief executive Tom Fox and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt this week: \"We showed as a team that we were not too much affected by all this stuff.\n\"This football club has had a lot of problems in the last few years. We are all in this situation today. The problems are within the club and we have to fight until the end.\"\nSwansea head coach Francesco Guidolin: \"It was not a very good performance but the players were concentrated and focused like a final game.\n\"Our season has not been a good season. When I came two months ago we had only two points on the relegation zone and we're now better than that.\n\"This is an important result for us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea have only lost once in their past 11 matches against Aston Villa, winning the last five.\nAston Villa are winless in seven top-flight matches at Swansea dating back to 1971.\nSwansea had 83% passing accuracy, while Villa managed only 74%.\nSwansea's Jack Cork covered 12.78km at an average speed of 8.03km, making 72 sprints - all of them the highest figures for his team.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea resume their Premier League programme after the international break by travelling to Stoke on 2 April (15:00 BST), when Aston Villa host Chelsea (12:45 BST).",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 2-2 West Ham United\nCesc Fabregas scored a free-kick and a late penalty as Chelsea earned a point to frustrate West Ham's Champions League ambitions.\nThe Hammers took the lead when Manuel Lanzini beat Thibaut Courtois with a sumptuous curling effort from 25 yards.\nFabregas's superb set piece on the stroke of half-time pegged them back.\nSubstitute Andy Carroll looked to have won it for West Ham, before Fabregas snatched a point after Michail Antonio fouled Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\nVictory would have moved West Ham in front of Manchester City into fourth place, but Slaven Bilic's side were unable to add Chelsea to Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal on their list of away scalps this season.\nChelsea, who remain unbeaten in the league under interim boss Guus Hiddink, stay 10th.\nRelive the action from Stamford Bridge as it happened\nFollow reaction to this and all the day's other Premier League games\nHammers hard done by?\nAfter Carroll finished clinically from Dimitri Payet's superb through-ball, West Ham were two minutes plus added time away from their first victory in Stamford Bridge at 14 years when substitute Loftus-Cheek tumbled in the area.\nReferee Robert Madley pointed to the spot, but replays appeared to show that rather than being clipped by Antonio, the midfielder tripped over his own feet.\nIn addition, Antonio - who had scored in each of his previous three league matches - appeared to be outside the box when Loftus-Cheek went down.\n\"To concede that late is gutting, but to concede it from a penalty that is not a penalty is unacceptable,\" Bilic said.\n\"It was not close to the line. It was way out. It was not a penalty. We are gutted and we are not getting these decisions.\"\nFabregas shines as Blues show fighting spirit\nFollowing last week's defeat by Everton in the FA Cup, reigning league champions Chelsea have nothing left to play for this season - but they showed plenty of battling spirit to take a point from this match.\nThe Blues were not at their fluent best but 18 crosses and 22 shots told the tale of their unstinting endeavour in forward areas.\nFabregas, a superb performer last season, has endured a much more difficult campaign this time round, and has sometimes been accused of going missing in difficult matches, but here he was at his influential best.\nHis free-kick was masterful, getting the ball up and down from 25 yards and beating the dive of Adrian after Winston Reid had fouled Oscar.\nBut his performance was about much more than goals - the 28-year-old Spaniard also had more shots, passes and touches than anyone else on the pitch.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas\nWhat they said\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"We stared well in the first 10 minutes but we then started losing the possession too easily. We reacted just before half-time, especially with the beautiful Fabregas free-kick. In the second half we got caught on the counter, but we reacted perfectly to get the draw.\n\"This is a very good West Ham side. They are knocking on the door for the top four. I was happy with the late penalty decision. It's difficult for me to make a judgement - I think he was tripped on the line. On the line is part of the box.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"I don't look too much at the table but what gives me confidence is the way we are playing, no matter who or where.\n\"We are capable and we are having chances against any team. That approach should take us far.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nCesc Fabregas scored twice in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2009 - a game which also featured his last goal direct from a free-kick.\nFabregas is the fourth Chelsea player this season to score a direct free-kick goal in all competitions (Oscar, Willian, Hazard being the other three).\nFour of Manuel Lanzini's five Premier League goals this season have been scored away from home.\nChelsea have now conceded in each of their last nine Premier League games at Stamford Bridge.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea face Aston Villa on 2 April, while West Ham host Crystal Palace."

We played well against a very good team - we showed a mature performance.\n\"It's important to get some time to analyse - 90% of the squad will be with their national teams and I think it's a good moment to analyse during this period.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was a really bad day for us. We had the worst possible start, we were slow out of the traps and we weren't ourselves at all in the first half. It was a poor display.\n\"I was hugely frustrated because, even when we don't play well, you see a clear philosophy and a way of playing. I honestly couldn't tell what we were trying to do in the first half. It was disjointed and we had no rhythm.\n\"When you come here and you don't bring your best game, it's going to be very difficult.\"\nWhat next?\nFollowing the international break, Tottenham have two games which could go a long way to deciding the destination of the Premier League title - Liverpool at Anfield (2 April) followed by Manchester United at home (10 April).\nBournemouth, who remain 13th and are 12 points above the relegation zone after Newcastle's draw with Sunderland earlier on Sunday, host Manchester City on 2 April.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester City 0-1 Manchester United\nMarcus Rashford became the youngest scorer in the history of this derby in the Premier League as his winner gave Manchester United a victory that moved them to within one point of fourth-placed Manchester City.\nRashford showed his precocious skill at 18 years and 141 days with a demonstration of lightning pace and skill to skate past City defender Martin Demichelis before showing composure to slide a 16th-minute finish past keeper Joe Hart.\nIt was a calamitous day for City and manager Manuel Pellegrini. Not only did they slump to a loss that leaves them fighting off Sunday's opponents and West Ham for a top-four place, they had England goalkeeper Hart carried off early in the second half as he rescued his side from a desperate Demichelis back pass.\nCity, as well as England manager Roy Hodgson, will hope the injury is not serious, with captain Vincent Kompany already out for the foreseeable future after a recurrence of the Belgium defender's calf problem.\nRaheem Sterling also went off injured early, a worry for City with a Champions League quarter-final against Paris St-Germain on the horizon.\nRelive the Manchester derby here\nSergio Aguero headed against the post when City finally applied late pressure, while United should have had a first-half penalty when the panicking Demichelis stepped across Rashford as he closed in on goal.\nIn contrast, the under-pressure United boss Louis van Gaal greeted his celebrating players at the final whistle as their fans enjoyed a superb recovery from the Europa League elimination at the hands of Liverpool - and the revival of their Champions League aspirations.\nVan Gaal's high-wire act\nVan Gaal has been living with speculation about his future since before Christmas - and he awoke to more headlines before this game, with reports from Spain claiming an agreement was in place between United and ex-Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.\nAnd yet, once more, he managed to grind out an important win which not only gives United and their fans the pleasure of a victory over their arch-rivals but keeps them right in the hunt for a top-four finish.\nVan Gaal has been criticised this season but one area where he deserves great credit is his willingness to have faith in young players - and Rashford delivered for him with a wonderful piece of skill and initiative that brought his goal.\nHe also made the wise decision to go without Marouane Fellaini against City. This meant United's temptation to play long balls towards the Belgium midfielder, awful in recent weeks, meant they could use the pace and width provided by Rashford and Anthony Martial.\nIt gave United extra fluency, as well as speed, without Fellaini clogging things up and slowing moves down - perhaps this will be a lesson Van Gaal will now learn.\nThe Dutchman may go at the end of the season - indeed the likelihood is that he will - but with United in the race for a Champions League place and still in the FA Cup, he may yet leave Old Trafford with something to remember him by.\nCrumbling Man City?\nWhen Manchester City announced that Pep Guardiola, perhaps the world's most coveted coach, would be replacing Manuel Pellegrini in the summer, the notion he would take over a club in the Europa League would not have crossed the minds of anyone at Etihad Stadium.\nAnd yet, after this, City are now in a serious battle to stay in the top four - and to make matters worse their form is deserting them and injuries are starting to mount.\nKompany already faced another spell on the sidelines, while Sterling and, more crucially, keeper Hart also sustained injuries here.\nCity will be hoping Hart's injury is not too serious because they need all the help they can get behind a central defensive pairing of Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala, who looked shot to pieces and an accident waiting to happen against the speed and mobility of Rashford and Martial.\nThey have now won only three out of 11 games since Guardiola's appointment was announced - and with rivals such as their Old Trafford neighbours and West Ham applying pressure, they need to rediscover their best form quickly.\nRashford for England?\nThe clamour will grow for the teenager after the flash of brilliance that led to the winner, accompanied by a selfless display of running that saw him take the ball into the corner to see the game out deep into the sixth minute of stoppage time.\nRashford's time will come but he also looked out on his feet, despite that late surge, after a run of eight successive starts.\nHe is undoubtedly a precocious talent but it may be too soon for Hodgson to be tempted into calling him up. One thing is certain - if it does not happen now it will happen before too long.\nMan of the match: Marcus Rashford\nWhat the managers said\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"We did not deserve to lose. We dominated the game from the first minute and we were the only team who wanted to play during the whole game - but we missed three or four chance to score.\n\"We are still in fourth place and we missed clear chances to score. We have another 24 points to play for and every game is different. It was a mistake for our goal and I don't remember a lot of options for Manchester United other than that.\"\nOn a difficult match for defender Demichelis, who was substituted, he added: \"Every player has bad days. Demichelis was nervous and it was not good for him to continue. We didn't score goals but that is not his fault.\"\nManchester United boss Louis Van Gaal: \"I am a very proud manager.\n\"We played a very good first half with a goal and also had more chances and we didn't receive a lot of chances against us.\n\"This victory was necessary. The gap was four points and now it is one point, plus we are equal with West Ham, which is important. What is possible? I cannot say.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThe last time City failed to score in both games of a season against a single Premier League opponent was against Arsenal in 2010-11.\nManchester United had just five shots including those blocked - their joint lowest number in a single league match this season (the other time against Crystal Palace in October).\nMeanwhile, Manchester City had 26 shots including those blocked - their highest number without scoring in a Premier League match since January 2012 (27 v Sunderland).\nSix of Manchester United's last seven Premier League away goals have been scored by English players.\nManuel Pellegrini's City side have failed to score in three of their past four Premier League games.\nLouis van Gaal's United side have kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League side this season (14).\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Manchester City travel to Bournemouth for a 15:00 GMT Premier League fixture on Saturday, 2 April, while Manchester United host Everton the next day in a 16:00 GMT kick-off."

We continued the level of performance against Barcelona.\n\"I like this group, I like the mental attitude - it has been questioned and it hurts me.\n\"When you work every day with them you see how much effort they put in.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We were second best.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Watford 1-2 Stoke City\nStoke secured a comfortable win at Watford thanks to goals from Jon Walters and Joselu.\nAfter a bright start from the hosts, Mark Hughes' side dominated possession and Walters turned home Phil Bardsley's right-wing cross.\nAfter Marko Arnautovic's goal was ruled out for offside, Joselu lobbed Heurelho Gomes after his poor clearance.\nThe Hornets struggled to create chances throughout but Troy Deeney scored a close-range header late on.\nThe victory moves Stoke up up seventh above Liverpool and Southampton, while Watford remain 14th on 37 points.\nRelive the action from Vicarage Road.\nFree-flowing Stoke\nMuch has been made of the change of style in Stoke's play since Mark Hughes took charge and nowhere was that more evident than with the opening goal.\nWalters rounded off a superb 13-pass move at the back post in which eight different players touched the ball, which was worked from the edge of their own area.\nWalters was a constant threat along with overlapping right-back Bardsley, with Ibrahim Afellay also tending to drift over to the right side in his free role as the Potters focused their attacks down that flank.\nWithout both Xherdan Shaqiri and Bojan Krkic, Hughes' men continued to impress and have now won four of their last six games to move within five points of the top four places.\n\"I spoke to Jonathan earlier in the week and told him he was playing,\" said Stoke boss Hughes.\n\"You could tell from the start that he was focused and ready to make an impact - he's not been playing for the last few weeks but he came in to good effect.\"\nWatford's woes\nDespite securing a place in the FA Cup semi-finals last week by winning at Arsenal, Watford will be concerned at their league form so far in 2016.\nThe Hornets have lost their last three Premier League games and have only two wins from their last 13 matches.\nSitting on 37 points, 12 above the relegation places, their future looks pretty secure for next season, but they will not want their campaign to peter out with the prospect of a semi-final at Wembley on the horizon.\nProblems stem from the reliance on the pairing of Deeney and strike partner Odion Ighalo for goals.\nCaptain Deeney's header was his ninth in the league this season, while Nigerian top scorer Ighalo has 14 - after that, Watford have five players who have scored one league goal. So if the Hornets' main men do not score, they tend not to.\nMan of the match - Jon Walters (Stoke)\nWhat the managers said\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"It got a little bit frenetic at the end and not the control we had for the most part, but in the end we got the job done. It was a great finish from Joselu as he hasn't had too many opportunities.\n\"We're just going to see how far we can go. We've got to take games to the opposition like we did today and be confident in our own ability - I sometimes think we don't know how good we are in full flow.\n\"We're not comfortable with the status quo and we want to keep on driving.\"\nWatford head coach Quique Sanchez Flores: \"I think they had more intensity energy, velocity and focus on the match than our team did. We didn't play like a team in the first half, so we have problems.\n\"We didn't create a lot of chances, but maybe in the last 20 minutes when we played a bit better. We're not happy with the match, we started slow and didn't play how our team usually plays.\n\"We are not worried about the future of the team in the Premier League but we want to achieve 40 points as soon as possible.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nPhil Bardsley's assist was his first in the Premier League since March 2015 and only his fourth ever.\nWatford have kept only two clean sheets in their last 13 Premier League games.\nJonathan Walters scored and provided an assist in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2014 and for the fifth time overall.\nAfter failing to score in each of their last six league matches against Watford, the Potters netted two on Saturday.\nTroy Deeney scored in a Premier League game for only the second time in his last 12 top-flight appearances.\nWhat next?\nBoth teams have a two-week break because of the international games. Watford will return to Emirates Stadium three weeks after knocking out Arsenal out of the FA Cup, while Stoke will look to continue their push for Europe when they host Swansea."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Chelsea 2-2 West Ham United\nCesc Fabregas scored a free-kick and a late penalty as Chelsea earned a point to frustrate West Ham's Champions League ambitions.\nThe Hammers took the lead when Manuel Lanzini beat Thibaut Courtois with a sumptuous curling effort from 25 yards.\nFabregas's superb set piece on the stroke of half-time pegged them back.\nSubstitute Andy Carroll looked to have won it for West Ham, before Fabregas snatched a point after Michail Antonio fouled Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\nVictory would have moved West Ham in front of Manchester City into fourth place, but Slaven Bilic's side were unable to add Chelsea to Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal on their list of away scalps this season.\nChelsea, who remain unbeaten in the league under interim boss Guus Hiddink, stay 10th.\nRelive the action from Stamford Bridge as it happened\nFollow reaction to this and all the day's other Premier League games\nHammers hard done by?\nAfter Carroll finished clinically from Dimitri Payet's superb through-ball, West Ham were two minutes plus added time away from their first victory in Stamford Bridge at 14 years when substitute Loftus-Cheek tumbled in the area.\nReferee Robert Madley pointed to the spot, but replays appeared to show that rather than being clipped by Antonio, the midfielder tripped over his own feet.\nIn addition, Antonio - who had scored in each of his previous three league matches - appeared to be outside the box when Loftus-Cheek went down.\n\"To concede that late is gutting, but to concede it from a penalty that is not a penalty is unacceptable,\" Bilic said.\n\"It was not close to the line. It was way out. It was not a penalty. We are gutted and we are not getting these decisions.\"\nFabregas shines as Blues show fighting spirit\nFollowing last week's defeat by Everton in the FA Cup, reigning league champions Chelsea have nothing left to play for this season - but they showed plenty of battling spirit to take a point from this match.\nThe Blues were not at their fluent best but 18 crosses and 22 shots told the tale of their unstinting endeavour in forward areas.\nFabregas, a superb performer last season, has endured a much more difficult campaign this time round, and has sometimes been accused of going missing in difficult matches, but here he was at his influential best.\nHis free-kick was masterful, getting the ball up and down from 25 yards and beating the dive of Adrian after Winston Reid had fouled Oscar.\nBut his performance was about much more than goals - the 28-year-old Spaniard also had more shots, passes and touches than anyone else on the pitch.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas\nWhat they said\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"We stared well in the first 10 minutes but we then started losing the possession too easily. We reacted just before half-time, especially with the beautiful Fabregas free-kick. In the second half we got caught on the counter, but we reacted perfectly to get the draw.\n\"This is a very good West Ham side. They are knocking on the door for the top four. I was happy with the late penalty decision. It's difficult for me to make a judgement - I think he was tripped on the line. On the line is part of the box.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"I don't look too much at the table but what gives me confidence is the way we are playing, no matter who or where.\n\"We are capable and we are having chances against any team. That approach should take us far.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nCesc Fabregas scored twice in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2009 - a game which also featured his last goal direct from a free-kick.\nFabregas is the fourth Chelsea player this season to score a direct free-kick goal in all competitions (Oscar, Willian, Hazard being the other three).\nFour of Manuel Lanzini's five Premier League goals this season have been scored away from home.\nChelsea have now conceded in each of their last nine Premier League games at Stamford Bridge.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea face Aston Villa on 2 April, while West Ham host Crystal Palace.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Crystal Palace 0-1 Leicester City\nLeicester City moved eight points clear at the top of the Premier League after Riyad Mahrez's goal saw off a stubborn Crystal Palace side.\nMahrez missed an early chance after being put clean through but made amends when he turned in Jamie Vardy's cross.\nDamien Delaney hit the bar for Crystal Palace in injury time, but the Foxes held out to clinch another vital win.\nThe Eagles are into the FA Cup semi-finals but remain without a league victory since 19 December.\nRelive the action from Selhurst Park\nLeicester move closer to title triumph\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri revised his points target for the title this week - moving it upwards from 79 points to 82 points, which is the most that nearest rivals Tottenham can manage if they win all their remaining games.\nHowever Spurs do, Leicester know that if they win six of their last seven fixtures - and reach 84 points - nobody can catch them.\nWinning is what the Foxes are doing pretty well at the moment. Saturday's success was their third in a row, and the way it came will surprise nobody.\nRanieri's side have now won 13 games by a single goal this season, more than any other top-flight team.\nThey also have the best away record in the Premier League, with 10 wins on their travels.\nThey will take some shifting from the top of the table, as their fans did from Selhurst Park.\nThe Foxes supporters sang \"we're going to win the league\" solidly for 15 minutes after the final whistle, and it took repeated announcements from the stadium announcer to persuade them to leave.\nPalace problems continue\nPalace certainly put plenty of effort in as they attempted to end their dismal league form - they are the only club in the top four divisions without a home win in 2016.\nThey fired 31 crosses into the Leicester area, with substitute Bakary Sako proving particularly dangerous when he came on.\nHowever, the Eagles could not find a finishing touch and their sixth-straight home league defeat means their relegation worries remain very real.\nNorwich's win at West Brom means Palace's eight-point cushion above the bottom three will be reduced on Sunday, no matter what the outcome of the north-east derby between Newcastle and Sunderland.\nMan of the match - Wes Morgan\nWhat they said\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"We are down, frustrated, we wanted to keep momentum after the FA Cup win over Reading but Leicester are top of the league for a reason. They have a lovely balance to the team, they will be difficult to catch and they would be worthy champions.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri on being top of the league by eight points: \"It sounds good, our fans are singing a very good song about that but we are to stay calm because the Premier League is the same as every match, you don't know what will happen.\n\"We have to continue to push a lot because the Champions League is very close to us. Maybe in the next two matches I can say something more.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester can take another step towards the title when they host Southampton on 3 April.\nPalace will aim to end their 13-match winless run in the league when they travel to West Ham the previous day.\nThe stats you need to know\nRiyad Mahrez has been involved in more Premier League goals this season than anyone else (16 goals, 11 assists), two more than team-mate Jamie Vardy (25).\nMahrez has also netted more away league goals this season than any other player (12).\nMahrez and Vardy have set each other up for eight Premier League goals this season (five Mahrez assists, three Vardy assists), a joint-high along with Arsenal's Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud.\nCrystal Palace have equalled their longest losing streak at home in the Premier League (six consecutive home losses in 1997-98)."

Norwich host relegation rivals Newcastle after the international break, and Sunderland two weeks later.\nNow, and after holding Manchester city to a 0-0 draw last week, they'll feel a lot more optimistic about avoiding the drop.\nWhat the managers said\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"It's disappointing. We were on such a good run and playing so well. I couldn't see it coming, they've trained well this week.\n\"We're not good enough to be anything less than 11 players playing to their maximum. Today, I don't think there's a player who could say they hit any sort of form.\n\"You have to give Norwich credit but if we don't play well and the opposition don't play well, I thought it had 0-0 written all over it. We didn't have a player who gave us a spark and the same for them.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"The boys performed well, we deserved to win. The frustrating thing is we've played well in the three or four games before and haven't picked up any points.\n\"There haven't been enough breaks go our way recently. Today was a big result, and we've got a batch of another four big games coming up.\n\"We need to take this momentum into those matches, we will fight tooth and nail to stay up.\"\nMan of the match - Robbie Brady (Norwich)\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom have to wait another two weeks before they play again, when they travel to Sunderland on 2 April. Norwich's next game is at home to Newcastle on the same day.\nThe stats you need to know\nBrady has now equalled his best ever Premier League goal record in a season (three, scored with Hull in 2013-14)\nJarvis provided his first assist in the Premier League since January 2014\nNorwich became the final Premier League team to keep a clean sheet away from home this season\nThe last four league meetings between the Baggies and the Canaries have seen wins for the away team and the home team failing to score",

So if the Hornets' main men do not score, they tend not to.\nMan of the match - Jon Walters (Stoke)\nWhat the managers said\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"It got a little bit frenetic at the end and not the control we had for the most part, but in the end we got the job done. It was a great finish from Joselu as he hasn't had too many opportunities.\n\"We're just going to see how far we can go. We've got to take games to the opposition like we did today and be confident in our own ability - I sometimes think we don't know how good we are in full flow.\n\"We're not comfortable with the status quo and we want to keep on driving.\"\nWatford head coach Quique Sanchez Flores: \"I think they had more intensity energy, velocity and focus on the match than our team did. We didn't play like a team in the first half, so we have problems.\n\"We didn't create a lot of chances, but maybe in the last 20 minutes when we played a bit better. We're not happy with the match, we started slow and didn't play how our team usually plays.\n\"We are not worried about the future of the team in the Premier League but we want to achieve 40 points as soon as possible.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nPhil Bardsley's assist was his first in the Premier League since March 2015 and only his fourth ever.\nWatford have kept only two clean sheets in their last 13 Premier League games.\nJonathan Walters scored and provided an assist in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2014 and for the fifth time overall.\nAfter failing to score in each of their last six league matches against Watford, the Potters netted two on Saturday.\nTroy Deeney scored in a Premier League game for only the second time in his last 12 top-flight appearances.\nWhat next?\nBoth teams have a two-week break because of the international games.

We are all in this situation today. The problems are within the club and we have to fight until the end.\"\nSwansea head coach Francesco Guidolin: \"It was not a very good performance but the players were concentrated and focused like a final game.\n\"Our season has not been a good season. When I came two months ago we had only two points on the relegation zone and we're now better than that.\n\"This is an important result for us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea have only lost once in their past 11 matches against Aston Villa, winning the last five.\nAston Villa are winless in seven top-flight matches at Swansea dating back to 1971.\nSwansea had 83% passing accuracy, while Villa managed only 74%.\nSwansea's Jack Cork covered 12.78km at an average speed of 8.03km, making 72 sprints - all of them the highest figures for his team.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea resume their Premier League programme after the international break by travelling to Stoke on 2 April (15:00 BST), when Aston Villa host Chelsea (12:45 BST)."

We were on such a good run and playing so well. I couldn't see it coming, they've trained well this week.\n\"We're not good enough to be anything less than 11 players playing to their maximum. Today, I don't think there's a player who could say they hit any sort of form.\n\"You have to give Norwich credit but if we don't play well and the opposition don't play well, I thought it had 0-0 written all over it. We didn't have a player who gave us a spark and the same for them.\"\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"The boys performed well, we deserved to win. The frustrating thing is we've played well in the three or four games before and haven't picked up any points.\n\"There haven't been enough breaks go our way recently. Today was a big result, and we've got a batch of another four big games coming up.\n\"We need to take this momentum into those matches, we will fight tooth and nail to stay up.\"\nMan of the match - Robbie Brady (Norwich)\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom have to wait another two weeks before they play again, when they travel to Sunderland on 2 April.

It was a poor display.\n\"I was hugely frustrated because, even when we don't play well, you see a clear philosophy and a way of playing. I honestly couldn't tell what we were trying to do in the first half.

Saturday's success was their third in a row, and the way it came will surprise nobody.\nRanieri's side have now won 13 games by a single goal this season, more than any other top-flight team.\nThey also have the best away record in the Premier League, with 10 wins on their travels.\nThey will take some shifting from the top of the table, as their fans did from Selhurst Park.\nThe Foxes supporters sang \"we're going to win the league\" solidly for 15 minutes after the final whistle, and it took repeated announcements from the stadium announcer to persuade them to leave.\nPalace problems continue\nPalace certainly put plenty of effort in as they attempted to end their dismal league form - they are the only club in the top four divisions without a home win in 2016.\nThey fired 31 crosses into the Leicester area, with substitute Bakary Sako proving particularly dangerous when he came on.\nHowever, the Eagles could not find a finishing touch and their sixth-straight home league defeat means their relegation worries remain very real.\nNorwich's win at West Brom means Palace's eight-point cushion above the bottom three will be reduced on Sunday, no matter what the outcome of the north-east derby between Newcastle and Sunderland.\nMan of the match - Wes Morgan\nWhat they said\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"We are down, frustrated, we wanted to keep momentum after the FA Cup win over Reading but Leicester are top of the league for a reason.

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Manchester City 0-1 Manchester United\nMarcus Rashford became the youngest scorer in the history of this derby in the Premier League as his winner gave Manchester United a victory that moved them to within one point of fourth-placed Manchester City.\nRashford showed his precocious skill at 18 years and 141 days with a demonstration of lightning pace and skill to skate past City defender Martin Demichelis before showing composure to slide a 16th-minute finish past keeper Joe Hart.\nIt was a calamitous day for City and manager Manuel Pellegrini. Not only did they slump to a loss that leaves them fighting off Sunday's opponents and West Ham for a top-four place, they had England goalkeeper Hart carried off early in the second half as he rescued his side from a desperate Demichelis back pass.\nCity, as well as England manager Roy Hodgson, will hope the injury is not serious, with captain Vincent Kompany already out for the foreseeable future after a recurrence of the Belgium defender's calf problem.\nRaheem Sterling also went off injured early, a worry for City with a Champions League quarter-final against Paris St-Germain on the horizon.\nRelive the Manchester derby here\nSergio Aguero headed against the post when City finally applied late pressure, while United should have had a first-half penalty when the panicking Demichelis stepped across Rashford as he closed in on goal.\nIn contrast, the under-pressure United boss Louis van Gaal greeted his celebrating players at the final whistle as their fans enjoyed a superb recovery from the Europa League elimination at the hands of Liverpool - and the revival of their Champions League aspirations.\nVan Gaal's high-wire act\nVan Gaal has been living with speculation about his future since before Christmas - and he awoke to more headlines before this game, with reports from Spain claiming an agreement was in place between United and ex-Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.\nAnd yet, once more, he managed to grind out an important win which not only gives United and their fans the pleasure of a victory over their arch-rivals but keeps them right in the hunt for a top-four finish.\nVan Gaal has been criticised this season but one area where he deserves great credit is his willingness to have faith in young players - and Rashford delivered for him with a wonderful piece of skill and initiative that brought his goal.\nHe also made the wise decision to go without Marouane Fellaini against City. This meant United's temptation to play long balls towards the Belgium midfielder, awful in recent weeks, meant they could use the pace and width provided by Rashford and Anthony Martial.\nIt gave United extra fluency, as well as speed, without Fellaini clogging things up and slowing moves down - perhaps this will be a lesson Van Gaal will now learn.\nThe Dutchman may go at the end of the season - indeed the likelihood is that he will - but with United in the race for a Champions League place and still in the FA Cup, he may yet leave Old Trafford with something to remember him by.\nCrumbling Man City?\nWhen Manchester City announced that Pep Guardiola, perhaps the world's most coveted coach, would be replacing Manuel Pellegrini in the summer, the notion he would take over a club in the Europa League would not have crossed the minds of anyone at Etihad Stadium.\nAnd yet, after this, City are now in a serious battle to stay in the top four - and to make matters worse their form is deserting them and injuries are starting to mount.\nKompany already faced another spell on the sidelines, while Sterling and, more crucially, keeper Hart also sustained injuries here.\nCity will be hoping Hart's injury is not too serious because they need all the help they can get behind a central defensive pairing of Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala, who looked shot to pieces and an accident waiting to happen against the speed and mobility of Rashford and Martial.\nThey have now won only three out of 11 games since Guardiola's appointment was announced - and with rivals such as their Old Trafford neighbours and West Ham applying pressure, they need to rediscover their best form quickly.\nRashford for England?\nThe clamour will grow for the teenager after the flash of brilliance that led to the winner, accompanied by a selfless display of running that saw him take the ball into the corner to see the game out deep into the sixth minute of stoppage time.\nRashford's time will come but he also looked out on his feet, despite that late surge, after a run of eight successive starts.\nHe is undoubtedly a precocious talent but it may be too soon for Hodgson to be tempted into calling him up. One thing is certain - if it does not happen now it will happen before too long.\nMan of the match: Marcus Rashford\nWhat the managers said\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"We did not deserve to lose. We dominated the game from the first minute and we were the only team who wanted to play during the whole game - but we missed three or four chance to score.\n\"We are still in fourth place and we missed clear chances to score. We have another 24 points to play for and every game is different. It was a mistake for our goal and I don't remember a lot of options for Manchester United other than that.\"\nOn a difficult match for defender Demichelis, who was substituted, he added: \"Every player has bad days. Demichelis was nervous and it was not good for him to continue. We didn't score goals but that is not his fault.\"\nManchester United boss Louis Van Gaal: \"I am a very proud manager.\n\"We played a very good first half with a goal and also had more chances and we didn't receive a lot of chances against us.\n\"This victory was necessary. The gap was four points and now it is one point, plus we are equal with West Ham, which is important. What is possible? I cannot say.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThe last time City failed to score in both games of a season against a single Premier League opponent was against Arsenal in 2010-11.\nManchester United had just five shots including those blocked - their joint lowest number in a single league match this season (the other time against Crystal Palace in October).\nMeanwhile, Manchester City had 26 shots including those blocked - their highest number without scoring in a Premier League match since January 2012 (27 v Sunderland).\nSix of Manchester United's last seven Premier League away goals have been scored by English players.\nManuel Pellegrini's City side have failed to score in three of their past four Premier League games.\nLouis van Gaal's United side have kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League side this season (14).\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Manchester City travel to Bournemouth for a 15:00 GMT Premier League fixture on Saturday, 2 April, while Manchester United host Everton the next day in a 16:00 GMT kick-off.",

We continued the level of performance against Barcelona.\n\"I like this group, I like the mental attitude - it has been questioned and it hurts me.\n\"When you work every day with them you see how much effort they put in.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We were second best. I thought Arsenal had more bite and intensity.\n\"It was so disappointing, the contrast in performance from last Saturday [the 2-0 FA Cup victory over Chelsea] is difficult to explain.\n\"We never got a platform into the game, we were ineffective, we had second thoughts in every action and Arsenal were, in every single aspect of the performance, better than us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal enjoyed only their third victory in their past 10 away Premier League games (drawn four, lost three).\nWelbeck has now scored four Premier League goals against Everton, his joint-best return against any side (along with Aston Villa).\nIwobi scored on his first Premier League start, the first Arsenal player to do so since Joel Campbell in October.\nBellerin has provided three assists in his past two Premier League games after managing just two in his previous 46.\nWhat next?\nThe Premier League takes a break for international football and Arsenal do not play again until 2 April when Watford visit Emirates Stadium.\nNext for Everton is a trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on 3 April."

But Slaven Bilic and his side will be furious with the decision from referee Mark Clattenburg in the 67th minute.\nThe Hammers were 2-1 ahead when Clattenburg dismissed Kouyate after he clumsily lunged at Gayle. Contact was made, but a straight red card seemed an extremely harsh decision.\nSpeaking after the match, Gayle admitted he did not think Kouyate's challenge was \"too bad\", but it had a big impact on the match.\nPalace, who instantly brought on striker Fraizer Campbell for midfielder Joe Ledley after Kouyate's sending off, equalised eight minutes later when Gayle pounced as Ogbonna made a mess of an attempted clearance.\nAnother wonderful goal for Payet\nIt was an afternoon of great entertainment at Upton Park. Before Kouyate's sending off, West Ham had looked well-placed to claim the three points.\nDespite falling behind in the 15th minute, they were only in arrears for three minutes before Diafra Sakho headed down Michail Antonio's cross and Lanzini drilled his low effort home.\nBut the moment of the match, once again, came from the boot of midfielder Payet, whose curling, dipping 20-yard free-kick put the Hammers ahead as half-time approached.\nIt was his 12th goal of the season and he has also been directly involved in 23 goals in all competitions, 13 more than any other West Ham player.\nIf the Hammers do miss out on Champions League qualification then they will face a battle to keep hold of the France midfielder, who is surely going to be among the contenders for the Premier League's Player of the Year award.\nPalace can be optimistic despite winless league run continuing\nAlthough they earned a good point, Crystal Palace may well see this as a missed opportunity.\nThey were gifted a fortunate opener when Adrian parried Bakary Sako's free-kick, even though the ball was heading out, into Delaney's path, who headed in from close range.\nEven when they were pegged back, the Eagles should have retaken the lead when Jason Puncheon found himself free six yards out. But he did not know whether to head or volley the ball and did neither, with the ball bouncing off his knee and over the bar.\nAlan Pardew's side have now not won in 14 Premier League games, but will be encouraged by the number of chances they created.\nThe Eagles, who have reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, are 16th, seven points above Sunderland in 18th. However, with a home game against Norwich and a trip to struggling Newcastle among their remaining fixtures, Pardew will be confident his side will stay in the top flight.\nThe stats you need to know\nCrystal Palace have scored the most goals by defenders in the Premier League this season (nine).\nOnly Southampton (six) have been shown more red cards than West Ham United (five) in the league this season.\nDwight Gayle ended a run of 20 Premier League games without a goal, scoring for the first time since January 2015.\nCrystal Palace remain the only team in the top four tiers who are yet to win a game in 2016 (drawn two, lost nine).\nMan of the match - Dimitri Payet (West Ham)\nWhat they said\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic said: \"I want to commend the players it was a good game of football, open, and we deserved to win.\n\"When it was 11 v 11 the scoreline was correct. They caused us a threat, but only at set pieces, then we turned it around.\"\nOn the decision to send off Kouyate, Bilic added: \"I would love to say a lot of things. I asked the legal people what can I say and what I can't. It is never a red card and it's the fourth game in a row we are getting decisions that are costing us.\n\"We're fighting to finish high. If the opponent is better than you, ok, but it is frustrating. We aren't going to sink or moan - we will come back and continue to play good football.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew admitted that he did not agree with Mark Clattenburg's decision to send off Kouyate.\n\"I thought the red card was harsh and I would've been disappointed to have that happen to one of my players,\" said Pardew.\n\"When you are 2-1 down at West Ham, in the form they are in, you take a 2-2. I'm delighted for the team and they showed their heart is still very much in it. We've got ourselves into a bit of trouble but this is a great result.\n\"Every point in the Premier League is gold-dust, especially to get something at West Ham. It was a great performance and a great result. West Ham had to defend for their lives at the end.\"\nWhat next?\nNext weekend is a vital one for West Ham and their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League as they entertain an Arsenal side third in the table. That London derby is the early kick-off on Saturday, 9 April, the same day as Crystal Palace's 3pm home game against Norwich City, another team fighting to stay in the Premier League.",

Up until the goal, we were the team with a better tempo and we always looked a threat.\n\"The goal was a very soft action, it's not up to our standards. The performances were very, very level and we shouldn't have lost the game. It's that sort of game that came down to small margins - the ball hitting the crossbar is the difference between us getting something out of the game.\n\"We are a young group with great potential, but our home form hasn't been anywhere near good enough.\"\nMan Utd stole victory, says Van Gaal\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester United have become the first team to score 1,000 Premier League goals at home.\nThe first was scored by Denis Irwin in a 1-1 draw against Ipswich Town in August 1992.\nBut the first Premier League goal for anybody at Old Trafford was scored by Everton - through Peter Beardsley in a 3-0 victory.\nTen of United's 15 Premier League games at Old Trafford this season have been goalless at half-time.\nEverton have suffered 200 defeats away from home in the Premier League.\nUnited have recorded four successive home wins for the first time since April 2015 (when they won six in a row).\nWhat next?\nManchester United travel to second-placed Tottenham in the Premier League next Sunday before an FA Cup quarter-final replay at West Ham three days later. Everton face a league trip to Watford next Saturday, and then to Crystal Palace the following Wednesday."

If it is not a handball, it is a goal. I don't know what they are doing.\n\"The second one was when Robert Huth handled. I don't say [Leicester] don't deserve the victory, but if it is a penalty and a red card, they don't win.\"\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante\nWhat they said\nLeicester captain Wes Morgan: \"We saw the Tottenham game yesterday [Saturday] was a draw and wanted to make the most of our opportunity.

The 21-year-old - who scored the equaliser in the Tyne-Wear derby - was once again Newcastle's hero, twice equalising having entered the action in the 62nd minute.\nThe momentum was with the visitors, and a first win must have gone through manager Rafael Benitez's mind when he saw Papiss Cisse's header drift towards the top corner, only for John Ruddy to produce an incredible save.\nThe Spaniard would have been happy with a point, but that hope was snatched away from him when Newcastle's porous defence was once again found wanting by left-back Olsson, whose late gamble to get forward into the opposition's area paid off.\nMbokani underlines Norwich spirit\nIt has been quite a fortnight for Mbokani.\nThe Canaries frontman declared it was a \"miracle\" he was alive\n, external\nhaving been at Brussels' Zaventem Airport during the attacks on 22 March.\nAt Carrow Road he received a warm welcome from the home crowd and delivered an outstanding display.\nThe 6ft 1in DR Congo striker won eight of his nine aerial duels (89%), provided four key passes and had three efforts on goal - one of which resulted in a goal.

But Slaven Bilic and his side will be furious with the decision from referee Mark Clattenburg in the 67th minute.\nThe Hammers were 2-1 ahead when Clattenburg dismissed Kouyate after he clumsily lunged at Gayle. Contact was made, but a straight red card seemed an extremely harsh decision.\nSpeaking after the match, Gayle admitted he did not think Kouyate's challenge was \"too bad\", but it had a big impact on the match.\nPalace, who instantly brought on striker Fraizer Campbell for midfielder Joe Ledley after Kouyate's sending off, equalised eight minutes later when Gayle pounced as Ogbonna made a mess of an attempted clearance.\nAnother wonderful goal for Payet\nIt was an afternoon of great entertainment at Upton Park. Before Kouyate's sending off, West Ham had looked well-placed to claim the three points.\nDespite falling behind in the 15th minute, they were only in arrears for three minutes before Diafra Sakho headed down Michail Antonio's cross and Lanzini drilled his low effort home.\nBut the moment of the match, once again, came from the boot of midfielder Payet, whose curling, dipping 20-yard free-kick put the Hammers ahead as half-time approached.\nIt was his 12th goal of the season and he has also been directly involved in 23 goals in all competitions, 13 more than any other West Ham player.\nIf the Hammers do miss out on Champions League qualification then they will face a battle to keep hold of the France midfielder, who is surely going to be among the contenders for the Premier League's Player of the Year award.\nPalace can be optimistic despite winless league run continuing\nAlthough they earned a good point, Crystal Palace may well see this as a missed opportunity.\nThey were gifted a fortunate opener when Adrian parried Bakary Sako's free-kick, even though the ball was heading out, into Delaney's path, who headed in from close range.\nEven when they were pegged back, the Eagles should have retaken the lead when Jason Puncheon found himself free six yards out. But he did not know whether to head or volley the ball and did neither, with the ball bouncing off his knee and over the bar.\nAlan Pardew's side have now not won in 14 Premier League games, but will be encouraged by the number of chances they created.\nThe Eagles, who have reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, are 16th, seven points above Sunderland in 18th. However, with a home game against Norwich and a trip to struggling Newcastle among their remaining fixtures, Pardew will be confident his side will stay in the top flight.\nThe stats you need to know\nCrystal Palace have scored the most goals by defenders in the Premier League this season (nine).\nOnly Southampton (six) have been shown more red cards than West Ham United (five) in the league this season.\nDwight Gayle ended a run of 20 Premier League games without a goal, scoring for the first time since January 2015.\nCrystal Palace remain the only team in the top four tiers who are yet to win a game in 2016 (drawn two, lost nine).\nMan of the match - Dimitri Payet (West Ham)\nWhat they said\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic said: \"I want to commend the players it was a good game of football, open, and we deserved to win.\n\"When it was 11 v 11 the scoreline was correct. They caused us a threat, but only at set pieces, then we turned it around.\"\nOn the decision to send off Kouyate, Bilic added: \"I would love to say a lot of things. I asked the legal people what can I say and what I can't. It is never a red card and it's the fourth game in a row we are getting decisions that are costing us.\n\"We're fighting to finish high. If the opponent is better than you, ok, but it is frustrating. We aren't going to sink or moan - we will come back and continue to play good football.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew admitted that he did not agree with Mark Clattenburg's decision to send off Kouyate.\n\"I thought the red card was harsh and I would've been disappointed to have that happen to one of my players,\" said Pardew.\n\"When you are 2-1 down at West Ham, in the form they are in, you take a 2-2. I'm delighted for the team and they showed their heart is still very much in it. We've got ourselves into a bit of trouble but this is a great result.\n\"Every point in the Premier League is gold-dust, especially to get something at West Ham. It was a great performance and a great result. West Ham had to defend for their lives at the end.\"\nWhat next?\nNext weekend is a vital one for West Ham and their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League as they entertain an Arsenal side third in the table. That London derby is the early kick-off on Saturday, 9 April, the same day as Crystal Palace's 3pm home game against Norwich City, another team fighting to stay in the Premier League.",

The 21-year-old - who scored the equaliser in the Tyne-Wear derby - was once again Newcastle's hero, twice equalising having entered the action in the 62nd minute.\nThe momentum was with the visitors, and a first win must have gone through manager Rafael Benitez's mind when he saw Papiss Cisse's header drift towards the top corner, only for John Ruddy to produce an incredible save.\nThe Spaniard would have been happy with a point, but that hope was snatched away from him when Newcastle's porous defence was once again found wanting by left-back Olsson, whose late gamble to get forward into the opposition's area paid off.\nMbokani underlines Norwich spirit\nIt has been quite a fortnight for Mbokani.\nThe Canaries frontman declared it was a \"miracle\" he was alive\n, external\nhaving been at Brussels' Zaventem Airport during the attacks on 22 March.\nAt Carrow Road he received a warm welcome from the home crowd and delivered an outstanding display.\nThe 6ft 1in DR Congo striker won eight of his nine aerial duels (89%), provided four key passes and had three efforts on goal - one of which resulted in a goal. That 71st-minute shot was a stunner.\nThe Canaries display as a whole was in stark contrast to the one in the reverse fixture in October at St James' Park where they succumbed to a 6-2 defeat.\nIt is now seven points from nine for the Premier League's youngest manager, 34-year-old Alex Neil.\nMan of the match - Dieumerci Mbokani (Norwich)\nManager reaction\nNorwich manager Alex Neil: \"It was a strange game but we were the better team throughout. It looked as if we were going to fail to capitalise but that's the best way to win a game.\n\"We went through the other side against Liverpool, conceding in the last minute of stoppage time, so huge credit to the players. We have great spirit here and we showed that in abundance.\n\"Football is an entertainment sport and everyone has gone home with their money's worth. We have started to turn it around, that's seven points in three games.\"\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez:\n\"Today was a pity. We conceded in the last minute of the first half and then we reacted well but we are disappointed. We worked hard but it is not enough to win games. We have seven games to go and we have to keep pushing.\n\"When we scored the second goal we were on top but we make a mistake and concede.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 0-4 Manchester City\nKevin de Bruyne starred on his return after two months out as Manchester City reinvigorated their top-four hopes with a sparkling win over Bournemouth.\nThree of City's goals came in the first 18 minutes, with Fernando opening the scoring from a Jesus Navas corner.\nDe Bruyne made it 2-0 when he volleyed home David Silva's flick and Sergio Aguero headed a third soon after.\nBournemouth had no response and Aleksandar Kolarov blasted in City's fourth with the last kick of the game.\nCity's win means they are now 12 points behind Premier League leaders Leicester with seven games remaining but their recent form means it is more relevant they increased their lead on fifth-placed West Ham to three points, after the Hammers were held by Crystal Palace.\nThe Cherries, meanwhile, remain two points off the 40-point mark, but their 11-point cushion above the bottom three still looks a healthy one.\nRelive City's early flurry of goals\nCity find some form at last\nA run of one win in their previous six league games had all but ended City's title hopes, and put their prospects of finishing in the Champions League spots in doubt as well.\nTheir away problems have been more longstanding - after winning their first three away league matches of the season, they took only 11 points from their next 11 games on the road, managing just seven goals.\nThere were no signs of those struggles at the Vitality Stadium, however, and they ripped Bournemouth apart with a devastating attacking display early on.\nCity head to French champions Paris St-Germain next, in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final, on the back of a performance that will give them reasons to be optimistic that more goals will follow.\nPellegrini pleased with pressing game\nCity boss Manuel Pellegrini felt his side's high-tempo pressing game was behind the fast start that led to their comfortable victory.\nPellegrini told BBC Sport: \"Our style of play was the way I like us to play. The most important thing was to return to our style of play.\n\"We played very well, especially the first half where we pressed very high, and scored three beautiful goals.\"\nThe move that led to De Bruyne's goal started when Bournemouth's Charlie Daniels lost the ball on the edge of his own area.\n\"Part of the mistake was down to the pressure we put on to recover the ball,\" Pellegrini explained.\n\"That was very important because we were a team that was pressing three four or five times just on that occasion. Then when we won it back we finished with the quality we have.\"\nDe Bruyne makes a brilliant return\nAt the end of a week where they discovered they could be without Yaya Toure and Joe Hart as well as skipper Vincent Kompany for their trip to Paris, a returning star gave City some reason to be cheerful.\nDe Bruyne has been sorely missed since he injured his knee at the end of January, with City winning only four out of 12 games without him.\nThe \u00a355m Belgian marked his return with a superbly taken goal, a volley relying on placement rather than power from the edge of the box, and came close to an equally spectacular second when another volley was palmed away by Artur Boruc.\nHe came off after 57 minutes to a deserved standing ovation and, when he is fully fit, City's chances against any opposition are clearly improved.\nSamir Nasri's appearance off the bench in the second half, for his first game since October, was another bonus for Pellegrini. The French midfielder has recovered from his serious thigh injury, but he is not in City's Champions League squad.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nFirst goal hurts most for Howe\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe said afterwards that he felt his side \"caught City on a good day\" but also rued some self-destructive defending.\nHowe told BBC Sport: \"The first goal was probably the most disappointing one because it was from a set-play, a poor ball in really, and we have not dealt with it.\n\"When you give a good team an early goal it gives them a lift and it makes it very difficult.\n\"It was a long game from 3-0 down so credit to the players that they did not cave in but it was a difficult watch, especially early on.\"\nBournemouth took 30 minutes to register their first effort on target - a Steve Cook header that forced a good stop from Willy Caballero - and did not manage another until Matt Ritchie let fly from distance in the 92nd minute.\nWhat's next?\nCity head for Paris, then play host to West Brom next Saturday.\nOn the same day, Bournemouth will be in action at Villa Park, where a Cherries win and a combination of other results could relegate Aston Villa.\nThe stats you need to know\nFernando bagged his first goal since March 2015 when he scored against West Brom.\nOnly Sergio Aguero (17) has scored more Premier League goals for Man City this season than Kevin De Bruyne (6).\nDavid Silva (11) is second only to Mesut Ozil (18) for assists in the Premier League this season.\nNo player has scored more Premier League goals in 2016 than Aguero (10, level with Harry Kane).\nMan City have scored seven first-half goals against the Cherries this season."

The Swansea coach's Vicenza side had been denied a place in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup by a dramatic goal by Hughes for Chelsea in 1998.\nThis time, the Italian had the final word, and Swansea - who have reached 37 points - are surely safe from relegation.\nHaugaard has difficulties on league debut\nWith Stoke's first-choice goalkeeper Jack Butland ruled out for the rest of the season - as well as Euro 2016 - after breaking his ankle on England duty seven days earlier, this was a chance for Jakob Haugaard to impress.\nThe Dane, signed from Midtjylland last summer, made his Premier League debut, but did not have the most auspicious of afternoons.\nHe flapped at one early corner, sending the ball high into the air with a punch that made next to no distance, and looked less than comfortable under pressure.\nHaugaard should really have kept out Sigurdsson's goal, which gave Swansea hope. The keeper may have been unsighted as the Iceland international turned to score from the edge of the penalty area, but the shot was well within his reach - and the scorer confirmed afterwards that it had not been deflected.\nStoke slip up again\nHughes has assembled a terrific squad at the Britannia Stadium; one that is well on course for their highest league finish since 1975 despite a raft of injuries.\nThey have, though, developed a frustrating habit of slipping up just when their momentum looks set to carry them into contention for a place in Europe.\nStoke lost to Southampton in their previous home game, when a win would have taken them to within a point of sixth place and, having won at Watford before the international break, they passed up another great chance to progress here.\nAfellay's opening goal was the least Stoke deserved for their first-half superiority and, when Bojan added a well-taken second by ending a mazy run with a precise low shot, the match should have been won.\nMan of the match - Jefferson Montero (Swansea)\nWhat they said\nSwansea head coach Francesco Guidolin: \"I am very happy because it's not easy coming into the Premier League. I saw, for example, what happened to Remi Garde at Aston Villa. We are seeing it with Rafa Benitez at Newcastle. It is not easy for anyone in our job to come in during the season.\n\"I hope to see my team play well in the last weeks of the season. I saw my team play with solidarity and enthusiasm and collaboration and focus. This is an important message for us. I am very proud today.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"I thought we were good value at 2-0. We created the vast majority of the chances up to that point and could have had more goals.\n\"But 2-0 isn't the easiest of leads to protect. Maybe we got defensive when they got the goal. They got the second goal from their second shot on target. One of Swansea's players was in an offside position for it, and we've been in to see the officials. But we don't get too many of those decisions.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nIbrahim Afellay scored a Premier League goal at the Britannia Stadium for the first time on his 30th birthday. It was also Stoke's 200th Premier League home goal.\nGylfi Sigurdsson (10) is the first Icelandic player to score 10 or more goals in a Premier League season since Eidur Gudjohnsen in 2004-05 (12).\nMarko Arnautovic, who assisted Afellay's opener, has been involved in more league goals this season than any other Stoke player (15 in total - 10 goals, 5 assists).\nSwansea have kept just one clean sheet in their past 17 Premier League away games.\nWhat next?\nStoke will attempt to revive their Europa League challenge when they visit Liverpool a week on Sunday (16:00 BST), the day after Swansea bid to reach the 40-point mark by beating Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium (15:00 BST).",

He has to deal with the competition but he finally stepped up.\"\nStats you need to know\nRuben Loftus-Cheek scored his first Premier League goal in his 11th appearance.\nAlexandre Pato is the sixth Brazilian to score on his Premier League debut, following Geovanni, Robinho, Gilberto, Ilan and Willian.\nOscar assisted Pedro's first goal within a minute of entering the field at half-time.\nOnly Diego Costa (11) has scored more Premier League goals for Chelsea than Pedro (6) this season.\nTwo of the five occasions Aston Villa have lost by four goals or more at Villa Park in the Premier League have come in 2015-16 (also 6-0 v Liverpool).\nChelsea have now set the longest unbeaten run of any team in the Premier League this season, going 15 games without a loss, winning seven and drawing eight.\nVilla have lost seven consecutive games for the second separate time this season.\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa play Bournemouth at Villa Park next Saturday.

The most important thing was to return to our style of play.\n\"We played very well, especially the first half where we pressed very high, and scored three beautiful goals.\"\nThe move that led to De Bruyne's goal started when Bournemouth's Charlie Daniels lost the ball on the edge of his own area.\n\"Part of the mistake was down to the pressure we put on to recover the ball,\" Pellegrini explained.\n\"That was very important because we were a team that was pressing three four or five times just on that occasion. Then when we won it back we finished with the quality we have.\"\nDe Bruyne makes a brilliant return\nAt the end of a week where they discovered they could be without Yaya Toure and Joe Hart as well as skipper Vincent Kompany for their trip to Paris, a returning star gave City some reason to be cheerful.\nDe Bruyne has been sorely missed since he injured his knee at the end of January, with City winning only four out of 12 games without him.\nThe \u00a355m Belgian marked his return with a superbly taken goal, a volley relying on placement rather than power from the edge of the box, and came close to an equally spectacular second when another volley was palmed away by Artur Boruc.\nHe came off after 57 minutes to a deserved standing ovation and, when he is fully fit, City's chances against any opposition are clearly improved.\nSamir Nasri's appearance off the bench in the second half, for his first game since October, was another bonus for Pellegrini. The French midfielder has recovered from his serious thigh injury, but he is not in City's Champions League squad.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nFirst goal hurts most for Howe\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe said afterwards that he felt his side \"caught City on a good day\" but also rued some self-destructive defending.\nHowe told BBC Sport: \"The first goal was probably the most disappointing one because it was from a set-play, a poor ball in really, and we have not dealt with it.\n\"When you give a good team an early goal it gives them a lift and it makes it very difficult.\n\"It was a long game from 3-0 down so credit to the players that they did not cave in but it was a difficult watch, especially early on.\"\nBournemouth took 30 minutes to register their first effort on target - a Steve Cook header that forced a good stop from Willy Caballero - and did not manage another until Matt Ritchie let fly from distance in the 92nd minute.\nWhat's next?\nCity head for Paris, then play host to West Brom next Saturday.\nOn the same day, Bournemouth will be in action at Villa Park, where a Cherries win and a combination of other results could relegate Aston Villa.\nThe stats you need to know\nFernando bagged his first goal since March 2015 when he scored against West Brom.\nOnly Sergio Aguero (17) has scored more Premier League goals for Man City this season than Kevin De Bruyne (6).\nDavid Silva (11) is second only to Mesut Ozil (18) for assists in the Premier League this season.\nNo player has scored more Premier League goals in 2016 than Aguero (10, level with Harry Kane).\nMan City have scored seven first-half goals against the Cherries this season.",

If it is not a handball, it is a goal. I don't know what they are doing.\n\"The second one was when Robert Huth handled.

He had run out of steam by the time he was replaced by Divock Origi late on.\nMan of the Match: Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\nManager reaction\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"Tottenham are fighting for the title, we fought for the three points. It didn't look like six or seven positions between the two teams. If you want to change the situation, we have to stay in the game. It is about belief.

The Swansea coach's Vicenza side had been denied a place in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup by a dramatic goal by Hughes for Chelsea in 1998.\nThis time, the Italian had the final word, and Swansea - who have reached 37 points - are surely safe from relegation.\nHaugaard has difficulties on league debut\nWith Stoke's first-choice goalkeeper Jack Butland ruled out for the rest of the season - as well as Euro 2016 - after breaking his ankle on England duty seven days earlier, this was a chance for Jakob Haugaard to impress.\nThe Dane, signed from Midtjylland last summer, made his Premier League debut, but did not have the most auspicious of afternoons.\nHe flapped at one early corner, sending the ball high into the air with a punch that made next to no distance, and looked less than comfortable under pressure.\nHaugaard should really have kept out Sigurdsson's goal, which gave Swansea hope. The keeper may have been unsighted as the Iceland international turned to score from the edge of the penalty area, but the shot was well within his reach - and the scorer confirmed afterwards that it had not been deflected.\nStoke slip up again\nHughes has assembled a terrific squad at the Britannia Stadium; one that is well on course for their highest league finish since 1975 despite a raft of injuries.\nThey have, though, developed a frustrating habit of slipping up just when their momentum looks set to carry them into contention for a place in Europe.\nStoke lost to Southampton in their previous home game, when a win would have taken them to within a point of sixth place and, having won at Watford before the international break, they passed up another great chance to progress here.\nAfellay's opening goal was the least Stoke deserved for their first-half superiority and, when Bojan added a well-taken second by ending a mazy run with a precise low shot, the match should have been won.\nMan of the match - Jefferson Montero (Swansea)\nWhat they said\nSwansea head coach Francesco Guidolin: \"I am very happy because it's not easy coming into the Premier League. I saw, for example, what happened to Remi Garde at Aston Villa. We are seeing it with Rafa Benitez at Newcastle. It is not easy for anyone in our job to come in during the season.\n\"I hope to see my team play well in the last weeks of the season. I saw my team play with solidarity and enthusiasm and collaboration and focus. This is an important message for us. I am very proud today.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"I thought we were good value at 2-0. We created the vast majority of the chances up to that point and could have had more goals.\n\"But 2-0 isn't the easiest of leads to protect. Maybe we got defensive when they got the goal. They got the second goal from their second shot on target. One of Swansea's players was in an offside position for it, and we've been in to see the officials. But we don't get too many of those decisions.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nIbrahim Afellay scored a Premier League goal at the Britannia Stadium for the first time on his 30th birthday. It was also Stoke's 200th Premier League home goal.\nGylfi Sigurdsson (10) is the first Icelandic player to score 10 or more goals in a Premier League season since Eidur Gudjohnsen in 2004-05 (12).\nMarko Arnautovic, who assisted Afellay's opener, has been involved in more league goals this season than any other Stoke player (15 in total - 10 goals, 5 assists).\nSwansea have kept just one clean sheet in their past 17 Premier League away games.\nWhat next?\nStoke will attempt to revive their Europa League challenge when they visit Liverpool a week on Sunday (16:00 BST), the day after Swansea bid to reach the 40-point mark by beating Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium (15:00 BST)."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Liverpool 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham missed the opportunity to increase pressure on Premier League leaders Leicester City as they could only draw with Liverpool at Anfield.\nHarry Kane's superb finish on the turn after 63 minutes gave Spurs a point after Philippe Coutinho slipped in Daniel Sturridge's pass early in the second half.\nKeeper Hugo Lloris kept Spurs on level terms with fine saves from Sturridge and two from Adam Lallana in the opening half - while Coutinho was inches off target in the closing moments.\nMauricio Pochettino's side had chances of their own in the second half, with Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet saving well from Christian Eriksen and Mousa Dembele, while Son Heung-min should have done better than volley wide from Eric Dier's pass.\nThe draw means Leicester would go seven points clear with victory at home to Southampton on Sunday.\nOne point gained or two lost for Spurs?\nKane's brilliant turn and finish after Eriksen chased a lost cause into the corner at least gave Spurs a point when they threatened to leave Anfield empty-handed after Coutinho's opener.\nIn the final reckoning, however, they will regard this as a chance missed - and manager Pochettino's body language seemed to suggest as much as he agonised over Mignolet's late save from Dembele and the sight of Toby Alderweireld's header flashing inches wide from the resulting corner.\nSpurs will now be banking on Southampton doing them a favour at the King Power Stadium on Sunday as a seven-point advantage with only six games left is a big gap to claw back and would need something close to a Foxes collapse.\nA point still gives Spurs something to cling to as they chase that first title in 55 years - but they will know it could have been all three had they been more clinical to benefit fully from that outstanding first-half work by keeper Lloris.\nLiverpool must build team around Coutinho\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will be taking big decisions about his squad as he tries to make his own permanent imprint on Anfield in the summer.\nHe will surely have already drawn one conclusion from his first six months at the club - the new-look Liverpool that will surely emerge next season must be built around the mercurial talent of Coutinho.\nThe 23-year-old returned from international duty with Brazil but no-one would have imagined he had taken the arduous journey from South America given his energy and inspiration.\nCoutinho was wisely brought to Anfield by Brendan Rodgers and has flourished further under Klopp, as proved by the brilliance of his goal against Manchester United in the Europa League and the composure he showed to finish in front of the Kop against Spurs.\nHe is the man who sprinkles magic on this Liverpool side and has years ahead of him to develop into a truly world-class talent.\nKlopp will be bringing in new faces as he reshapes Liverpool but Coutinho will be going nowhere.\nSturridge still struggling\nSturridge has the twin objective of piecing his Liverpool career together again after suffering a succession of injuries over the last two years while cementing a place in England manager Roy Hodgson's Euro 2016 squad.\nHere, it was clear he is still taking tentative steps on the road back as he looked ring rusty and still short of the form that made him such a potent force.\nSturridge showed his vision with a clever pass for Coutinho's goal but his snatched finish straight at Lloris in the first half hinted at fragile confidence. He had run out of steam by the time he was replaced by Divock Origi late on.\nMan of the Match: Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\nManager reaction\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"Tottenham are fighting for the title, we fought for the three points. It didn't look like six or seven positions between the two teams. If you want to change the situation, we have to stay in the game. It is about belief. We are not sure we can always beat teams like these.\n\"You have to learn to become a winner. On this way, we have a few knocks but we are still on a good way. There is not a lot wrong and we can build on this.\"\nStats you need to know\nLiverpool have won five and lost none of their last seven Premier League meetings with Tottenham.\nAfter going seven Premier League games without scoring, Philippe Coutinho has now scored in back-to-back games for Liverpool.\nTottenham have won just one of their last 22 Premier League visits to Anfield (W1 D7 L14).\nChristian Eriksen has now recorded more assists in 2015-16 than in any other previous campaign for Spurs (9).\nSpurs have recovered the most points from losing positions this season (19), while Liverpool have dropped the most from leading positions (17).\nWhat next?\nLiverpool travel to Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League on Thursday (20:05 BST) before hosting Stoke a week on Sunday (16:00 BST). Tottenham face Manchester United at home on the same day (also 16:00 BST).",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 1-0 Everton\nAnthony Martial's winning goal kept Manchester United in the chase for a Champions League place on the day they named a stand after Sir Bobby Charlton.\nMartial turned in Tim Fosu-Mensah's cross from close range early in the second half to send Everton to a third straight Premier League defeat.\nPhil Jagielka headed against the bar for the visitors, and later had a snapshot saved by David De Gea.\nVictory leaves United one point behind fourth-placed Manchester City.\nRelive the action from Old Trafford\nMan Utd unveil Sir Bobby Charlton Stand\nYoung generation gives Sir Bobby victory\nManchester United's modern-day young players combined to set up victory on a day when the club honoured as great a home-grown talent as they have ever had.\nBefore kick-off, the South Stand was renamed after Sir Bobby Charlton, the Busby Babe who won the 1966 World Cup with England, and who remains United's record goalscorer.\nAccompanied by his wife Norma, a visibly emotional Charlton watched from the pitch before kick-off as fans held up sheets to spell out his name.\nThe United team of 2016 follows strongly in the club's tradition of blooding young players - three of which were involved in the goal that provided a breakthrough after a turgid first half.\nMarcus Rashford has been a revelation since breaking into the United team in February; scoring four times in his first two appearances and hitting the winner at Manchester City two weeks ago.\nThis time, his backheel freed fellow academy graduate Fosu-Mensah to play a low ball across goal, which 20-year-old Martial - signed from Monaco for an initial fee of \u00a336m in September - touched in at the far post.\nFrom his seat in the stand, Charlton applauded warmly, a smile breaking across his face.\nUnited grind out victory\nThe result will have been pleasing for Charlton, but this was a far from fluent United performance in a largely forgettable match.\nFor the 10th time in the Premier League this season, a first half at Old Trafford ended goalless, and there was not a single shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nEverton just shaded that first half, with Marcos Rojo struggling at left-back against the pace of Everton winger Gerard Deulofeu.\nUnited improved after taking the lead, but were never entirely comfortable and - in addition to Jagielka's two near-misses - escaped when the classy Fosu-Mensah made a brilliant clearance almost underneath his own bar to clear Seamus Coleman's low cross.\nHowever, it was a second successive 1-0 victory for manager Louis van Gaal, which keeps his team firmly in contention to qualify for next season's Champions League.\nStones stumbles on return\nIt was a mixed afternoon for Everton defender John Stones, making only his second club start since late January as he attempts to ride through the trickiest spell of his young career to date.\nA target for Chelsea last summer, Stones has had to watch on for much of the last two months as Ramiro Funes Mori has partnered Jagielka at centre-back.\nStones has been criticised for errors made when trying to play out from the back; the latest of which came with England on Tuesday, as a slip allowed the Netherlands to begin the move from which they earned a penalty in a 2-1 win.\nThe 21-year-old showed he still has plenty of confidence on the ball, and made a superbly-timed challenge to deny Martial in the first half.\nHowever, he was at fault for United's winner, as both he and Coleman switched off to allow Martial space at the far post, and Everton fell to only their second away league defeat of the season.\nMan of the match: Daley Blind (Manchester United)\nWhat they said\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"There were two games within a game. Up until the goal, we were the team with a better tempo and we always looked a threat.\n\"The goal was a very soft action, it's not up to our standards. The performances were very, very level and we shouldn't have lost the game. It's that sort of game that came down to small margins - the ball hitting the crossbar is the difference between us getting something out of the game.\n\"We are a young group with great potential, but our home form hasn't been anywhere near good enough.\"\nMan Utd stole victory, says Van Gaal\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester United have become the first team to score 1,000 Premier League goals at home.\nThe first was scored by Denis Irwin in a 1-1 draw against Ipswich Town in August 1992.\nBut the first Premier League goal for anybody at Old Trafford was scored by Everton - through Peter Beardsley in a 3-0 victory.\nTen of United's 15 Premier League games at Old Trafford this season have been goalless at half-time.\nEverton have suffered 200 defeats away from home in the Premier League.\nUnited have recorded four successive home wins for the first time since April 2015 (when they won six in a row).\nWhat next?\nManchester United travel to second-placed Tottenham in the Premier League next Sunday before an FA Cup quarter-final replay at West Ham three days later. Everton face a league trip to Watford next Saturday, and then to Crystal Palace the following Wednesday."

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Watford 1-1 Everton\nWatford ended a four-match losing run by coming from behind to secure a draw against an out-of-form Everton.\nWith both teams eyeing the FA Cup semi-finals in a fortnight and struggling in the league, it is no surprise that this match lacked quality at times.\nDefensive errors led to the two goals. James McCarthy nicked the ball from Miguel Britos to coolly finish.\nThen seconds later Jose Holebas headed home at the far post from a corner which Everton had needlessly conceded.\nIt was John Stones, attempting to keep the ball alive in first-half stoppage time, who passed the ball back to Joel Robles forcing the goalkeeper to boot it out for a corner.\nAdmittedly, Everton's defence should have dealt better with the resultant set-piece which deflected in off Seamus Coleman.\nRomelu Lukaku hit the crossbar in the dying minutes and Watford too could have sneaked victory at the end only for an acrobatic Robles save to deny a deflected Ben Watson strike from distance. A draw, however, was the fairer result.\nReaction from Vicarage Road and round-ups of the rest of Saturday's games\nEverton fans make feelings clear\nToffees fans may have a trip to Wembley to look forward to at the end of the month, but that has not sated some of the fans who have become dismayed by the team's performances in the league.\nLast Sunday's 1-0 loss to Manchester United was their third successive league defeat and a loss which led Leighton Baines to claim the team lacked chemistry, comments he would later apologise for.\nBut the banners around Vicarage Road were evidence that all is not well on the blue half of Merseyside. \"Martinez out\" read one banner, while another said \"Baines is one of us\".\nMartinez described the draw as a \"solid performance\" but his team were well below the standards his young side had set in the early stages of the season, when they were so easy on the eye.\nWatford stop the rot\nWith just two victories in 12 league matches this year, Watford lacked confidence in the early stages of the match but were more sure defensively than the team which was thumped 4-0 by Arsenal last weekend.\nIt was the hosts who enjoyed the best chance of the match - a fine 25-yard strike from Jose Manuel Jurado forcing a fingertip save from Robles - until McCarthy struck.\nIndeed, the Hornets were finishing the first half strongly when Craig Cathcart tamely headed across to Britos, putting his team-mate under needless pressure.\nThe Uruguayan flapped, McCarthy nicked possession and the Republic of Ireland international finished beyond Gomes for his first goal of the season. But Everton's lead was short-lived.\nWatford equalised within a minute when Robles conceded a cheap corner from which Holebas headed in at the back post.\nWhat the managers said\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It's like we forgot a little to be competitive in the Premier League. We were competitive in the FA Cup and it's time to recuperate that power - this team has played really well this season.\n\"It was a fair result. The most important thing for us was to have the feeling that we had the legs and the power so I'm happy.\n\"It was important to score as we didn't deserve to go into half-time behind. It was very hard for us, it was nice we were able to draw level before half-time.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We had to work really hard for it. It was a good game, two teams with a lot of energy playing on the front foot. Watford were at their very best.\n\"It's a disappointment to concede from a dead-ball situation so close to half time and because of the nature of the goal, the deflection.\n\"We never allowed Watford to regain momentum. We were strong in the second half again and the amount of chances we created. We showed a little bit of rustiness from the last few games. Another day we would have scored the winning goal.\"\nMan of the match - Gareth Barry\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton have not lost against Watford in 11 games against the Hornets in all competitions (W9 D2 L0), last losing to Watford in March 1987.\nWatford's only clean sheet against Everton in any match came in their first meeting in August 1982 - they have since gone 21 matches without a shutout against the Toffees.\nJose Holebas netted his first Premier League goal and it was his first league goal since November 2014, when scoring against Internazionale for Roma.\nBen Watson claimed his first Premier League assist since April 2012, when playing for Wigan against Chelsea."

Seven points is a difficult gap to reduce but we need to believe.\n\"The performance like today, and the result like today, showed that this team believes.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal:\n\"Tottenham is a great team and I have said that also in advance of this match. But, until the first goal, I think we were a good team who were playing good in Tottenham and we also had a big chance for a goal.\n\"Yes, 3-0 is a big negative result but the way that we have played until the first goal was good.\"\nRead more from Louis van Gaal\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to Stoke in the Premier League on Monday, 18 April (kick-off 20:00 BST), while Manchester United face West Ham in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday, 13 April (19:00 BST).\nThe stats you need to know:\nManchester United failed to produce a single shot on target in the first halves of both games against Tottenham this season\nErik Lamela scored and assisted in the same game for only the second time in a Premier League match, having done so against Manchester City earlier in this campaign\nDele Alli scored his first goal at White Hart Lane since November, when he netted against Aston Villa\nThere were just five minutes and 46 seconds between Spurs' first and third goals",

We've conceded poor goals, but we have to remain professional until the end.\n\"We didn't create as many chances as we would have liked. Ultimately, if you concede poor goals it will be hard to score.\n\"I'm sure it's not easy to play in that atmosphere, but there have only been two or three victories here this season so I won't be criticising the supporters.\n\"They turned out again today, which I find remarkable. This is certainly not down to the supporters.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, tells BBC Sport: \"This was really important for us. It was very nervy from both teams but I thought we dominated the ball and deserved it in the end.\n\"It was a difficult game to play in because of the toxic atmosphere. We made it that way with the way we started.\"\nStats you need to know\nVilla have made more errors leading to goals than any other side in the Premier League this season (14).\nSteve Cook has scored four Premier League goals this season - the only defender with more is Scott Dann (5).\nJoshua King has scored five times for Bournemouth this season - he managed just five league goals in three seasons in the Championship with Blackburn.\nJordan Ayew scored his first Premier League goal since December, ending a run of 10 games without scoring.\nUp next\nVilla's relegation will be confirmed if they fail to beat Manchester United at Old Trafford next Saturday - something they have not done since 2009.\nBournemouth host Liverpool on 17 April."

We played very well in the first half, we deserved to score other goals.\n\"It's a very important win for our fans. It's a good afternoon for our players, our club and our fans. Jefferson Montero is an important player for us. Safety is almost real, but I hope to take other points in the next weeks because it's important to finish well.\"\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"Every defeat hurts but everyone knows the situation we are in, so there's a positive side to bringing in youngsters and seeing what they can do. We defended poorly and gave Sigurdsson a very free chance. We were attacking, attacking, but in the final third we were not sharp enough.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nCombined with his first spell at Chelsea, it was only Guus Hiddink's second loss in the Premier League (W17 D9).\nOnly Harry Kane (11) and Sergio Aguero (10) have scored more Premier League goals in 2016 than Gylfi Sigurdsson.\nSwansea's past six home league games have produced just seven goals, with no side scoring more than once in any of those fixtures.\nThe Swans have won three consecutive Premier League home games for the first time since March 2013.\nChelsea have failed to win away from home when Asmir Begovic has played in the Premier League this season (D2 L5).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Manchester City on April 16 as they bid to hang on to their top-half status, while Swansea visit relegation-threatened Newcastle on the same day."

You cannot lose these three points at home if you want to fight to be in the Champions League next year.\n\"Now we have a championship with four or five teams to try and play in the Champions League.\n\"When you have players like Kevin de Bruyne and Yaya Toure and they play with Samir Nasri and Sergio Aguero, the way the team played changed immediately. I'm very happy with Samir Nasri.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"I thought we played well today. We've got 40 points and the important thing is the lads turn up in all the games. We did that today and gave them a game and the disappointing thing is we've got nothing out of it.\n\"We've got to hit the target more - it's been a fault of ours this season. And one or two decisions didn't go our way.\n\"I'm not sure it's a penalty for them.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Watford 1-1 Everton\nWatford ended a four-match losing run by coming from behind to secure a draw against an out-of-form Everton.\nWith both teams eyeing the FA Cup semi-finals in a fortnight and struggling in the league, it is no surprise that this match lacked quality at times.\nDefensive errors led to the two goals. James McCarthy nicked the ball from Miguel Britos to coolly finish.\nThen seconds later Jose Holebas headed home at the far post from a corner which Everton had needlessly conceded.\nIt was John Stones, attempting to keep the ball alive in first-half stoppage time, who passed the ball back to Joel Robles forcing the goalkeeper to boot it out for a corner.\nAdmittedly, Everton's defence should have dealt better with the resultant set-piece which deflected in off Seamus Coleman.\nRomelu Lukaku hit the crossbar in the dying minutes and Watford too could have sneaked victory at the end only for an acrobatic Robles save to deny a deflected Ben Watson strike from distance. A draw, however, was the fairer result.\nReaction from Vicarage Road and round-ups of the rest of Saturday's games\nEverton fans make feelings clear\nToffees fans may have a trip to Wembley to look forward to at the end of the month, but that has not sated some of the fans who have become dismayed by the team's performances in the league.\nLast Sunday's 1-0 loss to Manchester United was their third successive league defeat and a loss which led Leighton Baines to claim the team lacked chemistry, comments he would later apologise for.\nBut the banners around Vicarage Road were evidence that all is not well on the blue half of Merseyside. \"Martinez out\" read one banner, while another said \"Baines is one of us\".\nMartinez described the draw as a \"solid performance\" but his team were well below the standards his young side had set in the early stages of the season, when they were so easy on the eye.\nWatford stop the rot\nWith just two victories in 12 league matches this year, Watford lacked confidence in the early stages of the match but were more sure defensively than the team which was thumped 4-0 by Arsenal last weekend.\nIt was the hosts who enjoyed the best chance of the match - a fine 25-yard strike from Jose Manuel Jurado forcing a fingertip save from Robles - until McCarthy struck.\nIndeed, the Hornets were finishing the first half strongly when Craig Cathcart tamely headed across to Britos, putting his team-mate under needless pressure.\nThe Uruguayan flapped, McCarthy nicked possession and the Republic of Ireland international finished beyond Gomes for his first goal of the season. But Everton's lead was short-lived.\nWatford equalised within a minute when Robles conceded a cheap corner from which Holebas headed in at the back post.\nWhat the managers said\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It's like we forgot a little to be competitive in the Premier League. We were competitive in the FA Cup and it's time to recuperate that power - this team has played really well this season.\n\"It was a fair result. The most important thing for us was to have the feeling that we had the legs and the power so I'm happy.\n\"It was important to score as we didn't deserve to go into half-time behind. It was very hard for us, it was nice we were able to draw level before half-time.\"\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We had to work really hard for it. It was a good game, two teams with a lot of energy playing on the front foot. Watford were at their very best.\n\"It's a disappointment to concede from a dead-ball situation so close to half time and because of the nature of the goal, the deflection.\n\"We never allowed Watford to regain momentum. We were strong in the second half again and the amount of chances we created. We showed a little bit of rustiness from the last few games. Another day we would have scored the winning goal.\"\nMan of the match - Gareth Barry\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton have not lost against Watford in 11 games against the Hornets in all competitions (W9 D2 L0), last losing to Watford in March 1987.\nWatford's only clean sheet against Everton in any match came in their first meeting in August 1982 - they have since gone 21 matches without a shutout against the Toffees.\nJose Holebas netted his first Premier League goal and it was his first league goal since November 2014, when scoring against Internazionale for Roma.\nBen Watson claimed his first Premier League assist since April 2012, when playing for Wigan against Chelsea."

We played very well in the first half, we deserved to score other goals.\n\"It's a very important win for our fans. It's a good afternoon for our players, our club and our fans. Jefferson Montero is an important player for us. Safety is almost real, but I hope to take other points in the next weeks because it's important to finish well.\"\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"Every defeat hurts but everyone knows the situation we are in, so there's a positive side to bringing in youngsters and seeing what they can do. We defended poorly and gave Sigurdsson a very free chance. We were attacking, attacking, but in the final third we were not sharp enough.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nCombined with his first spell at Chelsea, it was only Guus Hiddink's second loss in the Premier League (W17 D9).\nOnly Harry Kane (11) and Sergio Aguero (10) have scored more Premier League goals in 2016 than Gylfi Sigurdsson.\nSwansea's past six home league games have produced just seven goals, with no side scoring more than once in any of those fixtures.\nThe Swans have won three consecutive Premier League home games for the first time since March 2013.\nChelsea have failed to win away from home when Asmir Begovic has played in the Premier League this season (D2 L5).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Manchester City on April 16 as they bid to hang on to their top-half status, while Swansea visit relegation-threatened Newcastle on the same day.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester City 2-1 West Bromwich Albion\nManchester City maintained their grip on fourth place in the Premier League as Samir Nasri returned from injury to score the winner against West Brom.\nCity had to come from behind after Stephane Sessegnon beat Joe Hart at his near post just six minutes in.\nSessegnon then brought down Aleksandar Kolarov in the area to allow Sergio Aguero to equalise from the spot.\nNasri tapped into an empty net with 25 minutes remaining to put City four points above rivals Manchester United.\nUnited can close that gap if they beat Tottenham on Sunday, but City will also be keeping an eye on leaders Leicester City, who could reinstate a 15-point advantage over Manuel Pellegrini's side with victory over Sunderland.\nRelive Man City's win over West Brom\nCity with one eye on PSG\nThe prospect of reaching a first ever Champions League semi-final by beating Paris St-Germain at Etihad Stadium on Tuesday is more pressing for City, and the visit of the French side hung very much over Pellegrini's team selection and the performance as a whole.\nThe Chilean, who will be replaced by Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola in the summer, realises he can still leave an indelible mark on the club by taking them to European glory, and made five changes from the 2-2 draw in the first leg of their quarter-final with PSG last week.\nTop-scorer Aguero started and took his goal tally for the season to 23, but hobbled off near the end of the contest after taking a set of studs to the calf from Albion's Craig Gardner, although the Argentinian did not look to be seriously hurt.\nThe hosts, with Nasri making a Premier League start for the first time since September after a thigh injury, took a while to get to grips with the reshuffle from midweek and looked flat without the twin creative sparks of Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva.\nWilfried Bony was rarely an influence up front and it was not until the hour mark and the introduction of De Bruyne and Yaya Toure - a welcome sight to City fans after a three-week layoff - that City came alive.\nBelgian De Bruyne was integral to the winning goal, with his clever ball inside from the right flank allowing Jesus Navas to roll across to Aguero, whose blocked effort fell to the unmarked Nasri for a simple finish.\nBaggies almost bounce City\nWest Brom will feel they missed an opportunity to take a point from the two-time Premier League champions with a performance that forced City to battle until the end.\nBoss Tony Pulis has come under scrutiny from Albion fans for his direct style of play - despite having comfortably achieved safety - but their goal was well crafted, with James McClean whipping in a cross for Sessegnon to finish a swift counter-attack.\nThe Baggies do have goal-scoring concerns, though, and for all their grit, they ended the game with just two shots on target - however, that was two more than they had mustered in their two previous games.\nSaido Berahino had a pair of good chances that he put wide, although one was clearly offside, and Sandro wanted a penalty when he was shoved by Eliaquim Mangala.\nMcClean could have snatched a point with the last kick of the game with a volley that zipped the wrong side of Hart's post.\nMan of the match - Samir Nasri\nWhat they said\nManchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"It was a very important win. You cannot lose these three points at home if you want to fight to be in the Champions League next year.\n\"Now we have a championship with four or five teams to try and play in the Champions League.\n\"When you have players like Kevin de Bruyne and Yaya Toure and they play with Samir Nasri and Sergio Aguero, the way the team played changed immediately. I'm very happy with Samir Nasri.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"I thought we played well today. We've got 40 points and the important thing is the lads turn up in all the games. We did that today and gave them a game and the disappointing thing is we've got nothing out of it.\n\"We've got to hit the target more - it's been a fault of ours this season. And one or two decisions didn't go our way.\n\"I'm not sure it's a penalty for them. I think everyone in the stadium thought we should have had a penalty.\"\nWhat's next?\nIt has already been mentioned once or twice, but City have a Champions League quarter-final second-leg to play against PSG on Tuesday, with the tie poised at 2-2.

We've conceded poor goals, but we have to remain professional until the end.\n\"We didn't create as many chances as we would have liked. Ultimately, if you concede poor goals it will be hard to score.\n\"I'm sure it's not easy to play in that atmosphere, but there have only been two or three victories here this season so I won't be criticising the supporters.\n\"They turned out again today, which I find remarkable. This is certainly not down to the supporters.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, tells BBC Sport: \"This was really important for us. It was very nervy from both teams but I thought we dominated the ball and deserved it in the end.\n\"It was a difficult game to play in because of the toxic atmosphere.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Liverpool 4-1 Stoke City\nSubstitute Divock Origi scored twice as Liverpool made short work of Stoke to leapfrog their opponents and go eighth in the Premier League.\nA long-range shot from Alberto Moreno put the Reds ahead before Bojan escaped his marker to nod in Stoke's equaliser.\nDaniel Sturridge put away Sheyi Ojo's cross to regain the lead and Origi then headed in, before his attempted cross drifted in after the break.\nStoke rarely threatened apart from a late run from Mame Biram Diouf.\nRelive Liverpool's comfortable win\nOrigi or Sturridge? Or both?\nBy making seven changes to his starting line-up, including first Premier League starts for Ojo and Kevin Stewart, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp revealed his priorities for the season's run-in.\nThe lure of European silverware - and the resulting Champions League place - means their Europa League quarter-final second leg against Borussia Dortmund on Thursday now takes precedent over their vanishingly slim chances of gate-crashing the Premier League top four.\nKlopp opted to play Origi as a lone striker in the first-leg draw in Germany and Sturridge looked lively in the first half as he attempted to win back his place for the return against Dortmund.\nAfter Moreno's opener, the England international rattled the advertising hoardings with a powerful low shot and showed excellent instincts to get on the end of Ojo's cross to score.\nBut Origi also took his chance to shine, adding muscular movement to the Liverpool attack after coming on at the break. The Belgian might have had a hat-trick had he managed to keep a header on target from a Moreno cross.\nThe two worked well in tandem as Sturridge completed 90 minutes for the first time since 28 February, but surely it is a case of either or against Dortmund on Thursday.\nStoke's wait goes on\nStoke have now won just three times in 61 league meetings at Liverpool.\nBefore the match, Potters' manager Mark Hughes had noted, rather hopefully, that that win - like this match - was on Grand National weekend,\nBut his side were relegated to rank outsiders as soon as Liverpool moved two goals clear early in the second half.\nHughes instead will have to take the long-term view. His side are in the same ninth place that they managed in in his previous two seasons at the club, seven points off last season's total of 54 with five games remaining.\nRecord signing Giannelli Imbula showed he can provide a platform for Stoke's attack to shine, but his good work went to waste as the likes of Ibrahim Afellay and Xherdan Shaqiri faded from the game.\nUnderstudies to principals\nKlopp's fourth home league win since taking charge in October took the Reds to within nine points of fourth-placed Manchester City, but perhaps more valuable were the lessons he will have learned about some of his fringe players.\nJoe Allen, who is likely to step up from understudy to first-team regular after Jordan Henderson's injury, used the ball intelligently while Ojo showed electric pace to beat Shaqiri and set up Sturridge's goal.\nKlopp also got several reminders of his side's weak points though as Ryan Shawcross and Philipp Wollscheid won headers in dangerous areas just as 5ft 7in Bojan did to score his goal.\nMan of the match - Joe Allen\nWhat they said:\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"Today, I'm really proud. We made changes and it was a completely new formation. I'm sure the players have never played together before in this line-up.\n\"Stoke played 70 to 80% long balls to Peter Crouch, and you have to be tuned into that. It was a smart performance.\n\"Divock is still a young lad. We have to be patient. He can play together with Daniel.\n\"There's absolutely no doubt about that. We hope it stays like this that we have two strikers available like this because we have a big number of games to go.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"Once goals go in, it becomes difficult. It could have become embarrassing for us. It was damage limitation in the end.\n\"I was reasonably happy with the first-half performance, even though we were behind. But we kept on letting ourselves down by not switching on when the ball went dead.\n\"It was a difficult day, where we didn't acquit ourselves well enough.\n\"Today's result has hurt us obviously. We allowed Liverpool to go above us and teams around us are picking up points. But when we have a setback, we almost always bounce back, and we need to do that.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool have won five of their last six league meetings against Stoke, with the other game being a 6-1 loss on the final day of last season.\nLiverpool netted four goals in a game at home for the first time under Jurgen Klopp.\nDaniel Sturridge has been directly involved in seven goals in seven Premier League appearances against Stoke with four goals and three assists.\nAlberto Moreno scored his first Premier League goal since December 2014, ending a run of 42 games without a goal.\nJames Milner has provided more assists than any other Liverpool player in all competitions this season with 10.\nBojan scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the second time this term. The Spaniard had gone 11 games in all competitions without a goal before this run.\nDivock Origi, who netted his first Premier League brace, has scored in back-to-back games for Liverpool for the first time.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool meet Borussia Dortmund at home in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday before travelling to Bournemouth on Sunday in the Premier League. Stoke have an eight-day break before playing Tottenham at home next Monday."

We allowed Jamie Vardy to play to his strengths. One ball over the top... not coping with that was the reason why we lost today.\n\"Our most costly games were not today. A 0-0 draw would have been good for us. The costly ones were the last three, we should have won all three.

Or both?\nBy making seven changes to his starting line-up, including first Premier League starts for Ojo and Kevin Stewart, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp revealed his priorities for the season's run-in.\nThe lure of European silverware - and the resulting Champions League place - means their Europa League quarter-final second leg against Borussia Dortmund on Thursday now takes precedent over their vanishingly slim chances of gate-crashing the Premier League top four.\nKlopp opted to play Origi as a lone striker in the first-leg draw in Germany and Sturridge looked lively in the first half as he attempted to win back his place for the return against Dortmund.\nAfter Moreno's opener, the England international rattled the advertising hoardings with a powerful low shot and showed excellent instincts to get on the end of Ojo's cross to score.\nBut Origi also took his chance to shine, adding muscular movement to the Liverpool attack after coming on at the break. The Belgian might have had a hat-trick had he managed to keep a header on target from a Moreno cross.\nThe two worked well in tandem as Sturridge completed 90 minutes for the first time since 28 February, but surely it is a case of either or against Dortmund on Thursday.\nStoke's wait goes on\nStoke have now won just three times in 61 league meetings at Liverpool.\nBefore the match, Potters' manager Mark Hughes had noted, rather hopefully, that that win - like this match - was on Grand National weekend,\nBut his side were relegated to rank outsiders as soon as Liverpool moved two goals clear early in the second half.\nHughes instead will have to take the long-term view. His side are in the same ninth place that they managed in in his previous two seasons at the club, seven points off last season's total of 54 with five games remaining.\nRecord signing Giannelli Imbula showed he can provide a platform for Stoke's attack to shine, but his good work went to waste as the likes of Ibrahim Afellay and Xherdan Shaqiri faded from the game.\nUnderstudies to principals\nKlopp's fourth home league win since taking charge in October took the Reds to within nine points of fourth-placed Manchester City, but perhaps more valuable were the lessons he will have learned about some of his fringe players.\nJoe Allen, who is likely to step up from understudy to first-team regular after Jordan Henderson's injury, used the ball intelligently while Ojo showed electric pace to beat Shaqiri and set up Sturridge's goal.\nKlopp also got several reminders of his side's weak points though as Ryan Shawcross and Philipp Wollscheid won headers in dangerous areas just as 5ft 7in Bojan did to score his goal.\nMan of the match - Joe Allen\nWhat they said:\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"Today, I'm really proud. We made changes and it was a completely new formation. I'm sure the players have never played together before in this line-up.\n\"Stoke played 70 to 80% long balls to Peter Crouch, and you have to be tuned into that. It was a smart performance.\n\"Divock is still a young lad. We have to be patient. He can play together with Daniel.\n\"There's absolutely no doubt about that. We hope it stays like this that we have two strikers available like this because we have a big number of games to go.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"Once goals go in, it becomes difficult. It could have become embarrassing for us. It was damage limitation in the end.\n\"I was reasonably happy with the first-half performance, even though we were behind. But we kept on letting ourselves down by not switching on when the ball went dead.\n\"It was a difficult day, where we didn't acquit ourselves well enough.\n\"Today's result has hurt us obviously. We allowed Liverpool to go above us and teams around us are picking up points. But when we have a setback, we almost always bounce back, and we need to do that.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool have won five of their last six league meetings against Stoke, with the other game being a 6-1 loss on the final day of last season.\nLiverpool netted four goals in a game at home for the first time under Jurgen Klopp.\nDaniel Sturridge has been directly involved in seven goals in seven Premier League appearances against Stoke with four goals and three assists.\nAlberto Moreno scored his first Premier League goal since December 2014, ending a run of 42 games without a goal.\nJames Milner has provided more assists than any other Liverpool player in all competitions this season with 10.\nBojan scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the second time this term. The Spaniard had gone 11 games in all competitions without a goal before this run.\nDivock Origi, who netted his first Premier League brace, has scored in back-to-back games for Liverpool for the first time.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool meet Borussia Dortmund at home in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday before travelling to Bournemouth on Sunday in the Premier League.

They showed passion and commitment. Thank you to the fans. If we stick together then it's easier for us to approach the game and gives us the chance to win.\n\"The players that started were really good. And the other players who came on helped the team. Today we saw what we expect from this team. We have to show the same in the other games.\"\nSwansea head coach Francesco Guidolin: \"I think Newcastle deserved to win. In the second half we had situations and possibilities to score. It's a bad day for us. We have to look ahead to the next match away to Leicester.\n\"I know my job and I know football. We know that Newcastle play with fight, but we were ready for this game. These things can happen. After many important results this was not a good day.\"\nStats you need to know\nAndros Townsend has already assisted as many Premier League goals for Newcastle (two) in eight appearances as he did for Tottenham in 50 appearances.\nSwansea lost an away Premier League game by three goals for the first time since December 2014, when they were beaten 4-1 at Liverpool.\nNewcastle kept only their second clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games.\nThe Swans failed to score in an away Premier League game for the first time in 2016.\nRafael Benitez became the second Premier League manager to win on his birthday on two occasions, along with Arsene Wenger.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Chelsea 0-3 Manchester City\nA Sergio Aguero hat-trick moved Manchester City closer to securing Champions League football next season with victory at 10-man Chelsea.\nCity profited from slick break-aways, the first goal arriving when Kevin De Bruyne fed Aguero, who fired in.\nAgain De Bruyne led a clinical counter after the break, finding Samir Nasri, who put Aguero clear to finish smartly.\nThibaut Courtois was sent off for fouling Fernandinho, allowing Aguero to whip home his third from the spot.\nLook back on City's win at Stamford Bridge.\nChelsea threatened occasionally before the goals but faded and City move third, a point ahead of Arsenal - who have a game in hand - and four clear of Manchester United.\nWhen this fixture was scheduled last year, it seemed unthinkable that only one of these sides - the last two winners of the Premier League - would be battling for a top-four spot.\nThey have both underachieved, but City at least have targets as the season draws to a close and they were clearly sharper in west London, none more so than Aguero.\nThe Argentinian has now scored at least 20 goals in three Premier League seasons, a feat only achieved by Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry, Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Les Ferdinand.\nCity's red-hot duo\nThere can be little doubt City's season has gained a new lease of life in recent weeks and it is notable it has coincided with the return of De Bruyne from a lengthy injury lay-off.\nBoth he and Samir Nasri drew saves from Courtois in the opening period and it was De Bruyne who always looked likely to turn defence into attack for the away side.\nWhen the Belgian suffered knee-ligament damage in January, City were second in the table, three points behind leaders Leicester. They managed just two wins in seven league games without him and one wonders how close they would be to lifting the title now had he stayed fit.\nHe has now had a hand in 28 goals this season - scoring 15 and creating 13 - and encouragingly for manager Manuel Pellegrini with a Champions League semi-final to come, his relationship with the clinical Aguero looks sharper than ever.\nAguero, who now has 13 goals in 12 league games, will deservedly make headlines. But in De Bruyne, he once again has a support act boasting pace and guile in abundance. Could it be that the enforced rest through injury has left him fresh to do damage at the business end of the season?\nTop four for City?\nPerhaps only a loss of focus in fixtures either side of their two-legged Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid could prove destructive.\nBut Pellegrini said afterwards that \"it is another team\" with everyone fit and with the likes of Fabian Delph, Wilfried Bony and Bacary Sagna on the bench, they look to have options for when fixtures mount.\nA trip to Southampton comes between the Madrid fixtures, with the visit of Arsenal arriving four days after the second leg.\nCaptain Vincent Kompany should be fit for fixtures next week and even without him City were solid. Going forward they were blistering when they needed to be and having conceded just two goals in six league games, their base looks solid. Another tilt at Europe looks likely.\nChelsea wait for Conte\nChelsea are seemingly in limbo while they await the arrival of their next manager - Antonio Conte.\nSince announcing his appointment on 8 April they have lost both league fixtures, ending a 15-game unbeaten run and also interim manager Guus Hiddink's proud record of not losing two league games in a row since he was in charge at PSV Eindhoven in 2004.\nThis wasn't a performance where the Blues had clearly downed tools - they had an early Pedro effort cleared off the line and Ruben Loftus-Cheek went close twice - it just lacked killer instinct and a desire to finish any good work.\nThere are questions to be answered at Stamford Bridge. A 10th-straight home game without a clean sheet equals a run set in 1970. But unwanted records aside, just how did a side that eased to the Premier League title last May end up with nothing to play for by this stage of the season?\nWill such a collapse lead to a Conte clear out this summer? On this showing, there was an evident gulf in class with a side not even competing for the title.\nCourtois' dismissal summed up a miserable day with fans already on their way to the exits but he could have few complaints having been rounded by Fernandinho.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero\nWhat the managers said\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"Chelsea are a difficult situation this season. We managed to get out of the relegation zone but Chelsea need to be in the first four places. We were knocking on the door but we didn't create open chances.

When all the players are fit and playing together, it is another team. I wanted revenge for the FA Cup defeat when we played here with a young team and they beat us. Tonight was a complete game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAguero is the third opposing player to score a hat-trick at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League - the other two were scored by Nwankwo Kanu and Robin van Persie.\nThis was Chelsea's heaviest home defeat in the Premier League since losing 3-0 to Sunderland in November 2010.\nThibaut Courtois is the sixth goalkeeper in Premier League history to receive two red cards in the same season.\nUp next?\nChelsea, now playing for just a top-10 finish, go to Bournemouth in a week while Manchester City go to relegation-threatened Newcastle on Tuesday."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Leicester City 2-2 West Ham United\nLeonardo Ulloa's injury-time penalty rescued a point for Leicester in a controversial encounter with West Ham as the Foxes went eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nJamie Vardy's crisp finish from a lightning break gave Leicester the lead on 18 minutes - but he was then sent off after getting a second yellow card for diving when he tangled with Angelo Ogbonna early in the second half.\nReferee Jonathan Moss made himself even more unpopular when he awarded West Ham a penalty with six minutes left. There had been pushing and pulling in both penalty areas but he decided to punish Wes Morgan for pulling back Winston Reid at a corner.\nAnalysis: MOTD2 pundits on referee's 'mind-boggling inconsistencies'\nSubstitute Andy Carroll slotted home to end Leicester's run of 574 minutes without conceding a league goal and Aaron Cresswell looked to have opened the door to the Foxes' title rivals Spurs with a stunning left-footed finish two minutes later.\nAs the game went into injury time, Moss produced another controversial decision when he pointed to the spot once more after Carroll made the merest contact with Jeff Schlupp.\nWest Ham clearly felt Moss had evened things up after earlier decisions in their favour, but Ulloa was not concerned as he took the chance to secure what might yet be a vital point - although Leicester will be without Vardy for next weekend's home game with Swansea.\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nHow precious is Leicester's point?\nLeicester's fans celebrated at the end before turning their anger on referee Moss - although it was his very questionable decision that allowed them to earn that point at the end.\nPsychologically, this point could be vital because a loss might just have produced a few doubts and given Spurs just a little more wiggle room going into their game at Stoke on Monday.\nIt means Leicester's last Premier League defeat is still that last-minute loss at Arsenal on Valentine's Day and their spirits will be lifted by the manner in which they earned a point when it seemed certain they would end up empty-handed.\nReferee Moss highlights inconsistencies\nReferee Moss was surrounded by players of both sides and escorted from the field by stewards to jeering from the home fans at the final whistle.\nMoss's eventful second half began after 56 minutes when he penalised Vardy for simulation as he tumbled theatrically under a challenge from Ogbonna. Having already given Vardy a yellow card, he felt obliged to give a second.\nVardy made the most of the contact and ran the risk of punishment. And he has been accused of doing this before this season. Opinion was split but plenty felt Moss was right.\nFor West Ham's penalty, there was undoubtedly pulling and pushing between Morgan and Winston Reid - so again Moss had justification.\nThe difficulty, the inconsistency, is that similar behaviour had been going on in both penalty areas all afternoon without punishment - so why did Moss decide this was the time to penalise it?\nToo often, these decisions seem arbitrary, as was demonstrated when Ogbonna dragged Huth to the floor even more unceremoniously a few minutes later and no foul was given.\nFinally, in injury time and with an atmosphere of chaos engulfing the game, Moss pointed to the spot for the slightest touch from Carroll on Schlupp. It was incredibly harsh and the Hammers clearly felt Moss had punished them to make up for earlier decisions given against Leicester.\nIt is a tough job - as the abuse directed the referee's way at the end proved.\nChance for Spurs?\nNot as much as there might have been had Ulloa not scored at the end, but they can apply pressure and move to within five points of Leicester if they win at Stoke.\nLeicester at least have the point in the bag but Mauricio Pochettino and his players will just feel the door is ajar, even if they know time and games are running out.\nManager reaction\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"It was a very tough match. We were lucky at the beginning when they touched both posts. After that we scored a great goal and we had an opportunity to finish the match at the beginning of the second half.\n\"After then sending off it changed our match.\n\"I never spoke about the decision of the referee. Two yellow cards, that's it.\n\"Our performance 11 v 11 and 10 v 11 was fantastic.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"It was a good game of football. We showed determination, character and quality. We turned the game around. We were dangerous, and after sending off we totally dominated the game.\n\"After our second goal I thought we had done enough to win the game, maybe we could have coped with added time better in terms of keeping the ball but they took the risk.\n\"It was extremely hard for referee, but I mean that was no penalty at all.\"\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante (Leicester City)\nThe facts you need to know\nLeicester have won (11) and scored (9) more penalties than any other Premier League team this season.\nLeicester scored with both of their shots on target.\nWest Ham were awarded their first Premier League penalty on the road since October 2010.\nVardy is only the second Leicester player to score and be sent off in the same league game (David Lowe v Wimbledon in 1994 is the other).\nVardy has scored the opening goal in 11 Premier League games this season - more than any other player.\nVardy has had a hand in more Premier League goals this season than any other player (22 goals, 6 assists).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester - minus the suspended Vardy - are at home to Swansea next Sunday. The Hammers host Watford on Wednesday.",

This means a lot - it is great for me and most importantly great for the club.\n\"There is always more responsibility on the player taking the penalty than on me. He has the possibility to shoot anywhere and I need to be prepared to react quickly.\n\"I always try and wait for the penalty taker's decision. I never think about what he will do, I just waited for him.\"\nWhat they said:\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"It's a cruel game at times. I thought we played really well today - 40 crosses, two penalties - but it was just not our day.\"\n\"Good strikers miss penalties, and Saido is a good player - this will only make him better and stronger. He just has to bounce back. The players have been great with him and he will feel it as much as anyone.\n\"Saido wanted to take [the second penalty], and some top, top players have missed penalties, players who have had the nous to take the next one and that is what Saido did. I hope if we get another penalty in the next few games he is the one to smash it in.\"\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It was strange match - not too much football and both teams did not play really well.\n\"I'm not sure if we have enough points but what is most important is that we have to keep improving. It's creating a very good atmosphere around the team and will be important for the next match.\"\nWhat next?\nWatford have a trip to Wembley on Sunday for the FA Cup semi-final at 16:00 BST. The Hornets' next Premier League game is against relegated Aston Villa on 30 April. With 41 points, Watford look sure to play successive Premier League seasons for the first time.\nWest Brom, who are on 40 points and also look safe, face a trip to Emirates Stadium to play Arsenal in the league on Thursday evening.\nThe stats you need to know:\nSaido Berahino became only the fourth player to miss two penalties in a Premier League match.\nBefore this match, Berahino had scored all five of his penalties in the Premier League for West Brom.\nWatford have now won twice as many Premier League away games this season (six) as they did in their previous two Premier League seasons combined.\nBen Watson (two) is only the third player to have scored more than one goal for Watford in the Premier League this season.\nThis was Watford's first league win over West Brom in 16 attempts (W1 D7 L8) and their first league win over them since February 1995, a game that also ended 1-0 to the Hornets at The Hawthorns."

What I will say is today I thought [the Villa players] were outstanding - energy levels, desire to stick to the plan.\n\"But for some misfortune, I thought we could have got a draw. I know there has been criticism - some of it deserved - but today they showed there was some pride for the shirt.\n\"There are players in there capable of playing in the Championship. People in certain places will make sure that Villa will come back, I'm confident of that. That process has to start now.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"We have three points and make some distance from Southampton and West Ham, so the three points are very important. I'm not too happy with the performance. We have to finish the games a lot earlier and today we didn't do that.\n\"I have said to the boys before the match that Chelsea can beat Manchester City. City have the problem we had in that they have played this week and Chelsea didn't so they are more prepared. They can beat them I hope.\"\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nThe stats you need to know\nAston Villa's relegation is the earliest from the Premier League since Portsmouth were relegated with five games to go in 2009-10.\nVilla have won none of their past 13 Premier League meetings with Manchester United (W0 D3 L10).\nIn total United have lost just once in their past 41 Premier League matches against Villa (W30 D10 L1).\nThe Red Devils have kept 11 clean sheets in their past 16 Premier League home matches.\nAston Villa have won none of their past 16 Premier League away games (D3 L13).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United play at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday, while Aston Villa's next match is on Saturday when they welcome Southampton to Villa Park.",

They missed a number of opportunities, had more than 70% of the possession but once again failed to secure three points in a match they were expected to win.\nRelive the action from Emirates Stadium.\nArsenal home form worrying\nThe Gunners have collected eight points from their past six home games and it is that form which has ruined their title hopes and is threatening to wreck their ambitions of competing in next season's Champions League.\nArsenal still enjoy a four-point cushion over Manchester United in fifth and are level on points with City in third, but two draws in their past two games has increased the pressure on Arsene Wenger and his men in the run-in.\nWenger has not failed to qualify for the Champions League during his 20-year tenure, but his critics will point out that neither has the club finished higher than third in their past 10 campaigns.\nThe tale of this match was a familiar one to Arsenal fans and a nervous energy remained around the stadium even after Sanchez had put the hosts ahead in first-half stoppage time.\nArsenal created chances, notably Ozil and Sanchez free-kicks, a hooked Danny Welbeck effort and another Sanchez header. Midway through the second half nine Arsenal players had made more passes than Palace's top passer, but as has often been the case, the Gunners were unable to put the game to bed.\nNo flair, but Palace won't care\nPalace enjoyed their first victory of the year last weekend, courtesy of Jason Puncheon's winner over Norwich, but they remain winless on the road in eight league matches.\nThere was no hint in the first half that the FA Cup semi-finalists would snatch a point from this match. Rarely did they visit the opposition half and all their energy went into containing the creativity of Ozil and Sanchez.\nBut manager Alan Pardew must be praised for his attacking substitutions after the break, introducing former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor, much to the chagrin of the home support, and Zaha to support the lively Bolasie.\nEven with extra creativity in their ranks, the visitors created little. Until Bakary Sako's header from a corner in the 76th minute they had had no chance on goal in the second half.\nBut with a point giving the Londoners an extra cushion from the relegation scrap between Newcastle, Sunderland and Norwich, Pardew will care little about his team's lack of flair at Emirates Stadium.\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"It is very difficult - we had a lot of possession but did not make enough of it. We lacked a change of pace, sharpness.\n\"They defended well. We put a lot of effort in but came out with a frustrating result. It is hard to accept but the competition goes on and we focus on the next one.\n\"I don't know how it works mathematically but we are too disappointed to think about the league. We have to think about the Champions League and fight to be in the Champions League.\n\"We have another home game on Thursday and have to prepare for that.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"It was an important point for us. It means two of the teams below us have to get 40 points and with our goal difference it will be difficult for them.\n\"It makes it easier for us to look forward to the FA Cup semi-final and look to get to mid table which is where I think we belong.\n\"The cup runs has affected us but I think we have put that to bed - we can't keep leaning on that and we needed to focus on the league. I think the players have taken that message on board and hopefully we can pick up something at Manchester United.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nOnly Crystal Palace (five) have taken fewer points in Premier League London derbies this season than Arsenal (seven).\nArsenal have won just one London derby in league competition this season. Their fewest total since the 1963-64 campaign (one).\nEmmanuel Adebayor has had a hand in four goals in his past four league appearances against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium (two goals, two assists).\nAlexis Sanchez has scored or assisted seven goals in his past six Premier League games (four goals, three assists) after delivering just one in his previous 10.\nDanny Welbeck has provided an assist in two consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career.\nWhat next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Old Trafford on Wednesday to play Manchester United before turning their attention to an FA Cup semi-final on 24 April against Watford. Arsenal will next host West Brom on 21 April before matches with relegation-threatened Sunderland and Norwich."

They missed a number of opportunities, had more than 70% of the possession but once again failed to secure three points in a match they were expected to win.\nRelive the action from Emirates Stadium.\nArsenal home form worrying\nThe Gunners have collected eight points from their past six home games and it is that form which has ruined their title hopes and is threatening to wreck their ambitions of competing in next season's Champions League.\nArsenal still enjoy a four-point cushion over Manchester United in fifth and are level on points with City in third, but two draws in their past two games has increased the pressure on Arsene Wenger and his men in the run-in.\nWenger has not failed to qualify for the Champions League during his 20-year tenure, but his critics will point out that neither has the club finished higher than third in their past 10 campaigns.\nThe tale of this match was a familiar one to Arsenal fans and a nervous energy remained around the stadium even after Sanchez had put the hosts ahead in first-half stoppage time.\nArsenal created chances, notably Ozil and Sanchez free-kicks, a hooked Danny Welbeck effort and another Sanchez header. Midway through the second half nine Arsenal players had made more passes than Palace's top passer, but as has often been the case, the Gunners were unable to put the game to bed.\nNo flair, but Palace won't care\nPalace enjoyed their first victory of the year last weekend, courtesy of Jason Puncheon's winner over Norwich, but they remain winless on the road in eight league matches.\nThere was no hint in the first half that the FA Cup semi-finalists would snatch a point from this match. Rarely did they visit the opposition half and all their energy went into containing the creativity of Ozil and Sanchez.\nBut manager Alan Pardew must be praised for his attacking substitutions after the break, introducing former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor, much to the chagrin of the home support, and Zaha to support the lively Bolasie.\nEven with extra creativity in their ranks, the visitors created little. Until Bakary Sako's header from a corner in the 76th minute they had had no chance on goal in the second half.\nBut with a point giving the Londoners an extra cushion from the relegation scrap between Newcastle, Sunderland and Norwich, Pardew will care little about his team's lack of flair at Emirates Stadium.\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"It is very difficult - we had a lot of possession but did not make enough of it. We lacked a change of pace, sharpness.\n\"They defended well. We put a lot of effort in but came out with a frustrating result. It is hard to accept but the competition goes on and we focus on the next one.\n\"I don't know how it works mathematically but we are too disappointed to think about the league. We have to think about the Champions League and fight to be in the Champions League.\n\"We have another home game on Thursday and have to prepare for that.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"It was an important point for us. It means two of the teams below us have to get 40 points and with our goal difference it will be difficult for them.\n\"It makes it easier for us to look forward to the FA Cup semi-final and look to get to mid table which is where I think we belong.\n\"The cup runs has affected us but I think we have put that to bed - we can't keep leaning on that and we needed to focus on the league. I think the players have taken that message on board and hopefully we can pick up something at Manchester United.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nOnly Crystal Palace (five) have taken fewer points in Premier League London derbies this season than Arsenal (seven).\nArsenal have won just one London derby in league competition this season. Their fewest total since the 1963-64 campaign (one).\nEmmanuel Adebayor has had a hand in four goals in his past four league appearances against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium (two goals, two assists).\nAlexis Sanchez has scored or assisted seven goals in his past six Premier League games (four goals, three assists) after delivering just one in his previous 10.\nDanny Welbeck has provided an assist in two consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career.\nWhat next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Old Trafford on Wednesday to play Manchester United before turning their attention to an FA Cup semi-final on 24 April against Watford. Arsenal will next host West Brom on 21 April before matches with relegation-threatened Sunderland and Norwich.",

This means a lot - it is great for me and most importantly great for the club.\n\"There is always more responsibility on the player taking the penalty than on me. He has the possibility to shoot anywhere and I need to be prepared to react quickly.\n\"I always try and wait for the penalty taker's decision. I never think about what he will do, I just waited for him.\"\nWhat they said:\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"It's a cruel game at times. I thought we played really well today - 40 crosses, two penalties - but it was just not our day.\"\n\"Good strikers miss penalties, and Saido is a good player - this will only make him better and stronger. He just has to bounce back. The players have been great with him and he will feel it as much as anyone.\n\"Saido wanted to take [the second penalty], and some top, top players have missed penalties, players who have had the nous to take the next one and that is what Saido did. I hope if we get another penalty in the next few games he is the one to smash it in.\"\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It was strange match - not too much football and both teams did not play really well.\n\"I'm not sure if we have enough points but what is most important is that we have to keep improving. It's creating a very good atmosphere around the team and will be important for the next match.\"\nWhat next?\nWatford have a trip to Wembley on Sunday for the FA Cup semi-final at 16:00 BST. The Hornets' next Premier League game is against relegated Aston Villa on 30 April. With 41 points, Watford look sure to play successive Premier League seasons for the first time.\nWest Brom, who are on 40 points and also look safe, face a trip to Emirates Stadium to play Arsenal in the league on Thursday evening.\nThe stats you need to know:\nSaido Berahino became only the fourth player to miss two penalties in a Premier League match.\nBefore this match, Berahino had scored all five of his penalties in the Premier League for West Brom.\nWatford have now won twice as many Premier League away games this season (six) as they did in their previous two Premier League seasons combined.\nBen Watson (two) is only the third player to have scored more than one goal for Watford in the Premier League this season.\nThis was Watford's first league win over West Brom in 16 attempts (W1 D7 L8) and their first league win over them since February 1995, a game that also ended 1-0 to the Hornets at The Hawthorns."

Tottenham, meanwhile, face West Brom (home), Chelsea (away), Southampton (home) and Newcastle (away).\nTottenham have the best attack (64 goals) and the best defence (25 conceded) in the Premier League this season and there is a feeling their title charge is gathering momentum at the right time.\nHere are the title permutations:\nLeicester need a maximum of eight points from their remaining four games to win the title.\nThe earliest Leicester could conceivably win the title is at Old Trafford when they face Manchester United on 1 May - but only if results go their way next weekend.\nKane and Alli on the prowl... again\nAfter Leicester dropped points against West Ham on Sunday, Kane used Instagram to post a picture\n, external\nof prowling lions waiting to pounce.\nIt ought to have sent an ominous warning to Stoke's defenders, who simply could not handle the England striker and Alli.\nKane set Spurs on their way from the edge of the area after Mousa Dembele breezed past several challenges, before Alli's chip doubled the lead following Eriksen's delicious pass.\nKane made it 24 top-flight goals this season by connecting with Erik Lamela's cross before Alli put the gloss on a rampaging performance with a sweetly struck volley from Eriksen's cross.\nBut it was not all plain sailing for the 20-year-old England midfielder.\nAt 2-0 he produced an astonishing miss after rounding Shay Given, who was making his Premier League debut for Stoke two days short of his 40th birthday.\nFrom almost point-blank range he rolled the ball against the post instead of into the net - and Pochettino fell to the ground in disbelief before twice punching the surface with his fist.\nYet the evening was to end in smiles for the Argentine after a stellar performance by his team, with the manager later admitting he was a \"little embarrassed\" by his reaction to Alli's miss.\nLearning from the weekend's controversies?\nOne surprising aspect from this game was the lack of contact as players lined up for corners.\nOn Sunday, Leicester's 2-2 draw with West Ham featured a contentious decision by referee Jon Moss, who penalised Foxes centre-back Wes Morgan for grappling with Winston Reid.\nThat prompted widespread debate about players tussling at set-pieces, and it was noticeable this game was an hour old before there was any kind of contact between opposing players inside the box.\nIt came when Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross appeared to drag down Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld - but, unlike in Sunday's game, no penalty was given.\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen (Tottenham)\nWhat they said\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes, whose side stay ninth:\n\"Don't underestimate the quality of Spurs but we were poor.

They managed just two wins in seven league games without him and one wonders how close they would be to lifting the title now had he stayed fit.\nHe has now had a hand in 28 goals this season - scoring 15 and creating 13 - and encouragingly for manager Manuel Pellegrini with a Champions League semi-final to come, his relationship with the clinical Aguero looks sharper than ever.\nAguero, who now has 13 goals in 12 league games, will deservedly make headlines. But in De Bruyne, he once again has a support act boasting pace and guile in abundance. Could it be that the enforced rest through injury has left him fresh to do damage at the business end of the season?\nTop four for City?\nPerhaps only a loss of focus in fixtures either side of their two-legged Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid could prove destructive.\nBut Pellegrini said afterwards that \"it is another team\" with everyone fit and with the likes of Fabian Delph, Wilfried Bony and Bacary Sagna on the bench, they look to have options for when fixtures mount.\nA trip to Southampton comes between the Madrid fixtures, with the visit of Arsenal arriving four days after the second leg.\nCaptain Vincent Kompany should be fit for fixtures next week and even without him City were solid. Going forward they were blistering when they needed to be and having conceded just two goals in six league games, their base looks solid. Another tilt at Europe looks likely.\nChelsea wait for Conte\nChelsea are seemingly in limbo while they await the arrival of their next manager - Antonio Conte.\nSince announcing his appointment on 8 April they have lost both league fixtures, ending a 15-game unbeaten run and also interim manager Guus Hiddink's proud record of not losing two league games in a row since he was in charge at PSV Eindhoven in 2004.\nThis wasn't a performance where the Blues had clearly downed tools - they had an early Pedro effort cleared off the line and Ruben Loftus-Cheek went close twice - it just lacked killer instinct and a desire to finish any good work.\nThere are questions to be answered at Stamford Bridge. A 10th-straight home game without a clean sheet equals a run set in 1970. But unwanted records aside, just how did a side that eased to the Premier League title last May end up with nothing to play for by this stage of the season?\nWill such a collapse lead to a Conte clear out this summer? On this showing, there was an evident gulf in class with a side not even competing for the title.\nCourtois' dismissal summed up a miserable day with fans already on their way to the exits but he could have few complaints having been rounded by Fernandinho.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero\nWhat the managers said\nChelsea manager Guus Hiddink: \"Chelsea are a difficult situation this season. We managed to get out of the relegation zone but Chelsea need to be in the first four places. We were knocking on the door but we didn't create open chances. They outplayed us on 60-70 yard counters.\nMan City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"I am satisfied with the team, they played well in attacking and defending. When all the players are fit and playing together, it is another team. I wanted revenge for the FA Cup defeat when we played here with a young team and they beat us. Tonight was a complete game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nAguero is the third opposing player to score a hat-trick at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League - the other two were scored by Nwankwo Kanu and Robin van Persie.\nThis was Chelsea's heaviest home defeat in the Premier League since losing 3-0 to Sunderland in November 2010.\nThibaut Courtois is the sixth goalkeeper in Premier League history to receive two red cards in the same season.\nUp next?\nChelsea, now playing for just a top-10 finish, go to Bournemouth in a week while Manchester City go to relegation-threatened Newcastle on Tuesday."

They are seventh on 54 points, six points behind Arsenal in fourth while Everton are 11th on 41 points.\nEx-Everton players label team 'a shambles'\nRelive Liverpool's win over Everton\nWednesday's Premier League reaction\nA tale of two teams\nEverton have not won at Anfield since 1999 and, in truth, they never looked like getting anything from their latest visit.\nThe Reds looked more organised from the outset, attacked with pace and in numbers, and only a couple of good saves from Joel Robles prevented the hosts from taking the lead much earlier than the 43rd minute.\nThe sending-off of Funes Moris, after he stood on Origi's ankle, arguably ended any hopes of an Everton fightback but there had been little to suggest that was ever on the cards.\nLiverpool finished with 37 shots on goal, 13 of those on target, while all three of Everton's efforts were wide.\nThis was the 226th Merseyside derby and one of the most one-sided but it did come at a cost for Liverpool as Klopp confirmed Origi had twisted his ankle.\nPressure mounting on Martinez?\nThe first Merseyside derby this season proved to be the final game in charge for Klopp's predecessor Brendan Rodgers.\nPressure had been mounting on the 43-year-old after a disappointing start to the season in which the Reds had won just three of their opening 10 games and, after a 1-1 draw at Goodison on 4 October, he was sacked.\nThe situation Rodgers found himself in before his departure mirrored Roberto Martinez's going into this game. The Everton boss was under pressure to get a positive result on Wednesday, having overseen just three wins in the 10 games prior to the trip to Anfield.\nThat pressure now shifts to Everton's next game, with Martinez needing to pick up his players for an FA Cup semi-final with Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday.\nKlopp's magic touch\nSince Klopp arrived at Liverpool shortly after Rodgers' departure, the transformation of some of the club's once-out-of-favour players has been impressive.\nOrigi was sent out on loan to Lille last year and failed to shine as he was named in L'Equipe's worst Ligue 1 team of the season, while Sakho found himself a peripheral figure at Liverpool in the latter stages of Rodgers' reign.\nBoth, though, have become important parts of a Liverpool side that have now won four straight games games in all competitions - including last week's impressive victory over Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League.\nJust as on that night, both Origi and Sakho scored against Everton while Lucas Levia, who almost left the club at the start of this season, provided the assist for Sturridge's goal.\nOn top of that, Klopp was able to make nine changes from the side that beat Bournemouth 2-1 at the weekend. The former Dortmund boss has found a way to get the best out of the players in his squad.\nWhat they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It was really difficult for Everton: red card, injuries, good opponent.\n\"The second half changed completely with the red card and then the next change when John Stones had to come off that was really not easy for Everton.\n\"There was no real fight any more. That is not usual. There have been a lot more intensive derbies for sure and there will be a lot more intensive derbies.\"\nMan of the match - James Milner\nThe stats you need to know\nThere have now been 21 red cards in the Merseyside derby in Premier League history, more than any other fixture (14 Everton, 7 Liverpool).\nDaniel Sturridge has scored more goals in the Premier League against Everton than against any other team (6).\nDivock Origi has scored five times in his past five games for Liverpool (all competitions).\nJames Milner has recorded 11 assists in 2016 in all competitions, three more than any other Premier League player.\nLiverpool have won back-to-back games at Anfield in the Premier League for the first time since May 2015.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in the past 11 Premier League Merseyside derbies (W4 D7 L0).\nEverton's two heaviest Premier League Merseyside derby defeats have both been under Roberto Martinez and both at Anfield (4-0 in January 2014)\nWhat next?\nLiverpool host relegation-threatened Newcastle on Saturday while Everton play Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals.",

Overall, it was a positive day.\"\nWinger Raheem Sterling came on as a substitute to make his comeback after five games but could not inspire his side to a winner as they remain third.\nMan of the match - Jamaal Lascelles\n'We have to keep believing'\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"The fans appreciate the effort of the players. Everybody is trying to do everything to stay up.\n\"Hopefully we have momentum, but we cannot have influence on other teams' games. We have to keep believing and hopefully win the next game.\n\"I said when I came that it is an intimidating place for other teams. That is what we are looking for and that is what we have.\"\nManchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"I am happy. We started winning the game but we could not have the control after that. We knew that it was very tough.\n\"The officials have nothing to do with the result. I didn't see the team with the energy from Saturday, but we play after three days at the end of the season and it is not easy for the team to recover.\"\nPundit analysis\nFormer Newcastle striker Alan Shearer: \"The one thing that stood out for me was the atmosphere.

What I will say is today I thought [the Villa players] were outstanding - energy levels, desire to stick to the plan.\n\"But for some misfortune, I thought we could have got a draw. I know there has been criticism - some of it deserved - but today they showed there was some pride for the shirt.\n\"There are players in there capable of playing in the Championship. People in certain places will make sure that Villa will come back, I'm confident of that. That process has to start now.\"\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"We have three points and make some distance from Southampton and West Ham, so the three points are very important. I'm not too happy with the performance. We have to finish the games a lot earlier and today we didn't do that.\n\"I have said to the boys before the match that Chelsea can beat Manchester City. City have the problem we had in that they have played this week and Chelsea didn't so they are more prepared. They can beat them I hope.\"\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nThe stats you need to know\nAston Villa's relegation is the earliest from the Premier League since Portsmouth were relegated with five games to go in 2009-10.\nVilla have won none of their past 13 Premier League meetings with Manchester United (W0 D3 L10).\nIn total United have lost just once in their past 41 Premier League matches against Villa (W30 D10 L1).\nThe Red Devils have kept 11 clean sheets in their past 16 Premier League home matches.\nAston Villa have won none of their past 16 Premier League away games (D3 L13).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United play at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday, while Aston Villa's next match is on Saturday when they welcome Southampton to Villa Park.",

We need to turn that around starting with understanding that the responsibility of being at Everton is to win games on a consistent basis. We haven't been producing the results and I accept the unrest.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"I'm really disappointed because it was a big opportunity to win the game, right from the start. We had a lot of space to play but in the final part it wasn't good enough.\n\"At least we had a good reaction to going behind. We got one point but at this final part of the season it is not enough. We want to fight for Europe and it is not a step forward.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSouthampton have gone eight league games without a clean sheet, after a run of six consecutively.\nSadio Mane scored for only the second time in his past 23 Premier League appearances for Southampton.\nThe Toffees have won just one of their past 10 Premier League games at Goodison Park (W1 D3 L6).\nEverton have won just 17 points at home this season in the Premier League - their previous worst tally in a single season was 25 in 1996-97, which they can no longer reach this season.\nCallum Connolly (18 years, six months and 24 days) is the youngest player to make their Premier League debut for Everton since Ross Barkley (17 years, eight months and 15 days) in August 2011.\nWhat next?\nEverton will make the short trip across Stanley Park to play Liverpool on Wednesday, while Southampton's next game is a trip to relegated Aston Villa on 23 April."

Fortunately for the Black Cats, he has managed 16 in 30 games this season and they had success as they repeatedly tested the Norwich defence against the 32-year-old striker's pace with long balls forward.\nIt may have been one-dimensional, but that direct style paid off as Borini chased up on a swift counter-attack and was clumsily fouled by Wisdom in the box as he controlled Defoe's return ball.\nAfter the break, another fast transition after a dawdling Sebastien Bassong was robbed by Jan Kirchoff saw the roles reversed with Borini threading a perfect delivery to the far post for Defoe to slide in and convert.\nSunderland's goal difference is now seven superior to Norwich's and they might have increased that advantage further with Watmore wasting a fine opening before belatedly adding a third.\nNorwich's missing mojo\nNorwich had 19 shots to the visitors' eight and 14 corners with Sunderland unable to force a single one.\nBut for all their industry, endeavour and possession, they lacked the cutting edge and ruthlessness that the Black Cats showed.\nInstead they were largely restricted to long-range efforts, with Martin Olsson, Bassong and Wisdom bringing saves out of Vito Mannone.\nRedmond then struck the base of a post with a skimming effort, while referee Andre Marriner turned down a trio of weak penalty claims to the home crowd's disgust.\nSoured milk\nThe two clubs have competed for the Friendship Trophy in their league meetings\n, external\nsince they played each other in the 1985 Milk Cup final, but with the far greater prize of Premier League survival on the line there was little cordial about this encounter.\nNorwich's Robbie Brady nudged DeAndre Yedlin into the advertising hoarding in front of the Sunderland bench, sparking a shoving match in which Black Cats' boss Sam Allardyce and Norwich substitute Cameron Jerome jostled each other.\nRelations were not improved by Borini's goal celebration which finished with him sliding on his knees in front of the home supporters, some of whom returned fire with the paper clappers that had been distributed before kick-off.\nThe closing stages of the match played out to the travelling fans' taunts that Norwich are heading to the Championship with their north-east rivals Newcastle.\nIf that prediction proves true, this result will feature heavily in Norwich's post-mortem of the season.\nMan of the match - Jan Kirchoff\nWhat they said\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"The two teams are still chasing us, we're still a point ahead. We need to win games and that's always been the case.\n\"That second goal cost us the game. The second half, for that first 25 minutes we looked threatening, hit the post, and I thought we were going to score but that second goal took the stuffing out us.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"The position we've left ourselves in was making me feel a bit edgy this morning. Will we handle the pressure? Will we cope with the pressure?\n\"They've answered my questions. They've coped with the pressure and coped with everything Norwich could throw at them. To come here and win 3-0 shows you what a massive result it is.\"\nStats you need to know\nNorwich have conceded nine penalties in the Premier League this season, the highest tally in the division.\nSunderland have scored each of their past 17 penalties in the Premier League, last missing one in December 2011.\nOnly Sunderland in 2007-08 and Bradford in 1999-2000 (nine) have conceded more penalty goals in a Premier League season than Norwich this season (eight).\nJermain Defoe has now scored 10 goals in 14 Premier League away appearances this season for Sunderland.\nDefoe has scored or assisted in four of his past five Premier League games against Norwich (two goals, two assists).\nSunderland scored with all three shots on target in the match.\nSunderland won at Carrow Road for the first time since March 1985, having gone 10 games without a win there since.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams play Arsenal next.

The forward received a pass from Mesut Ozil and turned Sandro before firing beyond Ben Foster.\nThe Chilean was at his marauding best and he continued to torment West Brom before deservedly scoring a second, driving a free-kick through the West Brom wall.\nArsenal untroubled by blunt Baggies\nUnder Tony Pulis, West Brom have hardly been prolific. They have scored just 50 goals in 51 games and have had the fewest shots on target in the Premier League this season with 93.\nAdd that to the fact they had lost all but one of their nine previous Premier League trips to Arsenal, and a victory for the visitors looked a tall order.\nTheir best chances came from set pieces. McAuley rattled the bar from a corner when the score was 1-0, while Salomon Rondon missed a near open goal from another corner midway through the second half.\nFrom open play they carried no threat but with the Baggies 15th and 10 points clear of trouble, their job is largely done.\nHow did ref Jon Moss do?\nThis game was the first for referee Jon Moss since his controversial performance in the 2-2 draw between leaders Leicester and West Ham on Sunday.\nMoss awarded two penalties in that game, and also gave Foxes striker Jamie Vardy a second yellow card for diving.\nOn Thursday, Moss waved away a West Brom appeal for a penalty when Sanchez appeared to handle inside the area, and also took no action when Arsenal's Mohamed Elneny went down easily inside the area despite there being no contact by a defender.\nHe issued just the one yellow card and that was to McAuley after the Baggies defender held Olivier Giroud just before half-time.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We did the job in a serious way. We played well technically and the only regret is we should have scored more goals.\n\"The early goal helped us not be be anxious about the consequence of the result.\n\"We are in a position where it depends on us to finish in the top three but we want more and we have to fight to do that and if possible do more.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We didn't play as well as we can. We had too many players off it, which you can't do at Arsenal.\n\"The players have given me everything this year. We have played well at all of the big teams but not tonight. Sometimes you have to take defeat on the chin.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal have now won 500 Premier League games, the second team to reach the milestone in the competition (Manchester United have 584 wins).\nThe Baggies have won just one of their past 12 Premier League away games (D5 L6).\nThe Gunners have scored in all 20 of their Premier League games against West Brom - the best 100% record in the division.\nArsenal scored as many goals from outside the box on Thursday as they had in their 33 previous Premier League games this season (two).\nTony Pulis has lost all eight of his Premier League visits to Emirates Stadium.\nWhat next?\nArsenal travel to struggling Sunderland on Sunday, while West Brom are at Tottenham on Monday."

There had been pushing and pulling in both penalty areas but he decided to punish Wes Morgan for pulling back Winston Reid at a corner.\nAnalysis: MOTD2 pundits on referee's 'mind-boggling inconsistencies'\nSubstitute Andy Carroll slotted home to end Leicester's run of 574 minutes without conceding a league goal and Aaron Cresswell looked to have opened the door to the Foxes' title rivals Spurs with a stunning left-footed finish two minutes later.\nAs the game went into injury time, Moss produced another controversial decision when he pointed to the spot once more after Carroll made the merest contact with Jeff Schlupp.\nWest Ham clearly felt Moss had evened things up after earlier decisions in their favour, but Ulloa was not concerned as he took the chance to secure what might yet be a vital point - although Leicester will be without Vardy for next weekend's home game with Swansea.\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nHow precious is Leicester's point?\nLeicester's fans celebrated at the end before turning their anger on referee Moss - although it was his very questionable decision that allowed them to earn that point at the end.\nPsychologically, this point could be vital because a loss might just have produced a few doubts and given Spurs just a little more wiggle room going into their game at Stoke on Monday.\nIt means Leicester's last Premier League defeat is still that last-minute loss at Arsenal on Valentine's Day and their spirits will be lifted by the manner in which they earned a point when it seemed certain they would end up empty-handed.\nReferee Moss highlights inconsistencies\nReferee Moss was surrounded by players of both sides and escorted from the field by stewards to jeering from the home fans at the final whistle.\nMoss's eventful second half began after 56 minutes when he penalised Vardy for simulation as he tumbled theatrically under a challenge from Ogbonna. Having already given Vardy a yellow card, he felt obliged to give a second.\nVardy made the most of the contact and ran the risk of punishment. And he has been accused of doing this before this season. Opinion was split but plenty felt Moss was right.\nFor West Ham's penalty, there was undoubtedly pulling and pushing between Morgan and Winston Reid - so again Moss had justification.\nThe difficulty, the inconsistency, is that similar behaviour had been going on in both penalty areas all afternoon without punishment - so why did Moss decide this was the time to penalise it?\nToo often, these decisions seem arbitrary, as was demonstrated when Ogbonna dragged Huth to the floor even more unceremoniously a few minutes later and no foul was given.\nFinally, in injury time and with an atmosphere of chaos engulfing the game, Moss pointed to the spot for the slightest touch from Carroll on Schlupp. It was incredibly harsh and the Hammers clearly felt Moss had punished them to make up for earlier decisions given against Leicester.\nIt is a tough job - as the abuse directed the referee's way at the end proved.\nChance for Spurs?\nNot as much as there might have been had Ulloa not scored at the end, but they can apply pressure and move to within five points of Leicester if they win at Stoke.\nLeicester at least have the point in the bag but Mauricio Pochettino and his players will just feel the door is ajar, even if they know time and games are running out.\nManager reaction\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"It was a very tough match. We were lucky at the beginning when they touched both posts. After that we scored a great goal and we had an opportunity to finish the match at the beginning of the second half.\n\"After then sending off it changed our match.\n\"I never spoke about the decision of the referee. Two yellow cards, that's it.\n\"Our performance 11 v 11 and 10 v 11 was fantastic.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"It was a good game of football. We showed determination, character and quality. We turned the game around. We were dangerous, and after sending off we totally dominated the game.\n\"After our second goal I thought we had done enough to win the game, maybe we could have coped with added time better in terms of keeping the ball but they took the risk.\n\"It was extremely hard for referee, but I mean that was no penalty at all.\"\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante (Leicester City)\nThe facts you need to know\nLeicester have won (11) and scored (9) more penalties than any other Premier League team this season.\nLeicester scored with both of their shots on target.\nWest Ham were awarded their first Premier League penalty on the road since October 2010.\nVardy is only the second Leicester player to score and be sent off in the same league game (David Lowe v Wimbledon in 1994 is the other).\nVardy has scored the opening goal in 11 Premier League games this season - more than any other player.\nVardy has had a hand in more Premier League goals this season than any other player (22 goals, 6 assists).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester - minus the suspended Vardy - are at home to Swansea next Sunday. The Hammers host Watford on Wednesday.",

They showed passion and commitment. Thank you to the fans. If we stick together then it's easier for us to approach the game and gives us the chance to win.\n\"The players that started were really good. And the other players who came on helped the team. Today we saw what we expect from this team. We have to show the same in the other games.\"\nSwansea head coach Francesco Guidolin: \"I think Newcastle deserved to win. In the second half we had situations and possibilities to score. It's a bad day for us. We have to look ahead to the next match away to Leicester.\n\"I know my job and I know football. We know that Newcastle play with fight, but we were ready for this game. These things can happen. After many important results this was not a good day.\"\nStats you need to know\nAndros Townsend has already assisted as many Premier League goals for Newcastle (two) in eight appearances as he did for Tottenham in 50 appearances.\nSwansea lost an away Premier League game by three goals for the first time since December 2014, when they were beaten 4-1 at Liverpool.\nNewcastle kept only their second clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games.\nThe Swans failed to score in an away Premier League game for the first time in 2016.\nRafael Benitez became the second Premier League manager to win on his birthday on two occasions, along with Arsene Wenger."

Tottenham, meanwhile, face West Brom (home), Chelsea (away), Southampton (home) and Newcastle (away).\nTottenham have the best attack (64 goals) and the best defence (25 conceded) in the Premier League this season and there is a feeling their title charge is gathering momentum at the right time.\nHere are the title permutations:\nLeicester need a maximum of eight points from their remaining four games to win the title.\nThe earliest Leicester could conceivably win the title is at Old Trafford when they face Manchester United on 1 May - but only if results go their way next weekend.\nKane and Alli on the prowl... again\nAfter Leicester dropped points against West Ham on Sunday, Kane used Instagram to post a picture\n, external\nof prowling lions waiting to pounce.\nIt ought to have sent an ominous warning to Stoke's defenders, who simply could not handle the England striker and Alli.\nKane set Spurs on their way from the edge of the area after Mousa Dembele breezed past several challenges, before Alli's chip doubled the lead following Eriksen's delicious pass.\nKane made it 24 top-flight goals this season by connecting with Erik Lamela's cross before Alli put the gloss on a rampaging performance with a sweetly struck volley from Eriksen's cross.\nBut it was not all plain sailing for the 20-year-old England midfielder.\nAt 2-0 he produced an astonishing miss after rounding Shay Given, who was making his Premier League debut for Stoke two days short of his 40th birthday.\nFrom almost point-blank range he rolled the ball against the post instead of into the net - and Pochettino fell to the ground in disbelief before twice punching the surface with his fist.\nYet the evening was to end in smiles for the Argentine after a stellar performance by his team, with the manager later admitting he was a \"little embarrassed\" by his reaction to Alli's miss.\nLearning from the weekend's controversies?\nOne surprising aspect from this game was the lack of contact as players lined up for corners.\nOn Sunday, Leicester's 2-2 draw with West Ham featured a contentious decision by referee Jon Moss, who penalised Foxes centre-back Wes Morgan for grappling with Winston Reid.\nThat prompted widespread debate about players tussling at set-pieces, and it was noticeable this game was an hour old before there was any kind of contact between opposing players inside the box.\nIt came when Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross appeared to drag down Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld - but, unlike in Sunday's game, no penalty was given.\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen (Tottenham)\nWhat they said\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes, whose side stay ninth:\n\"Don't underestimate the quality of Spurs but we were poor. We didn't do the things we talked about before the game.\n\"We had a go in the second half but that played into their hands and they picked us off. We didn't deal with them at all.

The forward received a pass from Mesut Ozil and turned Sandro before firing beyond Ben Foster.\nThe Chilean was at his marauding best and he continued to torment West Brom before deservedly scoring a second, driving a free-kick through the West Brom wall.\nArsenal untroubled by blunt Baggies\nUnder Tony Pulis, West Brom have hardly been prolific. They have scored just 50 goals in 51 games and have had the fewest shots on target in the Premier League this season with 93.\nAdd that to the fact they had lost all but one of their nine previous Premier League trips to Arsenal, and a victory for the visitors looked a tall order.\nTheir best chances came from set pieces. McAuley rattled the bar from a corner when the score was 1-0, while Salomon Rondon missed a near open goal from another corner midway through the second half.\nFrom open play they carried no threat but with the Baggies 15th and 10 points clear of trouble, their job is largely done.\nHow did ref Jon Moss do?\nThis game was the first for referee Jon Moss since his controversial performance in the 2-2 draw between leaders Leicester and West Ham on Sunday.\nMoss awarded two penalties in that game, and also gave Foxes striker Jamie Vardy a second yellow card for diving.\nOn Thursday, Moss waved away a West Brom appeal for a penalty when Sanchez appeared to handle inside the area, and also took no action when Arsenal's Mohamed Elneny went down easily inside the area despite there being no contact by a defender.\nHe issued just the one yellow card and that was to McAuley after the Baggies defender held Olivier Giroud just before half-time.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We did the job in a serious way. We played well technically and the only regret is we should have scored more goals.\n\"The early goal helped us not be be anxious about the consequence of the result.\n\"We are in a position where it depends on us to finish in the top three but we want more and we have to fight to do that and if possible do more.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We didn't play as well as we can. We had too many players off it, which you can't do at Arsenal.\n\"The players have given me everything this year. We have played well at all of the big teams but not tonight. Sometimes you have to take defeat on the chin.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal have now won 500 Premier League games, the second team to reach the milestone in the competition (Manchester United have 584 wins).\nThe Baggies have won just one of their past 12 Premier League away games (D5 L6).\nThe Gunners have scored in all 20 of their Premier League games against West Brom - the best 100% record in the division.\nArsenal scored as many goals from outside the box on Thursday as they had in their 33 previous Premier League games this season (two).\nTony Pulis has lost all eight of his Premier League visits to Emirates Stadium.\nWhat next?\nArsenal travel to struggling Sunderland on Sunday, while West Brom are at Tottenham on Monday."

I think they are happy with the point.\n\"The first half we were clearly the better team and in the second half also, apart from the two goals we conceded.\n\"Two shots on target, two goals sounds not too good and it is not too good.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez: \"We knew the first half was not the best and we needed to react so I told them similar to what I said in the past: 'Nothing to lose'.\n\"We had to fight and show more character and I think the players had a fantastic reaction.\n\"I am pleased with the point against a very good team and hopefully they [Liverpool] can do well in the Europa League.\n\"We have to do our job and see what happens with the other games but at least we showed character and the belief is still there, which is crucial for us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle have kept only one clean sheet in their past 35 league trips to Anfield, conceding 83 goals in that period\nDaniel Sturridge has netted seven goals in seven Barclays Premier League starts against Newcastle United\nSturridge's goal (1:07) was Liverpool's second quickest in the Premier League this season after James Milner's strike against Aston Villa in September (1:06)\nLiverpool have scored more goals from outside the penalty area (14) than any other Premier League team this season\nJack Colback netted his first away goal in the Premier League since Feb 2014; his last five Premier League goals had been scored in home matches\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Spanish side Villarreal for the first leg of their Europa League semi-final on Thursday before returning to Premier League action at Swansea next Sunday.\nThe first of Newcastle's remaining three league matches is at St James' Park next Saturday against Crystal Palace.",

We had two or three chances, and if we'd taken them, we might have got something. But if we have to score five goals at home to win a game, then we're going to be in for a tough challenge. We did get a response under difficult circumstances, but it wasn't enough to win the game.\n\"We conceded poor goals that put us on the back foot. There was a response, and credit for that, but on the day it wasn't enough.\n\"The fans are entitled to vent their displeasure. It's not an ideal atmosphere, but it's understandable, given the circumstances. We have to continue to be professional.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"Scoring four goals away from home is good but we conceded two and that is not like Southampton. We gave Villa the belief that they could get a better result. In the end, we were by far the better team. It was a good result finally, and we're on to the next game.\n\"Scoring goals was not a problem today, but in general we have been missing too many opportunities away from home. That is why we are a little way behind the fifth and sixth positions in the table.\n\"It was difficult because it was a strange atmosphere - but even more so for the home team. It's a shame that Aston Villa have been relegated because it is a great club and stadium. I hope they are back before too long.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nShane Long has netted more goals (six) against Aston Villa than against any other Premier League opponent.\nThis is now Long's best goalscoring season in the Premier League, with nine goals.\nSouthampton have scored 14 headed goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nAston Villa have conceded goals in 30 of their last 34 Premier League matches.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Manchester City next Sunday and Aston Villa visit Watford on Saturday."

They are seventh on 54 points, six points behind Arsenal in fourth while Everton are 11th on 41 points.\nEx-Everton players label team 'a shambles'\nRelive Liverpool's win over Everton\nWednesday's Premier League reaction\nA tale of two teams\nEverton have not won at Anfield since 1999 and, in truth, they never looked like getting anything from their latest visit.\nThe Reds looked more organised from the outset, attacked with pace and in numbers, and only a couple of good saves from Joel Robles prevented the hosts from taking the lead much earlier than the 43rd minute.\nThe sending-off of Funes Moris, after he stood on Origi's ankle, arguably ended any hopes of an Everton fightback but there had been little to suggest that was ever on the cards.\nLiverpool finished with 37 shots on goal, 13 of those on target, while all three of Everton's efforts were wide.\nThis was the 226th Merseyside derby and one of the most one-sided but it did come at a cost for Liverpool as Klopp confirmed Origi had twisted his ankle.\nPressure mounting on Martinez?\nThe first Merseyside derby this season proved to be the final game in charge for Klopp's predecessor Brendan Rodgers.\nPressure had been mounting on the 43-year-old after a disappointing start to the season in which the Reds had won just three of their opening 10 games and, after a 1-1 draw at Goodison on 4 October, he was sacked.\nThe situation Rodgers found himself in before his departure mirrored Roberto Martinez's going into this game. The Everton boss was under pressure to get a positive result on Wednesday, having overseen just three wins in the 10 games prior to the trip to Anfield.\nThat pressure now shifts to Everton's next game, with Martinez needing to pick up his players for an FA Cup semi-final with Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday.\nKlopp's magic touch\nSince Klopp arrived at Liverpool shortly after Rodgers' departure, the transformation of some of the club's once-out-of-favour players has been impressive.\nOrigi was sent out on loan to Lille last year and failed to shine as he was named in L'Equipe's worst Ligue 1 team of the season, while Sakho found himself a peripheral figure at Liverpool in the latter stages of Rodgers' reign.\nBoth, though, have become important parts of a Liverpool side that have now won four straight games games in all competitions - including last week's impressive victory over Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League.\nJust as on that night, both Origi and Sakho scored against Everton while Lucas Levia, who almost left the club at the start of this season, provided the assist for Sturridge's goal.\nOn top of that, Klopp was able to make nine changes from the side that beat Bournemouth 2-1 at the weekend. The former Dortmund boss has found a way to get the best out of the players in his squad.\nWhat they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It was really difficult for Everton: red card, injuries, good opponent.\n\"The second half changed completely with the red card and then the next change when John Stones had to come off that was really not easy for Everton.\n\"There was no real fight any more. That is not usual. There have been a lot more intensive derbies for sure and there will be a lot more intensive derbies.\"\nMan of the match - James Milner\nThe stats you need to know\nThere have now been 21 red cards in the Merseyside derby in Premier League history, more than any other fixture (14 Everton, 7 Liverpool).\nDaniel Sturridge has scored more goals in the Premier League against Everton than against any other team (6).\nDivock Origi has scored five times in his past five games for Liverpool (all competitions).\nJames Milner has recorded 11 assists in 2016 in all competitions, three more than any other Premier League player.\nLiverpool have won back-to-back games at Anfield in the Premier League for the first time since May 2015.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in the past 11 Premier League Merseyside derbies (W4 D7 L0).\nEverton's two heaviest Premier League Merseyside derby defeats have both been under Roberto Martinez and both at Anfield (4-0 in January 2014)\nWhat next?\nLiverpool host relegation-threatened Newcastle on Saturday while Everton play Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Bournemouth 1-4 Chelsea\nEden Hazard scored his first league goals of the season as Chelsea overcame Bournemouth in an entertaining game.\nCesc Fabregas provided Chelsea's first three goals, teeing up Pedro and Hazard in the first half before releasing Willian for the third after the break.\nThe Cherries had got back to 2-1 when Tommy Elphick's header crept in before the interval.\nBut Hazard, who netted 19 times last season, finished from Nemanja Matic's pull-back in injury time.\nRelive Chelsea's victory at Bournemouth\nHazard lights up\nThe Belgian, returning from a five-game lay-off with a hip injury, had been held up as one of the main men culpable for Jose Mourinho's departure as Chelsea boss in December, following a horrendous start to their Premier League title defence.\nIn contrast to the 2014-15 campaign, when he was voted player of the year by his fellow professionals, Hazard had looked lacking in motivation and desire at times this term, with his only two goals coming in the FA Cup.\nHazard was one of seven Blues players who had started their shock 1-0 loss to Bournemouth five months ago, but he was direct and effective in the return fixture at Dean Court.\nFabregas, having already slipped in a through-ball for Pedro to finish one-on-one for the opener, teed up Hazard with a clever backheel and the former Lille forward found the bottom corner from 20 yards out.\nAnd after Willian, once again racing on to a Fabregas pass, had restored a two-goal cushion, Hazard poked in his second to finish off a display that would have left incoming manager Antonio Conte excited about the talent at his disposal when he comes to Stamford Bridge in the summer.\nCherries fall away\nBournemouth's contribution to a game between two sides with little to play for should not go unheralded, and it is a testament to their tremendous season that a win would have drawn them level on points with ninth-placed Chelsea.\nIt is no longer a surprise to see Eddie Howe's men competing with the top tier's strongest outfits and they did well, particularly in the first half, to test a Chelsea defence that had makeshift centre-half John Mikel Obi at its heart after Gary Cahill had fallen ill overnight.\nSteve Cook shot over when he should have scored after keeper Asmir Begovic had flapped at a cross.\nAnd they deserved to get back into the game when Elphick's header from a short corner slid in off Begovic's right-hand glove.\nThe Cherries drifted out of the contest as the game drew on, but Callum Wilson stepped off the bench for the third consecutive game as he continues his positive recovery from a seven-month injury lay-off.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas\nWhat they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was an even game, certainly for the first half I thought we were terrific - the difference between the sides was how they finished their goals.\n\"We created a number of chances but didn't have their clinical edge. Second half, they were better and I thought Chelsea's attitude to the game was spot on, that's why it ended up being such a high quality game.\n\"The beauty of our run-in, which is so tough on paper, is that we're learning all the time. We're still finding our feet at this level, they've been harsh lessons for us but hopefully we'll come out of it a better team.\"\nChelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink: \"We're very pleased with the performance, especially in the second half.\n\"It was a very open, entertaining game. Bournemouth have a very good build-up and create good chances.\n\"It was good discipline and good to see some players who have been absent recently, scoring goals.\n\"We worked with Eden Hazard for the last 10 days, his movement was good and we talked about playing him for 45 minutes or perhaps more, but in the end he was enjoying it and he came through the whole game.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth, sat in 13th but with no risk of going down, can go above 11th-placed Everton if they beat them next Saturday.\nChelsea can sabotage Tottenham's title hopes when they host their London rivals on Monday, 2 May. It was a point not lost on the travelling Blues fans at Dean Court, who sung about their desire to go on and beat Spurs.\n\"I didn't hear what the fans were singing because I was so focused on the game,\" said Hiddink. \"But we play the next game to win. And the next game is Tottenham.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nBournemouth have lost three home league games in a row for the first time since March 2013\nChelsea scored with all four of their shots on target in the game\nEden Hazard - who scored more than once in a Premier League game for the first time since February 2014 - ended a run of 29 Premier League games without a goal\nCesc Fabregas assisted three or more goals in a Premier League game for the second time in his career (four assists for Arsenal v Blackburn, Oct 2009)\nTommy Elphick's goal was the 900th goal scored in this Premier League season\nThe Cherries have now conceded in each of their last seven Premier League games\nPedro has scored five goals in his last seven Premier League appearances after netting just two in the 19 beforehand"

In the first half we played very well and it will always happen in football when you allow the other team to believe you can concede.\n\"But I think I am still very proud for my players. We still need to believe. We know it will be difficult but we need to still believe and fight for these three games.\n\"We have a chance but it is true that now it is more difficult.

We lack a bit of quality at times but I can't fault their work-rate and they work within a shape that suits them.\"\nStats of the day\nTottenham attempted just two shots on target in this game - their lowest figure in a Premier League match at White Hart Lane since October 2014\nSpurs did not attempt a shot on target in this match after the 20th minute\nSpurs have scored a league-high 23 goals from set-piece situations this season in the Premier League (incl. five penalties)\nWest Brom had more shots (10) than Spurs (7) in the second half of this match\nDawson became the first West Brom player to score at both ends in the same game in the Premier League",

Real Madrid will offer different level of test to Stoke City but Iheanacho's pace off the bench could be a useful weapon for Pellegrini.\nWhat now for Stoke?\nMark Hughes' side started well, missed several chances at 2-0 down, and eventually caved in. They have now conceded 12 goals in three games.\nTheir task was not helped by the absence of Ibrahim Afellay, the Netherlands midfielder who suffered a serious knee injury on the eve of the game.\nThe Potters, who have won one of the last seven league games, were also forced to replace 40-year-old keeper Shay Given at the start of the second half due to a suspected groin injury.\nJoselu squandered a great opportunity to reduce the deficit at 2-0, while Mame Biram Diouf went close with a header before City took the game out of sight.\nStoke still have to face Sunderland (home), Crystal Palace (away) and West Ham United (home) and manager Hughes faces a battle to rouse his players and ensure the season does not end on a flat note.\nMan of the Match - Kelechi Iheanacho (Man City)\nWhat they said\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"A big team must always be focused on both competitions. Premier League and Champions League. Every big team must do it every year.\n\"Stoke is fighting for nothing but nobody wants to lose games. It was important to score the first goal.\"\nOn Kelechi Iheanacho: \"He is an important young player with a lot of future. He scores lots of goals but he is not just a penalty-box player. I am sure that his role in this team will be very important.\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"Once again we have conceded poor goals, which is a recurring theme.\n\"We were a million miles away from where we need to be in the first half. We are lacking the pace and power you need in key areas of the field.\n\"I'm not one to look at injuries but we have got guys coming back from long-term injuries and playing through injuries. It's difficult. We have issues but we should help ourselves.\"\nStoke midfielder Glenn Whelan: \"We are going through a difficult stage - we are feeling sorry for ourselves. This is not the Stoke City I am used to playing with and we owe more to our fans.\n\"We don't want the season to fizzle out. We have three games to turn it around. Listen, we need to look at ourselves. It hasn't been good enough. We are giving away soft goals.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nGoalkeeper Shay Given became the 14th player to start a Premier League game aged 40 or older (40y 3d old).\nSergio Aguero has scored 22 goals in his last 21 Premier League appearances, including seven in his last five games.\nAguero has netted in five consecutive Premier League games for the fourth time in his career (also November 2013, January 2014 and May 2015).\nStoke are without a clean sheet in nine away Premier League games, conceding 22 goals.\nThe Potters are the third team in Premier League history to concede 4+ goals in three consecutive Premier League games, after West Ham in March 2008 and Wigan in August 2010.\nWhat's next?\nAttention now turns to Tuesday's Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid for Manchester City, whose next Premier League game is at Southampton on 1 May.\nStoke will attempt to arrest their losing run at home to struggling Sunderland next Saturday.",

Fortunately for the Black Cats, he has managed 16 in 30 games this season and they had success as they repeatedly tested the Norwich defence against the 32-year-old striker's pace with long balls forward.\nIt may have been one-dimensional, but that direct style paid off as Borini chased up on a swift counter-attack and was clumsily fouled by Wisdom in the box as he controlled Defoe's return ball.\nAfter the break, another fast transition after a dawdling Sebastien Bassong was robbed by Jan Kirchoff saw the roles reversed with Borini threading a perfect delivery to the far post for Defoe to slide in and convert.\nSunderland's goal difference is now seven superior to Norwich's and they might have increased that advantage further with Watmore wasting a fine opening before belatedly adding a third.\nNorwich's missing mojo\nNorwich had 19 shots to the visitors' eight and 14 corners with Sunderland unable to force a single one.\nBut for all their industry, endeavour and possession, they lacked the cutting edge and ruthlessness that the Black Cats showed.\nInstead they were largely restricted to long-range efforts, with Martin Olsson, Bassong and Wisdom bringing saves out of Vito Mannone.\nRedmond then struck the base of a post with a skimming effort, while referee Andre Marriner turned down a trio of weak penalty claims to the home crowd's disgust.\nSoured milk\nThe two clubs have competed for the Friendship Trophy in their league meetings\n, external\nsince they played each other in the 1985 Milk Cup final, but with the far greater prize of Premier League survival on the line there was little cordial about this encounter.\nNorwich's Robbie Brady nudged DeAndre Yedlin into the advertising hoarding in front of the Sunderland bench, sparking a shoving match in which Black Cats' boss Sam Allardyce and Norwich substitute Cameron Jerome jostled each other.\nRelations were not improved by Borini's goal celebration which finished with him sliding on his knees in front of the home supporters, some of whom returned fire with the paper clappers that had been distributed before kick-off.\nThe closing stages of the match played out to the travelling fans' taunts that Norwich are heading to the Championship with their north-east rivals Newcastle.\nIf that prediction proves true, this result will feature heavily in Norwich's post-mortem of the season.\nMan of the match - Jan Kirchoff\nWhat they said\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"The two teams are still chasing us, we're still a point ahead. We need to win games and that's always been the case.\n\"That second goal cost us the game. The second half, for that first 25 minutes we looked threatening, hit the post, and I thought we were going to score but that second goal took the stuffing out us.\"\nSunderland manager Sam Allardyce: \"The position we've left ourselves in was making me feel a bit edgy this morning. Will we handle the pressure? Will we cope with the pressure?\n\"They've answered my questions. They've coped with the pressure and coped with everything Norwich could throw at them. To come here and win 3-0 shows you what a massive result it is.\"\nStats you need to know\nNorwich have conceded nine penalties in the Premier League this season, the highest tally in the division.\nSunderland have scored each of their past 17 penalties in the Premier League, last missing one in December 2011.\nOnly Sunderland in 2007-08 and Bradford in 1999-2000 (nine) have conceded more penalty goals in a Premier League season than Norwich this season (eight).\nJermain Defoe has now scored 10 goals in 14 Premier League away appearances this season for Sunderland.\nDefoe has scored or assisted in four of his past five Premier League games against Norwich (two goals, two assists).\nSunderland scored with all three shots on target in the match.\nSunderland won at Carrow Road for the first time since March 1985, having gone 10 games without a win there since.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams play Arsenal next. Sunderland welcome the Gunners to the Stadium of Light on 24 April, while Norwich have a fortnight to prepare for their trip to north London."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Leicester City 4-0 Swansea City\nLeicester City restored their eight-point lead over Tottenham Hotspur and took another stride towards the Premier League title with a ruthless demolition of Swansea City.\nThe Foxes were without suspended top-scorer Jamie Vardy and had watched Spurs start to apply pressure at the top of the table.\nBut Claudio Ranieri's side responded emphatically by equalling their best Premier League win and scoring four for the first time since Sunderland were beaten 4-2 on the opening day.\nRiyad Mahrez took advantage of Ashley Williams' poor clearance to score with a composed finish before Leonardo Ulloa stepped into the space left by Vardy to ensure this was a win achieved in style and comfort.\nAnalysis: 'I voted Vardy but Mahrez deserves PFA award'\nUlloa headed in Danny Drinkwater's free-kick before the break, then scrambled in the third goal from a loose ball on the hour to give Leicester the advantage their superiority deserved.\nSubstitute Marc Albrighton added a fourth to leave Leicester needing a maximum of five more points to win the title for the first time in their history. They could even clinch it with victory at Manchester United next weekend if Spurs slip up at home to West Bromwich Albion on Monday night.\nRelive Leicester's win against Swansea\nUlloa answers the Vardy question\nWhat would Leicester City do without Vardy? That question has been asked plenty of times this season - and more so in recent days, after he was suspended for being sent off in the 2-2 draw with West Ham and then hit with a follow-up Football Association charge for his reaction to referee Jon Moss.\nThe emphatic answer came in the shape of Ulloa, who fully repaid manager Ranieri's faith in his ability to replace the man with 22 Premier League goals this season.\nWhen Ulloa earned the Foxes a vital point with a stoppage-time penalty last weekend against West Ham, he showed he was not a man to be perturbed by pressure - and he relished the responsibility put on his shoulders against Swansea.\nThe 29-year-old Argentinian striker, an \u00a38m buy from Brighton in July 2014, ran selflessly all afternoon to compensate for the darting, pacy threat of Vardy, and most importantly contributed two goals that eventually made this a stroll for Leicester City.\nUlloa reacted decisively to head Drinkwater's inviting free-kick past Lukasz Fabianski on the half-hour, then showed determination to make sure he was first to a loose ball to bundle home his second, Leicester's third, after Jeff Schlupp had broken clear.\nThe two-goal striker was rewarded with a standing ovation when he was substituted late on. Vardy was not missed - and there is no greater compliment to Ulloa's performance.\nFans roaring the Foxes home\nLeicester's King Power Stadium demonstrated its first signs of tension during the draw with West Ham United last Sunday - a result that left the door ajar for title rivals Spurs.\nMauricio Pochettino's side took full advantage with a 4-0 thrashing of Stoke City on Monday night, and that could easily have played on Foxes' nerves.\nNot a bit of it. Well before kick-off, there was a mood of expectation and optimism sweeping around this atmospheric arena, with Leicester closing in on the finale to the greatest Premier League story.\nFormer Leicester forward Alan Birchenall, now master of ceremonies at the stadium on match day, whipped the crowd into a fervour with a rallying speech. The traditional pre-kick-off playing of Post Horn Gallop was accompanied by a deafening greeting for Leicester's players.\nAnd once Mahrez gave Leicester the lead, there was never a doubt about the destiny of the points. This ground reverberates on most occasions - but it has surely never been more thunderous than this.\nThe final seconds were played out to roars of \"Barcelona, we're coming for you\" - the perfect soundtrack to this wonderful, unlikely story of success.\nThis win, however, means that a day of yet greater celebration for the most unlikely of Premier League triumphs moves even closer.\nRanieri gets his selection spot on\nRanieri has spent the season flouting his reputation as 'The Tinkerman' - earned during his days at Chelsea when his penchant for squad rotation sent heads spinning.\nHe has relied on a bedrock of the same 11 players - but he needed to make selection decisions against Swansea, and got them spot on.\nOnce Vardy was suspended, the Italian announced within minutes that Ulloa would be his replacement. He talked up the player's character and ability and got a two-goal performance.\nHe backed another winner when he dropped Albrighton down to the bench and brought in Schlupp.\nThe 23-year-old Ghana international may be an erratic figure but his direct, strong running unsettled Swansea and he set up Ulloa for his second goal. He may be slightly unconventional but he was another to earn a standing ovation when he was substituted.\nAnd just to confirm Ranieri had the magic touch, Albrighton emerged from the bench to score the fourth late on.\nMan of the match - Leonardo Ulloa\nWhat they said\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"It's a fantastic performance. Without Jamie Vardy everyone gave something more.\n\"We knew we had some difficulties but with the fight of everybody we had a good match.\n\"We know it will be tough because Tottenham are a good team but we will fight until the end.\"\nSwansea boss Francesco Guidolin: \"We began really well, but then we conceded the first goal and we had to change our mentality and the way we played.\n\"We fought for 90 minutes. Claudio is my friend and now I can say it, I hope Leicester go on and win the title because they deserve it. Leicester are a really strong team and they deserve to win the Premier League.\"\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit and former Leicester player Robbie Savage: \"Leicester winning the league would have to be the best achievement in domestic sport. Ever. It is that incredible. And I don't think we'll see anything like this ever again.\n\"I just can't believe it.

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Liverpool 2-2 Newcastle United\nNewcastle boosted their hopes of avoiding relegation from the Premier League by coming back from 2-0 down to claim a point at in-form Liverpool.\nDaniel Sturridge's goal after 76 seconds and Adam Lallana's finish meant the Reds were cruising at the break.\nBut Papiss Cisse headed United back into contention early in the second half before Jack Colback pulled them level with a deflected shot.\nThey stay in the bottom three but are now a point behind 17th-placed Norwich.\nRafael Benitez's side have played a game more than the Canaries and two more than north-east rivals Sunderland, who are a place above them in the table, but are showing fighting spirit just when it is required.\nThis was their first away point of 2016 and the fifth point they have earned during what could be a pivotal week in their attempt to remain in the top flight.\nLISTEN: Newcastle come from two down to draw\nLiverpool in cruise control\nLiverpool came into this game as arguably the top-flight's form side following four successive wins in all competitions, during which they scored 14 goals.\nThey also had a striker returning to top form in Sturridge, so it was negligence of the highest order for Newcastle's defence to gift the England forward the time and space to chest down Alberto Moreno's free-kick, turn and fire home his third goal in as many games with just over a minute gone.\nIt would only get worse for the away side, who were out-worked, out-manoeuvred and picked off with ease as Lallana collected a square ball from Moreno before curling home from the edge of the box in the 30th minute.\nIt was just the half the home side needed after the news that defender Mamadou Sakho was being investigated by Uefa for a failed drugs test.\nIt ended without Newcastle having tested home goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and with Liverpool using as little energy as possible ahead of their Europa League semi-final first leg against Villarreal on Thursday.\nBenitez's side dig deep\nIn Newcastle's last away game they went down without a fight, losing 3-1 at Southampton to extend their away form to nine successive defeats.\nSince then, though, the Magpies have shown spirit and resilience to beat Swansea and draw with Manchester City in back-to-back home matches and, to their credit, they re-discovered this in the second half at Anfield.\nCredit must go to Benitez, who spent six successful years as Liverpool boss and master-minded another impressive result at Anfield, this time from the away dug-out.\nThey were given a helping hand by Mignolet, who rushed out and missed Andros Townsend's cross to gift Cisse the goal that sowed seeds of doubt in a Liverpool team that have been inconsistent for much of this season.\nUnited also survived a penalty shout for a foul on Sturridge by Cheick Tiote in the box and a Roberto Firmino close-range finish which was ruled out for offside against the Brazilian.\nThey grabbed the point their renewed application deserved when Colback picked the right moment to join the attack and fire in a deflected shot following Dejan Lovren's inadequate clearing header.\nThe result may yield only a point for Newcastle, but, more importantly, it gives them belief before the three games they have left to save their season.\nMan of the match - Alberto Moreno\nWhat they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I think we did really well in the first half against a highly-motivated side. I think they are happy with the point.\n\"The first half we were clearly the better team and in the second half also, apart from the two goals we conceded.\n\"Two shots on target, two goals sounds not too good and it is not too good.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez: \"We knew the first half was not the best and we needed to react so I told them similar to what I said in the past: 'Nothing to lose'.\n\"We had to fight and show more character and I think the players had a fantastic reaction.\n\"I am pleased with the point against a very good team and hopefully they [Liverpool] can do well in the Europa League.\n\"We have to do our job and see what happens with the other games but at least we showed character and the belief is still there, which is crucial for us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle have kept only one clean sheet in their past 35 league trips to Anfield, conceding 83 goals in that period\nDaniel Sturridge has netted seven goals in seven Barclays Premier League starts against Newcastle United\nSturridge's goal (1:07) was Liverpool's second quickest in the Premier League this season after James Milner's strike against Aston Villa in September (1:06)\nLiverpool have scored more goals from outside the penalty area (14) than any other Premier League team this season\nJack Colback netted his first away goal in the Premier League since Feb 2014; his last five Premier League goals had been scored in home matches\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Spanish side Villarreal for the first leg of their Europa League semi-final on Thursday before returning to Premier League action at Swansea next Sunday.\nThe first of Newcastle's remaining three league matches is at St James' Park next Saturday against Crystal Palace."

Despite United's victory, the atmosphere was flat.\nWith their title challenge over and some fans disillusioned with manager Van Gaal, thousands of supporters chose to give this match a miss.\nAsked afterwards about the empty seats, Van Gaal said he didn't see \"a lot\" before adding \"you have seen it because you want to see it.\"\nCan United secure a Champions League spot?\nThis was a game United simply had to win and they easily managed to get the job done thanks, partly, to an inferior Palace side who have yet to secure top-flight safety.\nUnited were everything Palace were not - bright, creative, energetic and hungry.\nOne win will not paper over the cracks of a disappointing league campaign, yet Van Gaal's side have given themselves a fighting chance of sealing a top-four finish and Champions League football.\nUnited still face big tests against leaders Leicester City (home) and West Ham (away), while they must also travel to a Norwich side fighting to stay in the Premier League before ending the league season at home to Bournemouth.\nYouth, pace and promise\nBut for keeper Julian Speroni, Palace would have been on the receiving end of an ugly defeat as Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard once again showed United have a promising future.\nMartial, who gave Martin Kelly and Adrian Mariappa a torrid evening, was denied by two excellent saves after Delaney had stabbed United into the lead while trying to make a clearance.\nUnited's previous four league wins had been 1-0 but the hosts always looked likely to add to their lead against limp opponents.\nDarmian neatly chested the ball down before dispatching a sweet finish in front of the Stretford End and only more heroics from Speroni kept out the lively pair of Rashford and Lingard.\nProblems mount for Pardew\nPalace started 2016 fifth in the table yet three matches from the end of their league campaign they are nine points above the relegation zone and all the teams below them have games in hand.\nManager Alan Pardew made seven changes from the side that earned a creditable 1-1 draw at Arsenal in their previous game, but they face Watford in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against the backdrop of one win in 18 league games.\nArgentine Speroni kept his side in the game while Wilfried Zaha at least offered glimpses of an attacking threat.\nOthers did little to enhance their chances of earning a starting place at the weekend as United dominated from start to finish.\nEmmanuel Adebayor never looked like scoring, defender Pape Souare was fortunate to escape a red card for a wild lunge on Juan Mata and Mariappa struggled on his first start for six months.\nMan of the Match - Julian Speroni (Crystal Palace)\nWhat they said\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I have told my players that it was a good game and the only remark is that we didn't score too many goals, because it could have been 5-0.\n\"We needed three points and that is what I said to my players. Darmian surprised me on Monday in the training session. We did a sort of finishing session and he was the top scorer in that time.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: \"I am disappointed to concede a goal like we did in the first six minutes. It was avoidable and took a bit of ambition out of us.\n\"It was difficult after the Arsenal performance to get the same energy here tonight. We tried to freshen it up.\n\"I could see a bit of blurred focus from our players. I can understand that. A lot of our players may never get a better chance to get to an FA Cup final.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester United have never lost to Crystal Palace in the Premier League (W11 D3).\nUnited have benefitted from more own goals in Premier League history than any other side (66).\nCrystal Palace have failed to score in 11 of their 14 Premier League games against Manchester United and six of seven at Old Trafford.\nUnited have won their last nine home league matches against Crystal Palace.\nPalace are winless in their last nine Premier League away matches (D5 L4) since their last win on the road back on 19 December at Stoke City.\nWhat's next?\nWembley beckons for both United and Palace.\nUnited will be confident of seeing off a deflated Everton in the first semi-final on Saturday (17:15 BST) while Palace have an extra day to prepare before facing Watford (16:00 BST) for a place in the 21 May final.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Leicester City 4-0 Swansea City\nLeicester City restored their eight-point lead over Tottenham Hotspur and took another stride towards the Premier League title with a ruthless demolition of Swansea City.\nThe Foxes were without suspended top-scorer Jamie Vardy and had watched Spurs start to apply pressure at the top of the table.\nBut Claudio Ranieri's side responded emphatically by equalling their best Premier League win and scoring four for the first time since Sunderland were beaten 4-2 on the opening day.\nRiyad Mahrez took advantage of Ashley Williams' poor clearance to score with a composed finish before Leonardo Ulloa stepped into the space left by Vardy to ensure this was a win achieved in style and comfort.\nAnalysis: 'I voted Vardy but Mahrez deserves PFA award'\nUlloa headed in Danny Drinkwater's free-kick before the break, then scrambled in the third goal from a loose ball on the hour to give Leicester the advantage their superiority deserved.\nSubstitute Marc Albrighton added a fourth to leave Leicester needing a maximum of five more points to win the title for the first time in their history. They could even clinch it with victory at Manchester United next weekend if Spurs slip up at home to West Bromwich Albion on Monday night.\nRelive Leicester's win against Swansea\nUlloa answers the Vardy question\nWhat would Leicester City do without Vardy? That question has been asked plenty of times this season - and more so in recent days, after he was suspended for being sent off in the 2-2 draw with West Ham and then hit with a follow-up Football Association charge for his reaction to referee Jon Moss.\nThe emphatic answer came in the shape of Ulloa, who fully repaid manager Ranieri's faith in his ability to replace the man with 22 Premier League goals this season.\nWhen Ulloa earned the Foxes a vital point with a stoppage-time penalty last weekend against West Ham, he showed he was not a man to be perturbed by pressure - and he relished the responsibility put on his shoulders against Swansea.\nThe 29-year-old Argentinian striker, an \u00a38m buy from Brighton in July 2014, ran selflessly all afternoon to compensate for the darting, pacy threat of Vardy, and most importantly contributed two goals that eventually made this a stroll for Leicester City.\nUlloa reacted decisively to head Drinkwater's inviting free-kick past Lukasz Fabianski on the half-hour, then showed determination to make sure he was first to a loose ball to bundle home his second, Leicester's third, after Jeff Schlupp had broken clear.\nThe two-goal striker was rewarded with a standing ovation when he was substituted late on. Vardy was not missed - and there is no greater compliment to Ulloa's performance.\nFans roaring the Foxes home\nLeicester's King Power Stadium demonstrated its first signs of tension during the draw with West Ham United last Sunday - a result that left the door ajar for title rivals Spurs.\nMauricio Pochettino's side took full advantage with a 4-0 thrashing of Stoke City on Monday night, and that could easily have played on Foxes' nerves.\nNot a bit of it. Well before kick-off, there was a mood of expectation and optimism sweeping around this atmospheric arena, with Leicester closing in on the finale to the greatest Premier League story.\nFormer Leicester forward Alan Birchenall, now master of ceremonies at the stadium on match day, whipped the crowd into a fervour with a rallying speech. The traditional pre-kick-off playing of Post Horn Gallop was accompanied by a deafening greeting for Leicester's players.\nAnd once Mahrez gave Leicester the lead, there was never a doubt about the destiny of the points. This ground reverberates on most occasions - but it has surely never been more thunderous than this.\nThe final seconds were played out to roars of \"Barcelona, we're coming for you\" - the perfect soundtrack to this wonderful, unlikely story of success.\nThis win, however, means that a day of yet greater celebration for the most unlikely of Premier League triumphs moves even closer.\nRanieri gets his selection spot on\nRanieri has spent the season flouting his reputation as 'The Tinkerman' - earned during his days at Chelsea when his penchant for squad rotation sent heads spinning.\nHe has relied on a bedrock of the same 11 players - but he needed to make selection decisions against Swansea, and got them spot on.\nOnce Vardy was suspended, the Italian announced within minutes that Ulloa would be his replacement. He talked up the player's character and ability and got a two-goal performance.\nHe backed another winner when he dropped Albrighton down to the bench and brought in Schlupp.\nThe 23-year-old Ghana international may be an erratic figure but his direct, strong running unsettled Swansea and he set up Ulloa for his second goal. He may be slightly unconventional but he was another to earn a standing ovation when he was substituted.\nAnd just to confirm Ranieri had the magic touch, Albrighton emerged from the bench to score the fourth late on.\nMan of the match - Leonardo Ulloa\nWhat they said\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"It's a fantastic performance. Without Jamie Vardy everyone gave something more.\n\"We knew we had some difficulties but with the fight of everybody we had a good match.\n\"We know it will be tough because Tottenham are a good team but we will fight until the end.\"\nSwansea boss Francesco Guidolin: \"We began really well, but then we conceded the first goal and we had to change our mentality and the way we played.\n\"We fought for 90 minutes. Claudio is my friend and now I can say it, I hope Leicester go on and win the title because they deserve it. Leicester are a really strong team and they deserve to win the Premier League.\"\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit and former Leicester player Robbie Savage: \"Leicester winning the league would have to be the best achievement in domestic sport. Ever. It is that incredible. And I don't think we'll see anything like this ever again.\n\"I just can't believe it. Everybody here is the same from when I was around; the kitman, the people holding the doors open. But on the pitch they are transformed. It's one of those moments when you think: I was there.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester registered their 22nd victory of the season, their biggest haul of wins ever in a top-flight season (21 in both 1928/29 and 1965/66).\nSwansea have enjoyed just two victories in their last 13 Premier League away games, drawing three and losing eight.\nRiyad Mahrez has been involved in a joint-league-high 28 top-flight goals this season (17 goals, 11 assists), level with team-mate Jamie Vardy.\nMahrez has netted four goals in his two Premier League games against Swansea this season.\nSwansea lost by a margin of four or more goals for only the fourth time in their Premier League history (also two 5-0 defeats and one other 4-0 loss).\nDanny Drinkwater provided his sixth Premier League assist of the season, but his first for anyone other than Jamie Vardy.\nLeonardo Ulloa has scored three goals in his last two PL games, as many as he'd scored in his previous 25 this season.\nOnly Steed Malbranque (26 in 09/10) has been substituted more often in a single Premier League campaign than Shinji Okazaki this season (23).\nWhat next?\nLeicester travel to Old Trafford to play Manchester United on Sunday, 1 May, while Swansea host Liverpool on the same day."

We had two or three chances, and if we'd taken them, we might have got something. But if we have to score five goals at home to win a game, then we're going to be in for a tough challenge. We did get a response under difficult circumstances, but it wasn't enough to win the game.\n\"We conceded poor goals that put us on the back foot. There was a response, and credit for that, but on the day it wasn't enough.\n\"The fans are entitled to vent their displeasure. It's not an ideal atmosphere, but it's understandable, given the circumstances. We have to continue to be professional.\"\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman: \"Scoring four goals away from home is good but we conceded two and that is not like Southampton. We gave Villa the belief that they could get a better result. In the end, we were by far the better team. It was a good result finally, and we're on to the next game.\n\"Scoring goals was not a problem today, but in general we have been missing too many opportunities away from home. That is why we are a little way behind the fifth and sixth positions in the table.\n\"It was difficult because it was a strange atmosphere - but even more so for the home team.

Real Madrid will offer different level of test to Stoke City but Iheanacho's pace off the bench could be a useful weapon for Pellegrini.\nWhat now for Stoke?\nMark Hughes' side started well, missed several chances at 2-0 down, and eventually caved in. They have now conceded 12 goals in three games.\nTheir task was not helped by the absence of Ibrahim Afellay, the Netherlands midfielder who suffered a serious knee injury on the eve of the game.\nThe Potters, who have won one of the last seven league games, were also forced to replace 40-year-old keeper Shay Given at the start of the second half due to a suspected groin injury.\nJoselu squandered a great opportunity to reduce the deficit at 2-0, while Mame Biram Diouf went close with a header before City took the game out of sight.\nStoke still have to face Sunderland (home), Crystal Palace (away) and West Ham United (home) and manager Hughes faces a battle to rouse his players and ensure the season does not end on a flat note.\nMan of the Match - Kelechi Iheanacho (Man City)\nWhat they said\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"A big team must always be focused on both competitions. Premier League and Champions League. Every big team must do it every year.\n\"Stoke is fighting for nothing but nobody wants to lose games. It was important to score the first goal.\"\nOn Kelechi Iheanacho: \"He is an important young player with a lot of future. He scores lots of goals but he is not just a penalty-box player. I am sure that his role in this team will be very important.\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"Once again we have conceded poor goals, which is a recurring theme.\n\"We were a million miles away from where we need to be in the first half. We are lacking the pace and power you need in key areas of the field.\n\"I'm not one to look at injuries but we have got guys coming back from long-term injuries and playing through injuries. It's difficult. We have issues but we should help ourselves.\"\nStoke midfielder Glenn Whelan: \"We are going through a difficult stage - we are feeling sorry for ourselves. This is not the Stoke City I am used to playing with and we owe more to our fans.\n\"We don't want the season to fizzle out. We have three games to turn it around. Listen, we need to look at ourselves. It hasn't been good enough. We are giving away soft goals.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nGoalkeeper Shay Given became the 14th player to start a Premier League game aged 40 or older (40y 3d old).\nSergio Aguero has scored 22 goals in his last 21 Premier League appearances, including seven in his last five games.\nAguero has netted in five consecutive Premier League games for the fourth time in his career (also November 2013, January 2014 and May 2015).\nStoke are without a clean sheet in nine away Premier League games, conceding 22 goals.\nThe Potters are the third team in Premier League history to concede 4+ goals in three consecutive Premier League games, after West Ham in March 2008 and Wigan in August 2010.\nWhat's next?\nAttention now turns to Tuesday's Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid for Manchester City, whose next Premier League game is at Southampton on 1 May.\nStoke will attempt to arrest their losing run at home to struggling Sunderland next Saturday."

Second half, they were better and I thought Chelsea's attitude to the game was spot on, that's why it ended up being such a high quality game.\n\"The beauty of our run-in, which is so tough on paper, is that we're learning all the time. We're still finding our feet at this level, they've been harsh lessons for us but hopefully we'll come out of it a better team.\"\nChelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink: \"We're very pleased with the performance, especially in the second half.\n\"It was a very open, entertaining game. Bournemouth have a very good build-up and create good chances.\n\"It was good discipline and good to see some players who have been absent recently, scoring goals.\n\"We worked with Eden Hazard for the last 10 days, his movement was good and we talked about playing him for 45 minutes or perhaps more, but in the end he was enjoying it and he came through the whole game.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth, sat in 13th but with no risk of going down, can go above 11th-placed Everton if they beat them next Saturday.\nChelsea can sabotage Tottenham's title hopes when they host their London rivals on Monday, 2 May. It was a point not lost on the travelling Blues fans at Dean Court, who sung about their desire to go on and beat Spurs.\n\"I didn't hear what the fans were singing because I was so focused on the game,\" said Hiddink. \"But we play the next game to win. And the next game is Tottenham.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nBournemouth have lost three home league games in a row for the first time since March 2013\nChelsea scored with all four of their shots on target in the game\nEden Hazard - who scored more than once in a Premier League game for the first time since February 2014 - ended a run of 29 Premier League games without a goal\nCesc Fabregas assisted three or more goals in a Premier League game for the second time in his career (four assists for Arsenal v Blackburn, Oct 2009)\nTommy Elphick's goal was the 900th goal scored in this Premier League season\nThe Cherries have now conceded in each of their last seven Premier League games\nPedro has scored five goals in his last seven Premier League appearances after netting just two in the 19 beforehand",

In the first half we played very well and it will always happen in football when you allow the other team to believe you can concede.\n\"But I think I am still very proud for my players. We still need to believe. We know it will be difficult but we need to still believe and fight for these three games.\n\"We have a chance but it is true that now it is more difficult. We understand that this was a must-win and now we have to lift the players.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis:\n\"We just watched them dance around us at times but the great thing about the game was we came in just 1-0 down at half-time.\n\"But second half was much better - more like the performances we've been putting in away from home.\n\"I'm really pleased with the players. We lack a bit of quality at times but I can't fault their work-rate and they work within a shape that suits them.\"\nStats of the day\nTottenham attempted just two shots on target in this game - their lowest figure in a Premier League match at White Hart Lane since October 2014\nSpurs did not attempt a shot on target in this match after the 20th minute\nSpurs have scored a league-high 23 goals from set-piece situations this season in the Premier League (incl. five penalties)\nWest Brom had more shots (10) than Spurs (7) in the second half of this match\nDawson became the first West Brom player to score at both ends in the same game in the Premier League"

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Arsenal 1-0 Norwich City\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger had to endure calls for his departure as his side beat a Norwich team whose Premier League future looks increasingly bleak.\nFans protested inside and outside Emirates Stadium, voicing frustration at their team's failure to mount a title challenge in recent years.\nThere was little for Arsenal to cheer until substitute Danny Welbeck put them ahead with a crisp half-volley.\nNorwich are two points from safety with three games left.\nThey had chances - twice Petr Cech stopped Nathan Redmond from scoring. But for all their endeavour, Norwich left north London with nothing and with Newcastle beating Crystal Palace and Sunderland securing a draw against Stoke earlier in the day, their hopes of survival appear slim.\nThe Canaries are second from bottom and two points behind Newcastle, who moved out of the bottom three thanks to their win over Palace.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\n'Arsenal fans should try supporting Newcastle and they wouldn't complain about Wenger'\nArsenal fans divided\nWenger and his players had been warned there would be a toxic atmosphere at the Emirates, and protests calling for the end of the Frenchman's 19-year tenure began outside the stadium.\nFans from the Arsenal Supporters' Trust, the Black Scarf Movement and Red Action handed out posters with the message 'time for change' and a minority held them up after 12 and 78 minutes - 12 being the number of years the club has gone without winning the league.\nVarious banners were held up, one saying 'Wenger - 12 years of excuses, Ranieri - 9 months, champions' in reference to Leicester's march towards the league title.\nStoking the flames this week were Wenger's pre-match comments - that fans had gone \"overboard\" with their criticisms, and that his team had played in \"a very difficult climate\" at home over recent months, contributing to their failure in the league.\nIn a divided stadium, there were those who supported their manager, singing \"there's only one Arsene Wenger\" in response to the 12th-minute protest. They would point to the six FA Cups, three league titles and 18 consecutive seasons of Champions League football the club have enjoyed under Wenger.\nVictory over Norwich moved them to third in the table, three points above Manchester City, and a step closer to securing another season in Europe's elite cup competition.\nArsenal lacking inspiration\nThere was little to unite the factions as the first half played out like the majority of Arsenal's games this year: plenty of possession, but little bite.\nFor the fourth time in their past nine home league games, Wenger's men failed to conjure a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nAt the other end of the pitch, and despite the visitors having just 30% of possession, Cech twice stopped Redmond from scoring, while a third effort from the striker before the break bounced just wide.\nIt was the 56th-minute introduction of Welbeck that turned the match in Arsenal's favour. The striker gave his team much-needed spark and, within three minutes of coming on, he placed Olivier Giroud's well-directed header into the bottom-left corner. Welbeck's goal came from his team's first shot on target.\nNorwich on the brink\nThe Canaries have won at Old Trafford, drawn at Anfield and Upton Park and held Arsenal at home this season so there was hope before this match, especially against a team who have collected just 10 points from their past seven home league games.\nArsenal were often uncomfortable defending Norwich's counter-attacks and had it not been for a well-timed Gabriel tackle on substitute Dieumerci Mbokani the visitors might have equalised.\nBut only relegated Aston Villa have lost more league games than Norwich this year and this defeat - their 11th in 15 league games - leaves them heading in the wrong direction.\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"We were warned about the protestors. You want to make the fans happy. I'm sorry if I don't achieve it. I'm irritated and frustrated if I cannot keep people happy. I have respect for the club and gave so much for the club. I want to make people happy.\n\"Our job is to do the best. I think this season we hoped that we could win the league. It didn't happen and that's why people are frustrated. I can share that frustration. The aim is to come back and do what is needed to do it next year. The last three years the club has moved forward.\"\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"Our gameplan worked really well. Petr Cech made three or four good saves. There was a five-minute spell when we were stretched and Arsenal managed to score in that spell.\n\"The last thing you can do down in the dogfight is feel sorry for yourselves. We didn't get what we deserved. We need three displays like that in the next three games. If you start worrying about the maths and what other people are doing then it'll drive you crazy.\"\nWhat next?\nTwo of Norwich's remaining three league games are at Carrow Road, against Manchester United (7 May) and Watford (11 May). They desperately need to secure points at home if they are to go to Everton's Goodison Park on the last day of the season with hopes of survival still alive.\nThe Gunners have two games to play - against fourth-placed Manchester City and relegated Villa.\nThe stats you need to know\nDanny Welbeck has equalled his Premier League goal tally from last season for Arsenal (4) but has played 10 games this season compared with 25 last campaign.\nOnly Mesut Ozil (18) has more assists in the Premier League than Olivier Giroud (5) for Arsenal this season.\nNo side has kept fewer clean sheets than Norwich in the Premier League this season (5, level with Villa).\nArsenal are unbeaten in eight Premier League matches (W4 D4) with only West Ham (10) and Leicester (9) on longer unbeaten runs than the Gunners.\nArsene Wenger's side have kept three clean in a row in the Premier League for the first time since September 2015.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Manchester United 1-1 Leicester City\nLeicester City moved to within two points of the Premier League title after holding Manchester United to a draw at Old Trafford - and will clinch it on Monday if Tottenham fail to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\nThe Foxes recovered well from a shaky start, during which they went behind after eight minutes when Anthony Martial drilled home a near-post finish from Antonio Valencia's cross.\nClaudio Ranieri's side demonstrated the strength of purpose that has become their trademark this season when captain Wes Morgan outmuscled United's defenders to head the equaliser past David de Gea nine minutes later.\nBoth sides had penalty appeals turned down when United's Marcos Rojo blocked off Riyad Mahrez and when Leicester's Danny Drinkwater was sent off late on after receiving a second yellow card for dragging back Memphis Depay, with referee Michael Oliver ruling it was right on the edge of the area.\nLeicester's supporters celebrated long and loud after the final whistle but this was a blow to United's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League as they now stand four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City with only three games left.\nAnalysis: 'Now we find out if Tottenham can respond' - Shearer\nReaction to Leicester's Old Trafford draw here.\nFootball Daily Podcast on the game.\nChampagne on ice - but not for long\nLeicester City did not quite complete the formalities of the greatest story the Premier League has ever told - but it surely will not be long before they can officially celebrate this spectacular triumph.\nThousands of visiting fans stayed behind well after the final whistle at Old Trafford in a demonstration of sheer elation as this dream journey towards a first top-flight crown reaches its conclusion.\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal gave his counterpart Ranieri a warm, almost congratulatory, greeting at the final whistle, while those home fans still inside the stadium rose to applaud Leicester's players as they made their way to the dressing room.\nIt was another sign of the wave of goodwill that has accompanied Ranieri and his players on this momentous journey.\nThe scenery now shifts to Stamford Bridge on Monday night, where the title will be Leicester's if Spurs do not beat Chelsea. Viewers can watch highlights of that game on a special Match of the Day programme on BBC One at 22:55 BST (23:25 in Northern Ireland).\nAnd even if Spurs do beat Chelsea, a victory at home to Everton will seal the deal next Saturday.\nLeicester show what they are all about\nLeicester have answered every question put in front of them this season - and so it was again when Martial put United ahead and the Foxes were on the rack.\nKeeper Kasper Schmeichel kept Leicester in it with a fine save from Jesse Lingard before Morgan equalised.\nThis Leicester City side is built on solid foundations of character and resilience as well as ability and it served them well here. Many might have crumbled in the face of that early United surge - not the Foxes.\nThey grew into the game, matched United and proved once again they will be worthy Premier League champions.\nWill Fellaini ever learn?\nMarouane Fellaini's use of his elbows has characterised his career in England, both at Everton and now at Manchester United - and he shows no signs of curbing his excesses.\nThe Belgian's wild swinging elbow that caught Robert Huth on the jaw in the first half at Old Trafford went unseen and unpunished by referee Michael Oliver and will surely attract the attention of the Football Association.\nFellaini's mitigating circumstance will be that Huth pulled at his hair in an act of provocation.\nThis was clearly true but there can be no excuse for Fellaini's reaction, which would surely have brought a red card from referee Oliver had he been seen.\nIn the light of Tottenham's Dele Alli receiving a three-match ban for his punch on West Bromwich Albion's Claudio Yacob, it is hard to see Fellaini escaping similar sanction. The consolation will be that any suspension will cover three league games and leave him available for the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace.\nMan of the match - Kasper Schmeichel\nThe game in stats\nLeicester have lost just one of the last 10 Premier League games in which they have conceded first (W3 D6) - vs Liverpool in December.\nAnthony Martial has scored 15 goals in all competitions this season, more than any other Manchester United player.\nMartial's goal was the first Leicester had conceded in the opening 10 minutes of their top-flight fixtures this season.\nThe Foxes have lost just one of the last five top-flight games in which they have had a player sent off.\nDanny Drinkwater notched his seventh Premier League assist of the season - only James Milner (11), Dele Alli (9) and Ross Barkley (8) have more among English players in 2015-16.\nLeicester remain one of only three teams Wayne Rooney has faced with Manchester United in the Premier League without scoring against (along with Blackpool and Derby).\nClaudio Ranieri has enjoyed just two victories in his 10 Premier League clashes with the Red Devils (D6 L2).\nWhat's up next?\nIf Tottenham fail to win at Chelsea on Monday, then Leicester will be crowned Premier League champions.\nOtherwise, Ranieri's side - 5,000-1 outsiders at the start of the season - will have the chance to seal the title in front of their own fans when they play Everton next Saturday (17:30 BST).\nUnited travel to struggling Norwich next Saturday (12:45 BST) as they look to boost their slim Champions League hopes."

We had to win. We had to dig deep, we showed we're a team and that we have character.\nOn Everton fans protesting about his reign: \"In football you have to concentrate on affecting the game and just winning. The winning feeling allows you to move on. That's what we can take from today.\n\"Those aspects (fans organising banners to be flown over Goodison) are not for me. My concentration is preparing the players and preparing for the game.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I think we were worth a draw, the two goals we conceded were out of context.\n\"We were solid and our keeper was a spectator for most of the game. When chances came we weren't clinical enough.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeighton Baines scored from open play in the Premier League for the first time since January 2013.\nTony Hibbert made his first Premier League appearance for Everton since December 2014, 511 days ago.\nNo Premier League side has scored more goals in the opening 15 minutes this season than Bournemouth (nine).\nWhat next?\nEverton visit Leicester next Saturday (17:30 BST), which could be a title-winning celebration for the Foxes, while Bournemouth host West Brom (15:00 BST).",

The 29-year-old found Carroll out on the left, and the England striker's looping ball over the top was drilled in with force by Noble.\nLeko: born in 1999\nWith West Brom's top-flight status all-but secure, Pulis handed a starting berth to 17-year-old Jonathan Leko - and he became the first player born in 1999 to start a Premier League match.\nThe young winger made an immediate impact, too, as he glided through the West Brom defence and supplied Craig Gardner, who saw two efforts kept out.\nLeko then tricked his way forward again, but Gardner could only head wide of the target.\nAs the teenager's impact faded, and the Hammers took the lead, West Brom rarely looked a threat.\nStriker Salomon Rondon had only four touches in the box all game, and their best effort in the second half was sent wide of the post by substitute Saido Berahino.\nMan of the match - Dimitri Payet\nWhat the managers said\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"I thought we dominated the first 25 minutes but we had to take chances. You know they're going to get opportunities, and we've not had the breaks.\n\"We went 2-0 down when they had three shots. They had four shots, three goals. We had five or six opportunities and we've not scored.\n\"We've got a lot of talent in the academy and Jonathan [Leko] has got raw talent. He needs to be out playing against men. Under-21 football isn't enough. We have to get these kids out. He's got unbelievable talent.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"We totally deserved it. They are physical and organised. They have a good home record against big teams and they were better in the first 25 minutes. We were on the back foot but then we started to stretch them.\n\"The goals helped - the first and second before the break. We scored magnificent goals from open play and it's a great win.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDimitri Payet is the fourth West Ham player to assist 10 goals in a Premier League season, following Matt Holmes (10, 1993-94), Eyal Berkovic (10 in 1997-98 and 11 in 1998-99) and Paolo di Canio (13 in 1999-2000).\nOnly Southampton (14) have scored more headed goals than the Hammers (13) in the Premier League this season.\nMark Noble has scored more Premier League goals this season (seven) than in his previous two seasons combined (five).\nNoble has scored four goals in his last two Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 57.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham face Swansea at home on 7 May, while West Brom travel to Bournemouth on the same day."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "West Bromwich Albion 0-3 West Ham United\nMark Noble scored twice as West Ham eased past West Brom to reclaim fifth place in the Premier League table.\nThe hosts had the best opportunities in the opening 15 minutes, but the Hammers soon took control.\nCheikhou Kouyate's header opened the scoring and the midfielder then set up Mark Noble, whose scuffed effort made it 2-0 before the break.\nAnd Noble grabbed a second - his fourth goal in two games - when he volleyed home from Andy Carroll's ball in.\nThe Hammers, now unbeaten in 10 league matches, leapfrog Manchester United, who play leaders Leicester on Sunday.\nAnd they have now reached their highest ever points haul in the Premier League with 59.\nBut the result leaves Tony Pulis' Baggies without a win in seven games.\nRelive West Ham's win over West Brom\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nPivotal Payet\nWest Ham have not lost a league game since their 1-0 defeat by Southampton in February and they look well set for a top-six finish - and a Europa League place.\nAgainst a poor West Brom side, Dimitri Payet was impressive once again for the Hammers and he played a big part in two of the three goals.\nThe Frenchman had just switched to the right wing when he collected the ball and sent in an accurate cross for Kouyate to head in on 34 minutes.\nKouyate then turned provider when he raced forward unopposed and fed Noble, who managed to poke past Ben Foster on the stroke of half-time.\nAnd it was Payet's weaving run which led to West Ham's third. The 29-year-old found Carroll out on the left, and the England striker's looping ball over the top was drilled in with force by Noble.\nLeko: born in 1999\nWith West Brom's top-flight status all-but secure, Pulis handed a starting berth to 17-year-old Jonathan Leko - and he became the first player born in 1999 to start a Premier League match.\nThe young winger made an immediate impact, too, as he glided through the West Brom defence and supplied Craig Gardner, who saw two efforts kept out.\nLeko then tricked his way forward again, but Gardner could only head wide of the target.\nAs the teenager's impact faded, and the Hammers took the lead, West Brom rarely looked a threat.\nStriker Salomon Rondon had only four touches in the box all game, and their best effort in the second half was sent wide of the post by substitute Saido Berahino.\nMan of the match - Dimitri Payet\nWhat the managers said\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"I thought we dominated the first 25 minutes but we had to take chances. You know they're going to get opportunities, and we've not had the breaks.\n\"We went 2-0 down when they had three shots. They had four shots, three goals. We had five or six opportunities and we've not scored.\n\"We've got a lot of talent in the academy and Jonathan [Leko] has got raw talent. He needs to be out playing against men. Under-21 football isn't enough. We have to get these kids out. He's got unbelievable talent.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"We totally deserved it. They are physical and organised. They have a good home record against big teams and they were better in the first 25 minutes. We were on the back foot but then we started to stretch them.\n\"The goals helped - the first and second before the break. We scored magnificent goals from open play and it's a great win.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDimitri Payet is the fourth West Ham player to assist 10 goals in a Premier League season, following Matt Holmes (10, 1993-94), Eyal Berkovic (10 in 1997-98 and 11 in 1998-99) and Paolo di Canio (13 in 1999-2000).\nOnly Southampton (14) have scored more headed goals than the Hammers (13) in the Premier League this season.\nMark Noble has scored more Premier League goals this season (seven) than in his previous two seasons combined (five).\nNoble has scored four goals in his last two Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 57.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham face Swansea at home on 7 May, while West Brom travel to Bournemouth on the same day.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Swansea City 3-1 Liverpool\nSwansea City dismantled a much-changed Liverpool side to make sure of their Premier League survival.\nAndre Ayew's header and a sumptuous Jack Cork goal put the hosts in charge after a vibrant first-half display.\nChristian Benteke nodded in to give the visitors hope, but Ayew's second goal swiftly ended those aspirations.\nBrad Smith was then sent off for Liverpool, whose hopes of Champions League qualification now rest on winning the Europa League.\nIt is a victory which moves Swansea, who have two games remaining, to 13th in the table and opens an unassailable 11-point gap between them and third-from-bottom Sunderland.\nRound-up and reaction to Sunday's Premier League matches\nWith Liverpool playing their first league game since an inquest concluded the 96 fans who died in the Hillsborough disaster were unlawfully killed, the pre-match tributes at the Liberty Stadium made for a moving atmosphere.\nOn the pitch, Swansea were as impressive against Liverpool as they were abject in their 4-0 capitulation at Leicester in their previous outing.\nYoung Reds come undone\nWith this match bookended by the two legs of their Europa League semi-final against Villarreal, Liverpool made eight changes as they named their youngest side of the Premier League era with an average age of 23.\nThis was not the first time Jurgen Klopp had selected an experimental team with European commitments in mind, as a similarly inexperienced line-up won comfortably at Bournemouth in April.\nHowever, against Swansea, Klopp's side unravelled as their youngsters were overwhelmed.\nMidfielder Pedro Chirivella endured a torrid first league start, and the 18-year-old was replaced by the seasoned Lucas Leiva at half-time.\nChirivella's midfield colleague Kevin Stewart did not fare much better, while young left-back Smith was sent off after receiving two yellow cards.\nSwans turn on the style for survival\nSwansea were already all but guaranteed a sixth successive season in the Premier League, but knew a point against Liverpool would officially secure survival.\nSoundly beaten by Leicester and Newcastle in their last two games, there was an onus on Francesco Guidolin's side to produce an improved performance - and they did so in style.\nCork embodied their dynamism with a thrusting display in midfield, crowned by his arcing shot from the edge of the penalty area which gave his side their second goal.\nThe Swans were given a fright when substitute Benteke headed in from a corner to halve Liverpool's deficit.\nBut the home side were never genuinely troubled and, two minutes later, Ayew fired into the bottom corner as Swansea scored three goals for the first time in the Premier League this season.\nMan of the Match - Andre Ayew\nManager reaction\nSwansea boss Francesco Guidolin: \"It is an important result for me, for the players, for the club, because this was a complicated season. I'm happy for my players because today they've shown they're not on the beach but very focused on the job. I know my players and I'm proud of them.\n\"At Leicester, we played well in the first 30 minutes and they were a bit worried, but today we played well and we scored two times. At Leicester we conceded two goals and this is the difference.\n\"Today we are happy because we won and the table is very good. I played in my career many games in the Europa League and it's difficult to play Thursday and Sunday. This is not right and this is the reason Liverpool, I think, lost the match because it's impossible to be fresh and ready for another important match but we deserved to win.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"We changed the line-up and with this line-up we can play much better football. We could explain a few things and it would sound like an excuse.\n\"This performance was not enough. We cannot be sure but if we don't concede the third one it's an open game. You can see there was not the body language you need for a comeback, though.\n\"We deserved to lose, they deserved to win, that's how football is on a bad day. I thought we lost a lot of easy balls, we weren't compact, there were a lot of things we could've done better. If we'd played a normal game, we could have won.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea enjoyed their fourth home league win in a row, their best-ever run of home Premier League victories.\nChristian Benteke netted his 50th goal in the Premier League.\nAndre Ayew scored twice in a game for the first time for Swansea in any competition.\nSwansea struck three goals in a Premier League game for the first time since 25 April, 2015 - the last time Jack Cork scored.\nGylfi Sigurdsson has been involved in 41 Premier League goals for Swansea overall (25 goals, 16 assists), 10 more than any other Swansea player (Wilfried Bony is next on 31).\nWhat next?\nSwansea can rest a little easier knowing their Premier League safety has been secured before next weekend's tough trip to West Ham and a home game with Manchester City on the final day of the season.\nLiverpool must wipe out a 1-0 first-leg deficit in the Europa League semi-final against Villarreal at Anfield on Thursday to maintain their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League."

We will enjoy this weekend because we won and then we will focus on the next one against Aston Villa, which will be a tough one.\n\"The victory means a lot - it gives us momentum, confidence and a connection with the fans.\n\"Hopefully it will be the same against Tottenham when we can avoid relegation and everyone will be happy.\n\"The free-kick was fantastic and the penalty save. I was really pleased for them. Hopefully Karl does not need to save any more until the end of the season.\"\nPalace boss Alan Pardew:\n\"For long periods we looked in control of the game, especially in the first half.\n\"They had a good spell in the second half. The crowd got involved and they scored right at the end of that period. We needed to score and we didn't. The game came down to two set-plays and that is the margin we are at.\n\"This was a tight game. Rafa has improved Newcastle in terms of the defensive structure. It is difficult to get at them and they have edged a win here.\n\"I thought the reception I got was muted, which was nice. A lot of people understand that I managed here to the best of my ability and we had some good times that I lean on.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNewcastle have gone four games unbeaten in the Premier League for the first time since October-November 2014.\nThe Eagles haven't won a Premier League away game since 19 December 2015 - they have picked up just five points in 10 road trips since.\nSix of Townsend's nine Premier League goals have been scored from outside the box.\nPalace have conceded in each of their past nine Premier League games on the road.\nCabaye had scored his previous four penalties in the Premier League before today's miss v Newcastle.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle are at relegated Aston Villa next Saturday and Palace have a home game against Stoke.",

We had control but we conceded two silly goals and had to work pretty hard. We have to fight against these sort of teams.\n\"The speculation [about my future] in many ways is not good for the players.

What was important was to be competitive.\"\nAston Villa caretaker-boss Eric Black: \"The players have been criticised, and justifiably so, but not today. Ultimately of course you need to win games but there was a lot to be encouraged by.\n\"It's a fantastic football club with fantastic supporters and maybe it's just one little step towards getting the supporters back on side.\n\"I thought the effort of the players was outstanding, they showed desire and hunger but the sending-off changes the whole context of the game.\n\"At 2-1 up, I thought we looked like the team who were going to score again.

He had a shot from the edge of the area blocked (the yellow circle in the right-hand graphic) and only one of his two headers at goal brought a save.\nWhat next?\nStoke travel to Selhurst Park next weekend to play Crystal Palace, while Sunderland's survival bid could well be decided at Stadium of Light - their next two matches, against Chelsea and Everton, are at home, before a final-day trip to Watford.\nThe stats you need to know\nOnly Harry Kane (14) and Riyad Mahrez (12) have scored more away goals in the Premier League this season than Jermain Defoe (11).\nNo Stoke player has scored more in a Premier League season than Arnautovic has this campaign (11).\nThe Potters have now gone eight Premier League games without keeping a clean sheet thanks to Defoe's late equaliser.",

Viewers can watch highlights of that game on a special Match of the Day programme on BBC One at 22:55 BST (23:25 in Northern Ireland).\nAnd even if Spurs do beat Chelsea, a victory at home to Everton will seal the deal next Saturday.\nLeicester show what they are all about\nLeicester have answered every question put in front of them this season - and so it was again when Martial put United ahead and the Foxes were on the rack.\nKeeper Kasper Schmeichel kept Leicester in it with a fine save from Jesse Lingard before Morgan equalised.\nThis Leicester City side is built on solid foundations of character and resilience as well as ability and it served them well here. Many might have crumbled in the face of that early United surge - not the Foxes.\nThey grew into the game, matched United and proved once again they will be worthy Premier League champions.\nWill Fellaini ever learn?\nMarouane Fellaini's use of his elbows has characterised his career in England, both at Everton and now at Manchester United - and he shows no signs of curbing his excesses.\nThe Belgian's wild swinging elbow that caught Robert Huth on the jaw in the first half at Old Trafford went unseen and unpunished by referee Michael Oliver and will surely attract the attention of the Football Association.\nFellaini's mitigating circumstance will be that Huth pulled at his hair in an act of provocation.\nThis was clearly true but there can be no excuse for Fellaini's reaction, which would surely have brought a red card from referee Oliver had he been seen.\nIn the light of Tottenham's Dele Alli receiving a three-match ban for his punch on West Bromwich Albion's Claudio Yacob, it is hard to see Fellaini escaping similar sanction. The consolation will be that any suspension will cover three league games and leave him available for the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace.\nMan of the match - Kasper Schmeichel\nThe game in stats\nLeicester have lost just one of the last 10 Premier League games in which they have conceded first (W3 D6) - vs Liverpool in December.\nAnthony Martial has scored 15 goals in all competitions this season, more than any other Manchester United player.\nMartial's goal was the first Leicester had conceded in the opening 10 minutes of their top-flight fixtures this season.\nThe Foxes have lost just one of the last five top-flight games in which they have had a player sent off.\nDanny Drinkwater notched his seventh Premier League assist of the season - only James Milner (11), Dele Alli (9) and Ross Barkley (8) have more among English players in 2015-16.\nLeicester remain one of only three teams Wayne Rooney has faced with Manchester United in the Premier League without scoring against (along with Blackpool and Derby).\nClaudio Ranieri has enjoyed just two victories in his 10 Premier League clashes with the Red Devils (D6 L2).\nWhat's up next?\nIf Tottenham fail to win at Chelsea on Monday, then Leicester will be crowned Premier League champions.\nOtherwise, Ranieri's side - 5,000-1 outsiders at the start of the season - will have the chance to seal the title in front of their own fans when they play Everton next Saturday (17:30 BST).\nUnited travel to struggling Norwich next Saturday (12:45 BST) as they look to boost their slim Champions League hopes.",

We had to win. We had to dig deep, we showed we're a team and that we have character.\nOn Everton fans protesting about his reign: \"In football you have to concentrate on affecting the game and just winning. The winning feeling allows you to move on. That's what we can take from today.\n\"Those aspects (fans organising banners to be flown over Goodison) are not for me. My concentration is preparing the players and preparing for the game.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I think we were worth a draw, the two goals we conceded were out of context.\n\"We were solid and our keeper was a spectator for most of the game. When chances came we weren't clinical enough.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeighton Baines scored from open play in the Premier League for the first time since January 2013.\nTony Hibbert made his first Premier League appearance for Everton since December 2014, 511 days ago.\nNo Premier League side has scored more goals in the opening 15 minutes this season than Bournemouth (nine).\nWhat next?\nEverton visit Leicester next Saturday (17:30 BST), which could be a title-winning celebration for the Foxes, while Bournemouth host West Brom (15:00 BST)."

Southampton sprayed the ball around with ease, particularly punishing their visitors on the counter-attack.\nCity had their moments; Raheem Sterling was denied from six yards thanks to a wonderful point-blank save by Fraser Forster with the score goalless, while Iheanacho halved the deficit as he took advantage of a woeful Cuco Martina clearance.\nThe 19-year-old Nigerian striker collected his second brilliantly from the edge of the box for a goal which suggests he has a bright future ahead.\nBut for the majority of the match, and the first half especially, Saints ran amok. Long twice caused City's backpedalling defence problems before he toe-poked Tadic's hooked byline cross into the near post.\nSaints had nine shots at goal in the opening 45 minutes, compared with City's three, and their second once again highlighted the visitors' lackadaisical approach to defending. The hosts burst forward at pace and the influential Tadic set Mane free to side-foot home.\nSouthampton's superiority deserved a greater lead, but early in the second half their two-goal advantage was restored just when City had threatened to change the momentum of the match.\nFonte headed Steven Davis' corner on to the crossbar and it was Mane who reacted quicker than anyone else, sticking his foot out from two yards.\nSouthampton continued to threaten. Virgil van Dijk forced Joe Hart into a fine save with an audacious scissors kick before Mane got his third to become the sixth player to score a Premier League hat-trick against City.\nMan of the Match - Sadio Mane\nWhat the managers said\nSouthampton boss Ronald Koeman: \"It was a great game - and maybe the best opening 45 minutes by us of the season. We scored some great goals.\n\"We created so many problems for them. The pace was the key to win the game. Sadio had a big impact in the result. We did an amazing job.\n\"We have a team of players really motivated and we like to play good football. We fight for Europe and that's what we like. Two games to go and we're still fighting for something.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"I'm very frustrated because I didn't expect that performance, especially in defence. At least four of them [today's line-up] are not playing [regularly].\n\"I think we could've played on Saturday and named a stronger team, but in this case we had to prioritise Wednesday's game.\n\"The best way to prepare is to win but we couldn't do it.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSouthampton have scored four or more goals in consecutive Premier League games for the first time.\nManchester City have conceded four or more goals in three Premier League games this season, the most since the 00/01 campaign (4+ in six games).\nSadio Mane has scored seven goals in his last six Premier League games for Southampton; which comes after a run of 19 league appearances without scoring.\nKelechi Iheanacho has averaged a goal every 86.9 minutes in the Premier League this season. It's the best rate of any player who has scored two or more goals.\nDusan Tadic is only the fourth player to have have managed three or more assists in two different Premier League games (after Eyal Berkovic, Cesc Fabregas and Thierry Henry).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to Madrid on Wednesday for their Champions League second-leg semi-final tie against Real before a Premier League match against top-four rivals Arsenal on 8 May. Southampton will visit Tottenham on 8 May."

I'm happy for my players because today they've shown they're not on the beach but very focused on the job. I know my players and I'm proud of them.\n\"At Leicester, we played well in the first 30 minutes and they were a bit worried, but today we played well and we scored two times. At Leicester we conceded two goals and this is the difference.\n\"Today we are happy because we won and the table is very good. I played in my career many games in the Europa League and it's difficult to play Thursday and Sunday. This is not right and this is the reason Liverpool, I think, lost the match because it's impossible to be fresh and ready for another important match but we deserved to win.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"We changed the line-up and with this line-up we can play much better football. We could explain a few things and it would sound like an excuse.\n\"This performance was not enough. We cannot be sure but if we don't concede the third one it's an open game. You can see there was not the body language you need for a comeback, though.\n\"We deserved to lose, they deserved to win, that's how football is on a bad day. I thought we lost a lot of easy balls, we weren't compact, there were a lot of things we could've done better. If we'd played a normal game, we could have won.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea enjoyed their fourth home league win in a row, their best-ever run of home Premier League victories.\nChristian Benteke netted his 50th goal in the Premier League.\nAndre Ayew scored twice in a game for the first time for Swansea in any competition.\nSwansea struck three goals in a Premier League game for the first time since 25 April, 2015 - the last time Jack Cork scored.\nGylfi Sigurdsson has been involved in 41 Premier League goals for Swansea overall (25 goals, 16 assists), 10 more than any other Swansea player (Wilfried Bony is next on 31).\nWhat next?\nSwansea can rest a little easier knowing their Premier League safety has been secured before next weekend's tough trip to West Ham and a home game with Manchester City on the final day of the season.\nLiverpool must wipe out a 1-0 first-leg deficit in the Europa League semi-final against Villarreal at Anfield on Thursday to maintain their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Watford 3-2 Aston Villa\nTroy Deeney's two late goals denied Aston Villa what would have been only their fourth league win of the season.\nCiaran Clark nodded home Villa's opener from Ashley Westwood's corner, and Almen Abdi equalised for Watford with a curled free-kick just before half-time.\nJordan Ayew's low drive restored Villa's lead, but Aly Cissokho was then sent off with 17 minutes to play.\nDeeney rose to head home Steven Berghuis's 90th-minute cross, before slotting in a loose ball in the box.\nRelegated Villa were minutes away from victory, but the Premier League's bottom club fell to a particularly galling 11th consecutive loss.\nThree points for 12th-placed Watford, meanwhile, means they are mathematically assured of their Premier League safety.\nVilla making more history (the wrong kind)\nThe last time Villa won was at home to Norwich on 6 February, the 2-0 victory being one of very few positives in what has been a truly miserable season.\nSaturday's defeat at Vicarage Road equals their longest losing run of 11 matches, set during the 1962-63 season in the old First Division.\nThe fact they had grown into the game to lead twice deservedly will make this result especially hard to take for the Villa fans who were there.\nThe 2,000 or so who travelled south saw Ayew hit the post with a header in the first half, before his brilliantly-taken second was scored after a lovely one-two with Rudy Gestede, who himself should have added a third but ballooned over from inside the box.\nBut after Cissokho was sent off for a professional foul on Ikechi Anya, Deeney powered his side to a dramatic victory and ensured the away side suffered the familiar feeling of defeat in a new and agonising manner.\nFollow reaction to this and all the day's other Premier League games\nRelive Watford v Aston Villa\nDeeney is Watford's (and Flores'?) saviour\nA defeat by Villa, just under a week after losing to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-finals, would have been hard for manager Quique Sanchez Flores to explain when he sits down to discuss his future at the end of the season.\nIf results go their way, the Hornets could finish as high as ninth in the table - a year on from their promotion from the Championship - but there is uncertainty over whether Spaniard Flores will keep his job.\nThis was Watford's second win in nine league games, and it was earned through two late moments of quality from Deeney after being outplayed for much of the afternoon.\nBen Watson cannoned against the bar with a volley before Villa took the lead and Abdi's equaliser was excellent - but in the second half, they were second best.\nHad Villa not been stretched by the sending off of left-back Cissokho, this result may have been very different.\nMan of the match - Troy Deeney (Watford)\nWhat they said\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"It was important because now mathematically we are [safe] in the Premier League and for Watford that is amazing.\n\"We deserved to win the match. We had control but we conceded two silly goals and had to work pretty hard. We have to fight against these sort of teams.\n\"The speculation [about my future] in many ways is not good for the players. The players always want to focus on the main target and the main target is the match.\n\"Speculation is not important. What was important was to be competitive.\"\nAston Villa caretaker-boss Eric Black: \"The players have been criticised, and justifiably so, but not today. Ultimately of course you need to win games but there was a lot to be encouraged by.\n\"It's a fantastic football club with fantastic supporters and maybe it's just one little step towards getting the supporters back on side.\n\"I thought the effort of the players was outstanding, they showed desire and hunger but the sending-off changes the whole context of the game.\n\"At 2-1 up, I thought we looked like the team who were going to score again. The key moment is the sending off.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford have secured two league wins in a single season against Aston Villa for the first time since 1969-70.\nTroy Deeney is the second Watford player to score over 10 Premier League goals (11), after Odion Ighalo managed it earlier this campaign (14).\nVilla have led in just eight Premier League games this season, winning just three of those matches (D2 L3).\nAlmen Abdi is the first Watford player to score directly from a free-kick in Premier League history.\nJordan Ayew scored away from home for the first time since December for the Villans.\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa play at home to Newcastle next Saturday, while Watford travel to Liverpool for their next match on Sunday."

Southampton sprayed the ball around with ease, particularly punishing their visitors on the counter-attack.\nCity had their moments; Raheem Sterling was denied from six yards thanks to a wonderful point-blank save by Fraser Forster with the score goalless, while Iheanacho halved the deficit as he took advantage of a woeful Cuco Martina clearance.\nThe 19-year-old Nigerian striker collected his second brilliantly from the edge of the box for a goal which suggests he has a bright future ahead.\nBut for the majority of the match, and the first half especially, Saints ran amok. Long twice caused City's backpedalling defence problems before he toe-poked Tadic's hooked byline cross into the near post.\nSaints had nine shots at goal in the opening 45 minutes, compared with City's three, and their second once again highlighted the visitors' lackadaisical approach to defending. The hosts burst forward at pace and the influential Tadic set Mane free to side-foot home.\nSouthampton's superiority deserved a greater lead, but early in the second half their two-goal advantage was restored just when City had threatened to change the momentum of the match.\nFonte headed Steven Davis' corner on to the crossbar and it was Mane who reacted quicker than anyone else, sticking his foot out from two yards.\nSouthampton continued to threaten. Virgil van Dijk forced Joe Hart into a fine save with an audacious scissors kick before Mane got his third to become the sixth player to score a Premier League hat-trick against City.\nMan of the Match - Sadio Mane\nWhat the managers said\nSouthampton boss Ronald Koeman: \"It was a great game - and maybe the best opening 45 minutes by us of the season. We scored some great goals.\n\"We created so many problems for them. The pace was the key to win the game. Sadio had a big impact in the result. We did an amazing job.\n\"We have a team of players really motivated and we like to play good football. We fight for Europe and that's what we like. Two games to go and we're still fighting for something.\"\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"I'm very frustrated because I didn't expect that performance, especially in defence. At least four of them [today's line-up] are not playing [regularly].\n\"I think we could've played on Saturday and named a stronger team, but in this case we had to prioritise Wednesday's game.\n\"The best way to prepare is to win but we couldn't do it.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSouthampton have scored four or more goals in consecutive Premier League games for the first time.\nManchester City have conceded four or more goals in three Premier League games this season, the most since the 00/01 campaign (4+ in six games).\nSadio Mane has scored seven goals in his last six Premier League games for Southampton; which comes after a run of 19 league appearances without scoring.\nKelechi Iheanacho has averaged a goal every 86.9 minutes in the Premier League this season. It's the best rate of any player who has scored two or more goals.\nDusan Tadic is only the fourth player to have have managed three or more assists in two different Premier League games (after Eyal Berkovic, Cesc Fabregas and Thierry Henry).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to Madrid on Wednesday for their Champions League second-leg semi-final tie against Real before a Premier League match against top-four rivals Arsenal on 8 May. Southampton will visit Tottenham on 8 May.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Arsenal 1-0 Norwich City\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger had to endure calls for his departure as his side beat a Norwich team whose Premier League future looks increasingly bleak.\nFans protested inside and outside Emirates Stadium, voicing frustration at their team's failure to mount a title challenge in recent years.\nThere was little for Arsenal to cheer until substitute Danny Welbeck put them ahead with a crisp half-volley.\nNorwich are two points from safety with three games left.\nThey had chances - twice Petr Cech stopped Nathan Redmond from scoring. But for all their endeavour, Norwich left north London with nothing and with Newcastle beating Crystal Palace and Sunderland securing a draw against Stoke earlier in the day, their hopes of survival appear slim.\nThe Canaries are second from bottom and two points behind Newcastle, who moved out of the bottom three thanks to their win over Palace.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\n'Arsenal fans should try supporting Newcastle and they wouldn't complain about Wenger'\nArsenal fans divided\nWenger and his players had been warned there would be a toxic atmosphere at the Emirates, and protests calling for the end of the Frenchman's 19-year tenure began outside the stadium.\nFans from the Arsenal Supporters' Trust, the Black Scarf Movement and Red Action handed out posters with the message 'time for change' and a minority held them up after 12 and 78 minutes - 12 being the number of years the club has gone without winning the league.\nVarious banners were held up, one saying 'Wenger - 12 years of excuses, Ranieri - 9 months, champions' in reference to Leicester's march towards the league title.\nStoking the flames this week were Wenger's pre-match comments - that fans had gone \"overboard\" with their criticisms, and that his team had played in \"a very difficult climate\" at home over recent months, contributing to their failure in the league.\nIn a divided stadium, there were those who supported their manager, singing \"there's only one Arsene Wenger\" in response to the 12th-minute protest. They would point to the six FA Cups, three league titles and 18 consecutive seasons of Champions League football the club have enjoyed under Wenger.\nVictory over Norwich moved them to third in the table, three points above Manchester City, and a step closer to securing another season in Europe's elite cup competition.\nArsenal lacking inspiration\nThere was little to unite the factions as the first half played out like the majority of Arsenal's games this year: plenty of possession, but little bite.\nFor the fourth time in their past nine home league games, Wenger's men failed to conjure a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nAt the other end of the pitch, and despite the visitors having just 30% of possession, Cech twice stopped Redmond from scoring, while a third effort from the striker before the break bounced just wide.\nIt was the 56th-minute introduction of Welbeck that turned the match in Arsenal's favour. The striker gave his team much-needed spark and, within three minutes of coming on, he placed Olivier Giroud's well-directed header into the bottom-left corner. Welbeck's goal came from his team's first shot on target.\nNorwich on the brink\nThe Canaries have won at Old Trafford, drawn at Anfield and Upton Park and held Arsenal at home this season so there was hope before this match, especially against a team who have collected just 10 points from their past seven home league games.\nArsenal were often uncomfortable defending Norwich's counter-attacks and had it not been for a well-timed Gabriel tackle on substitute Dieumerci Mbokani the visitors might have equalised.\nBut only relegated Aston Villa have lost more league games than Norwich this year and this defeat - their 11th in 15 league games - leaves them heading in the wrong direction.\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"We were warned about the protestors. You want to make the fans happy. I'm sorry if I don't achieve it. I'm irritated and frustrated if I cannot keep people happy. I have respect for the club and gave so much for the club. I want to make people happy.\n\"Our job is to do the best. I think this season we hoped that we could win the league. It didn't happen and that's why people are frustrated. I can share that frustration. The aim is to come back and do what is needed to do it next year. The last three years the club has moved forward.\"\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"Our gameplan worked really well. Petr Cech made three or four good saves. There was a five-minute spell when we were stretched and Arsenal managed to score in that spell.\n\"The last thing you can do down in the dogfight is feel sorry for yourselves. We didn't get what we deserved. We need three displays like that in the next three games. If you start worrying about the maths and what other people are doing then it'll drive you crazy.\"\nWhat next?\nTwo of Norwich's remaining three league games are at Carrow Road, against Manchester United (7 May) and Watford (11 May). They desperately need to secure points at home if they are to go to Everton's Goodison Park on the last day of the season with hopes of survival still alive.\nThe Gunners have two games to play - against fourth-placed Manchester City and relegated Villa.\nThe stats you need to know\nDanny Welbeck has equalled his Premier League goal tally from last season for Arsenal (4) but has played 10 games this season compared with 25 last campaign.\nOnly Mesut Ozil (18) has more assists in the Premier League than Olivier Giroud (5) for Arsenal this season.\nNo side has kept fewer clean sheets than Norwich in the Premier League this season (5, level with Villa).\nArsenal are unbeaten in eight Premier League matches (W4 D4) with only West Ham (10) and Leicester (9) on longer unbeaten runs than the Gunners.\nArsene Wenger's side have kept three clean in a row in the Premier League for the first time since September 2015."

Well, we started well for 20 minutes - it was like we were on fire, with the whole game being played in front of the Swansea goal. But Swansea have players who are capable of hurting you, and from nothing we conceded the first and second goals. We started losing out on balls in the middle of the park.\n\"I'm not that disappointed with our play with the ball, but without the ball we had too many passengers, relying on someone else to get the ball and play it to me in a good position.\n\"The bottom line is Swansea deserved it, and it's been a shock for us. We had a chance to qualify for the Champions League, but I have always said the gap I was focused on was the smaller one below us with Southampton and Liverpool. We really want to finish as high as possible and to achieve that we have to react in these final two games.\"\nSwansea manager Francesco Guidolin: \"I am very happy for my players, and I am very, very happy because we played very well.\n\"West Ham started very strongly and it was very difficult for us, but I don't think they played with pressure because West Ham's season has been very good. They are one of the best teams in the league this year.\n\"Our season is not finished and my team is not on the beach. We showed this in recent weeks against both Liverpool and now West Ham, and I hope also against Manchester City.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea City scored more than three goals in an away Premier League game for the first time since August 2012 vs QPR (5-0).\nAndre Ayew has scored as many goals in his past two Premier League games (3) as he had in his previous 21 combined.\nKi Sung-yueng scored his first league goal since Boxing Day 2015, ending a run of 11 games without a goal for the Swans.\nWest Ham ended a run of seven straight games in which they had scored at least twice.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham play Manchester United on Tuesday in the Boleyn Ground's final game, while Swansea's final match against Manchester City takes place next Sunday.",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Norwich City 0-1 Manchester United\nNorwich City's chances of avoiding relegation seem increasingly dismal after a home defeat by Champions League-chasing Manchester United.\nIt was a match low on chances, but the win moves United to within one point of Manchester City, who are fourth.\nWith the score goalless, Cameron Jerome had Norwich's best chance only for David de Gea to save his header.\nA mistake by Sebastien Bassong allowed Wayne Rooney to race clear and find the supporting Juan Mata, who slotted in.\nDefeat left Norwich second from bottom, four points behind Sunderland, who beat Chelsea 3-2, and three adrift of a Newcastle side who drew with relegated Aston Villa.\nOne more victory for Sunderland will secure their Premier League status and seal the fates of both Norwich and Newcastle.\nFor Manchester United, the prospect of playing in next season's Champions League remains achievable.\nManchester City host Arsenal on Sunday and anything other than victory for Manuel Pellegrini's side would put United's bid for a top-four finish in their own hands.\nFollow live coverage of the rest of the Premier League games\nRelive Manchester United's victory over Norwich\nUnited fail to impress again\nThe visitors controlled the majority of the match, but their attacks lacked zip and imagination, a complaint often made this season by critics of Louis van Gaal's tactics.\nUnited had more than 60% of possession in the first 20 minutes, but failed to muster a shot on target. By half-time, a tame long-distance strike from Jesse Lingard was their only effort on target, while Chris Smalling had headed over from three yards out.\nThe Red Devils ended the match having had more than 67% of possession but just two shots on target. It is unlikely West Ham's defence will be as generous as Norwich when Van Gaal's men visit on Tuesday.\nOf further concern was Wayne Rooney's role. The captain was a peripheral figure for much of the first half - indeed the only visiting player to have fewer touches than him in the opening 45 minutes was Matteo Darmian, who was substituted after 12 minutes because of injury.\nThe England international did improve after the break, and it was his tenacity that allowed Mata to score a goal that could prove to be crucial to their Champions League hopes.\nAnd it was a victory achieved despite Van Gaal having to make a late change to his line-up, moving Rooney up front and promoting Ander Herrera to midfield, after Anthony Martial was injured during the warm-up.\nMissed chances, bad mistakes\nCheered on by their vociferous supporters, Norwich began the match with energy. They were organised in defence and effective in pressing their visitors, but as the match progressed their players tired and their style of play became increasingly ineffective.\nScoring has been a problem for the Canaries throughout the season, which is why they are facing a return to the Championship, and so it proved again.\nHad Jerome headed either side of De Gea from six yards, the brilliant Spaniard may not have been able to prevent the hosts from taking the lead, but the chance was squandered.\nAlex Neil changed tactics in the 60th minute, bringing on joint-top scorer Dieumerci Mbokani to aid Jerome in a two-man attack, and while his side managed to loosen United's stranglehold they continued to be profligate, and were made to pay.\nMbokani mistimed a header from 12 yards and Gary O'Neil should have done better than to wildly swing the ball into the stands when Cameron Borthwick-Jackson headed the ball into his path.\nThey were missed opportunities made all the more galling when Bassong failed to clear near the edge of his box and Rooney nicked possession. The England captain held the ball up and fed the supporting Mata, who was allowed to run 30 yards unchallenged by the equally culpable Martin Olsson.\nMan of the match - Juan Mata\nWhat the managers said\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I said to the boys, we have to win, there is no excuse. We have won and it was more than deserved. We keep the pressure on our competitors and I am a happy manager.\n\"They were also fighting and pressing and it makes it difficult. The second half we did much better because we kept the ball and had more than one chance.\n\"We have seen this team can manage injuries. Away games are difficult for us and we changed the results by winning here. I hope we can see something between Man City and Arsenal that helps us.\"\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"The players tried as hard as they could but they make a silly error and it costs us the game.\n\"We had a chance with Cameron Jerome's header, but there were not many chances in the game. We had good shape but we could not create as much as we would have liked.\n\"The best teams get the goal when they are on top and ride the pressure. We made an error and it costs us. It is going to be tough, we are relying on other teams but we have got two more games.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJuan Mata has scored more Premier League goals against Norwich City than any other opponent (five).\nWayne Rooney is now joint-third for assists in Premier League history (95, level with Cesc Fabregas).\nNorwich City have won just one of their past eight Premier League matches at Carrow Road (W1 D2 L5).\nManchester United have lost only once in their past seven in the Premier League (W5 D1).\nThe Canaries have won just two of their previous eight home Premier League games versus United (L6).\nWhat next?\nNorwich have two games remaining, at home to Watford on 11 May, followed by a trip to Everton's Goodison Park on the final day of the season. Manchester United visit West Ham on 10 May before hosting Bournemouth next Sunday."

        "bbc_article_home_team_last_match": "Norwich City 0-1 Manchester United\nNorwich City's chances of avoiding relegation seem increasingly dismal after a home defeat by Champions League-chasing Manchester United.\nIt was a match low on chances, but the win moves United to within one point of Manchester City, who are fourth.\nWith the score goalless, Cameron Jerome had Norwich's best chance only for David de Gea to save his header.\nA mistake by Sebastien Bassong allowed Wayne Rooney to race clear and find the supporting Juan Mata, who slotted in.\nDefeat left Norwich second from bottom, four points behind Sunderland, who beat Chelsea 3-2, and three adrift of a Newcastle side who drew with relegated Aston Villa.\nOne more victory for Sunderland will secure their Premier League status and seal the fates of both Norwich and Newcastle.\nFor Manchester United, the prospect of playing in next season's Champions League remains achievable.\nManchester City host Arsenal on Sunday and anything other than victory for Manuel Pellegrini's side would put United's bid for a top-four finish in their own hands.\nFollow live coverage of the rest of the Premier League games\nRelive Manchester United's victory over Norwich\nUnited fail to impress again\nThe visitors controlled the majority of the match, but their attacks lacked zip and imagination, a complaint often made this season by critics of Louis van Gaal's tactics.\nUnited had more than 60% of possession in the first 20 minutes, but failed to muster a shot on target. By half-time, a tame long-distance strike from Jesse Lingard was their only effort on target, while Chris Smalling had headed over from three yards out.\nThe Red Devils ended the match having had more than 67% of possession but just two shots on target. It is unlikely West Ham's defence will be as generous as Norwich when Van Gaal's men visit on Tuesday.\nOf further concern was Wayne Rooney's role. The captain was a peripheral figure for much of the first half - indeed the only visiting player to have fewer touches than him in the opening 45 minutes was Matteo Darmian, who was substituted after 12 minutes because of injury.\nThe England international did improve after the break, and it was his tenacity that allowed Mata to score a goal that could prove to be crucial to their Champions League hopes.\nAnd it was a victory achieved despite Van Gaal having to make a late change to his line-up, moving Rooney up front and promoting Ander Herrera to midfield, after Anthony Martial was injured during the warm-up.\nMissed chances, bad mistakes\nCheered on by their vociferous supporters, Norwich began the match with energy. They were organised in defence and effective in pressing their visitors, but as the match progressed their players tired and their style of play became increasingly ineffective.\nScoring has been a problem for the Canaries throughout the season, which is why they are facing a return to the Championship, and so it proved again.\nHad Jerome headed either side of De Gea from six yards, the brilliant Spaniard may not have been able to prevent the hosts from taking the lead, but the chance was squandered.\nAlex Neil changed tactics in the 60th minute, bringing on joint-top scorer Dieumerci Mbokani to aid Jerome in a two-man attack, and while his side managed to loosen United's stranglehold they continued to be profligate, and were made to pay.\nMbokani mistimed a header from 12 yards and Gary O'Neil should have done better than to wildly swing the ball into the stands when Cameron Borthwick-Jackson headed the ball into his path.\nThey were missed opportunities made all the more galling when Bassong failed to clear near the edge of his box and Rooney nicked possession. The England captain held the ball up and fed the supporting Mata, who was allowed to run 30 yards unchallenged by the equally culpable Martin Olsson.\nMan of the match - Juan Mata\nWhat the managers said\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal: \"I said to the boys, we have to win, there is no excuse. We have won and it was more than deserved. We keep the pressure on our competitors and I am a happy manager.\n\"They were also fighting and pressing and it makes it difficult. The second half we did much better because we kept the ball and had more than one chance.\n\"We have seen this team can manage injuries. Away games are difficult for us and we changed the results by winning here. I hope we can see something between Man City and Arsenal that helps us.\"\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"The players tried as hard as they could but they make a silly error and it costs us the game.\n\"We had a chance with Cameron Jerome's header, but there were not many chances in the game. We had good shape but we could not create as much as we would have liked.\n\"The best teams get the goal when they are on top and ride the pressure. We made an error and it costs us. It is going to be tough, we are relying on other teams but we have got two more games.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJuan Mata has scored more Premier League goals against Norwich City than any other opponent (five).\nWayne Rooney is now joint-third for assists in Premier League history (95, level with Cesc Fabregas).\nNorwich City have won just one of their past eight Premier League matches at Carrow Road (W1 D2 L5).\nManchester United have lost only once in their past seven in the Premier League (W5 D1).\nThe Canaries have won just two of their previous eight home Premier League games versus United (L6).\nWhat next?\nNorwich have two games remaining, at home to Watford on 11 May, followed by a trip to Everton's Goodison Park on the final day of the season. Manchester United visit West Ham on 10 May before hosting Bournemouth next Sunday.",

        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Leicester City 3-1 Everton\nChampions Leicester comfortably beat Everton before being presented with the Premier League trophy during a day of celebrations at the King Power Stadium.\nJamie Vardy scored twice but missed out on a hat-trick by blazing a second penalty over the bar.\nCity's longest-serving player Andy King was also on the score-sheet with Kevin Mirallas netting Everton's consolation.\nBut this was almost a sideshow to the festivities for the Foxes' first top-flight title in their 132-year history.\nThe celebrations included a pre-match performance from Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli in front of a sold-out stadium bedecked in banners declaring the club's new status as champions of England.\nAnd then, once the game had finished, came the moment all connected with the club had been waiting for - the lifting of the Premier League trophy.\nIt was held aloft by captain Wes Morgan and manager Claudio Ranieri to a rapturous response from those inside the King Power Stadium and thousands more who had gathered outside the ground.\nCelebration time\nSaturday afternoon was billed as a title party, but for most inside the stadium the celebrations have been ongoing since Tottenham's draw at Chelsea confirmed the Foxes as the most remarkable of Premier League winners.\nThe City players themselves only returned to training for this fixture on Thursday after being given an extra day off to revel in their stunning triumph and presumably to fully recover from a rowdy Monday night at Jamie Vardy's house.\nFrom the moment they emerged for their pre-match warm-up, they were cheered to the rafters by supporters who had begun to mass in the stadium hours earlier to enjoy a beer on the club and revel in its greatest moment.\nSo keen were the home fans to show their appreciation to Ranieri and his side that the Italian was forced to quieten them for the performance of Nessun Dorma by compatriot Bocelli, who received a huge ovation when he removed his tracksuit top to reveal a Leicester shirt beneath bearing his name.\nBut despite the carnival atmosphere and a guard of honour from their opponents there was no complacency from the Foxes, who provided a fast-paced and committed finale befitting the side with the best home record in the division.\nJamie Vardy's having a party\nIf the rumoured Hollywood film of Vardy's life does come to pass it now has a superb ending, although it came within a few yards of the perfect denouement.\nHaving missed the last two games through suspension, the 29-year-old England striker returned to the starting XI and made an instant impact, scoring with what was his first meaningful touch to steer in from King's chipped delivery.\nA constant menace to the Everton defence, his second came from the spot after he had been tripped by Matthew Pennington.\nBut with a dream scenario beckoning after Darron Gibson had clattered into Jeffrey Schlupp in the box, Vardy blasted his hat-trick chance high over the Everton bar from the spot.\nWith 24 goals for the season, Vardy is now one behind Tottenham's Harry Kane in the race to be Premier League top-scorer, although he has now had a hand in more top-flight goals this season than any other player (30).\nLong live the King\nMidfielder King is a one-club man, the longest serving member of the Leicester squad and sole survivor of the side that won promotion from League One in 2009.\nHis 334th career appearance only came about because of Danny Drinkwater's suspension, but the 27-year-old illustrated the reasons for his Foxes longevity with a dynamic and influential display.\nAfter setting up the opener he was perfectly placed to latch on to a loose ball, following Riyad Mahrez's mazy run down the right, and fire his side into a commanding lead.\nThe goal was significant for another reason, as it took Leicester's all-time league goal difference to +1 - an apt time to go into the black.\nEverton firmly in the background\nGiven the context of the day Everton were always in danger of being totally overshadowed, especially as they have little left to play for this season.\nBut while the Toffees may not have needed Saturday's points, their under-pressure manager Roberto Martinez was in dire need of a proud and professional performance from his side.\nHowever, they were far too accommodating of their opponents in the first half, essentially extending their pre-match guard of honour to allow City a match-winning hold on the game before the break.\nThey rallied slightly early in the second half, with Oumar Niasse and Romelu Lukaku drawing good saves from Kaspar Schmeichel.\nBut when Mirallas scored a superb solo goal, which saw him run from the halfway line before beating Schmeichel in the 87th minute, many of the visiting side already seemed to be eyeing a swift exit to allow the Leicester party to get under way.\nMan of the match - Andy King (Leicester)\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester have taken 13 penalties this season; only one other side has taken as many in a Premier League season (Crystal Palace in 2004-05).\nLeighton Baines made his 350th Premier League appearance.\nThe Foxes attempted 33 shots (including blocks) against Everton, which is their highest total against any opponent in the Premier League this season.\nTwo of Kevin Mirallas' three Premier League goals this season have come against Leicester.\nJamie Vardy has scored the opening goal of the game 12 times in the Premier League this season, more than any other player.\nWhat next?\nLeicester end their season with a trip to the team they have just deposed as Premier League champions, Chelsea.\nEverton have two Premier League games remaining - away at Sunderland on Wednesday before a final-day home game against Norwich next Sunday."

Sunderland won, so all we can do now is wait for the score of their game on Wednesday and try to win our game.\n\"We were a little bit anxious in the first half.

Midfielder Mario Suarez struggled badly, while keeper Heurelho Gomes was beaten at the near post for Norwich's opener.\nThe third goal was a calamity of errors as Allan Nyom slipped while trying to incept the ball, as Cathcart followed up Wes Hoolahan's cross by poking into his own net.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond\nWhat they said:\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"It is severe disappointment. The story for us is that, as a club, we have dropped short for a variety of reasons. We have made vital errors in games at crucial times and the recruitment has not been as good to strengthen the squad.\n\"I am here to do a job, the club will be bigger than me and I am not fearing for my job.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"If we didn't worked really hard in the season then we may have been in Norwich's position. The level between Norwich and Watford is not too much. We recognise we have a good season.\n\"We will resolve my situation very quickly. We have enjoyed the season and the teams at the bottom have fought very hard recently. We didn't have that pressure.\"\nWhat next?\nNorwich have just pride to play for on Sunday at Everton, while Watford will look to end the season on a high at home to Sunderland (both at 15:00 BST).\nThe stats you need to know:\nNorwich have been relegated from the Premier League for the fourth time - only Crystal Palace have been relegated as many times\nDieumerci Mbokani is Norwich's top scorer this season with seven goals, with Nathan Redmond one behind on six\nTroy Deeney has provided an assist for Odion Ighalo seven times this season, a league high along with Dele Alli to Harry Kane for Tottenham",
        "bbc_article_away_team_last_match": "Sunderland 3-0 Everton\nSunderland sealed their Premier League safety and relegated Norwich and local rivals Newcastle with a comprehensive victory over Everton.\nDefender Lamine Kone struck twice from close range after Patrick van Aanholt scored with a 25-yard free-kick that was misjudged by keeper Joel Robles.\nVictory capped an impressive revival by Sam Allardyce's side, who have lost only two of their past 13 games.\nEverton were dire, heaping more pressure on boss Roberto Martinez.\nThe Toffees have picked up only six points from their past 10 league matches and the Spaniard is likely to face an uncomfortable final game of the season in front of disgruntled crowd at Goodison Park.\nIn contrast, Allardyce will be able to take his side to Watford on Sunday unburdened by the relegation fears that have surrounded the club since his appointment in October.\nTheir victory leaves them four points ahead of both Newcastle and Norwich with just one game to play.\nClubs react to the end of the relegation battle\nRelive the action from the Stadium of Light\nWhat next for relegated Newcastle?\nBig Sam the saviour\nSunderland's survival was built on several key decisions this season, none more significant than the appointment of Allardyce after Dick Advocaat resigned following eight games without a win to start the campaign.\nHardened to the fight from his experiences at Bolton and Blackburn and with time on his side, the 61-year-old has steadily built a disciplined and spirited side, sprinkled with match-winners.\nIt has not always been smooth sailing - notably during a five-game losing streak at the end of last year - but since February they have been more consistent and possessed far greater fight than their main relegation rivals.\nThey exemplified this once again on Wednesday with another display full of endeavour in front of a vociferous home crowd, who chanted their manager's name throughout a lap of honour after the game.\nKone excels from back to front\nSunderland can also credit their survival in part to the signings Allardyce made in January.\nKone, Jan Kirchhoff, Wahbi Khazri and, to a lesser extent, Dame N'Doye have integrated superbly with the talent already at the club to help transform a struggling side into an effective and, at times, exciting one.\nIt was Kone who shone on Wednesday, forming one part of a solid centre-back pairing with Younes Kaboul at one end of the pitch and the most unlikely of predators at the other.\nThe 27-year-old was without a goal in 13 Premier League appearances for the Black Cats heading into this match but showed the instincts of a seasoned goalscorer when he lashed home a volley from close range after Everton failed to clear a corner.\nHis second goal was a much simpler finish, from near point-blank range after Robles palmed Khazri's near-post corner on to the back of team-mate James McCarthy.\nIt was a costly second error from the keeper, who had inexplicably moved to his left to allow Van Aanholt's free-kick to go into the centre of the net, but the goal was no less than the home side deserved for their dominant display.\nEverton surrender again\nTwice in the space of four days, the travelling Everton fans - and those watching on television - have had to endure their side tamely surrendering a match to a hungrier opponent.\nThe Toffees may not have anything to play for, but their displays at Leicester on Sunday and Sunderland on Wednesday will do little to appease the growing opposition to Martinez's managerial reign.\nThere was an abundance of talent in the starting XI at the Stadium of Light but none of the players performed anywhere near their potential.\nDespite dominating possession for large parts of the match - particularly in the first half - it was only in the last 10 minutes that Everton truly threatened as Kevin Mirallas twice went close and Romelu Lukaku thundered a shot from close range against the bar.\nHaving witnessed wild celebrations from opposition fans at the end of their past two games, it will be interesting to see what reception Everton supporters give Martinez and his players after Sunday's season finale at Goodison Park.\nMan of the match - Lamine Kone (Sunderland)\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland have extended their Premier League stay to 10 consecutive seasons, last playing outside the top flight in 2006-07\nSunderland were in the relegation zone for 237 days this season but have survived; Aston Villa will have been in the relegation zone 233 days by the end of the season\nThe Black Cats have scored four goals directly from free-kicks in the Premier League this season, joint highest with Chelsea and West Ham\nThis was the first time that two Sunderland defenders have scored in the same game since December 2013 (John O'Shea and Phil Bardsley v Chelsea).\nEverton have conceded three goals in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since November 2009\nSunderland have named the same starting XI for the last seven games, something they had never done before in the Premier League\nEverton's Gareth Barry has now made more starts (572) than any other Premier League player, surpassing goalkeeper David James\nWhat next?\nOn the final day of the season on Sunday, Sunderland travel to Watford, while Everton host Norwich."

Domestic underachiever in some eyes, European pioneer in others.\nCity were well placed to win a second Premier League title in three seasons when the affable Chilean announced on 1 February that he would be replaced by Pep Guardiola at the end of the season.\nSince then the Blues have won only six of their 14 league matches, meaning Guardiola could arrive from Bayern Munich without Champions League football to plan for.\nPellegrini has led City to League Cup victory this season and taken them into the Champions League semi-final. But the solemn expression of chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak at the final whistle said everything - finishing fifth is not acceptable for the club's mega-rich Abu Dhabi owners.\nArsenal close in on Champions League\nFollowing second-placed Tottenham's 2-1 home defeat by Southampton earlier on Sunday, Arsenal knew victory would move them level with their arch-rivals going into the final weekend.\nArsene Wenger's side were unable to take all three points, but they showed character to fight back twice against top-four rivals City.\nThe Blues produced a lively attacking performance after being criticised for a laboured display in their narrow second-leg defeat at Real Madrid on Wednesday.\nPellegrini's side deservedly led when Aguero found space to turn and drill in from the edge of the area.\nA defensive mix-up between Joe Hart and Gael Clichy conceded the corner from which Giroud equalised with a header, but De Bruyne's run and precise finish edged City back in front.\nThe home side threatened a third before Arsenal fought back to earn a deserved point through Sanchez's clinical strike from 15 yards.\nDespite missing the chance to rein in Spurs, Wenger was satisfied with a point that puts them on the verge of Champions League football.\nOnly a shock loss against Villa, coupled with City and Manchester United taking maximum points in their remaining games, would see the Gunners finish fifth.\nMixed injury news for England (and Arsenal)\nEngland manager Roy Hodgson was not present at the Etihad, having watched Spurs' 2-1 defeat by Southampton at White Hart Lane instead.\nHodgson will have been concerned to see television pictures of Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck - a trusted member of his squad - limp off midway through the first half with a knee injury.\nBut, consequently, there was some positive news for Hodgson for Euro 2016.\nManchester-born Welbeck was replaced by midfielder Jack Wilshere, who made only his second substitute appearance of the season after his own 10-month injury absence.\nWilshere, 24, showed signs of his undoubted ability, topping Arsenal's passing accuracy statistics, as well as - perhaps unwisely - launching into a couple of tigerish tackles.\n\"For me, 70 minutes - playing with high intensity and pressure - was great,\" he said.\n\"I don't want the season to end. I feel good and fresh so I will see what happens after that.\"\nListen to the best bits of the match action via BBC Radio 5 live.\nAlso, catch the Football Daily podcast as Mark Pougatch presents reaction to this and the day's other Premier League results.\nWhat they said\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini:\n\"We should have won that game, and I think we deserved it. We played very well. Our first 25 minutes were some of the best here this season. But Arsenal's goals were good.\n\"The effort, speed and character was good, and we were playing against a very good team.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger:\n\"I am not disappointed because twice we were losing and twice we came back.

I thought the reaction was brilliant. The Villa fans have got a big part to play in getting this club back to the Premier League.\n\"It has been difficult to play in a relegation battle, but we have got some outstanding footballers and I thought we coped with them today.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez: \"We are disappointed. Sunderland won, so all we can do now is wait for the score of their game on Wednesday and try to win our game.\n\"We were a little bit anxious in the first half. We were not comfortable in possession. You have to take your chances and we didn't do that.\n\"We had to change things in the second half. We did that, but it was not enough..\"\nWhat next?\nNewcastle end their season at home to Tottenham on 15 May, the same day that Villa bow out of the Premier League at Arsenal.\nWe've got a new BBC Sport newsletter coming soon - to receive it from the start, sign up here.\n, external"

Aston Villa will have been in the relegation zone 233 days by the end of the season\nThe Black Cats have scored four goals directly from free-kicks in the Premier League this season, joint highest with Chelsea and West Ham\nThis was the first time that two Sunderland defenders have scored in the same game since December 2013 (John O'Shea and Phil Bardsley v Chelsea).\nEverton have conceded three goals in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since November 2009\nSunderland have named the same starting XI for the last seven games, something they had never done before in the Premier League\nEverton's Gareth Barry has now made more starts (572) than any other Premier League player, surpassing goalkeeper David James\nWhat next?\nOn the final day of the season on Sunday, Sunderland travel to Watford, while Everton host Norwich.",

Midfielder Mario Suarez struggled badly, while keeper Heurelho Gomes was beaten at the near post for Norwich's opener.\nThe third goal was a calamity of errors as Allan Nyom slipped while trying to incept the ball, as Cathcart followed up Wes Hoolahan's cross by poking into his own net.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond\nWhat they said:\nNorwich boss Alex Neil: \"It is severe disappointment. The story for us is that, as a club, we have dropped short for a variety of reasons. We have made vital errors in games at crucial times and the recruitment has not been as good to strengthen the squad.\n\"I am here to do a job, the club will be bigger than me and I am not fearing for my job.\"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: \"If we didn't worked really hard in the season then we may have been in Norwich's position. The level between Norwich and Watford is not too much. We recognise we have a good season.\n\"We will resolve my situation very quickly. We have enjoyed the season and the teams at the bottom have fought very hard recently. We didn't have that pressure.\"\nWhat next?\nNorwich have just pride to play for on Sunday at Everton, while Watford will look to end the season on a high at home to Sunderland (both at 15:00 BST).\nThe stats you need to know:\nNorwich have been relegated from the Premier League for the fourth time - only Crystal Palace have been relegated as many times\nDieumerci Mbokani is Norwich's top scorer this season with seven goals, with Nathan Redmond one behind on six\nTroy Deeney has provided an assist for Odion Ighalo seven times this season, a league high along with Dele Alli to Harry Kane for Tottenham"

the lifting of the Premier League trophy.\nIt was held aloft by captain Wes Morgan and manager Claudio Ranieri to a rapturous response from those inside the King Power Stadium and thousands more who had gathered outside the ground.\nCelebration time\nSaturday afternoon was billed as a title party, but for most inside the stadium the celebrations have been ongoing since Tottenham's draw at Chelsea confirmed the Foxes as the most remarkable of Premier League winners.\nThe City players themselves only returned to training for this fixture on Thursday after being given an extra day off to revel in their stunning triumph and presumably to fully recover from a rowdy Monday night at Jamie Vardy's house.\nFrom the moment they emerged for their pre-match warm-up, they were cheered to the rafters by supporters who had begun to mass in the stadium hours earlier to enjoy a beer on the club and revel in its greatest moment.\nSo keen were the home fans to show their appreciation to Ranieri and his side that the Italian was forced to quieten them for the performance of Nessun Dorma by compatriot Bocelli, who received a huge ovation when he removed his tracksuit top to reveal a Leicester shirt beneath bearing his name.\nBut despite the carnival atmosphere and a guard of honour from their opponents there was no complacency from the Foxes, who provided a fast-paced and committed finale befitting the side with the best home record in the division.\nJamie Vardy's having a party\nIf the rumoured Hollywood film of Vardy's life does come to pass it now has a superb ending, although it came within a few yards of the perfect denouement.\nHaving missed the last two games through suspension, the 29-year-old England striker returned to the starting XI and made an instant impact, scoring with what was his first meaningful touch to steer in from King's chipped delivery.\nA constant menace to the Everton defence, his second came from the spot after he had been tripped by Matthew Pennington.\nBut with a dream scenario beckoning after Darron Gibson had clattered into Jeffrey Schlupp in the box, Vardy blasted his hat-trick chance high over the Everton bar from the spot.\nWith 24 goals for the season, Vardy is now one behind Tottenham's Harry Kane in the race to be Premier League top-scorer, although he has now had a hand in more top-flight goals this season than any other player (30).\nLong live the King\nMidfielder King is a one-club man, the longest serving member of the Leicester squad and sole survivor of the side that won promotion from League One in 2009.\nHis 334th career appearance only came about because of Danny Drinkwater's suspension, but the 27-year-old illustrated the reasons for his Foxes longevity with a dynamic and influential display.\nAfter setting up the opener he was perfectly placed to latch on to a loose ball, following Riyad Mahrez's mazy run down the right, and fire his side into a commanding lead.\nThe goal was significant for another reason, as it took Leicester's all-time league goal difference to +1 - an apt time to go into the black.\nEverton firmly in the background\nGiven the context of the day Everton were always in danger of being totally overshadowed, especially as they have little left to play for this season.\nBut while the Toffees may not have needed Saturday's points, their under-pressure manager Roberto Martinez was in dire need of a proud and professional performance from his side.\nHowever, they were far too accommodating of their opponents in the first half, essentially extending their pre-match guard of honour to allow City a match-winning hold on the game before the break.\nThey rallied slightly early in the second half, with Oumar Niasse and Romelu Lukaku drawing good saves from Kaspar Schmeichel.\nBut when Mirallas scored a superb solo goal, which saw him run from the halfway line before beating Schmeichel in the 87th minute, many of the visiting side already seemed to be eyeing a swift exit to allow the Leicester party to get under way.\nMan of the match - Andy King (Leicester)\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester have taken 13 penalties this season; only one other side has taken as many in a Premier League season (Crystal Palace in 2004-05).\nLeighton Baines made his 350th Premier League appearance.\nThe Foxes attempted 33 shots (including blocks) against Everton, which is their highest total against any opponent in the Premier League this season.\nTwo of Kevin Mirallas' three Premier League goals this season have come against Leicester.\nJamie Vardy has scored the opening goal of the game 12 times in the Premier League this season, more than any other player.\nWhat next?\nLeicester end their season with a trip to the team they have just deposed as Premier League champions, Chelsea.\nEverton have two Premier League games remaining - away at Sunderland on Wednesday before a final-day home game against Norwich next Sunday."

In the second half we were much improved and I thought we deserved the equaliser.\n\"I'm slightly disappointed with elements of the performance, but overall you have to reflect on the season and it's been a great effort by the players.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We're disappointed, the players have worked so hard.

He had to suffer a lot with injuries this year but I'm very happy he's back.\n\"The players showed they love to play football.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSix of Christian Benteke's nine Premier League goals for Liverpool have been as a substitute - more than any other player has managed this season in the league.\nLiverpool have scored in their past 13 Premier League fixtures.\nChelsea have kept just one clean sheet in their past 12 Premier League meetings with Liverpool.\nBenteke's late goal means Chelsea are winless in three Premier League games for the first time in either of Guus Hiddink's spells at the club.\nWhat's next?\nThe final day on Sunday sees Liverpool travel to the Hawthorns to face West Brom and Chelsea host champions Leicester."

It's difficult as we have got one eye on the FA Cup final.\n\"We needed to make sure we got a win for home fans and second half we were great and had numerous chances.\n\"I said to him [Dwight Gayle] at half-time that I thought he was our best player.

Well, we started well for 20 minutes - it was like we were on fire, with the whole game being played in front of the Swansea goal. But Swansea have players who are capable of hurting you, and from nothing we conceded the first and second goals. We started losing out on balls in the middle of the park.\n\"I'm not that disappointed with our play with the ball, but without the ball we had too many passengers, relying on someone else to get the ball and play it to me in a good position.\n\"The bottom line is Swansea deserved it, and it's been a shock for us. We had a chance to qualify for the Champions League, but I have always said the gap I was focused on was the smaller one below us with Southampton and Liverpool. We really want to finish as high as possible and to achieve that we have to react in these final two games.\"\nSwansea manager Francesco Guidolin: \"I am very happy for my players, and I am very, very happy because we played very well.\n\"West Ham started very strongly and it was very difficult for us, but I don't think they played with pressure because West Ham's season has been very good. They are one of the best teams in the league this year.\n\"Our season is not finished and my team is not on the beach. We showed this in recent weeks against both Liverpool and now West Ham, and I hope also against Manchester City.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSwansea City scored more than three goals in an away Premier League game for the first time since August 2012 vs QPR (5-0).\nAndre Ayew has scored as many goals in his past two Premier League games (3) as he had in his previous 21 combined.\nKi Sung-yueng scored his first league goal since Boxing Day 2015, ending a run of 11 games without a goal for the Swans.\nWest Ham ended a run of seven straight games in which they had scored at least twice.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham play Manchester United on Tuesday in the Boleyn Ground's final game, while Swansea's final match against Manchester City takes place next Sunday.",

Domestic underachiever in some eyes, European pioneer in others.\nCity were well placed to win a second Premier League title in three seasons when the affable Chilean announced on 1 February that he would be replaced by Pep Guardiola at the end of the season.\nSince then the Blues have won only six of their 14 league matches, meaning Guardiola could arrive from Bayern Munich without Champions League football to plan for.\nPellegrini has led City to League Cup victory this season and taken them into the Champions League semi-final. But the solemn expression of chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak at the final whistle said everything - finishing fifth is not acceptable for the club's mega-rich Abu Dhabi owners.\nArsenal close in on Champions League\nFollowing second-placed Tottenham's 2-1 home defeat by Southampton earlier on Sunday, Arsenal knew victory would move them level with their arch-rivals going into the final weekend.\nArsene Wenger's side were unable to take all three points, but they showed character to fight back twice against top-four rivals City.\nThe Blues produced a lively attacking performance after being criticised for a laboured display in their narrow second-leg defeat at Real Madrid on Wednesday.\nPellegrini's side deservedly led when Aguero found space to turn and drill in from the edge of the area.\nA defensive mix-up between Joe Hart and Gael Clichy conceded the corner from which Giroud equalised with a header, but De Bruyne's run and precise finish edged City back in front.\nThe home side threatened a third before Arsenal fought back to earn a deserved point through Sanchez's clinical strike from 15 yards.\nDespite missing the chance to rein in Spurs, Wenger was satisfied with a point that puts them on the verge of Champions League football.\nOnly a shock loss against Villa, coupled with City and Manchester United taking maximum points in their remaining games, would see the Gunners finish fifth.\nMixed injury news for England (and Arsenal)\nEngland manager Roy Hodgson was not present at the Etihad, having watched Spurs' 2-1 defeat by Southampton at White Hart Lane instead.\nHodgson will have been concerned to see television pictures of Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck - a trusted member of his squad - limp off midway through the first half with a knee injury.\nBut, consequently, there was some positive news for Hodgson for Euro 2016.\nManchester-born Welbeck was replaced by midfielder Jack Wilshere, who made only his second substitute appearance of the season after his own 10-month injury absence.\nWilshere, 24, showed signs of his undoubted ability, topping Arsenal's passing accuracy statistics, as well as - perhaps unwisely - launching into a couple of tigerish tackles.\n\"For me, 70 minutes - playing with high intensity and pressure - was great,\" he said.\n\"I don't want the season to end. I feel good and fresh so I will see what happens after that.\"\nListen to the best bits of the match action via BBC Radio 5 live.\nAlso, catch the Football Daily podcast as Mark Pougatch presents reaction to this and the day's other Premier League results.\nWhat they said\nManchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini:\n\"We should have won that game, and I think we deserved it. We played very well. Our first 25 minutes were some of the best here this season. But Arsenal's goals were good.\n\"The effort, speed and character was good, and we were playing against a very good team.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger:\n\"I am not disappointed because twice we were losing and twice we came back. It was a game that was very, very intense.\n\"I was surprised by the intensity of City's start. We expected an intense game but they really came out with strong pressure.\n\"The good thing is that we absorbed it and we've shown good character today.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSergio Aguero has scored in six consecutive Premier League games for the first time - the first Manchester City player to do so.\nManchester City have not won any of their eight Premier League games against the top five this season, drawing three and losing five.\nArsenal scored with their only two shots on target.\nOliver Giroud scored his first goal in his past 16 Premier League appearances.\nGiroud now has 18 headed goals in the Premier League, more than any other player since the Frenchman made his debut (August 2012)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-3 Arsenal: Gabriel & Willian impress on debut in Gunners win\nDebutants Gabriel and Willian impressed as Arsenal blew away promoted Fulham in the opening game of the Premier League season.\nFormer Chelsea winger Willian had a hand in all three goals and Gabriel - a \u00a323m signing from Lille - scored in his first game in English football.\nArsenal were highly impressive, while Fulham caused themselves too many problems at the back.\nBoth sides have played and won at Wembley - twice for the Gunners - in the 48 days since the last Premier League season finished.\nAlexandre Lacazette scored the opener from close range after Willian's effort was saved.\nCentre-back Gabriel then scored from Willian's corner with his shoulder. Willian, who also hit a post from a free-kick, picked out Pierre-Emerick Aubamayeng with a perfect cross-field ball and the captain curled home Arsenal's third.\nArteta admitted he was surprised at how well Gabriel played on his first game since March when Ligue 1 was curtailed.\n\"He hadn't played any football for six months so to come and play a game in the Premier League after training with the team for three or four days is a big task,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"The boy showed a lot of character and what he can do. He can still improve a lot but he had a really good game.\n\"Willian knows the league, the country and is very settled here so I knew his performance would settle straight away.\"\nFulham created few chances, with last season's top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic coming on with only 27 minutes to go and forcing Bernd Leno into a save.\nHow you rated the players\nLive text commentary of all Saturday's games\nSlick Arsenal catch the eye\nThere were signs of improvement under boss Mikel Arteta last season, with Arsenal showing a new defensive solidity and looking confident going forward.\nThey won the FA Cup final and Community Shield - against Chelsea and Liverpool respectively - at either end of August.\nDespite a pre-season break of less than a month, they are in good shape if this performance is anything to go back.\nArteta said: \"On the first day you always have butterflies. It's been a strange pre-season. Yesterday was the first day we had the full squad together training.\"\nArsenal substitutes Dani Ceballos and Eddie Nketiah clashed twice in the pre-match warm-up over a training drill, but there was total harmony among the 11 players who started.\nFulham had little answer to Arteta's tactics. Ainsley Maitland-Niles was nominally a left wing-back but spent a lot of his game in midfield, with central defender Kieran Tierney playing almost as a left-back.\nMohamed Elneny and Granit Xhaka, whose Arsenal careers looked over last season, had solid performances in midfield.\nLeno started in goal, with Emiliano Martinez, who ended last season as number one with Leno injured, set to join Aston Villa for \u00a320m.\nFor the fourth season in a row it took less than 10 minutes for the opening goal of a Premier League season, with Lacazette becoming the first player to score the first goal in two different seasons. He made no mistake from close range after Marek Rodak parried Willian's shot.\nThe dominant Gunners should have been further clear at half-time, with Willian striking the base of a post with a fine free-kick.\nThe second half followed the same pattern and Arsenal made the game safe.\nGabriel became the third Arsenal defender to score on his Premier League debut as he turned home Willian's corner. He tried to head the ball but it went in via his shoulder. The new laws this season say if the ball hits the area where a T-shirt sleeve would be, that it is not handball.\nAubameyang scored the pick of the goals with a trademark curling effort from another Willian pass.\nWillian is the first player to assist two goals on his Premier League debut for Arsenal since Ray Parlour in August 1992 against Liverpool.\nArsenal could have scored more if they needed, but this will be exactly what Arteta, whose job title changed from head coach to manager this week, wanted to see.\nHave Fulham learned from past mistakes?\nFulham were relegated in each of their past two Premier League seasons, in 2013-14 and 2018-19 - conceding the most goals in the league both times.\nThe last time they were promoted they spent more than \u00a3100m and played a new-look team in a miserable season.\nBut this time boss Scott Parker started with 10 of the 11 players who beat Brentford in the Championship play-off final on 4 August, with no new signings getting on to the pitch.\nMitrovic, who was not fully fit for their Wembley win after scoring 26 goals, was on the bench again.\nFulham will hope not many of their games are as tough as playing in-form Arsenal, but there were signs this could be another leaky season at the back.\nThe opening goal came from their own mistake. Tim Ream blocked a Xhaka shot and should have cleared it, but he let Willian take the ball and shoot, leading to Lacazette's goal.\nOne attempt to play out from the back led to Elneny having a shot blocked and Xhaka shooting over.\nThere was little to get excited about at the other end, with two shots on target and both from outside the box - Denis Odoi after seven minutes and Mitrovic after 67.\nThere are decisions, then, for Fulham and Parker on whether to stick with the approach that got them promoted.\n\"The big lesson today is to understand the fine margins in this division mean you can get punished,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"When you are a team like us that has come from the Championship you can't let defeat after defeat really cripple you. We are going to lose more than we win but as a team you have to keep learning and developing.\n\"It has been a quick turnaround for us. We have brought players in that will improve us and hopefully there will be more. We need to get them up to speed quickly.\"\nMan of the match - Gabriel\nMatch stats - Fulham's poor derby record continues\nFulham have lost their past 11 top-flight London derbies - including 10 defeats in 2018-19 - the longest run by a club in top-flight history.\nArsenal have won their first game in consecutive seasons for the first time since 2009-10.\nFulham have lost their first game in three consecutive league seasons for the first time since 2006-07 to 2008-09, losing to Arsenal in the second of those games in 2007-08.\nEleven Brazilians have now appeared for Arsenal in the Premier League, with only Chelsea and Manchester City boasting more (12 each).\nArsenal have scored the first goal of a Premier League season four times, with only Liverpool doing so more often (5).\nArsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette has netted four goals in three Premier League appearances against Fulham, more than against any other side in the competition.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the first player to score on the opening weekend in consecutive Premier League seasons for Arsenal since Robert Pires in 2003-04 and 2004-05.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal have another London derby next Saturday - at home to West Ham at 20:00 BST.\nFulham visit Ipswich in the EFL Cup on Wednesday (19:00) before travelling to fellow promoted side Leeds in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00)."

We had some chances yes, but the goalkeeper made a few saves.\"\nOn the referee downgrading Kyle Walker-Peters' red card: \"The first good thing was the speeding up and it is good to use more often the screen. It was the right thing to do and also brave to say no red card and a yellow.\"\nZaha's half century - the stats\nWilfried Zaha netted the 50th league goal in his career (excluding play-offs), with 37 of those coming in the Premier League and 13 in the Championship.\nZaha has been directly involved in 60 Premier League goals for Palace (37 goals, 23 assists) - 28 more than any other player for the club in the competition.\nSouthampton have won just one of their past 14 Premier League season openers (D7 L6), failing to win any of the last seven (D4 L3).\nAndros Townsend has provided more Premier League assists versus Southampton than he has against any other side in the competition (4).\nThis is the first time the home side has won a Premier League fixture between Crystal Palace and Southampton in seven meetings (D2 L4) since Saints registered a 3-1 victory in April 2017.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in Carabao Cup second-round action against Championship opposition in midweek with Palace away at Bournemouth on Tuesday (19:45 BST), while Southampton host Brentford on Wednesday (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Mohamed Salah's hat-trick sees Liverpool edge out Leeds in Premier League classic\nLeeds United made a dramatic return to the Premier League after a 16-year absence as they produced a magnificent display only to lose to a late penalty in a thriller against champions Liverpool at Anfield.\nLiverpool, back in action after winning their first title in 30 years, led three times but were pegged back on each occasion by Marcelo Bielsa's fearless side before this superb match was settled by hat-trick hero Mohamed Salah's spot-kick.\nLeeds looked to be leaving Anfield with a fully deserved point only for new \u00a330m striker Rodrigo, on as a substitute, to produce a shocking challenge on Fabinho in the 88th minute, leaving Salah to give Liverpool victory after a serious scare.\nSalah made it a nightmare start for last season's Championship winners when he drilled home a penalty in the fourth minute after his shot was handled by another Leeds new boy, Germany defender Robin Koch.\nLeeds produced the perfect response as Jack Harrison drilled a low right-foot shot past Alisson only for poor defending to allow Virgil van Dijk to restore Liverpool's advantage as he headed in Andy Robertson's corner.\nVan Dijk was badly at fault when he gifted Patrick Bamford Leeds' second before a searing strike from Salah completed the scoring in a chaotic first half.\nIn a game which also contained four disallowed goals, Leeds were not to be brushed aside and were level again after 66 minutes when a perfect first touch and volley from Mateusz Klich flashed past Alisson.\nMan of the match Salah had the final word, however, after that reckless late challenge from Rodrigo.\nHow you rated the players\nReaction from Anfield as Liverpool beat Leeds\n'Leeds make magnificently chaotic return'\nLeeds so unlucky to lose\nThe presence of manager Bielsa alone will add to the theatre of the Premier League and his vibrant, attacking Leeds United side already promise to decorate the top flight.\nLeeds could have feared the worst when Liverpool capped a rampant opening spell by scoring from the spot even before the visitors had secured possession in the opposition half.\nNot a bit of it.\nLeeds got on the ball, were bursting with energy and attacked Liverpool every time they had the chance, playing with confidence and self-belief.\nThree times they went behind but not for one moment did their heads drop or was their positive intent diminished, as proved by the manner in which they fought their way back into the game.\nThe final injury was cruel but self-inflicted, Rodrigo's ludicrous challenge on Fabinho drawing the inevitable penalty that cost Leeds a point.\nThere was so much to admire about Leeds in an attacking sense but there is also an air of naivety which they must address otherwise plenty of teams will fancy scoring goals against them.\nLeeds conceded two penalties and from two set-pieces, although Salah scored a quite brilliant volley when they failed to clear a free-kick.\nBielsa and Leeds have created a hugely positive impression from what was arguably the toughest test of all, away to the champions on the opening day.\nIn the end, however, they had only Rodrigo to blame for giving Liverpool the chance to gratefully snatch victory.\nReds survive real scare\nLiverpool got the job done courtesy of Salah's late penalty but this was an uncharacteristically sloppy display from the champions that relied on that Rodrigo challenge to get three points.\nSalah was in imperious mood up front but elsewhere Leeds were able to hurry Liverpool out of their stride and run through their midfield in a manner which would have disturbed manager Jurgen Klopp.\nLiverpool were also occasionally shambolic at the back, cut open far too easily with even the normally unflustered Van Dijk knocked out of his stride, committing an awful error for Leeds' second goal, while Trent Alexander-Arnold had a game he will want to forget.\nAlexander-Arnold was rescued by the offside flag when he bizarrely headed Harrison's lob into his own net and he will lead Liverpool's relief at getting three points.\nIn attack, though, Liverpool have players such as Salah who can rescue them from any hazardous situation and so it proved again here.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nUp and down for Van Dijk - all the stats\nLiverpool extended their unbeaten home league run to 60 games (W49 D11) - only the third run of 60-plus unbeaten home games by a side in the English top flight, after Chelsea's run of 86 ending in October 2008 and Liverpool's run of 63 ending in December 1980.\nThis was only the second Premier League game played on the opening matchday of a season to see five goals scored before half-time, after Manchester United 5-1 Fulham in August 2006 (4-1 at half-time).\nLiverpool have conceded three or more goals in back-to-back home league games for the first time since September 1982.\nLiverpool have now won the past 35 Premier League games in which Mohamed Salah has scored - he has now overtaken Wayne Rooney's competition record of 34 consecutive wins when scoring from September 2008 to February 2011.\nVirgil van Dijk scored his 10th Premier League goal for Liverpool - more than any other centre-back in the competition since his club debut in January 2018. His past nine such goals have been headed.\nVan Dijk has made two errors leading directly to a goal in his past four Premier League games, more than he registered in his first 154 appearances.\nJack Harrison, Patrick Bamford and Mateusz Klich were the first players to score on their Premier League debut for Leeds United since Nick Barmby in August 2002 against Manchester City, and the first to do so in an away game since Alan Smith in November 1998 - which was also at Anfield against Liverpool.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool have a full week to prepare for their next game at Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday, 20 September (16:30 BST), while Leeds are in Carabao Cup second-round action at home to Hull on Wednesday (19:45).\nNightlife and coronavirus: How will clubbing survive?\nJamie Oliver: Nine interesting facts about the famous chef"

We have to analyse that.\n\"We had a good pre-season, we were feeling good after finishing the season well so we were disappointed with tonight.\n\"We need to get better with the players we have and they can be better, undoubtedly.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce told Sky Sports: \"I wouldn't say best week but when you come away from the Premier League and win 2-0 with two new signings scoring, it helps the cause.\n\"There was not much in it and we have a striker who scored typical striker's goal. Callum Wilson enjoys playing against West Ham and it was good to see them two get off the mark. We were worthy winners.\n\"We have been missing the goals, Callum will give us something different and makes the squad better. He can only help the situation.\n\"We have made progress, it is a long season and cannot get carried away but the last week has been a positive week for everybody, the impact the signings have made, the supporters in particular will like the look of them,\n\"That is certainly the best I have seen of Andy Carroll since the year he has been back.

        "article_text": "West Brom 0-3 Leicester: Jamie Vardy penalty double helps Leicester see off West Brom\nJamie Vardy scored a second-half penalty double as Leicester condemned West Brom to a disappointing return to the Premier League.\nAfter goalkeeper Sam Johnstone twice came to the home side's rescue with saves to deny Harvey Barnes in the first half, new signing Timothy Castagne broke the deadlock when he nodded home a far-post cross from fellow Belgian Dennis Praet nine minutes after the restart.\nVardy, last season's Premier League top scorer, then got up to score from the spot after being dragged back by Kyle Bartley as he chased into the box to support a move that saw Johnstone deny former Baggies loanee Barnes for a third time.\nThe 33-year-old repeated the feat 10 minutes later after Dara O'Shea tripped James Justin.\nAs playmaker James Maddison made a second-half appearance off the bench after recovering from a hip operation that crucially caused him to miss the end of the season, it was a good day for manager Brendan Rodgers and his team, who were winning this particular fixture for the fifth time in a row.\nFor West Brom, it was a brutal reminder of the task they face merely trying to stay in the top flight.\nAll three promoted teams lost on the opening weekend and - like Fulham, who were beaten by a similar scoreline against Arsenal on Saturday - there are early question marks over whether they have the quality to survive.\nRelive Leicester's win over West Brom\nHow you rated the players\nGood day for Leicester\nLeicester's biggest away win since New Year's Day provided a positive response to some major questions.\nAfter looking like Champions League certainties for the first half of the season, a draining run of 17 games in which they claimed only four wins and 17 points saw Leicester overtaken by Manchester United for a top-four spot on the final day of the season.\nJust as his side's form nosedived, so did Vardy's.\nHe may have been the Premier League's top scorer but 17 of his 23 goals came before Christmas Day.\nAfter toiling for most of the afternoon, Vardy's day seem to be reaching an unhappy end when he limped away from a collision with Johnstone.\nBut the physio sorted Vardy out and within minutes he had scored. Ten minutes after that, he had another one.\nThe similarity of his penalties was uncanny. The run-up was purposeful, the shot powerful, both times to Johnstone's right as the keeper dived the wrong way to his left.\n\"Any team would want him. He's super cool, clinical, still has pace and running ability,\" said Rodgers.\n\"He's a box player. He'll never be dropping underneath with bright intricate play but he's a killer in the box. Whether from a cross or penalty he's got the eye to score. He never looked like missing.\"\nMaddison's introduction was further reason for Leicester to cheer, although with a notoriously draining Europa League campaign to negotiate from the middle of October, it is fair to assume Rodgers will want more signings beyond Castagne, who has been brought in as a replacement for Ben Chilwell, who joined Chelsea for \u00a345m.\n\"There is a load of work going on behind the scenes. We will see what happens in the next few days,\" added Rodgers.\n\"Delighted with the guys who are here. We will try to improve this squad whether we get new players in or not.\"\nGoal-shy Baggies\nWhen West Brom went down three seasons ago, their measly 31 goals was one of the major reasons.\nSalomon Rondon and Jay Rodriguez were joint top scorers with seven, so it is obvious where the Baggies must improve if they are to stand a chance of preserving their Premier League status.\nHaving spent \u00a328m on three new attackers - all of whom joined on a more permanent basis after impressing during the club's promotion season - expectations around Pereira, Grady Diangana and Callum Robinson are high.\nThere was evidence of plenty of movement from the three of them but it only translated into a single shot on target.\nKasper Schmeichel made one feet-first save from Pereira before the break but the Brazilian's effort was going wide anyway. Pereira was the home side's major attacking threat - and might have done better with a volley he sent sailing over the bar after controlling in a good position inside the Leicester box.\nBut without a greater goal threat, it could be a long old season for the Baggies.\n\"I was really pleased with the way we played until they scored,\" said Albion boss Bilic.\n\"It was a good performance up to then, with and without the ball. Very disappointed with the result. Our mentality was not the same after the goal. We have to think forwards.\"\nMan of the match - Timothy Castagne (Leicester)\nVardy equals Van Nistelrooy record - the stats\nLeicester have won all five of their Premier League away games against West Brom - no other side has a better 100% away win rate against an opponent in the competition (Man City also 5/5 vs Bournemouth and Arsenal 5/5 vs Hull).\nAll three promoted clubs (Leeds, West Brom and Fulham) have lost their opening match of a Premier League campaign for the first time since 2013-14, when Crystal Palace, Hull and Cardiff did so.\nThe home side remains winless in all nine Premier League meetings between West Brom and Leicester (D2 L7), with only Bournemouth v Watford (10) being played more without the home side winning.\nLeicester earned their first Premier League away win since New Year's Day (3-0 at Newcastle), ending a run of eight games without a win on the road (D3 L5).\nIn 380 Premier League games last season, there was just one occasion of a player scoring two penalties in a single match (Troy Deeney v Newcastle) - it's happened twice already in five matches this season (Mo Salah v Leeds, Vardy for Leicester).\nVardy has scored in all five of his away Premier League appearances against West Brom, equalling Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of most away games vs an opponent in the competition with a 100% scoring record (5/5 at Newcastle).\nLeicester's Castagne became the fifth different Belgian player to score on his Premier League debut, after Luc Nilis, Thomas Vermaelen, Christian Benteke and Leandro Trossard.\nLeicester's Vardy became the first player to score two penalties in an away Premier League game since Riyad Mahrez vs Everton in December 2015 - also for Leicester.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom play EFL new boys Harrogate Town in the Carabao Cup second round on Wednesday before travelling to Everton in the Premier League on 19 September (12:30 BST).

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Everton: Dominic Calvert-Lewin heads winner against Spurs\nDominic Calvert-Lewin's brilliant header ensured new-look Everton made a flying start to the Premier League season with victory at Tottenham.\nCalvert-Lewin gave Hugo Lloris no chance after getting between Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier to connect with Lucas Digne's in-swinging free-kick to earn the Toffees a first win over Spurs since 2012.\nIn a high-octane encounter, Jordan Pickford produced two excellent saves to keep out Dele Alli and Matt Doherty, who was making his debut after signing from Wolves.\nBut with new signing James Rodriguez in excellent form, Everton fully deserved their win after a hard-working performance.\nEverton should have taken the lead in the early stages but Richarlison lost his footing after rounding Spurs keeper Lloris.\nAnalysis: Rodriguez shows Spurs what they are missing\n'Pre-season hit by Covid-19' - Mourinho\n'We were lazy in our pressing' - reaction as Everton beat Tottenham\nNew-look Everton turn on the style\nAfter Everton's disappointing 12th place last season, their lowest position since 2003-04, Carlo Ancelotti has embarked on an ambitious rebuilding job, specifically targeting the midfield.\nAs well as Rodriguez, Brazil's Allan and Watford's Abdoulaye Doucoure have also been drafted in to provide energy and creativity in the engine room - and all three gave Ancelotti huge encouragement for the season ahead.\nRodriguez, in particular, stood out, with his quality passing. The signing from Real Madrid created five opportunities for his team-mates, the most by a player on their Premier League debut since Alexis Sanchez back in August 2014.\nThe Toffees could - and should - have won by a more handsome margin against a static Tottenham side short of ideas.\nRodriguez twice picked out Richarlison after half-time but the Brazilian, who wasted a great chance in the first half after sprinting past Alderweireld and rounding Lloris, was unable to punish Spurs.\nAllan, who played under Ancelotti at Napoli, was calm and composed as Everton looked rejuvenated after a poor 2019-20.\nPickford was commanding and his saves to keep out Alli and Doherty were crucial, with Ancelotti delighted with a clean-sheet win against a side that finished 10 points and six places above his side last season.\nFlat start by Spurs\nSpurs boss Jose Mourinho was unhappy with Everton's goal, claiming the free-kick which led to Calvert-Lewin's winner was taken from the wrong place.\nBut over the 90 minutes, Spurs were distinctly second best and their lack of threat was summed up by the fact Harry Kane only touched the ball twice in Everton's penalty area.\nSon Heung-min was Spurs' most threatening player, particularly in the first half when he set up chances for Kane and Alli.\nKane looked a shadow of the player who finished last season with five goals in three games while Alli, despite forcing a fine save from Pickford, was replaced at half-time.\nMourinho said before the game that he wanted a new striker before the transfer window closes next month and this performance will reinforce his need to strengthen the squad.\nNew signing Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg also started but was unable to have the same impact as Everton's new additions.\nMan of the match - James Rodriguez (Everton)\n'We could have done more' - what they said\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho: \" I was expecting much more individually and collectively. It wasn't a very good performance, not a consistent performance, not a performance that leaves me with a very good feeling that all of my players gave everything.\n\"I go home with the feeling that some of the boys could do more.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti: \"We are satisfied, I am satisfied, the performance of the team was brilliant.\n\"I am pleased we started the season well and we showed we can compete which is the most important message to take. We can compete with everyone if the spirit is good, if the attitude is good and the players showed this.\"\nHead start - the stats\nOnly Chris Wood (14) and Harry Kane (12) have scored more headed goals in the Premier League since the beginning of the 2017-18 campaign than Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin (11).\nSpurs boss Jose Mourinho has been defeated on the opening matchday of a league campaign for the first time in his managerial career.\nEverton have secured their first Premier League win in London in nine games.\nOnly Pep Guardiola (4/4) can boast a better 100% winning ratio on the opening weekend of a Premier League season than Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti, who has won each of his three matches to kick-off an English top-flight season (also Frank Clark, 3).\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2018, only Andy Robertson (24) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (25) have registered more assists in the competition amongst all defenders than Everton left back Lucas Digne (12).\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in cup action in midweek. While Tottenham travel to Bulgaria to face Lokomotiv Plovdiv in the second qualifying round of the Europa League on Thursday (17:00 BST), Everton host League Two Salford City on Wednesday in the second round of the Carabao Cup (20:15).\nNightlife and coronavirus: How will clubbing survive?\nJamie Oliver: Nine interesting facts about the famous chef"

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 0-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Nuno praises special Wolves\nWolverhampton Wanderers boss Nuno Espirito Santo says he believes \"something special\" is being built at the club after he celebrated a new contract with a 2-0 win at Sheffield United.\nRaul Jimenez struck in the third minute of the two sides' Premier League opener before Romain Saiss headed in a second soon after.\nNuno signed a new three-year on Sunday, keeping him at the club until 2023.\n\"It has been an amazing three seasons,\" he said.\n\"I think we create something really special - the identity, the core of the squad, the bonds between us, this is how we operate but we have to stay humble.\n\"Now I have to prepare the next training session because we play Stoke in the League Cup. We go day by day.\"\nBoth sides had enjoyed hugely impressive campaigns last term, with the Blades upsetting the odds to finish ninth on their return to the top flight, while Wolves secured seventh and reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League.\nBut it was Nuno's side who picked up where they left off as they raced into a two-goal lead.\nThe home side looked sluggish and struggled to create many meaningful chances in the first half, with their first shot on target not arriving until seven minutes before the half-time, when Oli McBurnie headed at Rui Patricio.\nA half-time team talk by Chris Wilder had the desired impact as United came out flying in the second half, with John Fleck striking the base of the post with a powerful low drive before John Lundstram just failed to get to a teasing Billy Sharp cross.\nHowever, only a superb save by Blades debutant Aaron Ramsdale denied Wolves a third on the break as the 22-year-old - an \u00a318m summer signing from Bournemouth - pushed a Saiss strike on to the post before Jimenez shot wide from the rebound.\nAsked whether he was concerned that the Blades could be in danger of suffering 'second-season syndrome' and struggling this time round, Wilder told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I wish I had a pound for everyone who's said that.\n\"There are 37 games to go. Whatever. Words and statements like there were last year come at us thick and fast if we lose a game; if we win a game we're the best thing since sliced bread. If you lose it's second-season syndrome - that's the coverage the Premier League gets.\"\nWolves make flying start, despite lack of pre-season\nWolves' performances both domestically and in Europe last season were all the more impressive considering the sheer volume of games they played as a result of their Europa League commitments.\nTheir campaign started in July last year and ended last month - more than 60 games later - as they reached the last eight of Europe's second-tier club competition - losing to eventual winners Sevilla.\nThe late finish to a season disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic meant Wolves have not had time to squeeze in any friendlies before the start of the new campaign.\nBut despite the lack of preparation they showed no signs of rustiness and they were at their clinical best from the outset, scoring from their first two chances of the game.\nJimenez showed great composure to let a cross run across his body before finishing and then Saiss placed a header beyond the reach of Ramsdale in the Blades' goal.\nThe lack of preparation for the new campaign perhaps showed as they saw less of the ball in the second half, although they did still have the better chances on the break.\nA tale of two halves for rusty Blades\nIt would, as Wilder has rightly pointed out, be very premature to suggest this defeat is an indicator of Sheffield United being destined to fall foul of 'second-season syndrome' but there will be some causes for concern for the Blades boss.\nDespite playing four pre-season friendlies compared to Wolves' none it was the hosts who looked short of sharpness in the first half.\nThey were slow to build attacks and lacked bite in the final third, while their defence - the backbone of their impressive campaign last season - was well below par.\nBut they were much improved after the break as they pressed Wolves high, while the overlapping runs from defence that were utilised to deadly effect last season were also more prominent.\nA significant portion of Sheffield United's summer spending went on Ramsdale, who showed that he should be a more than capable replacement for Dean Henderson - returned to parent club Manchester United - with his superb second-half save from Saiss.\nOtherwise Wilder has, so far, invested in promising youth rather than making wholesale changes to his squad in pre-season, and while his side's first-half display will have left him wondering whether that decision was justified, the second-half performance will give him hope that the Blades can once again upset the odds this season.\n\"We move quickly on - that's a lesson we learned last year,\" Wilder added.\n\"It does hurt but you can't dwell on it. All those teams that lost on the opening day, they're going to have an unbelievable struggle and those who won games are going to get in the Champions League and push Liverpool and Manchester City. That's just how the Premier League is and we've accepted it.\n\"Our focus is our belief. We need to tighten up on certain things and we go into the next game quickly looking to get a result to get us up and running.\"\nMan of the match - Raul Jimenez\nA first since Mick McCarthy's reign - the stats\nSheffield United have won their opening game of a league campaign in only one of the past seven seasons (D1 L5), but this was the first time they have lost in the first round of games in the Premier League (previously W2 D2).\nWolves are unbeaten in their opening league game of the season in each of the past eight campaigns (W4 D4), with this their first Premier League victory in the first round of games since 2011-12 under Mick McCarthy (2-1 v Blackburn).\nSheffield United have lost each of their past four games across all competitions, their longest losing streak under current manager Chris Wilder.\nThis was just the seventh time that Wolves have won a Premier League away game by more than one goal - five of those seven victories have come during Nuno Espirito Santo's time in charge.\nWolves scored twice in the opening six minutes of a Premier League game for the first time, while it was also the quickest a team have netted two goals in their opening game of a Premier League season.\nRaul Jimenez's opener (two minutes 19 seconds) was Wolves' quickest goal in a Premier League game since February 2011, when Matt Jarvis netted against Blackpool after a minute and 56 seconds.\nJimenez has scored 28 goals in all competitions since the start of last season - among Premier League players in this period, only Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Raheem Sterling have scored more (both 31).\nWhat next?\nThe second round of the Carabao Cup is up next for both sides as Sheffield United travel to Premier League rivals Burnley on Thursday, 17 September (17:30 BST), while Wolves host Championship side Stoke later on the same day (19:00 BST).\nNightlife and coronavirus: How will clubbing survive?\nJamie Oliver: Nine interesting facts about the famous chef"

        "article_text": "Brighton 1-3 Chelsea: Frank Lampard wants title challenge after starting season with win\nFrank Lampard says his expensively reshaped Chelsea side \"have to have intentions to be up there\" with champions Liverpool after they began their campaign with victory at Brighton.\nChelsea finished 33 points adrift of the Reds last season and lost both league fixtures against them but have spent around \u00a3200m this summer.\nTimo Werner - signed from RB Leipzig - and his Germany team-mate Kai Havertz - brought in from Bayer Leverkusen - made their debuts for a side forced to work hard for their win in Monday's game at Brighton.\nWerner was pacy and prominent in the victory, winning a 23rd-minute penalty when he was hauled down by Brighton keeper Mat Ryan, Jorginho scoring the resulting spot-kick.\nThe new signing had ice strapped to his leg at full-time following the collision to win the penalty but said he would be fit to face Liverpool in Sunday's game at Stamford Bridge.\nBrighton lost summer signing Adam Lallana to injury before the break but were back on level terms after 54 minutes when Leandro Trossard's 20-yard shot squirmed past Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nChelsea regained their lead two minutes later when Reece James ripped a 25-yard right-foot shot high past Ryan.\nBrighton should have equalised when Lewis Dunk somehow headed wide at the far post, paying the price for the miss when Kurt Zouma's shot was deflected past Ryan by Adam Webster.\n\"We definitely want to close that gap to Liverpool - we have to have intentions to be up there even though it is a big ask to win [the title],\" said Lampard, who has also signed midfielder Hakim Ziyech and defenders Xavier Mbuyamba, Malang Sarr, Ben Chilwell and Thiago Silva this summer.\n\"We are behind, it's step by step. Hopefully we can make big strides.\"\nHow you rated the players\nWerner impresses but Kepa issue remains\nHow Chelsea move happened for Werner\nWho is Chelsea signing Havertz?\nRusty Chelsea will take the points\nLampard will be delighted to leave Brighton win three points after what was a mixed performance, perhaps understandable for the first Premier League outing of the season.\nLampard got what he wanted, apart from a debut goal, from Werner as he was a constant menace, always on the move and looking to use his speed to get behind the Brighton defence. He had no trouble adjusting to the tempo of the Premier League and there seems little doubt goals will come.\nHavertz was a more low-key presence on the right side of midfield in front of James but he worked hard in his 79 minutes and drew warm applause from Lampard for one lengthy recovery run back into his own penalty area to clear danger.\nChelsea were without injured left-back Chilwell, signed for \u00a350m from Leicester City, and Silva as he has only just joined training and Lampard will be keen to get that influential duo into a defence that still looks vulnerable.\nTariq Lamptey's crosses caused trouble all night and Chelsea were grateful for that headed miss by Dunk at the far post when it looked easier to score.\nAnd once again there were questions over keeper Kepa, who got close to Trossard's shot but allowed it to creep in.\nIt seems his time is running out as Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper, with the \u00a320m signing of Rennes' Edouard Mendy apparently imminent.\nBrighton rue missed chance\nBrighton can take some satisfaction through the pain of a defeat that will leave manager Graham Potter bitterly frustrated.\nThe Seagulls acquitted themselves very well and had the game's outstanding performer in former Chelsea right-back Lamptey, who was industrious and creative in a top-class display.\nAnd the momentum appeared to be with Brighton when Trossard scored a deserved equaliser - only for them to concede a second within two minutes from James' thunderous finish.\nBrighton then wasted the best chance of the game when Dunk headed wide and were unable to recover as Chelsea re-established a two-goal lead.\nThis was, however, a very respectable performance. On the down side, Potter is facing the issue he must have feared when he signed Lallana from Liverpool.\nLallana is a great asset when fit - but therein lies the problem. He did not last the first half and has now failed to play 90 minutes in the Premier League since he faced Middlesbrough for Liverpool in May 2017.\n'We'll get better and better' - what they said\nBrighton manager Graham Potter to BBC Sport: \"The performance was good in many aspects; we more than matched Chelsea for long periods. I'm disappointed with the opening goal, but errors can happen. We were heavily punished with a wonder strike - and ultimately, if you concede three times it's hard to win football matches.\n\"You have moments against the big teams that you need to have go your way and we need to learn from that. But there are positives. Adam Lallana was enjoying the game, he brings that personality, we are pleased with what he has brought to us and we just have to help him get on the field more often.\"\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard to BBC Sport: \"To come to Brighton and win is a tough ask. We've only had a few days, so I didn't expect the kind of football we want to play. We had to do some of the more difficult things - resilience, throwing yourself in front of the ball, so I'm pleased.\n\"We've had a lot of quarantines, a lot of players who aren't match fit. That's how this season has started. There's a lot of strain on these players and hopefully we'll get better and better.\"\nMan of the match - Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)\n2,000 points - the best of the stats\nThis victory earned Chelsea their 2,000th point in the Premier League (1,077 games), making them the third side to reach that total since the competition began in 1992, after Manchester United (2,234) and Arsenal (2,014).\nBrighton have won just one of their 10 home Premier League games in 2020 (D4 L5), the fewest of any side to have played two or more home matches in the competition this calendar year.\nSince the start of last season, Chelsea's 20 away Premier League games have produced 81 goals (42 for, 39 against), at least 14 more than any other side on their travels.\nChelsea have scored each of their past 16 penalties in the Premier League, since Eden Hazard missed from the spot against Manchester City in April 2017.\nJorginho has scored all eight of the penalties he has taken for Chelsea in all competitions (excluding shootouts), including five in the Premier League.\nSince he joined Chelsea in 2018, Kepa Arrizabalaga has conceded more Premier League goals from outside the box (19) than any other goalkeeper. Indeed, excluding blocked shots, Kepa has conceded nine of the past 13 overall shots on target he has faced in the Premier League.\nLeandro Trossard has scored three goals in his past six Premier League games for Brighton, as many as he netted in his first 26 appearances in the competition before this.\nKurt Zouma scored what was only his second Premier League goal for Chelsea (72nd appearance), and his first since September 2015 against Arsenal.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton host Portsmouth in the Carabao Cup on Thursday, 17 September (19:45 BST) and return to Premier League action at Newcastle on Sunday, 20 September (14:00).\nMeanwhile, Chelsea host champions Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, 20 September (16:30) in the Premier League.\nNightlife and coronavirus: How will clubbing survive?\nJamie Oliver: Nine interesting facts about the famous chef"

        "article_text": "Everton 5-2 West Bromwich Albion: Dominic Calvert-Lewin scores hat-trick in big win\nDominic Calvert-Lewin hit a first career hat-trick and James Rodriguez scored on his home debut as Everton continued their impressive start to the Premier League season with a dominant win against 10-man West Brom.\nThe Baggies took an early lead through an excellent solo effort by Grady Diangana, who broke from inside his own half before hitting a dipping effort beyond Jordan Pickford for his first top-flight goal.\nEverton equalised midway through the first half when the video assistant referee overturned an offside decision after Calvert-Lewin cleverly backheeled into the net for his second goal in as many games.\nRodriguez then marked his home debut with a clinical finish on the stroke of half-time, sweeping a low effort into the far corner from Richarlison's pass.\nReaction to Everton's win against West Brom\nLawro's full predictions v singer and Manchester United fan Raye\nA crazy few minutes at the end of the first half saw Kieran Gibbs and manager Slaven Bilic sent off for the visitors - Gibbs dismissed for pushing Rodriguez, and Bilic for remonstrating with the officials as they made their way off the pitch at half-time.\nDespite that double setback West Brom pulled level straight after the restart when Matheu Pereira curled in a stunning free-kick, but parity was short-lived as Michael Keane stabbed in a loose ball after Sam Johnstone parried Richarlison's header.\nCalvert-Lewin then got his second when he slid in from close range after good work by Rodriguez and Richarlison and completed his hat-trick by heading in Rodriguez's corner.\nEverton have won their opening two league fixtures for the first time in eight years, while defeat for West Brom means they are still searching for their first points of the season.\n'I wanted explanation from referee' - Bilic on red card\nEarly days, but Everton - and Rodriguez - look exciting\nAfter flirting with relegation and then limping towards a mid-table finish last season, Everton needed a big summer.\nDespite the short turnaround, Carlo Ancelotti's work in the transfer market has been impressive and the additions of Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure already appear to have significantly improved their midfield just two games into the season.\nBut it is the signing of Colombian forward Rodriguez that looks set to be the pick of the deals, as well as perhaps the best bit of business completed this summer in the Premier League.\nRodriguez caught the eye with his impressive footwork and vision in Everton's opening win against Tottenham and built on that in this game as he was involved in three of the home side's five goals.\nHis strike to make it 2-1 was one of real quality as, despite having four West Brom players in close attention, he took a touch before sweeping into the far corner from outside the box.\nHe then showed great vision for Everton's fourth, lofting the ball into the box for Richarlison, who squared for Calvert-Lewin, and was on hand again to provide the assist for the English striker's third.\nAncelotti clearly is a manager who can get the best out of Rodriguez, who has now scored in four of Europe's top five leagues, with his first goals in La Liga, the Bundesliga and now the Premier League all coming under the Italian.\nAnd the former Chelsea boss appears to be having the same influence on Calvert-Lewin. The striker had not scored more than six goals in a season in his first three Premier League campaigns but got 13 last term - eight of those under Ancelotti - and already has four this season.\nBaggies need to shore up defence\nWhen West Ham sold Diangana to West Brom this summer, it prompted an unexpected and angry message on social media from Hammers' captain Mark Noble, who said he was \"gutted, angry and sad\" that the club had decided to sell the youngster.\nHis goal against Everton showed just why Noble rated Diangana so highly and justified West Brom's decision to spend \u00a318m of their budget on the England youth international.\nDiangana's raw talent coupled with the creativity of Pereira - who with 17 assists is second only to Kevin de Bruyne as top creator of goals in English football since the start of last season - means the Baggies have attacking flair that could serve them well this season.\nBut they have now conceded eight goals in just two games and there will need to be significant improvement in their defensive displays if they are to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.\nRodriguez made it look easy - what they said\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti to BBC Sport: \"The game was not so easy. We had difficulties in the first half. West Brom were better than us. We had a good reaction. With the advantage of one more player we were more in control.\n\"The players have come back with more ambition and motivation. The new signings have helped us be more motivated. Good momentum for us.\n\"I'm really pleased for James Rodriguez. A new country, a new league - it was not so easy. But he made it easy because he has a lot of quality. A fantastic player.\"\nWest Brom boss Slaven Bilic told BBC Sport: \"We did so many mistakes we can't do at this level.\n\"Why I'm frustrated is the way we were tactically in the first half, we were closing them down, passing the ball, the way we pressed them, it can't be 2-1 for them.\n\"To show that naivety to go down after we are 1-0 up and to get the red card is frustrating.\"\nA first for Richarlison - the stats\nEverton have registered back-to-back victories at the start of a Premier League campaign for the first time since 2012-13.\nWest Brom have conceded five goals in a Premier League game for the first time since a 5-5 draw on the final day of the 2012-13 season against Manchester United.\nSeamus Coleman became only the sixth player to hit the 250-start milestone for Everton in the Premier League (also Tim Howard, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka, Leon Osman and David Unsworth).\nSince his Everton debut in December 2016, Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored 36 goals in all competitions, seven more than any other player for the Toffees.\nCalvert-Lewin is the first Everton player to score a top-flight hat-trick since Wayne Rooney vs West Ham in November 2017, and the youngest Englishman to do so for the Toffees (23 years and 187 days) since Tony Cottee (23 years and 47 days) vs Newcastle in August 1988.\n34% of Everton playmaker James Rodr\u00edguez's 53 goals in Europe's top five leagues have been scored from outside the box (18 of 53), including three of his past six.\nKieran Gibbs is the first West Brom player to be sent off in the Premier League since Hal Robson-Kanu against Burnley in August 2017.\nEverton attacker Richarlison registered two assists in a Premier League game for the first time ever (111 appearances in total).\nWhat next?\nEverton will look to make it four wins from four in all competitions when they travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday, 26 September (15:00 BST), while West Brom host Chelsea on the same day (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Leeds United 4-3 Fulham: Helder Costa's early goal sparks seven-goal thriller\nLeeds came out on top in a seven-goal thriller against Fulham in their first Premier League home game for 16 years.\nLeeds' opening two Premier League games this season have seen 14 goals, the most in a top-flight side's opening two matches since Wolves in 1962-63.\nAfter losing 4-3 at Liverpool on the opening weekend, this was the second week running that Marcelo Bielsa's side were involved a frenetic end-to-end affair.\nHelder Costa's fifth-minute goal for the hosts sparked the contest into life, with his powerful close-range effort going in off the underside of the crossbar.\nHowever, Aleksandar Mitrovic levelled the scores with a penalty after Robin Koch had fouled Joe Bryan.\nLeeds were soon back in front though, with Poland midfielder Mateusz Klich stroking in a penalty after Bryan had fouled Patrick Bamford.\nBamford's placed effort just after the interval put Leeds firmly in charge and they looked to have sealed the win when Costa added a fourth from Bamford's cross.\nBut Bobby Decordova-Reid's low drive and Mitrovic's second goal of the day for the Cottagers set up a dramatic finale.\nTwo games, 14 goals, bags of drama - Leeds' dramatic Premier League return\nFollow all Saturday's Premier League matches\nGood times return to Elland Road\nTony Blair was the UK prime minister and American TV sitcom Friends had just aired its final episode the last time Leeds featured in a Premier League fixture at home.\nYet Costa's thumping finish off the underside of the Fulham crossbar after five minutes was a perfect reminder that the good times have returned to Elland Road.\nA narrow opening-day defeat at champions Liverpool illustrated the strides they have made under Argentine boss Bielsa.\nBut this time their adventurous attacking and energetic style were rewarded with all three points - although it was still a performance underscored by moments of naive defending.\nBamford and Costa in particular, excelled for the hosts leading from the front at every opportunity.\nCosta's pace and trickery repeatedly occupied more than one visiting defender at a time as he constantly demanded the ball. Not only did that invaluably create space for his team-mates, he was at his clinical best scoring with both of this two shots resulting in goals.\nBamford's showing as Leeds' lone striker will also have pleased Bielsa. In a system that means the 27-year-old is likely to have to sacrifice himself at times, Bamford superbly created Costa's goal on the left.\nAnd he showed a cool head to convert his only real chance of the game from Klich's pass.\nFulham pay for defensive lapses\nWhile Fulham boss Scott Parker has already conceded his team are likely to lose more games than they win this term he will have been disappointed by the way they gifted Leeds their opening goal.\nFor the second week in succession his team conceded from a corner and were punished for a lapse in concentration and poor organisation.\nBryan's push on Bamford will also go down as a moment that was easily avoidable with the full-back and central defender Denis Odoi both caught out of position.\nHowever, unlike their home defeat by Arsenal, Fulham did at least show the character to respond against a side that had beaten them 3-0 in the corresponding fixture last term.\nAndre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's sleight of foot and drive in midfield helped to kick-start the comeback, as he brushed off recently capped England midfielder Kalvin Phillips to play in Decordova-Reid.\nFormer Lyon defender Kenny Tete also marked an impressive Premier League debut with a fine cross, from which Mitrovic scored his second of the game.\n'This won't be a constant'- what they said\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"This won't be a constant all year. It is very difficult to maintain the efficiency [in front of goal] we have had in these first two games.\n\"The characteristics of our game is to create goalscoring opportunities. In these two games we have created very little but we have scored all our chances.\n\"We have had two very different games. Against Liverpool we tried to get close to a very big rival and today we tried to not be caught by Fulham. Both were very difficult games.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"There were a lot of encouraging things. You go 4-1 down away from home and they could really drop their heads. I didn't see that in my team. I saw a real character and determination.\n\"The biggest thought in my head is that you cannot give up goals that we have given up today. You can't expect to score four or five goals to win football matches in this league.\n\"If you give up goals too easy you aren't going to win many. I just worry that a red bolt doesn't go off for us.

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-3 Crystal Palace: Wilfried Zaha scores twice against former club\nWilfried Zaha scored twice against his former club as Crystal Palace condemned Manchester United to a miserable start to their Premier League campaign with victory at Old Trafford.\nAfter Andros Townsend squeezed a seventh-minute shot into the far corner from Jeffrey Schlupp's cross, the hosts struggled badly but the game slipped away from them thanks to Zaha's controversial 74th-minute penalty.\nReferee Martin Atkinson used the VAR TV monitor to decide Victor Lindelof had handled inside his own box. But, after David de Gea saved Jordan Ayew's spot-kick, Atkinson ordered a retake because the Spain international had moved off his line. Zaha took responsibility for the second attempt and made no mistake.\nOn his debut, Donny van de Beek pulled one back 10 minutes from time but Zaha struck again against his former club to secure a deserved victory for Palace.\nIt was their biggest ever win at Old Trafford, the first time they have beaten United away from home in successive seasons and means Palace have won their opening two games of a top flight season for the first time in their history.\nFor United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, it was a horrible day. Too many of his players were off the pace, including Paul Pogba, who was replaced by Van de Beek midway through the second half.\nVeteran boss, youthful team\nPalace's 73-year-old boss Roy Hodgson is just five years younger than Sir Alex Ferguson, who watched this game from the directors' box.\nFerguson must have been impressed with the youthful exuberance of the Palace side. Despite conceding possession, they were by far the most inventive and gave central defensive pair Harry Maguire and Lindelof a torrid time.\nLindelof was shrugged away far too easily by Schlupp in the build-up to Townsend's goal and Ayew would have had a second for Palace before the break had it not been for De Gea's brilliant one-handed save.\nThat it should be Zaha whose contribution eventually proved decisive was a further painful memory for United.\nZaha was Ferguson's last signing as United boss. But the Ivory Coast international never settled at Old Trafford and was sold back to Palace in 2015.\nAfter ending last season with a whimper, Palace could not have done better over the past fortnight and face an intriguing meeting with Everton, who have also won their opening two games, at Selhurst Park next weekend.\nWhere now for United?\nIn his programme notes, United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward spoke about the impact the coronavirus pandemic is having on football's finances.\nThis argument is wearing a little thin with United supporters, who have seen rivals sign players for big money while United hit a brick wall in their attempt to sign Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.\nNone of those criticisms will be silenced by this dismal fare.\nDespite being given an extra week off because of their European exploits, United were flat. The spark that player of the year Bruno Fernandes brought to the United side in January was missing. Pogba was poor and guilty of too many unforced errors.\nUnited's defence struggled badly, with Maguire and Lindelof out of position far too often, and they have now conceded first in four successive home league games.\nTheir best chance until Van de Beek's goal was a far-post Mason Greenwood header which the striker sent disappointingly wide.\nOn this evidence, it is hard to see United matching last season's third-place finish without further additions to Solskjaer's squad.\nWe should look at ourselves in the mirror - what they said\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"You can see we are short and they deserved the points.\n\"Today was a performance you don't see very often from this group. We should look at ourselves in the mirror. Everyone knows we can perform better than this.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I thought that both defensively and offensively we were good.\n\"We made certain and kept them playing in front of us and they could not profit from those spaces they are skilful enough to find.\n\"And when we had the ball I thought we looked very dangerous and threatening so I don't think it was a big surprise that we scored three.\"\nA rare opening defeat for Manchester United - the stats\nCrystal Palace have won consecutive league games away against Manchester United for the first time; they're just the second London club to win consecutively in the Premier League at Old Trafford after Tottenham in 2012-13/2013-14.\nManchester United have lost their opening home game to a Premier League campaign for the just the third time, also losing vs Everton in 1992-93 and Swansea in 2014-15.\nCrystal Palace scored more than twice for the first time in 40 Premier League games, since beating Bournemouth 5-3 on the final day of the 2018-19 campaign.\nPalace's Zaha has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since November 2019 - his two strikes were his first goal involvements in his 10th Premier League appearance against former club Manchester United.\nCrystal Palace's Townsend has already matched his Premier League goal tally from last season (one), with this his first league goal in 20 games since netting against Norwich in September 2019.\nManchester United keeper De Gea has failed to save any of the past 18 penalties he's faced in the Premier League, last keeping one out from Everton's Leighton Baines in October 2014.\nVan de Beek became the 20th player to score on his Premier League debut for Manchester United, and the 10th of those to do so as a substitute.\nWhat next?\nManchester United travel to Championship side Luton in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, 22 September (20:15 BST) while Crystal Palace are next in action on Saturday, 26 September when they host Everton in the Premier League (15:00)."

In the end you have to find a way because there will be games like this through the season.\"\nThe Gunners largely controlled the opening stages of the contest and deservedly went ahead when Alexandre Lacazette headed in from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's chipped cross.\nHowever, the Hammers, who always looked dangerous on the counter-attack, levelled just before the interval when Michail Antonio bundled in Ryan Fredericks' cross at the end of a sweeping move.\nWhile Arsenal continued to enjoy more of the ball after the break, David Moyes' side created the better openings in front of goal with Antonio heading against the bar and seeing a scuffed close-range effort saved by Bernd Leno.\nBut, Nketiah's late tap-in from a Dani Ceballos pass ensured Arsenal continued their fine home record against the Hammers, having won 11 of the last 12 meetings at Emirates Stadium.\nArsenal eke out another win\nWhile there have been considerable signs of improvement at Arsenal since Arteta took charge last December this performance appeared to fizzle out after Lacazette had registered his 50th goal in all competitions for the club.\nThe crispness of passing, swift attacking and solidity at the back were all noticeably missing and it allowed West Ham a route back into the encounter.\nHowever, the pleasing aspect for the Spaniard will be that his team were still capable of eking out a victory from an under-par showing.\nNervy at the back throughout, Arteta's side survived several close scares and struggled to break free of their lethargy despite the introduction of \u00a372m winger Nicolas Pepe.\nIt took another substitute, Nketiah, to make the difference, with his tap-in coming eight minutes after he had come on to replace Lacazette.\nWest Ham show signs of improvement\nWhile it was difficult to see just how West ham were going to score in their opening day defeat to Newcastle, this performance will offer David Moyes hope that goals and points are just around the corner.\nAfter making a cautious start which invited pressure, the Hammers appeared transformed once they committed men forward to chase the game.\nAntonio's goal was a prime example, with four visiting players breaking quickly as Fredericks superbly overlapped down the right before finding the forward.\nSince top-flight football resumed in June, the 30-year-old has now scored more goals than any other Premier League player bar Raheem Sterling (both have nine).\nAnd on another day the Hammers may have profited fully from a rampaging display from Antonio that unsettled the home defence.\nAs it was, the Hammers were left feeling aggrieved after failing to take their chances and having had a penalty appeal turned down when Tomas Soucek's header appeared to hit Gabriel's arm.\n\"I think it was a penalty,\" said West Ham manager David Moyes.\n\"If it wasn't they need to explain the rules to us again. We're all unsure. He [Gabriel] should have headed it, because he missed it, it hit his arm. He should have been punished for that.\"\nMoyes' barren run - the stats\nArsenal have won 11 of their past 12 home games against West Ham United in all competitions, with the only exception being on the opening day of the 2015-16 Premier League season (0-2).\nWest Ham have lost 200 of their 485 London derbies in the top flight, becoming only the second side to lose 200 such matches after Tottenham (213).\nAgainst no side has West Ham manager David Moyes managed more away matches in all competitions without ever winning than against Arsenal (20 - level with Chelsea).\nAlexandre Lacazette scored his 50th goal for Arsenal in all competitions, becoming the fourth Frenchman to reach this milestone for the club after Thierry Henry (228), Robert Pires (84) & Olivier Giroud (105).\nSince 3 February 2018, Arsenal's Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have combined for 11 Premier League goals - the only duo to combine for more in the competition during this period is Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson (13).\nSince the Premier League resumed last season in June, no player has scored more goals in the competition than West Ham's Michail Antonio (9, level with Raheem Sterling).\nSince the start of last season, only Man City (9) have scored more Premier League goals via substitutes than Arsenal (8).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal go to Leicester in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday 23 September (19:45 BST) before travelling to Anfield to face champions Liverpool in the Premier League on Monday 28 September (20:15 BST)\nWest Ham are next in Premier League action when they host Wolves on Sunday 27 September (19:00 BST)."

He's amazing. Four assists, he deserved the man of the match today.\n\"We've been working for five seasons now together, we know what we like.\"\nSon's first came on the stroke of half-time when he raced on to Kane's pass before driving across Alex McCarthy and into the back of the net.\nThe pair opened up Southampton again as Spurs took the lead soon after the restart, Kane sending Son through one-on-one and the forward making no mistake.\nThe hosts struggled to deal with Son's superbly timed runs behind the defence and he duly got his third, racing on to Kane's clipped pass before slotting in.\nKane then provided his fourth assist of the day with a brilliant cross for Son, who coolly chipped McCarthy, before Kane got in on the scoring himself when he stabbed in from close range after Erik Lamela's shot had been pushed on to the post.\nIngs converted a penalty in stoppage time but it was scant consolation as Southampton slumped to their third consecutive defeat in all competitions.\nAlli absent as Son puts on super show\nThis was a much-needed win for Tottenham after a difficult start to the season in which they were beaten by Everton on the opening day before scraping past Bulgarian side Lokomotiv Plovdiv in Europa League qualifying in midweek.\nA significant reason for their defeat to the Toffees was their lack of creativity in midfield - with Dele Alli paying the price in that game for a disappointing display by being taken off at half-time.\nLeft out of the midweek Europa League tie, Alli was again omitted from the side for the trip to St Mary's, with Jose Mourinho saying his absence was down to having \"too many players\" in certain positions.\nFor a long time in this game, Mourinho's bold move looked destined to be the talking point as Tottenham sorely lacked creativity in midfield.\nAside from a couple of disallowed goals for Kane, the visitors barely troubled the Southampton defence and even when they did manage to score right before the half-time whistle it came from Tottenham's only shot and only touch in Southampton's box in the entire first half.\nBut after the break, Son and Kane took centre stage, taking advantaging of Southampton's high line and slow defence as they demonstrated an understanding that seemed almost telepathic at times.\nKane assisted just two league goals in the entirety of last season but almost every pass he provided in the second half of this game was to set up a Son goal as he became the first player in Premier League history to assist a single team-mate four times in the same match.\nWith the return of Gareth Bale, Tottenham have the potential for a front three that could rival the very best in the world.\nSaints have work to do\nA seven game unbeaten run at the end of last season gave Southampton fans plenty of reasons to be optimistic that their side could challenge further up the table this term.\nThings have so far not gone to plan. The Saints have been beaten in all three of their games this season, losing to Crystal Palace in their Premier League opener before they were knocked out of the League Cup by Championship side Brentford.\nIngs, who scored 22 league goals last season, has been linked with a move to Tottenham in this transfer window and he showed why it is crucial that the Saints keep a hold of him.\nHis first goal in this game was a superbly taken finish and he was a constant thorn in the Spurs side in a first half Southampton had the better of as he pressured defenders in possession and linked up play in attack.\nBut Southampton cannot rely on Ings to win games on his own and will need to show better in defence than they did in the second half as time and again they failed to pick up the runs by Son.\n\"The way we defended was a disaster,\" conceded Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl after the game.\n\"That is something we will have to speak about because it was stupid. In the end it was a deserved defeat.\"\nWe were too good for them - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl to BBC Sport: \"I think we conceded a stupid goal shortly before half-time. Then we had a big chance for 2-1.\n\"On the counter-attack it's 1-2. From that our heads are going down and a team with this quality kills you immediately.\n\"Playing offside all the time doesn't work because of the rule that the linesman has to keep the flag down. It doesn't make sense to do it like this.\n\"It didn't feel like we were five goals worse than they are.\"\nSpurs manager Jose Mourinho to BBC Sport: \"We didn't start bad at all. In the first 10 or 15 minutes we were good. After that we lost control.\n\"In the centre of our defensive area, we were a bit sloppy. We lost some duels. They got the ball behind us too easy. I was on the bench and thinking I would be happy to get in at 1-0.\n\"The goal gave us a different position in the game. In the second half, Harry Kane killed the game, the way he connected the game, the way he was dropping, he allowed Son Heung-min into attacking spaces. His performance was amazing.\n\"In the second half we were too good for them.\"\nSpurs travelling well - the stats\nSince Ralph Hasenhuttl took charge of Southampton in December 2018, his side have squandered more points from winning positions than any other Premier League side (37).\nTottenham are now unbeaten in four Premier League games away from home (W2 D2), their longest run without defeat on the road since January 2019 (four straight wins under Mauricio Pochettino).\nAll of Son Heung-min's four goals were assisted by Harry Kane, the first time a player has assisted another player's hat-trick since May 2003, when Thierry Henry assisted Freddie Ljungberg's treble for Arsenal against Sunderland.\nSouthampton striker Danny Ings has netted the opening goal in 11 Premier League games since the beginning of last season, more than any other player in the competition.\nTottenham have failed to keep a clean sheet in their past 10 Premier League matches against Southampton, their worst run against a single side since 13 games without a shutout between May 2001 and May 2018 versus Leicester City.\nSpurs forward Harry Kane is only the sixth player to assist four goals in a single Premier League game, and the first English player to do so. Indeed, Kane only assisted two league goals in the entirety of last season.\nSpurs team-mates Son Heung-min and Harry Kane have combined for more Premier League goals than any other duo in the competition since the Korean's move to England in August 2015 (24 goals).\nTottenham's Harry Kane is the first player to be directly involved in five goals in one Premier League game (one goal, four assists) since Mohamed Salah versus Watford in March 2018 (four goals, one assist). It is also the second time Kane has managed to do so (also May 2017 versus Leicester).\nWhat next?\nSouthampton travel to Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday (20:00 BST) while Tottenham are at Leyton Orient in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday (18:00 BST).\nKitchen Starter Pack: Delicious recipes and food hacks that won't break the bank\nBBC Food: How well do you know your coffee?"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 0-3 Brighton & Hove Albion: Neal Maupay scores two in superb Seagulls win\nNeal Maupay scored twice as Brighton cruised to a comfortable Premier League victory over an under par Newcastle at St James' Park.\nIt was a superb all-round showing from the Seagulls and the perfect response to losing their opening game to Chelsea.\nFrench forward Maupay was the early beneficiary as Graham Potter's side took control, scoring twice in the opening seven minutes, with his first goal coming via a penalty after the impressive Tariq Lamptey was tripped by Allan Saint-Maximin.\nHis second, which was checked by the video assistant referee for offside, was a close-range finish to the bottom left corner at the end of a move down the right involving Lamptey and Leandro Trossard.\nNewcastle, who struggled to recover after a sluggish start, did not manage a shot until the 40th minute and failed to register one on target throughout the whole game.\nBrighton, who saw Trossard hit the post from long distance, rounded off a fine performance when Aaron Connolly curled in a right-foot effort.\nYves Bissouma was sent off for the visitors late on when his attempted flick over his shoulder saw him catch Jamal Lewis in the face with a boot. It left both sides to finish the game with 10 players, Lewis unable to continue and the hosts having already used all their substitutes.\nFollow all Sunday's Premier League games\nLamptey continues to sparkle for Seagulls\nWhile Potter was taking positives in defeat on Monday, he will have been delighted to see the industry and creativity of his side fully rewarded six days later.\nA lightning start and some typically slick football saw his team slice through Newcastle on several occasions to gain a two-goal cushion they rarely looked like relinquishing.\nJust as pleasing is the form of 19-year-old Lamptey, who was outstanding for the second successive week.\nThe recently capped England Under-21 international turned down a new contract at Chelsea last season in favour of a move to Brighton and on this evidence he appears to be making the most of playing regular first-team football.\nLamptey impressed when starting in seven of the Seagulls' nine Premier League matches when football resumed in June and he has picked up where he left off.\nAn early break down the right served notice of his pace and awareness and moments later he drew a clumsy foul from Saint-Maximin to help set Brighton on their way.\nHis energy and quality were a feature throughout the first half. After contributing to Brighton's second, he twice almost added a third goal himself, with one break across the length of the pitch following a Newcastle corner particularly catching the eye.\nHis talent was not just restricted to going forward with one superbly timed challenge on Callum Wilson preventing the forward from having a clear run on goal.\nDespite being withdrawn after 58 minutes, Lamptey made more interceptions (four) and won more fouls (four) than any other player on the pitch.\nSluggish Newcastle struggle\nWhile Newcastle made an assured start to their Premier league season at West Ham, this display was almost the exact opposite as they struggled against more energetic and fluent opponents.\nToo often they were left chasing shadows in the early stages and appeared to have few ideas of how to cope with Brighton's 3-4-3 formation.\nJonjo Shelvey and Isaac Hayden appeared overworked and outmanoeuvred in midfield and Andy Carroll and Wilson, who worked well together a week ago, were on the periphery.\nAside from Saint-Maximin, who was substituted with a first-half injury, no player that started had fewer touches than Newcastle's front two, who both managed 21 each.\nManager Steve Bruce introduced three substitutes - Ryan Fraser, Miguel Almiron and Joelinton - but there was little improvement, with Wilson heading over a difficult chance from Almiron's cross.\nThe only consolation for Bruce and Newcastle supporters was that the margin of their defeat was not even greater.\n'We do OK then we throw a hand grenade in' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce told BBC Sport: \"We gave ourselves a mountain to climb. We've gifted them the first two goals. When you start like that it'll be a difficult afternoon.\n\"We changed formation at half-time and it helped us slightly but we couldn't recover from an awful 10 minutes. Since I've been here it's like this. We do OK for a while, then we throw a hand grenade in. We've got to be better than we were today.\"\nOn Yves Bissouma's red card: \"I don't know what the lad is doing. He was showboating before that and it's a nasty cut [to Jamal Lewis]. But it's not the cut we're worried about. He's got an abrasion on his eye, we think. By the letter of the law it's pretty obviously dangerous, I don't know why he's doing it when he's left a mess like that. I don't think he intended it but it's stupid.\"\nBrighton manager Graham Potter told BBC Sport: \"I'm delighted with the start. It reflects the attitude the players have had all week.\n\"To keep a clean sheet and score three goals, creating a few more opportunities and limiting our opponents to not much was positive. I'm delighted for the players. It's good to get up and running in the Premier League.\"\nOn Lamptey: \"He's so refreshing to work with. He threatens the back line with such pace but he also the desire to do it. He's a fantastic boy who wants to improve and help the team. He's a breath of fresh air since he has come in and I am delighted for him.\"\nOn Bissouma's red card: \"Knowing Yves there won't be any intent so it's whether it's an uncontrolled action. It's the one disappointing bit of the game. We're 3-0 up, there's no need for Yves to hurt the player - he's not that type of player anyway.\"\nBrighton find form on the road - the stats\nBrighton have won back-to-back away Premier League games for the first time since November 2017.\nNewcastle have lost three consecutive home Premier League matches for the first time since a run of five between August and October 2018.\nThis was Brighton's second away Premier League win against Newcastle, with the Magpies the only team the Seagulls have beaten more than once away from home in the Premier League.\nBrighton's Neal Maupay scored twice in the opening seven minutes of the match, the earliest a player has scored twice in a Premier League match since Edin Dzeko scored twice in the opening four minutes against Norwich for Manchester City in December 2012.\nBrighton have now won three of their past four away Premier League games (D1), as many as in their previous 27 games on the road (W3 D8 L15).\nNewcastle conceded twice in the opening 10 minutes of a home Premier League game for the first time since February 2011 against Arsenal, when they let three in.\nNewcastle defender Jamal Lewis has ended on the losing side in 12 of his 16 home Premier League games (11 for Norwich, one with Newcastle); among players to play at least 15 home games in the competition, no player has ended on the losing side in a higher proportion than Lewis' 75% (Kevin Kyle also lost 75% of his home games).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Tottenham for their next Premier League fixture on Sunday, 27 September (14:00 BST).

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool: Sadio Mane nets double against 10-man Blues\nLiverpool delivered a powerful statement of intent about their desire to retain the Premier League title with a comfortable dismissal of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on another nightmare day for keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nJurgen Klopp's champions were already in complete control even before Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen was correctly shown a red card on the stroke of half-time.\nReferee Paul Tierney initially opted for a yellow card but reviewed Christensen's desperate challenge on Sadio Mane as he raced on to Jordan Henderson's pass.\nMane then punished Chelsea with two swift goals after the break to confirm Liverpool's vast superiority, the second of which was the result of another calamity for Kepa.\nMane headed in Roberto Firmino's cross after 50 minutes then chased down Kepa, whose botched clearance gave the forward the simplest of finishes.\nChelsea's day of misery was complete when Jorginho, normally so reliable from the spot, saw his penalty saved by Alisson after Liverpool's new \u00a320m signing Thiago Alcantara, on as a half-time substitute, brought down Timo Werner.\nLiverpool send ominous message\nLiverpool were helped by Christensen's moment of sheer panic that reduced Chelsea to 10 men right on the break - but they were head and shoulders ahead of a negative home team even before that crucial moment.\nThe champions dominated from the first whistle and it seemed only a matter of time before they scored, pinning Chelsea back in their own territory and probing for openings at will.\nAnd when the breakthrough came, no-one deserved it more than Mane, now comfortable in world-class and willing to do the dirty work as well as apply the finishing touches.\nMane's first goal was a superb header but in many ways he summed up what makes him the complete attacker with his second, reacting with fury at giving the ball away before chasing down Kepa.\nThe Senegal forward's pace forced the error from a goalkeeper who does not necessarily need forcing into errors and effectively finished the contest with Liverpool's second.\nIt was all so easy for Liverpool after that, Thiago easing his way in as a substitute although there will be a concern about yet another injury for captain Henderson, who went off at half-time.\nChelsea pay for cautious approach\nThis was a brutal reality check for Chelsea after a summer of big spending by manager Frank Lampard - and surely the final flawed contribution from error-ridden keeper Kepa.\nChelsea's gameplan appeared to be to sit back and attempt to catch Liverpool on the break with Werner's pace but in the end it was all too passive, the home team resembling a side that would have been happy with a point.\nWerner showed the odd flashes of what he will undoubtedly bring to Chelsea but he was feeding off scraps at best here and his struggles reflected a surprisingly conservative approach.\nAs for Kepa, the \u00a371m keeper who has never lived up to his lavish price tag, this must surely be the final straw for Lampard, who dropped the goalkeeper last season and is now pursuing Rennes' keeper Edouard Mendy in a \u00a320m deal.\nKepa had already had a couple of near misses before he cleared the ball straight to Mane, who induced panic in the keeper and scored the visitors' second.\nLampard's side will have better days and patience will be required with such an influx of new faces, the likes of Thiago Silva, Ben Chilwell and Hakim Ziyech yet to be involved, but this will have been a real disappointment and is a missed opportunity to make a statement of their own.\n'Red card changes the face of the game' - what they said\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"For chances the first half was very even. The red card changes the face of the game, the talk I do at half-time, and it forces me into a reshuffle. It was always going to be difficult after that.\nOn the red card: \"I think it could be given or not. I was perhaps surprised it was given as a yellow first. If it was given as a red straight away, you continue with that.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's always a tough game here. I liked the first half. It was two teams that wanted to play, create, defend and make things happen.\n\"They were the dominant side without goals but then a massive game-changer in the last seconds which was good for us. We had to adapt to that and we did.\n\"We decided to bring Thiago on early because it was 11 v 10 and a player like him can command the rhythm. It was the perfect start for him and the boys helped him massively.\"\nBusy debut for Thiago - the best of the stats\nLiverpool are the first reigning champions to win away at Chelsea in the Premier League since Manchester United in April 2002, with the Blues unbeaten in 13 such matches since then before today (W7 D6).\nThis is only the third time Chelsea have lost their first home match of a Premier League season, also doing so against Blackburn in 1993-94 and Burnley in 2017-18.\nHalf of Liverpool's eight Premier League wins away at Chelsea have come in just six visits to Stamford Bridge under manager Jurgen Klopp (W4 D1 L1).\nChelsea had both a player sent off and missed a penalty in the Premier League for the first time since February 1999 against Blackburn, when Gianluca Vialli was sent off and Frank Leboeuf missed from the spot.\nJorginho missed a penalty for the first time in nine attempts for Chelsea in all competitions, while this was Alisson's first penalty save for Liverpool since joining the club (three faced). The penalty was also Alisson's first save of any kind in this season's Premier League.\nThis was the 13th time Mane scored more than once in a Premier League game, but the first away from home. The forward has scored in each of his last three away league games for Liverpool.\nDespite him only coming on as a second-half substitute, no Chelsea player completed more passes (75) or had more touches (89) than Liverpool debutant Thiago. His 75 successful passes was the most by a player to play 45 or fewer minutes in a Premier League game since 2003-04 (when full passing data is available).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Championship side Barnsley in the Carabao Cup third round on Wednesday, 23 September (19:45 BST kick-off), before travelling to West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday, 26 September (17:30 BST).\nLiverpool travel to Lincoln City for their Carabao Cup tie on Thursday, 24 September (19:45 BST). They are back in Premier League action against Arsenal at Anfield on Monday, 28 September (20:15 BST)."

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 1-0 Sheffield United: Ezri Konsa header gives Villa narrow win\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder criticised two \"major decisions\" from officials as Ezri Konsa's second-half header gave Aston Villa victory over the Blades, who played for 78 minutes with 10 men.\nKonsa headed in fellow defender Tyrone Mings' flick-on in the 63rd minute after Matt Targett whipped a corner in from the left for the only goal of the game.\nBut Wilder questioned referee Graham Scott's decisions to send off John Egan early in the game and not show a red a card to Villa's Targett for conceding a penalty, which John Lundstram saw saved by Villa debutant Emiliano Martinez with the score at 0-0.\nA lengthy VAR review showed Targett had clipped Chris Basham in the box, but the 'double jeopardy' rule - which means a player cannot be sent off when conceding a penalty if they were making an attempt to win the ball - saw the Villa left-back only pick up a booking.\nEgan, however, was dismissed for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity for tussling with Ollie Watkins, who looked to be in on goal in the 12th minute.\n\"Why didn't the referee go over to the monitor? I wouldn't come out here and mug myself off - if I thought it was a clear sending-off I'd say so,\" Wilder told Sky Sports.\n\"Why didn't he go to the monitor? Why didn't Stockley Park [where the VAR officials are based] say 'it's a bit of tussle and look at it yourself'?\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, he added: \"The penalty - Egan gets sent off 35 yards from goal, Matt Targett makes no effort to win the ball.\n\"The double jeopardy is only when the opposition player makes a challenge for the ball, the ball is four yards away, so [he can't reach it] unless he's got spider legs he can wrap around - and he hasn't because I've watched it.\"\nThe defeat was United's fifth in a row in the Premier League, including the end of last season, and despite regrouping from the sending-off, they could not hold out to earn a share of the points.\nMeanwhile, Villa continue where they left off at the end of the last campaign and are now unbeaten in their past five league games.\nReaction and analysis from Villa Park\nFootball Daily podcast: Comprehensive City, victorious Villa and adios Alli?\nMartinez heroics as Villa battle to victory\nVilla got off to a good start and within a minute right-back Matty Cash - making his debut - fired a dangerous ball into the box but John McGinn's volley flew over the bar.\nUnited also threatened in the early exchanges and Konsa had to slide in at the near post to prevent a low cross from the right being poked in by David McGoldrick.\nBut Villa were gifted the upper hand inside a quarter of an hour when Egan pulled back Watkins as he raced on to Mings' long ball and referee Scott showed the red card.\nDespite their numerical disadvantage, Lundstram could have given United the lead from the spot 20 minutes later but Martinez, who arrived from Arsenal for \u00a317m earlier this month, dived to his right to deny the midfielder.\nConor Hourihane's deliveries were causing problems and although Villa were unable to capitalise initially, they deserved to take the lead through Konsa's header after Jack Grealish and Watkins each went close.\nIt was Villa's second victory in a week after they overcame League One side Burton Albion in the Carabao Cup second round.\nBlades fail to recover from Egan red\nAfter going two goals down in their Premier League opener to Wolves within six minutes last Monday, Wilder would have hoped for a smoother start at Villa Park.\nBut again, a needless error from Egan made United's task much harder and Wilder was forced to sacrifice striker McGoldrick before the break.\nNew signing Ethan Ampadu's introduction was a shrewd tactical decision - releasing Basham into midfield and moving John Fleck across to deal with Cash.\nThe move paid off immediately with Basham making the forward run into the box to earn the penalty but Lundstram was unable to take advantage.\nUnited kept their organisation and steel at the back - pushing back every set-piece and squeezing out the space in which Villa tried to work for the next half an hour.\nBut Konsa's header was the key blow and while United had glimpses of hope on the counter-attack, they never truly tested Villa from open play.\nWhat they said\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith to BBC Sport: \"A very good start, to get three points and a clean sheet you can't ask for more. I thought we started the game the better and the game changes with the sending-off.\n\"We've worked on Tyrone Mings getting across the near post, flicking it on and Ezri Konsa arriving. It's difficult when they go in with two banks of four. We probably should have scored more. Since lockdown, defensively I think we've been more aggressive.\"\nA first for debutant Martinez - the best of the stats\nAston Villa have won three consecutive Premier League games at Villa Park for the first time since October 2007 under Martin O'Neill.\nVilla are unbeaten in their last 14 home league meetings with Sheffield United (W8 D6), including all five games against them at Villa Park in the Premier League (W4 D1).\nSheffield United have lost their opening two games to a top-flight season for the first time since 1973-74.\nSeven of Aston Villa's last nine Premier League goals have come from set-piece situations (four corners, three free-kicks).\nSheffield United have failed to win any of their 11 Premier League games in which they received a red card (D4 L7).\nKonsa has scored two goals in his last four league games, one more than he registered in his previous 137 in league competition.\nMartinez became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty on their debut for Aston Villa in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa travel to Bristol City in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Thursday (19:00 BST), before a visit to Fulham in the Premier League on Monday (18:00).\nSheffield United host Leeds United in the Premier League on Sunday (12:00).\nTricky Podcast: Has cancel culture gone too far?\nFootball Daily: Kepa crisis, magic Mane and super Son"

        "article_text": "Wolves 1-3 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola's side start with away win\nManchester City held off a second-half Wolves fightback to begin their quest to regain the Premier League title with a win at Molineux.\nCity did the damage in a superb first half as Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year Kevin de Bruyne and Phil Foden, playing for the first time since being sent home from England duty in disgrace, both found the net.\nAt that stage it seemed a case of how many the visitors would get, with Foden and Raheem Sterling both going close and Wolves keeper Rui Patricio making two decent saves.\nHowever, City ran out of steam after the break.\nDaniel Podence twice went close for the hosts and Kyle Walker hacked a scuffed Ruben Neves shot off the line, before Raul Jimenez, scorer of 27 goals last season, netted 12 minutes from time to give Wolves hope.\nHowever, they were unable to repeat last term's exploits, when they came back from 2-0 down to win this fixture, and Gabriel Jesus' injury-time effort sealed victory for Pep Guardiola's side.\nHow Man City have shown faith in Foden after England lapse\nFootball Daily podcast: Comprehensive City, victorious Villa and adios Alli?\nDe Bruyne and Foden shine\nDe Bruyne was superb in the number 10 role as City made light of the absence of seven senior players.\nIn opening the scoring from the penalty spot, after he had been fouled by Romain Saiss, the Belgian extended his record of being involved in more goals than any other player since the start of the 2019-20 league campaign.\nWhile it was those attributes that led to him winning the PFA prize despite playing for a team that finished the season 18 points behind champions Liverpool, it was De Bruyne's tenacious streak that came to the fore in the second period on Monday, when City had to be on their toes defensively and new \u00a340m centre-back Nathan Ake showed his class.\nBut if De Bruyne was the standout City player, it was also a good night for Foden.\nThe 20-year-old England midfielder has been shielded to an extent by City since that breach of coronavirus quarantine guidelines in Iceland, for which he has apologised. Whatever lessons Foden needs to learn off the field, he is evidently a very able student when it comes to matters on it.\nHis goal was a thing of beauty, as he firmly finished off a move he started from Sterling's cutback. Foden also nearly scored a sensational second with a floated effort that went narrowly wide of the far post.\nWolves pay for slow start\nIn signing his three-year contract extension, Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo has set himself the task of reshaping his team.\nMatt Doherty, who has gone to Tottenham, is yet to be replaced in the right wing-back role. Nelson Semedo is earmarked for that job but a \u00a330m deal is still to be completed.\nIn the meantime, Adama Traore is being asked to fill in. However, the Spaniard does not have a defender's instinct and can fail to read opponents' runs, and using him in that position blunts him as an attacking force.\nOn the other side, with Jonny on the long-term injured list, Nuno brought in Marcal from Lyon for \u00a33m. Unfortunately for the hosts, the game was barely five minutes old when the Brazilian wandered over to his manager to tell him he had to come off.\nIt weakened Wolves on both flanks and, in trying to cover, they were carved up down the middle.\nBy half-time, they were in big trouble. Coming back from 2-0 down to win the corresponding fixture 3-2 was one of the Premier League highlights of last season. With no fans in the stadium on Monday, the hosts had to try to generate their own momentum.\nThey rallied after the break and Podence crashed an effort off the frame of the goal before Neves' tame shot was turned away by City defender Walker. Podence's attempt to chip Ederson when clean through ended up on the roof of the net and Jimenez sent a good chance wide before the Mexico striker did eventually find the net, heading in after Podence had cleverly nutmegged De Bruyne.\nBut Wolves lost their way and City had the game under control before Jesus administered the final blow.\n'I expect us to suffer in moments' - what they said\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo to Sky Sports: \"The first half we didn't start very well. Manchester City moved the ball well and created a lot of problems for us. We conceded the penalty and from then on it become much harder. In the second half we improved. We created a lot of moments and chances we could score from. We knew one moment could change everything.\n\"We changed and tried to adapt. We blocked City's possession through the middle. We were able to press and recover the ball. We had a lot of things to change and work out. Too bad we didn't finish with a different end to the game.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola to Sky Sports: \"It was a good performance. We know how difficult it is. Sometimes the opening is good and sometimes we need more time to get our best conditions - but the start was good.\n\"The period that we are in and the situation that we had in these past two weeks, I expected that in some moments we would suffer, but in general we controlled the game.\"\n10 openers in a row - the best of the stats\nWolves have lost two of their past four Premier League home games, as many defeats as in their previous 13 at Molineux.\nCity have become the first team to win 10 opening Premier League games in a row.\nIt was Jimenez's sixth headed goal in the league since the start of last season - no player has scored more in that time.\nCity have won six Premier League games in a row for the first time since August 2019 (a run of 15).\nIn 2020, Manchester City have won more penalties than any other side in the English top flight (eight, scoring four).\nSince the start of last season, De Bruyne has been directly involved in more Premier League goals (35 - 14 goals, 21 assists) than any other player - three ahead of Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.\nSince the 2019-20 season restarted in June, Raheem Sterling has had a hand in 13 goals in 14 appearances for City (11 goals, two assists), with only Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Abameyang registering more in that time (14).\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to London Stadium to take on West Ham United on Sunday (19:00 BST kick-off).\nManchester City host Bournemouth in the Carabao Cup third round on Thursday (19:45), before taking on Leicester City at Etihad Stadium in the Premier League on Sunday (16:30).\nTricky Podcast: Has cancel culture gone too far?\nFootball Daily: Kepa crisis, magic Mane and super Son"

        "article_text": "Brighton 2-3 Man Utd: Dramatic injury-time penalty gives Manchester United victory\nA dramatic injury-time penalty gave Manchester United victory at Brighton and their first three points of the season in a stunning game at Amex Stadium.\nA match packed full of incident was settled with the very final kick as Bruno Fernandes coolly stroked in the winning penalty, spotted and awarded via a VAR check for Neal Maupay's handball from a corner, all after on-field official Chris Kavanagh had blown to signal the end of the match.\nJust moments before, Brighton thought they had sealed a point that would have been the least they deserved when Solly March headed in a cross from Alireza Jahanbakhsh.\nIt was a fitting finale to a madcap, seesaw game that had seen Albion take the lead through a Maupay penalty before United clawed their way back into the ascendency thanks to a Lewis Dunk own goal and a superb solo effort from Marcus Rashford.\nAs if that wasn't enough, the home side also struck the woodwork five times (with Leandro Trossard responsible for three of them), saw one awarded penalty overruled by VAR and another potential one waved away by Kavanagh.\nOn top of that, the visitors had two goals ruled out for offside.\nBut despite still being far from their best, it is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side who emerge with a first win of the Premier League campaign, helping quieten some of the criticism that followed their surprise opening-game loss to Crystal Palace.\nFor Brighton, it is a flooring loss at the end of an emotional rollercoaster - their second from three games.\nWhat did we learn from Man Utd's chaotic win at Brighton?\nAction and reaction from Brighton v Man Utd, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v singer-songwriter Declan McKenna\nUnited show fighting spirit\nIt speaks to the shambolic nature of United's defeat by Palace that such a chaotic and fortunate win is a step forward for Solskjaer's side.\nThere was still plenty to be critical about in their display at the Amex - a still ropey-looking defence that tried but ultimately failed to protect a 2-1 lead, a midfield packed with quality but lacking the cohesion witnessed in the run-in last season and a big gulf in quality from first XI to the bench.\nFernandes may have scored the winning penalty, but he was at fault for the one from which Brighton scored the opener, courtesy of a clumsy foul on the again lively Tariq Lamptey.\nHarry Maguire played his part in their equaliser to that opener with his presence in the Brighton box forcing Dunk to poke in Nemanja Matic's headed cross, but he was nowhere when March headed home late on.\nHowever, the United boss can now at least point to a fighting spirit, depth of resolve and signs of sharpness returning to his forward three as pillars on which to build.\nRashford was particularly impressive and involved in much of their good attacking play.\nAlthough he twice wandered slightly offside to cause the ruling out of two goals - firstly for Greenwood and then himself - he made amends with a brilliant solo goal.\nHaving driven into the box, the England forward turned one way and the next and past flailing Brighton tackles before firing a deflected shot into the net.\nDavid de Gea also deserves some credit for a superb point-blank save to deny Trossard just moments before March's header sparked the injury-time madness.\nBrighton victims of their own profligacy\nIn the closing stages of the game, the television cameras captured Brighton boss Graham Potter in slow motion in an extended, lip-wobbling exhale, and make no wonder.\nHaving impressed in defeat by Chelsea before wiping the floor with Newcastle, his side again demonstrated what they are about with a patient, effective and incisive display that should have got them a point and could easily have given them all three.\nThat they did not get either is partly down to a new handball law that continues to harshly penalise defenders, but also their own failure to take the chances that came their way.\nTrossard is a superb player and was central to Albion's display but he has developed a frustrating knack for hitting the woodwork as opposed to the net.\nHe was somewhat unfortunate with the two long-range efforts that struck the post in the first half, but he should definitely have scored with the second-half shot that hit the bar.\nThe salt in Brighton's wounds is the fact that they had a penalty of their own overturned by VAR after the break, although when they view it back they may agree with the officials that Connolly was pulling Pogba's shirt before then tumbling under a clumsy challenge.\nJust three months ago, Potter's team were outclassed here by United, going down 3-0 without having laid a glove on them.\nThis, then, is definite progress and something on which to build once the disappointment of the result subsides.\nBy quirk of fate, these two get to do it all again on Wednesday, when they meet in a Carabao Cup fourth-round tie.\nBrighton claim unwanted record\nBrighton hit the woodwork five times in this game, the most team any team has done in a single Premier League game since Opta started recording this data (2003-04).\nManchester United have won each of the past four Premier League meetings with Brighton, their joint-longest winning streak against a current top-flight side (also 4 v Leicester).\nSince the start of last season, Manchester United's Premier League games have produced 20 penalties, the most of any team in that time (15 for, 5 against).\nManchester United have given away a penalty in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since March 2009; it's the first time the Red Devils have conceded one in both of their first two games in a Premier League campaign.\nTariq Lamptey is the first player ever to win penalties in consecutive Premier League appearances for Brighton.\nManchester United's David de Gea has saved just two of the 29 penalties he has faced in the Premier League. Of goalkeepers to face 25+ spot-kicks in the competition, only Paul Robinson has saved a lower proportion (6.1% to De Gea's 6.9%).\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2017, Brighton's Lewis Dunk has scored five own goals in the competition, at least two more than any other player.\nManchester United's Bruno Fernandes has been involved in 17 goals in his 16 Premier League appearances (9 goals, 8 assists).\nFernandes' goal for Manchester United at 99:45 is the latest scored in the Premier League since Juan Mata's strike for Chelsea against Norwich in August 2011 (100:03).\nLeandro Trossard is the first player to hit the woodwork three times in a Premier League match since Cristiano Ronaldo vs Newcastle United in October 2006.\nWhat's next?\nAfter Wednesday's Carabao Cup tie, Brighton travel to Everton for a 15:00 BST kick-off on Saturday, 3 October.\nUnited are at home against Jose Mourinho's Tottenham the day after (16:30).\nCancel Culture: Has it gone too far?\nVideo Games: The industries problems with inclusion"

Indeed, 31 of his 32 goals in the competition have come from inside the box.\nOnly Wilfried Zaha (23) has provided more assists for Crystal Palace in the Premier League than Andros Townsend (18).\n'Totally unacceptable' - what they said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"I predict what will happen is players will start flicking the ball on to a hand and screaming 'handball'.\n\"A really good game destroyed by a decision. I do not believe in the rule. People in football find it hard to accept. The referee doesn't think it is handball either. He doesn't want to give it but has to because that's what he is told to do.\n\"We have lost in a way I find totally unacceptable.\"\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti: \"I'm really pleased for the result. The first half was good, second half was more difficult because Crystal Palace put a lot of pressure on us.\nWe defended well but we could play better with the ball. It is good to see the spirit in the team in this moment. We have started the season well.\n\"We have to look only for the momentum, that is good in this moment. In a busy time with another game on Wednesday, we have to keep the motivation and ambition. The danger is behind us all the time when we do not behave properly.\"\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Chelsea in their next Premier League game on Saturday, 3 October (12:30 BST).

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 3-3 Chelsea: Tammy Abraham scores stoppage-time equaliser\nTammy Abraham scored a stoppage-time equaliser to complete an incredible comeback and rescue a point for Chelsea at West Bromwich Albion after they had trailed 3-0 at half-time.\nIn a thrilling match, West Brom looked to be heading for their first win back in the Premier League after racing into a commanding lead inside the opening 30 minutes at The Hawthorns.\nA mistake by Marcos Alonso led to the hosts' first, Matheus Pereira feeding Callum Robinson to produce a classy finish past Willy Caballero, who was starting in place of dropped \u00a371m keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nThiago Silva, who was making his Premier League debut for Chelsea, was then too casual in possession, allowing Robinson to pounce and run at goal before doubling the lead with another impressive finish.\nRemarkably, it was quickly 3-0 as Kyle Bartley was left unmarked to tap home inside the six-yard box after the visitors failed to deal with a corner.\nBut Frank Lampard's side rallied after the break and Mason Mount reduced the deficit from 20 yards.\nSubstitute Callum Hudson-Odoi set up a tense finale with a stylish finish, before Abraham, making his first top-flight start of the season, tapped home the equaliser in the 93rd minute after Mount's shot had been saved.\nAlthough West Brom boss Slaven Bilic was unhappy the goal stood because of a Kai Havertz handball in the build-up.\nHe said: \"It's not maybe handball - it is handball. It's so obvious I don't even want to talk about it.\"\n'Big lesson for Chelsea' - plus vote for your favourite Premier League comeback\nReaction from The Hawthorns, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nMixed feelings for Lampard\nBlues boss Frank Lampard looked furious slumped in his seat in the dugout after sending his players out early for the start of the second half following a horrific defensive display.\nHaving been handed the captain's armband on his first Premier League appearance since arriving on a free transfer, this was supposed to be a day to remember for 36-year-old Brazil centre-back Silva.\nInstead, his mistake allowed Robinson to get his second after the former Sheffield United forward had broken the deadlock following Alonso's careless header.\nIt went from bad to worse when no-one picked up defender Bartley to make it 3-0, before Chelsea finally got a grip thanks to goals from three homegrown players.\nSince the start of last season, Chelsea have conceded more away Premier League goals than any other team but as bad as they were at the back, Lampard's side were always a threat going forward.\nTimo Werner had already hit the bar when Baggies keeper Sam Johnstone was left rooted to his line by Mount's finish, which launched the comeback.\nHudson-Odoi's classy finish left West Brom a bag of nerves, although it took until the third minute of stoppage time for Abraham to equalise.\nDespite spending \u00a3200m-plus on strengthening his squad, Lampard still has work to do if Chelsea are to claim another top-four finish.\nHaving lost against champions Liverpool last weekend, they have dropped five points in their past two games and looked a mess during a shambolic first 45 minutes.\nBaggies let it slip\nThis was a case of so near yet so far for West Brom, who are still searching for a first win since returning to the Premier League.\nThey have conceded 11 goals in 270 minutes of top-flight action - but when the dust settles Slaven Bilic will surely seize on the positives from this incident-packed encounter.\nRobinson showed excellent composure for both his finishes, while Pereira has been directly involved in three of West Brom's five Premier League goals this season.\nAfter following up his goal and assist at Everton last week, the Brazilian provided the pass for Robinson's first goal.\nAbraham's late equaliser will hurt but if Bilic can tighten up his defence, the Baggies could give themselves a fighting chance this season after showing they have the ammunition to cause problems in attack.\n'We knew second half would be hard' - what they said\nWest Brom boss Slaven Bilic: \"We played the game we wanted to play. You can't plan you are going to outclass them but you can outrun them, have the right determination and concentration, make them make mistakes and punish them.\n\"We knew the second half was going to be hard for us. We knew we would have to defend as a team quite deep and the plan was to limit them to shots outside the box.\n\"It's disappointing as the boys did well enough to get all three points.\"\nOne of the best Premier League comebacks? The stats\nChelsea are the first Premier League team since West Ham in February 2011 to avoid defeat after trailing by three or more goals at half-time, a game which was also against West Brom at The Hawthorns and also ended 3-3.\nWest Brom are the first English top-flight side to concede 11 goals in their opening three league games since Arsenal in 1963-64 (12).\nChelsea have failed to keep a clean sheet in 20 of their 21 Premier League away games under Lampard.\nRobinson's four goal involvements in the Premier League have all come against 'big six' sides, scoring three times against Chelsea and providing an assist versus Manchester United.\nChelsea were 3-0 down after 27 minutes against West Brom - only against Manchester City in February 2019 (19 minutes) have they been three goals down earlier in a Premier League match.\nSilva is the first outfield player to make an error leading to a goal on their Premier League debut since Issa Diop for West Ham against Arsenal in August 2018.\nWhat's next?\nWhile West Brom have a week to prepare for a league game at Southampton on 4 October (12:00 BST), Chelsea are away to Tottenham in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday (19:45).\nCancel Culture: Has it gone too far?\nVideo Games: The industry's problem with inclusion"

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-1 Southampton: Danny Ings earns Saints first Premier League win\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said they \"need players\" after Danny Ings' early goal earned Southampton a first top-flight victory at Turf Moor for almost 50 years and ended the visitors' losing start to the season.\nFormer Clarets forward Ings struck in the fifth minute, supplied by Che Adams's cutback following an excellent through ball by Kyle Walker-Peters.\nInjury-hit Burnley, without seven senior players, had claims for a penalty dismissed by referee Andre Marriner - and the video assistant referee - midway through the first half after striker Chris Wood went down under pressure from Jan Bednarek.\nWood went close to an equaliser immediately after half-time but Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy was equal to his low header from Ashley Westwood's cross.\nMcCarthy was again called upon to stop Charlie Taylor's powerful first-time strike from the edge of the penalty area as the hosts - who remain without a point from two games - pressed for a leveller.\nSouthampton failed to register a shot on target following Ings' early goal but held firm in response to conceding five at Tottenham last weekend as they sealed a first win at Burnley in the top flight since March 1971.\n\"The chairman knows what is required. Action. We need players. It is a challenge though, here, it always has been,\" Dyche told Sky Sports.\n\"We have two experienced defenders on the bench and that is it. We are reliant on what we have. It is a challenge but we will have players back fit.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, he added: \"We have been very unfortunate with injuries. We are stretched. The players are giving me everything. I've mentioned it for a number of months now - it's down to the chairman and the board to make those decisions.\"\nReaction to Burnley v Southampton and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nIngs proves decisive once again\nRalph Hasenhuttl's side largely answered his pre-match calls to prove they were better than their opening results and performances had suggested, producing the gritty display necessary to take the points at Turf Moor.\nSouthampton lost both league games to Burnley last season - including a 3-0 loss in Lancashire - but they offered a resolute response to Sunday's concerning 5-2 defeat by Tottenham.\nOnce again it was Ings who made the difference for Saints, though it was summer signing Walker-Peters who stepped up from right-back to produce the defence-splitting pass which allowed Adams to tee up his strike partner.\nEngland forward Ings, fresh from finishing as joint-second top goalscorer in the Premier League last season, has now scored 46% (25) of Southampton's past 54 goals in the competition and looks ready to mount another Golden Boot challenge.\nWith no other Saints player scoring more than five in that time, he will be required to if they are to improve on last season's 11th-place finish.\nHowever, following the heavy defeat by Spurs - which featured a worrying second-half collapse - just as pleasing for Hasenhuttl will surely be the enduring focus and desire to see out a clean sheet on Saturday, despite coming under late pressure.\nJannik Vestergaard came into the defence to partner Bednarek at the expense of Jack Stephens and the pair settled in well, producing 13 clearances apiece in front of McCarthy, who himself delivered when called upon.\n\"It wasn't a good start to the season but we have focused our work this week on the defence and it was fantastic to see how much they had invested today,\" said Saints manager Hasenhuttl.\nHe added: \"In the end we had a very important win for us. We had a non-existent pre-season, we couldn't prepare for the first game and we have had no chance to work on anything before this week. Suddenly it looks different, more organised - this is the key to winning.\"\nBurnley's threadbare squad stretched to its limit\nThe challenge facing the Clarets boss at the start of this season was visible for all to see at Turf Moor - with Dyche himself perhaps hoping to emphasise a point of his own.\nOn his 400th game as a manager - his 351st at Burnley - Dyche chose to make no substitutions as his side sought a route back into the contest.\nWith key figures in captain Ben Mee, James Tarkowski, Ashley Barnes, Johann Berg Gudmundsson, Jack Cork, Robbie Brady and, most recently, Jay Rodriguez sidelined, Dyche named four players on his bench aged 21 or under and yet to play a Premier League game.\nDyche has rightly been lauded for his ability to deliver with a modestly assembled Clarets squad - delivering a second top-10 finish in five Premier League seasons in 2019-20 - but an already threadbare squad is operating at its limit.\nThe hosts were bolstered by the arrival of midfielder Dale Stephens from Brighton on Thursday and, out of necessity above all else, he was thrust into the Clarets' midfield for his debut on Saturday.\nOn his 100th Premier League appearance, Stephens demonstrated why Dyche wanted to add him to his ranks, as the 31-year-old made more tackles than any other player.\nIt was Wood who led the hosts' attempts to claw back level but, after seeing his header well saved by McCarthy, he was flagged for offside before rounding the Saints goalkeeper as he missed out on becoming the first Clarets player to score in five successive top-flight games since Willie Irvine in 1966.\nDyche reiterated his message to the board through his absence of changes late on and, with little over a week of the transfer window remaining, he will be desperate to add further reinforcements.\nBurnley's worst start since they were relegated - the stats\nSouthampton's victory ended a six-match winless streak at Turf Moor.\nSaints striker Ings has scored 10 goals in 12 Premier League appearances since football restarted in June after the coronavirus shutdown.\nMeanwhile, Adams has been directly involved in four goals in his past five league games for Southampton - one more than in his first 28 combined.\nBurnley have lost their first two matches in a top-flight season for the first time since 2014-15, when they were relegated.\nThe Clarets have lost three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since a run of four ending in January earlier this year.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host Manchester City in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday (19:30 BST) before travelling to Newcastle United in the Premier League on Saturday (20:00).\nSouthampton welcome West Brom to St Mary's in the league on Sunday (12:00).\nCancel Culture: Has it gone too far?\nVideo Games: The industry's problem with inclusion"

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 0-1 Leeds United: Patrick Bamford heads in late winner\nPatrick Bamford's late header earned Leeds United a hard-fought victory over Sheffield United, who are still searching for their first points of the season.\nAfter both goalkeepers excelled, it looked as though a first Premier League derby between the two Yorkshire sides in 26 years was heading for a goalless draw.\nBut with two minutes remaining, Bamford rose at the back post to meet Jack Harrison's cross and head in his third goal of the season to send Leeds' players and staff wild.\nIt was just reward for a second half in which Leeds continued to ask questions of home keeper Aaron Ramsdale.\nSheffield United, who have never previously failed to score in their opening three league fixtures, will regret John Lundstram's first-half shot being superbly saved by Illan Meslier.\nBut a second win of the season for Leeds, and a clean sheet, having conceded seven goals in their opening two games, will be relished by their fans - especially against one of their fiercest rivals.\nReaction to Sheffield United v Leeds and live text coverage of Sunday's Premier League games\nMeslier lays groundwork for Leeds victory\nLeeds have enjoyed an entertaining start to the season, having scored and conceded seven goals in their opening two fixtures against Liverpool and Fulham.\nThe fact they pushed the champions close in a 4-3 loss at Anfield and held out to beat Fulham by the same scoreline suggests they will win many new fans this campaign.\nBut against Sheffield United they showed they could grind out a victory and were thankful to Frenchman Meslier, who excelled in goal.\nIn thwarting Lundstram from eight yards, he pulled off one of the saves of the season so far. He also denied George Baldock with another superb effort.\nLed superbly by midfielder Kalvin Phillips - a timely performance, with England manager Gareth Southgate watching - Marcelo Bielsa's side created plenty of chances themselves in a finely-balanced game.\nBut they could not find their way past Ramsdale, who denied Luke Ayling and Stuart Dallas' toe-poke in the first half before other efforts from Helder Costa and Bamford after the break.\nWhen Dallas finally rounded Ramsdale from Ayling's long through-ball, Chris Basham cleared his tame effort off the line.\nBut Leeds finally found a way through in the 88th minute as Bamford nodded in a downward header to clinch three points.\nBlades paying for lack of punch up front\nWilder will feel like misfortune is becoming too common a companion for his side, who unexpectedly finished ninth last season after their return to the Premier League following a 12-year hiatus.\nHaving lost to Wolves in their opening game, they also lost John Egan to a contested red card in the defeat by Aston Villa - although Ethan Ampadu was an able deputy here - and Wilder said before kick-off that defender Jack O'Connell would need surgery on an injured knee.\nBut for a team built on a solid defence, their big problem is the lack of goals, an issue that has been underlined this season.\nThey had the chances to score and having weathered an early Leeds onslaught, finished the first half on top.\nLundstram, who was a key scorer for the Blades in the first half of last season, should have beaten Meslier after David McGoldrick's clever flick from Ben Osborn's cross.\nFive minutes before half-time the Leeds keeper showed his class again with a fine save from Baldock's rising drive and Enda Stevens could not find a way through in the second half.\nBut it was a barren day for Blades front pair of Oli Burke and McGoldrick, who did not have a shot on target between them.\nAs they pressed for a winner, with substitute Billy Sharp aiming to score against his former team, they began to leave gaps at the back which Leeds exploited.\nDefeat leaves Wilder's team at the bottom of the table and their task is not set to get any easier with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City all to come next month.\n'It's not going our way' - what the managers said\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder told BBC Sport: \"They are a decent team, a high energy, high tempo side and I thought we matched that. It's all about creating chances and putting them in the back of the net. We did the first bit but couldn't do the second bit.\n\"It's not going our way at the moment but it is a time to stand up stick your chest out and show what you are about in a lot of ways. Bravery in and out of possession, brave as a team. We have enough characters in there. It was a really tight game and the players will be thinking it's one that has got away.\"\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa said: \"I have already experienced a Yorkshire derby in the Championship but it is different in the Premier League. When there are no fans it is hard to compare. The games are very competitive and it is hard to impose yourself. The difference between the two teams was not a lot.\"\nOn suggestions Patrick Bamford might struggle in the Premier League, he added: \"There are a lot of people who thought contrary to what you say. The league season is very long. Hopefully he can continue to show his obvious qualities.\"\nBlades' worst run since 2013 - the stats\nSheffield United have lost their opening three league matches of a season for only the third time, also doing so in 1966-67 and 1995-96.\nSheffield United have lost their past six league matches, their worst run since September 2013 (also six in a row).\nLeeds have won 14 of their past 17 league matches, keeping clean sheets in 11 of those wins.\nBamford is the first player in Leeds' history to score in his first three top-flight appearances for the club.\nThe Leeds striker became the first player since Mick Jones in the 1968-69 season to score in Leeds' first three matches of a top-flight season.\nBamford is only the third player to score on matchday one, two and three of a Premier League season for a newly promoted team.\nWhat's next?\nLeeds welcome Manchester City to Elland Road on Saturday (17:30 BST), while Sheffield United travel to Arsenal on Sunday (12:00).\nCancel Culture: Has it gone too far?\nVideo Games: The industries problem with inclusion"

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Newcastle United: Magpies rescue late point amid VAR controversy\nNewcastle rescued an injury-time point against Tottenham Hotspur from the penalty spot entirely against the run of play after another controversial handball decision.\nSpurs could have been 5-0 up if they had taken their chances by the time Andy Carroll headed a cross against Eric Dier's arm from close range. The decision was made after video assistant referee consultation.\nCallum Wilson stepped up to score the penalty with practically the last kick - and Spurs boss Jose Mourinho walked down the tunnel in disgust.\nLucas Moura had put Spurs ahead at the back post from a low cross by Harry Kane, the England striker's fifth assist in two league games.\nSpurs would have been out of sight had it not been for Magpies keeper Karl Darlow, who made 11 saves - including two excellent ones to deny Kane.\nSon Heung-min, who scored four goals in last weekend's 5-2 win over Southampton, hit the woodwork twice but was replaced at half-time.\nNewcastle were cautious and created very few chances as they failed to have a shot on target until the late, late drama.\n'Football has lost the plot with handball', says Bruce - despite profiting from controversial penalty\n'VAR is ruining our game'\n\"VAR is ruining our game,\" said BBC Radio 5 Live pundit Clinton Morrison after seeing the late drama.\nAnd Spurs boss Mourinho clearly agreed as he stormed away following Wilson's equaliser - although he would not speak about it at full-time.\nThe decision came after a long wait - with four minutes between the incident and the goal. Dier had his arms in the air while he was jumping with Carroll, with his back to the Newcastle striker, who headed the ball directly against his arm from inches away.\nVAR checked whether there was an offside in the build-up and then if it was a handball.\nPeter Bankes eventually went over to the monitor and pointed to the spot. Spurs coach Nuno Santos was sent off for his angry reaction.\nThe Premier League admitted at the start of the season there would be more penalties for handball. And they were right.\nDier's arms were not next to his body and that is why it was a penalty by the new laws, although football fans, managers, players and pundits all agree it has to change.\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson said on Saturday that it is \"killing the game of football\".\nMorrison said: \"I would take the handball rule away from the VAR officials. I like it that the referee goes to the monitor because the players will respect it more. I don't blame the referee, I blame VAR. That is the problem.\"\nWe have not heard the last of this.\nSpurs can't take their chances\nSpurs were hugely unfortunate - but they will have to take some blame for their poor finishing.\nWatched on by Gareth Bale, not yet fit to play, and with Dele Alli left out of the squad entirely, they started brightly.\nKane and Darlow's personal battle started in the third minute. The keeper pulled off a fantastic double save to keep out Giovani lo Celso's free-kick and Kane's close-range follow up.\nAfter nine minutes he kept out Kane's header from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's cross.\nKane may have been kept scoreless but he has developed a role as a creator in the past week. It was his ball across the six-yard box that was converted by Moura at the back post.\nHe has set up five goals in his last two Premier League games - having created all of Son's goals last weekend. That equals his assist tally from the previous 54 league matches. Seven - back in 2016-17 - is the most he has set up in a Premier League season.\nKane had a 25-yard effort saved by a diving Darlow and then found Son, who hit the post from outside the box.\nSon then hit crossbar from a similar distance after good play by Matt Doherty.\nThe South Korean was replaced by Steven Bergwijn at half-time.\nIt was more of the same in the second half as Moura had a couple of headers saved by Darlow, who kept out two Lo Celso efforts and an Erik Lamela free-kick.\nProbably the closest they came to conceding before the end was when Hojbjerg almost scored a late own goal after getting in the way of Ben Davies' clearance.\nThey were made to pay when Wilson scored with only Newcastle's third shot on target in three Premier League games this season. They have scored all of them.\nWilson sets record with late goal - match stats\nNewcastle have lost just two of their last seven Premier League away games against Tottenham (W4 D1), conceding no more than a single goal in any of those games.\nNewcastle (W1 D1) have started a Premier League campaign unbeaten in their opening two away games for the first time since 2011-12.\nSince Opta began collecting exact Premier League goal times in 2006, Callum Wilson's penalty equaliser for Newcastle (96:20) is the latest any side has scored with their first shot on target.\nLucas Moura's opener for Tottenham was his first Premier League goal since December 2019 against Wolves, ending a run of 22 games in the competition without finding the back of the net.\nNo player has provided more assists in the opening three matchdays of a Premier League season than Tottenham's Harry Kane this campaign (5 - level with Ruel Fox for Newcastle in 1994-95 and Henrikh Mkhitaryan for Man Utd in 2017-18).\nKarl Darlow's 11 saves in this game was the most by a Newcastle goalkeeper in a Premier League match since Tim Krul made 14 against Tottenham in November 2013.\nWhat's next?\nSpurs have three games next week - at home to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Tuesday, hosting Maccabi Haifa in the Europa League play-off on Thursday and visiting Manchester United next Sunday in the league.\nNewcastle visit Newport in the cup on Wednesday and host Burnley in the league on Sunday.\nLawro's predictions v singer-songwriter Declan McKenna\nCancel Culture: Has it gone too far?\nVideo Games: The industries problem with inclusion"

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-5 Leicester City: Jamie Vardy hat-trick inspires visitors to comeback win\nJamie Vardy scored a hat-trick as Leicester City inflicted a remarkable defeat on Manchester City to go top of the Premier League.\nDespite going behind to a superb fourth-minute strike by former Foxes midfielder Riyad Mahrez, the visitors responded in stunning fashion.\nVardy levelled with a penalty before the break after he had been fouled by Kyle Walker, and he then sealed his second treble against Pep Guardiola's side from the spot, after he had cleverly turned home Timothy Castagne's cross to make it 2-1.\nJames Maddison scored for the first time since 1 January when he curled home a stunning fourth for Leicester.\nAnd although Nathan Ake pulled one back with his first goal since a \u00a340m summer move from Bournemouth, a third Leicester penalty - this time converted by Youri Tielemans because Vardy had already gone off - completed a memorable afternoon for Brendan Rodgers' Foxes, who have started a top-flight season with three successive wins for the first time.\nIn contrast, Guardiola was suffering his worst home defeat as City boss, with his team now in the bottom half of the table.\n'Man City have bigger problems than defence' - Darren Fletcher analysis\n'They were lucky' - Rodri says 'football was not fair' to Man City in Leicester defeat\nMan City agree \u00a365m deal for Benfica's Dias\nReaction to Manchester City v Leicester and live text coverage of Sunday's Premier League games\nFearsome Vardy\nFor most of the opening period, the possibility of Leicester returning to the top of the table appeared remote.\nBut with Vardy they always have a chance. Even at the age of 33, the striker remains frighteningly fast.\nWalker is no slouch but the England right-back was panicked into making a rash challenge when the Leicester forward got ahead of him inside the box. Vardy's powerful spot-kick gave Ederson no chance of keeping it out.\nHis second penalty was equally emphatic after another City defender, Eric Garcia, had got himself into the wrong position as he tried to challenge Vardy.\nIn between, Vardy tucked home a poacher's effort Leicester's most celebrated old boy, Gary Lineker, would have been proud of. The supplier was Castagne, who is turning into a very astute purchase, given how willing the Belgian is to push forward from his right-back role as manager Rodgers demands.\nMaddison's return adds the dimension the Foxes lacked so badly as their 2019-20 season petered out into a relatively disappointing fifth-place finish.\nThe only sour note for the visitors were injuries to midfielder Dennis Praet and defender Jonny Evans.\nThe latter in particular may prompt some hard thinking among the Leicester hierarchy, given they had a \u00a330m bid for Burnley centre-back James Tarkowski turned down on Friday.\nMan City to make market move\nIt is now just a matter of time before Benfica defender Ruben Dias completes his move to the Eithad. And on this evidence, the Portugal international cannot come soon enough. The fee will be about \u00a365m, with centre-back Nicolas Otamendi going the other way for about \u00a313.7m in a separate deal.\nGuardiola has made the purchase of a right-sided central defender a priority before the transfer window closes on 5 October. He does not trust either Otamendi or England international John Stones in that role - and he knows if the situation is not addressed, the chances of City overhauling Liverpool are almost non-existent.\nAgainst Leicester, Eric Garcia, wearing a headguard to protect the 16 stitches he sustained during a training ground incident that kept him out of the season opener at Wolves, started in the position earmarked for 23-year-old Dias.\nIn defence, it was an orthodox role in a four-man backline. But as soon as the hosts were in possession - which was fairly often - Garcia became the central component of a back three, which skipper Fernandinho was part of, allowing Walker and Benjamin Mendy to turn into wing-backs.\nGarcia's future is unclear. The 19-year-old Spaniard has a year left on his contract, has refused to sign another and wants to go back to Barcelona.\nPlenty of problems for Guardiola\nGuardiola spoke earlier this month about the need to deserve a new contract.\nThat requires his team to compete for trophies - and to do that they will need to perform a lot better than this.\nWith Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Aguero definitely missing next Saturday's trip to Leeds United, City need to solve their problems in attack, given Raheem Sterling failed to make much of an impact as a false nine and 17-year-old Liam Delap cannot be expected to shoulder the burden given his lack of experience.\nGuardiola will spend some time pondering the problem. However, given they have only played two games, he will do so with his team in 13th place, which is virtually unheard of in recent times.\nLeicester's best ever start - the stats\nIt is the first time in 686 games that a side managed by Guardiola has conceded five goals.\nIt is also the first time in 438 games at Etihad Stadium that City have let in five goals.\nThis was only the second time Guardiola has lost his opening home game of a league season as a manager.\nLeicester have won their opening three games of a top-flight season for the first time.\nThe Foxes have scored 12 goals in the Premier League this season, the most by a team in their first three matches since Manchester City (12) and Manchester United (13) in 2012-13.\nLeicester are the first Premier League side to score three penalties in a game, while Manchester City are the first side to concede three spot-kicks in the same fixture since Tottenham in October 2014.\nVardy has now scored eight league goals against Manchester City since Guardiola took charge in 2016.\nVardy is the only player to score two hat-tricks against sides managed by Guardiola.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2014, Vardy has won more (19) and scored more (22) penalties than any other player in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City go to Burnley in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday (19:00 BST), before travelling to Elland Road to play newly promoted Leeds in the Premier League on Saturday (17:30).\nLeicester's next game is at home to West Ham United in the league on Sunday (12:00).\nCancel Culture: Has it gone too far?\nVideo Games: The industry's problem with inclusion"

        "article_text": "West Ham United 4-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Jarrod Bowen scores twice as Hammers register first win\nJarrod Bowen scored twice as West Ham registered their first Premier League win of the season against a disappointing Wolves side.\nThe result lifts the Hammers from 18th up to 10th in the table, with Wolves dropping down to 16th.\nIt was no more than the hosts deserved, David Moyes' side delivering a fine performance while he controlled team affairs from home after testing positive for coronavirus on Tuesday.\nDominant throughout, they rarely looked like relinquishing their lead once Bowen had opened the scoring at the London Stadium.\nBowen, who had managed just one goal for West Ham since joining them in January, superbly set them on their way, curling a left-foot effort into the bottom corner after being sent clear by Pablo Fornals' quick free-kick.\nThe former Hull forward doubled West Ham's lead after the break, prodding in from close range after a Fornal effort had come back off the post.\nThe Hammers had lost each of their last four top-flight fixtures against Wolves without scoring a single goal, but they created several excellent chances to put the game out of sight.\nTomas Soucek made it three with a header that flicked in off Raul Jimenez from Aaron Cresswell's corner, and Sebastien Haller's stoppage time header added the gloss to a fine victory.\nReaction from all of Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v singer-songwriter Declan McKenna\nA performance to please the absent Moyes\nAfter showing improvement in their narrow defeat to Arsenal last Saturday this performance represented a large leap in the right direction for the Hammers.\nHaving started the evening in the bottom three, few would have predicted that they would end up thrashing Wolves using a similar template.\nWhile manager Moyes was not present, it was clear from the opening moments that his side had been set up to operate on the counter-attack.\nThat, coupled with taking advantage of a 3-4-3 Wolves formation without natural full-backs, helped the Hammers establish control.\nRyan Fredericks, Bowen, Arthur Masuaku and Fornals all impressed working in or coming off wide positions and Michail Antonio's physical presence and pace provided another type of outlet up front.\nThe 30-year-old, who has kept record signing Haller out of the side since his conversion into a central striker at the end of last season, was a menace throughout.\nAnd he tellingly contributed to both of the hosts' opening two goals, winning a free-kick from Willy Boly for the first and powering clear on the left to tee up Fornals before Bowen's second.\nMoyes, communicating with assistant Alan Irvine from home throughout, will have been buoyed by the nature of the victory and the fact that his side could have enjoyed an even more emphatic win, had Fornals and Soucek both converted good chances from close range.\nIt was also the perfect way in which to go into a challenging set of fixtures in October when the Hammers will face Leicester, Tottenham, Manchester City and champions Liverpool.\nWoeful Wolves lack threat\nWhile Wolves enjoyed the majority of possession they simply lacked the speed of thought and foot to trouble the hosts.\nAdama Traore barely got a touch on the right of their attacking trio, while behind him debutant Nelson Semedo endured a tough start to life in the Premier League after signing from Barcelona.\nThe Portugal full-back, who was deployed on the right of a midfield four, was eventually withdrawn, while Pedro Neto, who did show purpose on opposite flank, was too often ignored to make an impact.\nIn many ways Ruben Neves' 45th-minute shot summed up Wolves' evening, lacking in power and conviction to beat Lukasz Fabianski.\nHad that gone in Nuno Espirito Santo's side would have reached the interval all square after being outplayed.\nAnd while they briefly rallied, not even the introduction of their new record signing Fabio Silva could help them turn the contest around.\n'David was in control' - what they said\nWest Ham assistant Alan Irvine talking to BBC Sport: \"There were a lot of phone calls with David Moyes. Stuart Pearce was inundated. David picked the team and controlled the substitutions.\n\"All the messages that were passed down were very clear. I have worked with David for many years and I have an idea of what he is looking for.\n\"All the players and staff have been fantastic.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo talking to BBC Sport: \"We played a very bad game with a lot mistakes and West Ham were better than us.\n\"A lack of concentration, anxiety and we must improve. We must bounce back.\n\"We defended very bad. We must find a solution in the squad we have, the solution is not in the transfer market.\"\nWolves' heaviest top-flight defeat for eight years - the stats\nThis was West Ham United's biggest home league win since David Moyes' first game back in charge at the club on New Year's Day this year (4-0 v Bournemouth), while it was also their first league clean sheet at the London Stadium since then.\nWest Ham have scored three or more goals in three consecutive home matches in all competitions for the first time since March 2011.\nWolves suffered their heaviest Premier League defeat since March 2012 against Manchester United (5-0).\nWest Ham's Jarrod Bowen scored his first league double since December 2019 for Hull against Stoke in the Championship; he had only scored once in his first 22 Premier League appearances before tonight.\nSince the start of last season, Pablo Fornals has assisted more goals in the Premier League than any other player for West Ham (six).\nNelson Semedo was the 14th Portuguese player to appear in the Premier League for Wolves - at least three more than any other side in the competition's history.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to Everton in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday 30 September (19:45 BST) before travelling to Leicester in the Premier League on Sunday 4 October (12:00 BST).\nWolves are next in action when they welcome Fulham to Molineux in the Premier League on Sunday 4 October (14:00 BST).\nCancel Culture: Has it gone too far?\nVideo Games: The industry's problem with inclusion"

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-3 Aston Villa: Clinical Villa brush off sloppy Fulham\nAston Villa cruised to a comfortable Premier League win as they took advantage of another horrific defensive performance by Fulham.\nVilla are now unbeaten in eight games, including six wins, stretching back to last season.\nJack Grealish put them ahead with a shot on the bounce after John McGinn's clipped ball over the top caught Fulham out.\nConor Hourihane doubled their lead when McGinn laid the ball into his path.\nAnd Tyrone Mings wrapped the game up early in the second half when he snuck in behind a high Cottagers line to stab home Hourihane's free-kick - Villa's third shot on target of the game.\nThat means Fulham have conceded 10 goals in their opening three games, which would have been a joint record in Premier League history - if West Brom had not conceded 11 this season.\nFulham had a Bobby Decordova-Reid goal disallowed after a video assistant referee review for a foul, but that was one of their few clear chances at goal.\n'I promise new players & better efforts' - Fulham owner Khan\nFollow reaction, plus Liverpool v Arsenal\nVilla keep their momentum going\nVilla stayed up last season thanks to eight points in their final four games. Dean Smith's side have carried that good form into this season with four wins from four games, including two in the Carabao Cup.\nThey will face much tougher tests than this one though.\nVilla were clinical and scored with three of their five shots on target, all the result of good play.\nBBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Upson called the link-up play between McGinn and Grealish for the opener \"almost like telepathy\".\nThe second came from a nice passing move as Grealish found McGinn, who passed to Hourihane, with the midfielder slotting into the bottom corner.\nThat was the earliest Villa have gone 2-0 up in a Premier League game since May 2011 - and the first time McGinn has set up two goals in a game for Villa.\nDean Smith's side did not create too many clear opportunities, but still managed a third goal.\nMings had the freedom of the penalty area to tuck home a left-wing Hourihane free-kick.\nThey never looked back and move onto six points from two games.\nThe unusual 17:45 BST kick-off time was so it did not overlap with the late game between Arsenal and Liverpool, which was changed so it was finished before pubs have to shut in England at 22:00 BST.\nFulham need to sort it out quickly\nFulham are only the fourth team to concede at least three goals in each of their opening three Premier League games - following West Brom this season and West Ham in 2010-11 and 2017-18.\nScott Parker tried a five-man defence instead of his usual back four, but it did not work. Perhaps the problem is the personnel and not the tactics.\nOnly one of their starting line-up - Ivan Cavaleiro, with Wolves in 2018-19 - has ever played in a Premier League team who have not been relegated.\nThere are a combined 10 Premier League relegations in 11 seasons (six with Fulham and four with other teams) among the rest of the team.\nThey were sloppy for all Villa's goals and their attacking tactics were one-dimensional.\nFulham ended the game with 36 crosses from open play - by comparison Villa tried two.\nThey thought they had a goal when Decordova-Reid pounced after Emiliano Martinez spilled Aboubakar Kamara's shot. But after viewing the screen, referee Stuart Attwell decided Mitrovic had fouled Konsa as the first shot came in.\nBryan went close late on when his shot was tipped onto the bar by Martinez.\nParker will have to go back to the drawing board again if Fulham are to stay up this season. The transfer deadline is in a week's time.\nMatch stats - Villa's best start since 1999\nAston Villa registered a clean sheet for the first time in their last 27 away Premier League games, since a 0-0 draw with West Brom in January 2016.\nVilla have opened a Premier League campaign with back-to-back victories for just the third time, also doing so in 1995-96 and 1999-00.\nFulham have failed to find the back of the net in consecutive home league games for the first time since January 2016.\nAston Villa found themselves two ahead within 15 minutes in the Premier League for the first time since May 2011, when they led Arsenal 2-0 at the Emirates.\nJack Grealish's goal in the fourth minute was the earliest goal Aston Villa have scored away from home in the Premier League since Christian Benteke against Everton in February 2013 (second minute).\nFive of John McGinn's eight goal involvements for Aston Villa in the Premier League have come in London (two v Fulham, one v West Ham, Arsenal and Spurs).\nAston Villa midfielder Conor Hourihane scored for the first time in his last 17 Premier League appearances, since netting against Norwich on Boxing Day 2019.\nHalf of Aston Villa defender Tyrone Ming's Premier League goal involvements (six in total in 52 games) have come in his last four appearances (one goal, two assists).\nWhat's next?\nBoth these sides are in Carabao Cup action against Championship sides on Thursday, before Premier League matches on Sunday.\nFulham visit Brentford (17:30 BST) and then Wolves (14:00 BST), while Villa host Stoke (19:00 BST) and then Liverpool (19:15 BST).\nLiving with Bulimia: Freddie Flintoff opens up about his battle\nJust One Night: Could one date with someone new save a relationship?"

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-1 Arsenal: Champions fight back to maintain perfect start\nLiverpool's new \u00a345m signing Diogo Jota grabbed a home debut goal as the champions demonstrated their determination to retain an iron grip on their Premier League crown by coming from behind to record an impressive victory against Arsenal at Anfield.\nThe Gunners, who had won their opening two league games, went ahead after 25 minutes when Alexandre Lacazette took advantage of Andrew Robertson's error to bundle a close-range finish past Alisson but ended well beaten.\nLiverpool, who maintained their 100% start to the season and moved second behind Leicester City, responded instantly as man-of-the-match Sadio Mane, who was perhaps fortunate when a high arm into the face of Kieran Tierney was only punished with a yellow card early on, pounced two minutes later after Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno could only push out Mohamed Salah's shot.\nAnd Liverpool went ahead before half-time when Robertson atoned for his earlier error by getting on the end of Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross to beat Leno.\nLiverpool were far superior but Arsenal will rue a great chance missed by Lacazette, who shot tamely at Alisson when he was clean through with the score 2-1 and their night was complete when Jota, making his Anfield bow following his move from Wolves, shot low past Leno from the edge of the area.\n'Did I hear you right, Mr Keane?' - Klopp takes pundit to task over 'sloppy' comment\nReaction to Liverpool v Arsenal\nLiverpool already looking ominous\nLiverpool's response to Arsenal taking the lead sent a powerful message to anyone with hopes of challenging Jurgen Klopp's side for the Premier League title this season.\nIn contrast to the collapse we saw from Manchester City once Leicester City took control at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, Liverpool simply went through even higher gears after Lacazette pounced to give the Gunners the lead.\nLed by the irrepressible Mane, Liverpool were back on terms within two minutes and a tidal wave of attacks saw them ahead by the interval.\nMane is the star of the show at Liverpool at the moment, outshining even Salah with his potent mixture of pace, work-rate and goal threat.\nThe attacker may have rode his luck early on, however, when he caught Tierney full on with that raised arm and might have been very relieved to only see the yellow card produced by referee Craig Pawson.\nLiverpool's squad strength was also on display, with new signing Thiago Alcantara and Jordan Henderson missing through injury, they coped impressively and the icing on the cake was provided by Jota's lively late cameo, in which he missed a great chance, had one taken off him by Salah and then scored in a moment which clearly delighted Klopp on the sidelines.\nThe challengers will have hopes of depriving Liverpool of a second successive title - but on this evidence it will take some doing.\nArsenal still a work in progress\nArsenal have plenty of reasons for optimism under Mikel Arteta, fuelled by last season's FA Cup win and a good start to this term.\nThis, however, was an illustration of just how far they have got to go and why it is perfectly understandable Arteta is not getting carried away and stressing just how much rebuilding still needs to be done.\nArsenal flirted with danger as they knocked the ball around at the back in the face of Liverpool's high press, not helped by the lack of quality on the ball when they did work it into midfield.\nOn the other side, however, they were right in this game until the closing moments and should have scored when Lacazette raced clear only to send a weak finish at Alisson with the score 2-1.\nArsenal return here on Thursday hoping to do better in the Carabao Cup at the start of a run of games that will provide further tests for Arteta, with visits to Manchester City and Manchester United and a home game against table-topping Leicester City.\n'They are superior to us in many aspects' - what the managers said\nLiverpool manager Klopp told BBC Sport: \"I'm completely happy with our performance. We played good football, we were flexible, we mixed it up.\n\"I'm really pleased for Diogo Jota. Top, top guy. It's so difficult to improve a team like ours. He's been on my list for two or three years, he's here now.\"\nOn joining Leicester and Everton on nine points, he added: \"[Everton manager] Carlo Ancelotti did super business. I'm not at all surprised. Leicester is Leicester. They play some good football. Who cares in this moment who is up there? It's just the start.\"\nArsenal boss Arteta said: \"We were in it for a big part of the game. The reality is they are superior to us in many aspects. You could see that in some phases.\n\"I'm really happy in the way the team competed and kept believing. This is the standard we have to reach. We are on a different journey. They've been together five years, we've had a few months. We have a long way to go in many things.\"\nArteta's Arsenal letting points slip - the stats\nLiverpool have won their last five home league games against Arsenal, their longest run against them since a run of seven between 1981-1988.\nSince Arteta's first game in charge in December 2019, Arsenal have dropped more points from winning positions than any Premier League side (18).\nThere have been 166 goals scored in Premier League meetings between Arsenal and Liverpool, at least seven more than any other fixture in the competition.\nLiverpool had 21 shots against Arsenal, taking their total in their three games this season to 61 - at least 17 more than any other side.\nRobertson has scored or assisted a goal in seven of his last eight Premier League games for Liverpool.\nMane has scored in four of his five home league games against Arsenal for Liverpool.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool welcome Arsenal to Anfield once again in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Thursday (19:45 BST).\nArsenal then host Sheffield United in the Premier League on Sunday (14:00) and Liverpool travel to face Aston Villa later that day (19:15).\nLiving with Bulimia: Freddie Flintoff opens up about his battle\nJust One Night: Could one date with someone new save a relationship?"

        "article_text": "Chelsea 4-0 Crystal Palace: Ben Chilwell scores on first Premier League start since move\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard called for patience as summer signing Ben Chilwell inspired his new-look side to victory over Crystal Palace, on his first Premier League start since a \u00a345m move from Leicester City.\nHaving made his first appearance in Tuesday's Carabao Cup defeat on penalties by Tottenham, Chilwell marked his 100th Premier League game by firing in at the back post following Mamadou Sakho's failed clearance.\nChilwell, 23, then delivered an excellent cross from the left to allow Kurt Zouma to head in a second after 66 minutes, before Jorginho converted two penalties in the space of four minutes to seal victory.\nLampard also handed a league debut to \u00a322m goalkeeper Edouard Mendy - his latest recruit in a summer spending spree now beyond \u00a3220m in response to last year's transfer ban.\n\"There is a lot of reactionary stuff about us because of expectation,\" the Chelsea boss told BBC Sport.\n\"I do think people have to remain calm - that's how I have to be, I can't get caught up in it. It's my job not to be reactionary and not get too upset or down.\n\"We got a lot of credit for coming fourth [last season] and we are not going to go from there to 100 instantly. We are a work in progress but I am up for that work and so are the players.\"\nIn a comfortable first Premier League game, Senegal international Mendy kept Chelsea's first clean sheet of the season as a lacklustre Palace failed to muster a shot on target.\nThere was a rare moment of discontent among the hosts' ranks as Tammy Abraham, having won his side's first penalty, felt aggrieved at being denied the opportunity to take the second by captain Cesar Azpilicueta, who shepherded him away from Jorginho.\nOn Abraham's dispute with Jorginho, Lampard added: \"I don't mind Tammy's exuberance but that has been dealt with by Azpilicueta and then me in the dressing room. I don't mind a bit of conflict in the moment but it has been dealt with and won't happen again.\"\nReaction to Chelsea v Crystal Palace, plus live text coverage of Saturday's Premier League games\nNew-look Chelsea begin to take shape\nFollowing their first starts for the club on Tuesday, Mendy and Chilwell's league debuts were among six changes made by Lampard to the side which clawed back a point in a 3-3 draw with promoted West Brom last weekend.\nThe Blues - who narrowly avoided back-to-back defeats on that occasion courtesy of Abraham's late equaliser - dominated possession on Saturday but were initially frustrated in their attempts to unlock a Palace side content to sit back for much of the first half.\nIt was a rare error in the Eagles defence which allowed Chilwell to fire his new side ahead, as Sakho's attempted headed clearance dropped perfectly for the England international.\nWith Palace forced to pursue an equaliser, Chelsea's youthful side began to flow - with the free-to-roam Kai Havertz in particular a constant headache for the Eagles defence as he stretched the back-line with clever movement off the ball.\nChilwell had delivered delightful crosses from the left throughout and Zouma eventually took advantage to grant the left-back the assist his efforts deserved.\nAbraham had gone close to adding a third from Callum Hudson-Odoi's cross before winning a penalty from Tyrick Mitchell shortly after, as Jorginho put the result beyond doubt with a cool spot-kick after 78 minutes.\nAnd, after Havertz was felled by Sakho, the Italy international made no mistake with his second to lessen the chance of any ill-feeling from his unhappy team-mate.\nHodgson's best-laid plans come unstuck\nPalace boss Roy Hodgson named an unchanged line-up from defeat at Everton last weekend, when a penalty decision described as \"nonsense\" by the 73-year-old ended the Eagles' winning start to the new campaign.\nFortunately, there were no controversial handball decisions against his side at Stamford Bridge - where Hodgson could have no complaints about the two penalties conceded by his side as both Mitchell and Sakho were drawn into fouls.\nThe visitors successfully nullified Chelsea's attack until Chilwell pounced in the 50th minute but, with a limited threat of their own, they never looked remotely like forcing a way back.\nWilfried Zaha, who looks set for another campaign as a Palace player as the summer transfer window draws to a close, and strike partner Jordan Ayew, were starved of chances as their side spent long spells without the ball.\nHodgson made it clear during Friday's news conference that the club will not accept any late bids for star player Zaha, already just one goal shy of last year's four-goal league tally. He will require a much improved service to eclipse that in the weeks ahead.\nOn defeat, Hodgson said: \"We were our own worst enemy today with the two penalties. The only one you could say [was a good goal] was the Zouma header, from a looping cross, but even there you would hope your centre-backs could deal with it.\n\"In the end we find ourselves on the end of a heavy beating. As a team we were nowhere near as good as we need to be to come to Chelsea and cause them problems.\"\nChelsea's London derby joy - the stats\nNone of the last 19 Premier League meetings between Chelsea and Crystal Palace have finished level, while Chelsea have won six consecutive league games against Crystal Palace for the first time.\nThe Blues have won more Premier League London derbies than any other side (133) and have lost just one of their last 11 of those fixtures at home.\nMeanwhile, Crystal Palace have lost nine of their last 12 Premier League matches.\nSince the start of last season, the Eagles have failed to score in the first half in 30 different league games - more than any other Premier League side over that period.\nJorginho became the second player to score two penalties in a Premier League game after manager Lampard did so for Chelsea against Aston Villa in March 2010.\nWhat's next?\nFollowing the international break, Chelsea host Southampton on Saturday, 17 October (15:00 BST) and Crystal Palace face Brighton a day later (14:00 BST).\nPlayer Rater\nWorking from home: Expert tips on avoiding damaging posture\nStep Into The Ring: Meet the young UK wrestlers fighting their demons"

        "article_text": "Everton 4-2 Brighton: Calvert-Lewin scores again as Toffees go top\nDominic Calvert-Lewin scored his ninth goal of the season and James Rodriguez netted twice as Everton beat Brighton to make it four Premier League wins from four for the impressive table-topping Toffees.\nHowever, it was another game that will prompt questions about the quality of goalkeeper Jordan Pickford for both club and country.\nAll was going well for the home side after Calvert-Lewin rose highest to head in at the back post to cap another excellent week that saw him score his second hat-trick of the season and earn a first call-up to the senior England squad.\nBut in the closing stages of a first half in which he had barely been tested, England keeper Pickford dropped a tame bouncing ball at the feet of Neal Maupay, who then slotted the ball in on the turn.\nThe heavy rain during the match was undoubtedly a contributing factor but the poor error comes not long after the shocking mistake he made in the Carabao Cup win at Fleetwood.\nThankfully for the home side, they were able to reclaim the lead before the break when Rodriguez picked out fellow Colombian Yerry Mina, who headed in from a free-kick.\nAnd it was Rodriguez who put the game beyond Albion, firstly sliding in to finish off Alex Iwobi's chipped cross at the back post then finding space in the same area to tap home Abdoulaye Doucoure's pass.\nBrighton were able to claim a consolation through a superb Yves Bissouma strike in added time but they have now lost three of their first four games.\nThey can argue they deserved to take something from the defeats by Chelsea and Manchester United, but they can have no complaints about this.\nAside from Pickford's form, the only other negative for Carlo Ancelotti's side was losing forward Richarlison to injury in the first half.\nEverton lead the division, having taken 12 points from 12, but could be overtaken this weekend by Leicester and Liverpool, who both play on Sunday.\nAction and reaction from Everton v Brighton, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Man City and Scotland midfielder Weir\nBrilliant at one end, but issues at the other\nSince joining Everton from Sheffield United in August 2016, Calvert-Lewin has played under six managers, the first of which, Ronald Koeman, occasionally played him at right wing-back and tasked him with providing opportunities for others.\nNow, though, under the tutelage of Ancelotti, he is developing into a supreme finisher and the side is set up to supply him.\nEarlier in the season, in reference to the striker, Ancelotti harked back to his time as boss of AC Milan, when Filipo Inzaghi made the predatory one-touch finish an artform.\nCalvert-Lewin is not at that level yet, but you can see the shared DNA. One early chance, gifted to him by an error from Bissouma, saw him quickly get the ball out of his feet and fire a shot that Mat Ryan had to palm away.\nHis opening goal - converted at the back post from Gylfi Sigurdsson's cross - looks simple on the surface, but is a testament to positioning, prowess and the ever-growing understanding of the service he needs from a team that has come a long way from some of the limp, directionless displays of last season.\nRodriguez is a big factor in that and the Colombian has now been directly involved in six goals in his five games for Everton in all competitions this season.\nThe Toffees have scored 24 goals in their seven games of the campaign, currently more than any other side in Europe's top five leagues.\nThings are not quite so rosy at the other end of the pitch, though.\nPickford, who looked shaky throughout the game, gifted Brighton their equaliser and could easily have presented them with another goal when he palmed out a cross to Maupay for a shot that Tom Davies blocked.\nAnd it is not a new problem - Pickford has made 11 errors leading to goals in the Premier League since his debut for Everton in August 2017, more than any other goalkeeper in that time.\nEverton's superb attacking talent compensated for his big mistake on Saturday, but his form will be a concern to Ancelotti and England manager Gareth Southgate with three international fixtures coming up this month.\n'This is the moment of Dominic Calvert-Lewin now'\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti, speaking to MOTD: \"Brighton played well. We played well also. We managed the situation of the game well. We had composure defensively and had opportunities on the counter attack. The performance was complete and this was the reason we deserved to win.\"\nOn James Rodriguez: \"As I said on the first day, the players with quality have not a problem with that (settling in). The quality is there because football is not so complicated. The pitch is always the same, the opponents are always 11, the ball is the same, the goal doesn't move. Football is simple. It is not complicated.\"\nOn Dominic Calvert-Lewin's impressive start to the season: \"There is not just one reason. He is confident, we are seeing him improving and he is scoring goals and that is the most important motivation for a striker. This is the moment of Dominic Calvert-Lewin now.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter: \"I don't think Everton had so many chances but we helped them, second half certainly. To concede just before half time was a blow for us and then we didn't start the second half so well.\n\"I think we contributed a little bit to our downfall today and that is something we need to be better at.\n\"We have conceded all our goals against Chelsea, Manchester United and Everton and they are want you consider to be top sixish teams.\"\nEverton replicate title-winning start from 1969-70\nEverton have won each of their opening four games to a top-flight season for the first time since 1969-70, when they went on to win the title.\nEverton have won their first seven games in all competitions in a season for the first time since 1894-95 (won first eight).\nBrighton remain winless away at Everton in all competitions, drawing two and losing seven of their nine visits.\nThis game saw three Colombians start a Premier League match for the first time (James Rodr\u00edguez and Yerry Mina for Everton and Steven Alzate for Brighton), with Mina's goal the first in the competition scored and assisted (Rodr\u00edguez) by two Colombians.\nSince the start of last season, Everton striker Calvert-Lewin has scored seven headed goals in the Premier League, more than any other player.\nSince his Everton debut in August 2017, Gylfi Sigurdsson has registered 13 assists in the Premier League, more than any other player for the Toffees (Digne next on 12).\nMaupay has scored four goals in his last three Premier League appearances, as many as he managed in his previous 22 in the competition.\nWorking from home: Expert tips on avoiding damaging posture\nStep Into The Ring: Meet the young UK wrestlers fighting their demons"

        "article_text": "Leeds 1-1 Man City: Rodrigo earns Leeds a draw in entertaining game\nLeeds United came from behind in stirring fashion to secure a thoroughly deserved point as they played out a thrilling draw with Manchester City at Elland Road.\nIn the battle of wits between City manager Pep Guardiola and his inspiration Marcelo Bielsa, Raheem Sterling's smart 17th-minute finish was the reward for an early siege on the Leeds goal.\nIn the glorious chaos of this end-to-end encounter, Leeds fought back to force two fine saves from Ederson at the feet of Stuart Dallas and Luke Ayling in the first half before his weak punch from a corner gifted substitute Rodrigo an equaliser on the hour.\nKevin De Bruyne hit the post for City in the first half and they had several near misses after the break but Leeds, bursting with energy, were a huge threat, Ederson rescuing a rocking City by turning Rodrigo's header on to the bar before saving superbly at the feet of Patrick Bamford.\n'Guardiola has questions while Bielsa has Leeds here to stay'\nAction and reaction from Leeds v Man City, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Man City and Scotland midfielder Weir\nLeeds will light up the Premier League\nLeeds fans will have feared the worst as they were given a fearful going over in the early stages of this game, pinned back and a bag of nerves as Manchester City came out with all the anger of a team that had lost their last Premier League game 5-2 at home to Leicester City.\nDe Bruyne rattled the post, Sterling scored - but not for one second did Leeds let their heads drop or lose belief.\nSlowly but surely, the relentless positivity and intensity that makes Bielsa's side such compelling viewing started to emerge and once they had settled they not only stood toe-to-toe with City but also dominated much of the second half.\nBamford had that great chance late on but this was once again a demonstration of the fitness and fearlessness they bring to the Premier League, standing on the front foot and refusing to compromise their attacking beliefs.\nLeeds consolidated a very strong (and at times spectacular) start to the season.\nTheir style means there will be slips along the way of course but you cannot take your eyes off this Leeds United side under their charismatic manager.\nManchester City lose further ground\nManchester City possess a strange vulnerability for a side packed with such quality and with their track record of success.\nIt seems that unless City turn early supremacy into a convincing lead, they grow increasingly vulnerable - and so it proved here.\nGuardiola's side were in a different class to Leeds for the first 20 minutes but with only a one-goal advantage, they suddenly looked nervous as the home side grew in confidence.\nEderson rescued City either side of the error for Rodrigo's goal and once again the continued fallibility of Benjamin Mendy was exposed, particularly with one error that almost gifted Ayling a goal.\nIt was a real test for new \u00a365m defender Ruben Dias on his debut and this will feel like points lost for Guardiola, particularly after the heavy loss to Leicester.\nCity, in their defence, created a host of chances themselves and were furious when penalty appeals against Sterling were ignored by referee Mike Dean.\nIn the final reckoning, however, this is a result that will please Bielsa much more than City boss Guardiola.\n'It's like perfume...'\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa speaking to MOTD: \"The start and the end were with City and the end of the first half and the beginning of the second half were a bit better for us\n\"For them to be superior to us is pretty easy for them, it doesn't require much effort, whereas for us it requires us to go to the limit to be on their level.\n\"We couldn't take the ball off them and they were taking the ball off us very easily. We did it with a lot of effort, a lot of aggression to win the ball back and the confidence in our game grew.\n\"It wouldn't have been fair if we had won the match, it would've been possible, but not fair.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"It was an entertaining game for everyone. I'm incredibly proud of these players who enjoy football and come to this country and play many years at a high level. This is their first pre-season together, we couldn't do it more because the opponent was so good like all Marcelo Bielsa sides.\n\"Of course we are far away from the top of the league, we need to start to win games. It's a marathon, and with Champions League games, all the teams have this situation.\n\"Society gives credit for the winners. It's like perfume: when you win, you smell so good. When you don't, you smell so bad.\n\"The approach was incredible and it's nice to face a team like Leeds because they want to win, like they did with Liverpool. It's incredible entertaining football and it's interesting for the fans.\"\nRodrigo ends near 10-year wait for second PL goal\nLeeds United's Rodrigo Moreno scored his second Premier League goal and first since January 2011, nine years and 272 days ago. It's the second-longest gap between a player's first two goals in the competition after Andy Johnson (nine years 276 days).\nLeeds have lost just one of their last six Premier League games against Manchester City (W3 D2) and remain unbeaten in their last three against the Citizens in the competition (W1 D2).\nManchester City's Pep Guardiola remains unbeaten in all four of his managerial meetings with Leeds United's Marcelo Bielsa in all competitions (W2 D2).\nManchester City (D1 L1) have failed to win consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2018 (L2).\nManchester City have lost just one of their last 32 Premier League games against promoted sides (W25 D6), with that defeat coming at Norwich last season.\nSince the start of last season, only Danny Ings (12) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (nine) have scored the opening goal in more Premier League games than Raheem Sterling (eight).\nManchester City's Raheem Sterling has scored more goals than any other Premier League player in all competitions since the start of last season (34).\nRodrigo became the first Spanish player to score for Leeds United in the Premier League, netting just three minutes and six seconds after coming on as a substitute.\nWorking from home: Expert tips on avoiding damaging posture\nStep Into The Ring: Meet the young UK wrestlers fighting their demons"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 3-1 Burnley: Callum Wilson double helps the hosts move up to sixth\nNewcastle moved up to sixth in the Premier League with a comfortable win over a disappointing Burnley side.\nThe Clarets, who were well below par particularly in the first half are now 19th in the table, after losing their opening three games in the top flight for the first time since 1927-28.\nAllan Saint-Maximin opened the scoring for the hosts with a low drive into the bottom right corner.\nWhile Burnley rallied and levelled via Ashley Westwood's superb volley into the same corner, Newcastle quickly wrestled back control of the game.\nSaint-Maximin's purposeful run down the right gave Callum Wilson a tap-in.\nAnd the forward added his second - and Newcastle's third - from a penalty after Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope fouled Ryan Fraser after miscontrolling James Tarkowski's backpass.\nNightmare night for Pope\nIt was a difficult evening for Burnley despite the return of Tarkowski in defence - making his first Premier League start of the campaign following a toe injury.\nThe pace and power of Joelinton and Wilson caused them problems throughout and two early misjudgements by Pope seemed to spark a nervousness in front of him.\nThe twice-capped England goalkeeper ought to have been punished after allowing Wilson to charge down an attempted clearance in the opening minutes and was also lucky to escape without conceding moments later - charging out of his area and watching as the forward skipped clear of him.\nKevin Long's misplaced pass out of defence put further pressure on the visitors, who were grateful to see former player Jeff Hendrick skew wide from a good position just before the break.\nThere were moments of promise for Burnley in attack. Dwight McNeil's fizzing drive brought a fine save from home goalkeeper Karl Darlow, who also did well to tip Chris Wood's header to safety.\nAnd while Sean Dyche's side played with considerably more intensity in the second half and scored a superb goal, their confidence appeared badly dented when Wilson re-established Newcastle's lead.\nPope's final error just compounded a dreadful night and their pointless start.\nSaint-Maximin's magic\nNewcastle had won just one of their past eight home league games prior to Burnley's arrival at St James' Park.\nAnd apart from a 20-minute spell after the break there was enough in what was an otherwise commanding performance to cheer manager Steve Bruce.\nWilson has now scored four goals in his four Premier League appearances for the club and appears worth every penny of the \u00a320m the Magpies paid for him.\nJonjo Shelvey's scheming was a feature of their play, with the midfielder making more passes than any other Newcastle player and driving his side forward at every opportunity.\nAnd in Saint-Maximin, Bruce had arguably the game's outstanding player at his disposal.\nDespite being closely marked and on the end of a few crunching Phil Bardsley challenges, the 23-year-old French winger was unplayable at times.\nReturning from a three-game absence after an ankle injury, he latched on to Wilson's touch to sweep in a delicious opening goal.\nAnd then with Burnley threatening to take control, he outmuscled McNeil and accelerated away from Charlie Taylor before supplying Wilson with the easiest of finishes.\nHowever, one concern for Bruce will be that the Frenchman and Swiss defender Fabian Schar both had to be substituted with injuries.\n'We tried to be more expansive' - what they said\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce told BBC Match of the Day: \"I am delighted for the players. We've all had our fair share of criticism this week, maybe rightly so.\n\"Tonight we have hopefully quietened a few for a while anyway. We have tried to change and be more expansive. It goes up and down so quickly - that's Newcastle.\n\"If we can keep Allan Saint-Maximin fit he will get people off their seats, he can do things that other people can't. He is explosive. He is a goalscorer and a threat.\n\"I've known Phil Bardsley since he was 12 so I'm not shocked that he's had a few kicks at him.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"Allan Saint-Maximin? He was a handful, well done him. I'm really pleased for him.\n\"On a night like tonight Nick Pope should just put his foot through it, he knows that but he's a top keeper.\n\"We have still got four important players missing, we have a few days off now and then we will work very hard. When everyone is fit we have got a good group. It looks different when they are all back.\"\nWilson emulates Ferdinand - the stats\nNewcastle enjoyed their first home league win in six games (D2 L3), since beating Sheffield United 3-0 in June.\nBurnley have begun a league campaign with three straight defeats for the first time since 2003-04 in the second tier, while the last time they did so in the top flight was in 1927-28.\nNewcastle are unbeaten in their past eight home league games against Burnley (W4 D4), including all five meetings in the Premier League (W2 D3).\nBurnley have lost back-to-back away Premier League games after losing just one of their eight on the road before that (W5 D2).\nCallum Wilson is the first player to score as many as four goals in his first four Premier League appearances for Newcastle since Les Ferdinand in 1995-96.\nAshley Westwood became the eighth player to hit the 100-game mark in the Premier League for Burnley, and marked the milestone with his first goal in 15 top-flight appearances.\nWhat's next?\nFollowing the international break, Newcastle welcome Manchester United to St James' Park in the Premier League on Saturday, 17 October (15:00 BST).\nBurnley travel to West Brom on the same day and also kick-off at 15:00.\nReaction from Newcastle v Burnley, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Man City and Scotland midfielder Weir\nWorking from home: Expert tips on avoiding damaging posture\nStep Into The Ring: Meet the young UK wrestlers fighting their demons"

We have to do more and show more determination, and show a better mentality than we have shown.\n\"Southampton were better in everything. I know the guys want it but there has to be so much more determination and desire.\"\nThe Saints had lost their first two league fixtures of the season but have now recorded back-to-back wins in the competition.\nDjenepo's opener just before half-time, a clinical finish into the bottom corner, was just reward for an excellent first-half display in which only a string of fine saves by Sam Johnstone prevented Southampton from taking the lead earlier.\nJohnstone kept out Ryan Bertrand's curling effort before reacting quickly to prevent Semi Ajayi from diverting the ball into his own net and then stopped Che Adams from pouncing with the follow-up.\nThe Manchester United academy product dived at full stretch to deny Danny Ings' header but could do nothing about Djenepo's smart finish.\nWest Brom were marginally better after the break but still did not trouble Alex McCarthy enough in the Southampton goal.\nThe hosts made sure of the points when Romeu superbly volleyed in Stuart Armstrong's cross for his first goal in 20 months.\nSaints strikers finally get support\nSouthampton have finally started to get into a gear after a slow start to the season and six points from their past two games will send them into the international break on a high before returning to action with two tough fixtures against Chelsea and in-form Everton.\nThis win will have been a relief in more ways than one for Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl as he finally saw players other than Ings score.\nSouthampton have been far too reliant on the former Liverpool striker to come up with the goods, with their three goals in the Premier League prior to Sunday all scored by Ings.\nIn fact, goals from players other than strikers has been a problem with their previous nine in the league scored by either Ings or Adams, so it will have been pleasing for Hasenhuttl to see two different names on the scoresheet against West Brom.\n\"Hopefully we can continue this successful run,\" said Hasenhuttl.\n\"We need to work as a team together, whether you are a good team you have a good chance to win games.\n\"We have six points now, it makes everything not easier but a little bit more comfortable. We have a tough fixture after the international break, let's go.\"\nDefeat underlines Baggies' shortcomings\nIt has been a tough return to the top flight for West Brom, who are still searching for their first league win of the season.\nBilic has been vocal in his need for attacking reinforcements, having recently confirmed\n, external\ninterest in Huddersfield forward Karlan Grant and Leicester City striker Islam Slimani. After Sunday's game Bilic confirmed he was \"hopeful\" of getting a deal done for Grant soon.\nBut goals have not really been an issue for West Brom, having scored 10 in their previous five games in all competitions.\nInstead, keeping them out of their own net is proving a cause for concern. The 11 goals they had conceded in their three previous games set a new Premier League record and if not for Johnstone this could have been a defeat by an even bigger margin.\nAll too often it was easy for Southampton to cut through the West Brom midfield and find space in the defence, while the visitors' attacking players' inability to keep the ball in the final third added to the burden on the Baggies backline.\nBaggies' lowest bounce since 1985 - the stats\nSouthampton have only lost two of their past 11 Premier League games (W6 D3) and head into the international break on the back of consecutive victories.\nWest Brom have taken just one point from their four games in the Premier League this season, their fewest at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1985-86.\nSouthampton have won each of their past nine games against promoted teams in the Premier League, conceding just four goals in total in this run (five clean sheets).\nDjenepo scored his first Premier League goal for Southampton at St Mary's in his 13th home appearance, with his previous two in the competition both coming away from home.\nRomeu ended a run of 43 games without a goal in the Premier League, netting with his first touch in the opposition box in this season.\nJohnstone is only the second goalkeeper to concede 13+ goals in his first four Premier League games, after Fraser Digby for Swindon in 1993-94 (14).\nSince the start of last season, no Southampton player has made more assists than Armstrong in the Premier League (four - joint-most along with Nathan Redmond).\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break Southampton travel to Chelsea on Saturday, 17 October (15:00 BST), while West Brom host Burnley at the same time."

It was everything we asked for. It is all well and good to do this on the training ground but they have to make it happen [in the game]. Everyone did a fantastic job.\n\"This club needs to be looking up rather than down. Too often we have been looking over our shoulder. I'm not saying we are there yet but we are making steps towards that.\n\"We should have got something at Arsenal and [the result at] Wolves was great, but it doesn't matter much if you don't follow it up.\"\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers to BBC Sport: \"Everything was missing - it was poor. We started the season well and scored goals but we lacked aggression in our defending and West Ham have shown they are a good side.\n\"We rushed the game and then gave away two poor goals, it gave us a mountain to climb. They deserved to win, they were good defensively and on the counter-attack.\n\"We didn't see the performance coming from us. We have nine points from 12 and we will take that, but today is what can happen in football.\n\"Dennis [Praet] and James Maddison [both injured] give us extra quality and we lacked precision in our passing. We couldn't get our front players involved and didn't give the back line a chance to get up the pitch.\"\nWest Ham beat one of top two for first time since 2017\nWest Ham have won against a side starting the day in the top two of the Premier League for the first time since May 2017, previously losing nine and drawing two since then.\nWest Ham have won successive Premier League games while keeping a clean sheet for the first time since May 2019.\nLeicester failed to record a shot on target in a Premier League home game for just the third occasion since 2003-04 (also, v Liverpool in December 2019 and v Man City in November 2017).\nRodgers has lost consecutive home games in all competitions for the first time since October 2012 when he was Liverpool boss (three matches).\nFornals scored and assisted in a league game for the first time since September 2018 for Villarreal v Athletic Club.\nAfter no assists in his past 36 Premier League appearances, Cresswell provided two against Leicester City; it was the first time he had assisted twice in a top-flight game (192nd appearance).\nNo player has scored more headed goals in the Premier League than Antonio since he made his debut in the competition in September 2015 (18).\nAntonio is the first West Ham player to score in five successive Premier League away games, with the forward netting eight goals in this run.\nWorking from home: Expert tips on avoiding damaging posture\nStep Into The Ring: Meet the young UK wrestlers fighting their demons"

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-0 Fulham: Pedro Neto's goal condemns visitors to fourth straight loss\nPedro Neto's goal helped Wolves return to winning ways as they condemned Fulham to a fourth straight Premier League defeat.\nThe hosts, who had lost their two previous top-flight games by an aggregate score of 7-1, move up to 12th in the table with the victory.\nHowever, they were still far from their best and created few clear-cut chances against a resolute Fulham side.\nNeto's goal was a rare moment of quality in the final third, with the Portugal Under-21 international superbly driving an effort into the bottom right corner early in the second half.\nWith Alphonse Areola impressing in goal, the visitors had looked good value for a point at Molineux, where they have not won in the league since 1985.\nAnd even after Neto's strike, substitute Aboubakar Kamara spurned a glorious opportunity to level the scores, firing a close-range shot straight at Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio.\nFollow all of Sunday's Premier League action\nNeto inspires Wolves win\nAfter being thrashed by West Ham last Sunday, the visit of a Fulham team yet to earn a point on their return to the top flight seemed an ideal opportunity for Wolves to get back on track.\nFans of the West Midlands club were buoyed in the week by the news that the club had secured the long-term services of captain Conor Coady and forward Raul Jimenez.\nHowever, for the second week running, it appeared as though Nuno Espirito Santo is yet to find a way to ignite the attacking spark of a side that has lost Diogo Jota and Matt Doherty to Liverpool and Tottenham respectively.\nThe duo supplied 23 goals last term and were integral to Wolves' ability to counter-attack with pace and penetrate with runs behind opposition defences.\nIn the first period in particular, those qualities were absent in a display short on imagination and intensity.\nNeto's sweet left foot provided the solution, in part.\nThe 20-year-old winger was Wolves' most purposeful player throughout, drawing a fine save from Areola before emphatically breaking the deadlock.\nNelson Semedo was denied a goal on his first home start, following up Neto's drive, while Jimenez also saw the Fulham keeper save after opportunistically latching onto a long clearance over the top.\nProgress without a point\nFulham boss Scott Parker has accused his side of being naive, particularly in defence, since their Premier League return.\nBut he will have been encouraged by this display, albeit their progress came without delivering the reward of a point.\nAntonee Robinson, Maxime le Marchand and on-loan Torino defender Ola Aina all started in a new-look defence and the visitors appeared unrecognisable from the side that shipped 10 goals in their opening three matches.\nFormer AC Milan target Robinson was assured in defence and attack but should have done better with a first-half attempt after bursting past two home defenders.\nAina, a Nigeria international who started his career with Chelsea and Le Marchand, also contributed to a disciplined rearguard effort.\nPleasingly for Parker, his side also did not concede any real chances once they had started to chase the game, while Ademola Lookman impressed on his debut, starting the move from which Kamara ought to have equalised.\n'It was important to bounce back' - what they said\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We started the game well, organised. We had some problems in attack. Fulham were organised. Second half we were much better, we created and were on the front foot and got the goal.\n\"It was important to bounce back from last week but we know it is important to improve.\n\"We made a lot of things better than last week but with our standards I believe we should do better. We should manage the game better after we score.\"\nOn players going for international duty: \"We are proud our players go to national teams but I think the schedule is not correct. It is the pandemic and everyone has to adjust so we assess and decide and keep them going.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker, speaking to Sky Sports: \"I am delighted and proud of the team in what they produced today. They showed every facet of what a team needs to show, it has been well documented defensively in terms of conceding goals.\n\"For large parts we nullified their threat as a counter-attacking team and on the other side of it we defended as best we can.\n\"We have been absolutely gutted at some of the goals we have conceded - the players are hurting as much as anyone they are not winning games.\n\"I think we got a performance today. We have had that in other games as well.\n\"If you could, you would wave a magic wand or click a finger and everything would be perfect but it is not that easy.\"\nOn Ademola Lookman: \"You saw the boy's quality in the time he had on the pitch. There is a directness about him, a willingness to cause problems and that is what we need. He will be a massive asset for us.\"\nOn potential transfers: \"We are in the market, we are hoping to get some players in to help us. If it is not the case then this group of players will come out fighting.\"\nSecond-half side Wolves - the stats\nWolves have kept more home clean sheets in the Premier League in 2020 than any other side (seven), keeping seven shutouts in their last nine league matches at Molineux.\nFulham have lost each of their opening four matches to a top-flight season for only the second time, and the first since 1951-52.\nIn all competitions, Wolves are now unbeaten in 16 home matches against Fulham, winning 12 and drawing four.\nFulham have conceded 11 goals from their opening four Premier League games of 2020-21, the most they've shipped after their first four matches of any league campaign since 1960-61 (14).\nFulham boss Scott Parker has lost 11 of his 14 Premier League games as a manager (79%); of managers to have taken charge of 10+ games in the competition, only Jan Siewert (80% - 12/15) has a poorer ratio of defeats.\nOf Wolves' last 16 Premier League goals, 12 have come in the second half of their matches. Indeed, Wolves have failed to score in the opening 45 minutes in 20 of their last 26 league fixtures.\nPedro Neto scored his fourth Premier League goal for Wolves, but first at Molineux, with this his 16th home league appearance for the club.\nWhat's next?\nFollowing the international break, Wolves travel to Leeds for their next Premier League fixture on Monday 19 October (20:00 BST).\nFulham's next Premier League match is at Sheffield United on Saturday 17 October (15:00 BST)."

That was the longest wait for a shot in any Premier League game in 2020.\nThe Gunners had the better chances in the first half but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang forced a good diving save from Aaron Ramsdale and then hit an acrobatic volley at the goalkeeper.\nSheffield United had a red card let-off of their own as Sander Berge was only booked for a lunging tackle on Aubameyang, who was hurt but able to carry on.\nArsenal's two strikes were worth the wait, the result of fine passing moves.\nAubameyang lifted a pass over the top to Bellerin, whose clipped cross was headed into the top corner by Saka at the far post.\nAnd then substitute Pepe played a one-two with Bellerin before running at the Blades defence and slotting home via the base of the post.\nTheir main disappointment will have been losing a clean sheet and causing a few tense moments late on when the game looked safe.\nSheffield United's worrying form continues\nThe Blades' European dream was finished by three consecutive defeats at the end of last season - and that losing run has carried over into this campaign.\nAfter failing to score in their opening three league games for the first time in their history, Chris Wilder spent a club-record \u00a323.5m on Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster - although he was not registered in time to make his debut at Emirates Stadium.\nThey ended the game with six shots, as many as Arsenal, but few of them were clear chances.\nMcGoldrick's high and wide effort was their only shot in the first half, but the Republic of Ireland striker did eventually hit the target with a fine 20-yard effort from George Baldock's pass.\nThe 32-year-old has only scored three Premier League goals in his career, all against the big six - having netted twice against Chelsea last season.\nBut they would not have deserved an equaliser and begin a top-flight season with four defeats for the first time since 1966.\nWill Wilder be involved in the transfer market on deadline day on Monday? He may have to be if they are to avoid second-season syndrome.\nMatch stats - Wilder's worst run since Halifax in 2004\nArsenal have won nine of their past 11 home Premier League matches (D2) since a 2-1 defeat by Chelsea in Arteta's first home game in charge in December.\nSheffield United have lost seven consecutive league matches for only the second time in their history, with their other seven-game losing run coming between August and September 1975.\nArsenal have won nine of their past 11 home league matches against Sheffield United (D2) since a 1-0 defeat in August 1971.\nPepe's goal for Arsenal came after a build-up of 19 passes, the most before a Premier League goal this season; indeed, of the nine goals scored this season with 10 or more passes in the build-up, four have been scored by the Gunners.\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder has lost seven consecutive league matches as a manager for the first time since a run of 10 defeats in a row as Halifax Town manager between February and April 2004.\nOnly Liverpool (34) have won more home Premier League points than Arsenal (29) since Arteta's first home game in charge last December.\nThis was Burke's 18th Premier League appearance, with the Sheffield United player yet to end on the winning side (D3 L15). Burke has played more games in the Premier League without winning than any other player in the history of the competition.\nSheffield United scored their first Premier League goal of the season, with McGoldrick's goal their 31st attempt of the campaign.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal visit Manchester City in the league next Saturday (17:30 BST), while Sheffield United host fellow strugglers Fulham at 15:00 that day."

        "article_text": "Man Utd 1-6 Tottenham: Son Heung-min, Harry Kane score\nJose Mourinho returned to Old Trafford and humiliated his former club as Tottenham thrashed Manchester United to record a famous victory.\nSon Heung-min and Harry Kane scored twice, with Tanguy Ndombele and Serge Aurier also on target as 10-man United suffered a defeat on a par with their 6-1 thrashing at home by Manchester City in 2011.\nIt meant it was not only the heaviest defeat since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took temporary charge in December 2018, but also the largest United have suffered since Ed Woodward took over as executive vice-chairman in 2013.\nThe result leaves United 16th in the Premier League, with newly promoted Fulham and West Brom the only clubs with a worse goal difference. Only West Brom have conceded more than their 11 goals.\nUnited were completely outplayed, even before they were reduced to 10 men midway through the first half when Anthony Martial dragged his hand across Erik Lamela's face in reaction to an elbow in his neck.\nIn contrast, Tottenham moved up to fifth after emerging from a packed schedule of five games in 11 days in three competitions with a creditable four wins and a draw - their last two games have had five-goal winning margins.\nIt is also Tottenham's biggest win at Old Trafford and matches their record home win over United, 6-1 in September 1932.\nFans and pundits weigh in as Solskjaer endures 'worst day as Man Utd manager'\nThe most ridiculous five hours of Premier League football ever?\nTerrible day for United\nAfter struggling to bring in new players since the end of last season, the preceding 24 hours had been quite good for United, with deals for veteran striker Edinson Cavani and Brazilian full-back Alex Telles nearing conclusion.\nThe match could not have got off to a better start either. Davinson Sanchez barged Martial over inside the box within 30 seconds, which provided Bruno Fernandes with the chance to score yet another penalty.\nAfter that it was downhill at a rapid rate for the hosts, who had lost their lead after four minutes, were behind after seven and by the break had conceded four at home in the first half of a league game for the first since 1957, bizarrely also against Spurs.\nThere was no disguising the abysmal nature of United's defending, with \u00a380m skipper Harry Maguire one of the chief culprits.\nThe England centre-back got himself into a real mess trying to deal with what appeared to be a routine ball into the box. Twice he failed to clear, as did Luke Shaw, allowing Ndombele to drive home his first Premier League goal in more than a year.\nIf the equaliser was bad, what followed was worse.\nMaguire conceded a free-kick for a foul on England team-mate Harry Kane 45 yards from goal, but instead of delaying the situation, which Sanchez did when faced with a similar situation at the other end not long afterwards, Maguire backed off. Kane simply slid a pass through the gap and Son's pace took him clear of Eric Bailly and Shaw.\nThe third was a result of Kane sliding in to win possession on the edge of the home area after Bailly's short pass had put Nemanja Matic under pressure. The England skipper then finished after Son had crossed low.\nA 14-minute spell either side of the interval brought another goal for Son and a rare goal for Aurier.\nBy this point, Solskjaer needed to be thankful Old Trafford was largely empty and the only noise was the visiting contingent in their celebrations. The thought of it being full to witness a humiliation like this is not a pretty one.\nJose's joy\nIn his two and a half years as United boss, Mourinho only saw his team score four in the first half of a Premier League game at Old Trafford once. They never scored five in a game anywhere, let alone six.\nGiven the start they had, Mourinho must have been delighted not only with the way his players responded but the manner in which they maintained the pressure on their beleaguered hosts as they capitulated.\nThe one negative from that first-half was Lamela's reaction to the incident with Martial.\nWhile it could be argued Lamela did not strike Martial in the face - his elbow went into the Frenchman's neck to provoke the red card reaction - his response, first holding his face, then falling to the ground when it was evident the contact was minimal did not reflect well on the Argentine.\nBy the end, Mourinho seemed to be taking little satisfaction from what was unfolding.\nHe did not even leave his dug-out as Kane converted the penalty after Paul Pogba had needlessly taken down Ben Davies.\nAt the end, he shook Solskjaer by the hand and gave him a consoling arm around the head. He, more than most, knows the issues facing managers of this mighty club which, since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013, routinely follows significant steps forward by taking massive ones in the other direction.\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"It's very embarrassing, it hurt all the players. It hurts me as the manager. It's my worst day ever.\n\"I'll hold my hands up, I'm responsible for this. I've lost 5-0 with United and we've lost 6-1. We've lost big results before and always bounced back.\n\"I promise we'll do everything we can to turn this around. We know how good they can be but today all our mistakes came almost like Christmas everything at once and if you make too many mistakes against a good team and you'll be punished.\"\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho: \"To win 6-1 against Manchester United at Old Trafford is an honour for all of us, considering the dimension of Manchester United and Old Trafford.\n\"The pleasure is not the 6-1, the pleasure is the performance and three points which we really need after losing points at home against Newcastle.\n\"The target, objective is every match we go to win. I told the players in the last couple of days 1000 times a good result at Old Trafford is to win.\n\"Of course if you draw it's not a bad result but that's the kind of mentality we must get. It was a great performance, a great result. We have seven points, so our position in the table is so-so.\"\nWhat next?\nManchester United's next Premier League game is against Newcastle at St James' Park on 17 October (15:00 BST). Tottenham have a London derby with West Ham at home the following day (16:30 BST).\nUnited break unwanted records - the stats\nManchester United suffered their joint-heaviest defeat in the Premier League - losing by five goals for the fourth time in the competition, and for the first time since October 2011 against Manchester City.\nTottenham are the first visiting side to score four first half goals in a league game away at Manchester United since Spurs themselves also did so in November 1957 in a 4-3 win.\nManchester United have lost their first two home games of a league campaign for just the fifth time in the club's history, with 1986/87 being the previous occasion they suffered two defeats from two at Old Trafford.\nSpurs boss Jose Mourinho equalled his biggest margin of victory away from home as a Premier League manager, winning by five goals for the first time since his Chelsea side won 5-0 at Swansea City in January 2015.\nManchester United conceded six goals in a single Premier League game for only the third time - with each coming in October (1996 v Southampton, 2011 v Man City, today v Spurs).\nThis was the first Premier League match to see three goals scored in the opening seven minutes since Burnley v Man City in April 2010, and first in which both sides scored in this period since Nottingham Forest v Man Utd in February 1999.\nSpurs boss Jose Mourinho picked up his first away league victory against a team he has previously managed in the Premier League (previously D1 L4).\nHarry Kane has been directly involved in nine goals in the Premier League this season (three goals and six assists) - only Thierry Henry in 2004/05 has had a hand in more in the opening four games of a Premier League campaign (10).\nSpurs' Son Heung-Min and Harry Kane are the first visiting players since Edin Dzeko in October 2011 to be directly involved in three goals in a a Premier League game at Old Trafford.\nSpurs pair Son Heung-Min and Harry Kane have now combined for 26 Premier League goals; the fifth-most of any duo in the competition's history, and the most of any current pair.\nBruno Fernandes has scored all 10 of the penalties he has taken for Manchester United in all competitions - today's spot kick was the earliest penalty goal in a Premier League match (01:37) since Sergio Aguero against Newcastle in February 2015 (01:12)."

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 7-2 Liverpool: Ollie Watkins hat-trick as champions stunned\nOllie Watkins scored a first-half hat-trick and Jack Grealish had a hand in five goals as Aston Villa deservedly stunned champions Liverpool with one of the most unbelievable scorelines in Premier League history.\nVilla's record signing Watkins had never scored a Premier League goal before kick-off and 45 minutes later he had the match ball, as the home side took advantage of Liverpool's high line and individual mistakes.\nCaptain Grealish scored their final two goals after assisting three.\nFollow live reaction to Aston Villa v Liverpool\nIt is the first time Liverpool have conceded seven goals since 1963 and is only their fourth Premier League defeat since 3 January 2019. Villa, who escaped relegation on the final day of last season, overtake them in the table with their best start since 1962.\nVilla's first was the result of a huge error by Adrian. The Reds stand-in keeper passed the ball straight to Grealish, who cut it back for Watkins to side-foot in from eight yards.\nWatkins' second was excellent as he cut in from the left and smashed into the top corner.\nMohamed Salah looked to have restored order when he scored for the Reds, but John McGinn's deflected volley two minutes later put Villa's lead back to two.\nIt got even better when Watkins headed in from Trezeguet's cross to become the first player to score a Premier League hat-trick against Liverpool since Dimitar Berbatov for Manchester United 10 years ago.\nVilla debutant Ross Barkley, a boyhood Evertonian, was excellent and added a fifth after the break from just outside the box - from Grealish's third assist.\nSalah made it 5-2 from Roberto Firmino's pass on the hour-mark but then Grealish smashed in Villa's sixth before latching onto McGinn's raking pass to add another.\nThis is the first time in 18 attempts that Villa have beaten the reigning champions at home - the last was a 3-2 win over Arsenal in December 1998.\nThere have already been many surprising results this season - including Tottenham's 6-1 win at Manchester United earlier on Sunday - but none can beat this for sheer shock value.\n\"We never dreamed of getting a result like this,\" Villa boss Dean Smith told BBC Sport.\n\"The performance was outstanding from start to finish. We created an awful lot of chances against an exceptional defence and team. We had to work very hard.\"\nThe game that defies all logic\nThis is a result which makes no sense - apart from the fact Aston Villa were remarkable and clinical and Liverpool were unbelievably bad.\nA team who almost got relegated last season beat the defending champions - who barely ever lose - 7-2.\nIt is one thing to identify Liverpool's weaknesses but quite another to take advantage of them in such a sensational way.\nVilla are now unbeaten in seven league games, including the run that saw them stay up at the end of last season, and have won all three league matches this season.\nDean Smith's side managed to get in behind Liverpool's high defensive line with ease in the first half and Watkins, who was the Championship's top scorer last season and cost Villa a club record \u00a328m, was the chief beneficiary.\nHe took advantage of Adrian's error for the first with his left foot and chased onto Grealish's pass before cutting inside Joe Gomez and firing home with his right.\nWatkins got his perfect hat-trick - in more ways than one - before the break, nodding into an empty net after Barkley's deep free-kick was collected by Trezeguet who clipped the ball into the six-yard box. He also crashed an effort onto the crossbar as Villa chased an eighth goal late on.\n\"We have carried on the momentum from the end of last season but we have added quality to that,\" Villa boss Smith said. \"People have questioned Ollie Watkins' price. That has probably trebled now.\"\nThree more goals followed in an equally frenetic second half. Grealish picked out Barkley, whose 20-yard strike was helped into the top right-hand corner by a flick off the leg of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Grealish then scored via a Fabinho deflection before running onto a McGinn pass to add a famous seventh.\nWhat now for Villa? With a performance like this and three wins from three their thoughts will be a lot, lot higher than a relegation battle.\nWhat on earth was that from Liverpool?\nLiverpool were missing first-choice goalkeeper Alisson through injury and Sadio Mane and Thiago, who have both tested positive for coronavirus. But nothing could excuse this performance, surely the worst of manager Jurgen Klopp's illustrious era.\nEven last year when they put out their under-23 team to face Villa in the Carabao Cup, as the first team contested the Club World Cup, that only ended in a 5-0 defeat.\nLiverpool were completed wretched. The tone was set from the moment Adrian overhit a simple pass to Joe Gomez, which went straight to Grealish to set up the opener.\nAdrian has made five errors directly leading to goals in his 21 appearances for Liverpool - as many as first-choice Alisson has in 92 games. Klopp revealed after the game that Alisson is likely to miss several games with a shoulder injury.\nSeveral of Villa's goals took advantage of Liverpool's high defensive line. They just could not deal with the guile of Grealish and Barkley and the finishing of Watkins.\nSalah's double will count for nothing.\nWill Klopp treat this game as a one-off anomaly, or will the the manner of the defeat be more of a concern for the German?\n\"You have to say that Villa did very well,\" Klopp told BBC Sport. \"They were very physical, very smart and very direct, we were not.\n\"We had big chances which we did not use, but when you concede seven I'm not sure you can say it would have been 7-7. We made too many mistakes and massive ones obviously. It started with the first goal and around the goals we made massive mistakes.\"\nLiverpool's leakiest start since 1937 - match stats\nAston Villa have won their opening three league games to a season for the first time since the 1962-63 campaign.\nThis was the first time Liverpool have conceded seven goals in a match in all competitions since April 1963 in a 7-2 league defeat at Tottenham, while it was the second time Aston Villa have netted seven times in a single Premier League game, after a 7-1 win over Wimbledon in February 1995.\nLiverpool are the first reigning English top-flight champions to ship seven goals in a league match since Arsenal against Sunderland in September 1953.\nAston Villa have won four consecutive home Premier League matches for the first time since October 2007.\nLiverpool's 11 goals conceded is their most after four games of a league season since 1937-38 (also 11).\nSince the start of last season, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins has scored more league goals than any other player in England's top four tiers (29, including play-offs).\nWatkins was the 10th player to score a Premier League hat-trick against Liverpool, and the first since Dimitar Berbatov in September 2010.\nJack Grealish is only the second Aston Villa player to assist three goals in a single Premier League game, after James Milner v Burnley in February 2010.\nMohamed Salah has now scored against 25 of the 26 sides he has appeared against in the Premier League for Liverpool (96%) - the best ratio of any player in the competition for the club.\nWhat's next?\nFollowing the international break, Liverpool visit Everton in the Merseyside derby on Saturday, 17 October, with Villa at Leicester the same day."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-2 Liverpool: Dominic Calvert-Lewin earns Toffees point\nEverton came from behind twice to maintain their unbeaten start to the Premier League in a Merseyside derby thriller as Liverpool were denied a stoppage-time winner by the video assistant referee.\nSadio Mane put the visitors ahead in the third minute but they were furious soon afterwards when a wild challenge by Everton keeper Jordan Pickford on Virgil van Dijk, committed after an offside decision, saw the defender having to go off injured with VAR failing to review the tackle.\nEverton, who had won their previous seven games in all competitions, equalised swiftly at Goodison Park when Michael Keane headed in a corner from the outstanding James Rodriguez.\nLiverpool, with Thiago Alcantara at the heart of everything, were back in front with 18 minutes left when Mohamed Salah volleyed in Yerry Mina's poor clearance to set up a frantic finale, with only Pickford's magnificent save from Joel Matip's header keeping Everton in the hunt.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin's towering header restored parity with nine minutes left but Everton were then reduced to 10 men when Richarlison was sent off for a wild challenge on Thiago.\nLiverpool thought they had won it in stoppage time when Pickford could not keep out Jordan Henderson's shot - but in a finish to match the chaotic nature of the game, Mane was adjudged to be offside after a lengthy wait for the VAR decision.\nKlopp 'doesn't understand' VAR decisions\n'Everton lucky but show grit in derby of chaos and controversy'\nReaction to Everton v Liverpool, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nPickford the central figure again\nEverton and England keeper Pickford has been unable to stay out of the headlines this season as the spotlight has fallen on his faltering form - and he was the central figure in this eventful Merseyside derby.\nWhen Everton were 1-0 down, he somehow escaped a red card for a challenge on Van Dijk that was dangerous enough to force Liverpool's defender off, with the Dutchman looking in much discomfort as he made his way around the pitch.\nHe was then in more traditional action as he made a fine save from Trent-Alexander Arnold's free-kick and then - with Liverpool no doubt feeling he should not even be on the pitch - he made a world-class save diving away to his right to keep out Matip's header when it looked a certain goal with the score 2-1 in favour of Jurgen Klopp's side.\nEven then his afternoon was not over as he scrambled back in vain after failing to hold Henderson's shot - the relief clear when VAR ruled out the goal.\nEverton may still not have beaten their great rivals in a decade but Carlo Ancelotti's side will take great comfort from the manner in which they fought back twice and while Liverpool were the more consistent threat, there is a serious menace about this team that was not present last season.\nThiago brings class to the chaos\nLiverpool's Thiago and Everton's Rodriguez sailed serenely above the chaos in this match, showing the time and class that simply did not seem to be available to others.\nIn Thiago, Liverpool have added a midfield controller to the side that won the Premier League at a canter last season.\nHe was composed and some of his picked passes were of the highest standard, looking an absolute snip at \u00a320m from Bayern Munich.\nSalah's unforgiving finishing was on show once again, scoring his 100th goal for the club, and Liverpool will feel disappointed they could not close out the victory after leading so late on.\nThey mounted an expected recovery from that 7-2 thrashing at Aston Villa but they have now dropped five points in their past two away games and - even allowing for Van Dijk's early injury - do not look as impregnable as they did last season.\nKlopp will hope Van Dijk's injury is not serious as, perhaps helped by the manner in which Leeds United troubled Liverpool on the opening weekend and that humiliation at Villa, there is a belief in opponents that they can be got at.\n'We were dominant against a flying side'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told Match of the Day: \"Performance-wise very, very happy. Best away game we've played here since I started managing. We gave away two goals on set-pieces after changing formation.\n\"We were dominant against a flying side. Different things happened today. This type of offside I didn't see in the Virgil and Pickford incident.\nOn the Henderson ruled-out goal: \"I don't know where the line is where you can do offside.\n\"Yes, we should have won this game. The boys played a super game. against a side with quality and confidence. Dominating from the first second is absolutely exceptional.\"\nEverton goalscorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin: \"As you'd expect in derbies, got tackles flying in 50-50, so there's always a chance the ref might bring out a yellow or red.\n\"Disappointed we didn't kick on at 1-1. We knew we would have spells where we wouldn't have the ball. I managed to put one away but I genuinely thought it would be coming [the win], but it wasn't to be.\n\"I'm disappointed we didn't win the game. In that respect it was frustrating. In terms of the bigger picture, it's a point and we'll take it.\"\nThe stats - the red card derby\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 23 meetings against Everton in all competitions, their longest run against a single opponent in history.\nEverton haven't led in any of their past 14 Premier League matches against Liverpool - only Crystal Palace have had a longer run against an opponent without going ahead in the competition (17 v Manchester United between 1992-2017).\nEverton v Liverpool has seen more red cards than any other fixture in Premier League history (22), with Everton's 15 in this fixture also a record for one side against another.\nLiverpool have conceded 13 goals in their five Premier League games this season - they conceded as many after 15 games last term. Thirteen goals is the most Liverpool have shipped after five league games since 1953-54 (also 13).\nMohamed Salah's goal was his 100th for Liverpool in all competitions, in his 159th game for the club - only Roger Hunt (144) and Jack Parkinson (153) have reached the milestone in fewer appearances for the Reds.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin is the first player to score in each of Everton's first five league games in a season since Tommy Lawton in 1938-39.\nCalvert-Lewin is just the fourth player to score in each of his side's first five Premier League games in a season, after Arsenal's Jose Antonio Reyes (2004-05), Manchester United's Wayne Rooney (2011-12) and Manchester City's Sergio Aguero (2019-20).\nSadio Mane's goal after two minutes and 15 seconds was Liverpool's fastest goal in a Premier League Merseyside derby, while it was the second quickest goal overall in this fixture in the competition (Olivier Dacourt for Everton, one minute in April 1999).\nWhat's next?\nEverton visit Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday, 25 October (14:00 GMT), while Liverpool face Ajax in Amsterdam in the Champions League on Wednesday (20:00 BST) before hosting Sheffield United in the Premier League on Saturday (20:00 BST).\nThe Trump Show: Behind the scenes of his presidency\nThe Young Offenders: All episodes are streaming now"

        "article_text": "Chelsea 3-3 Southampton: Blues must cut out individual errors - Lampard\nFrank Lampard said Chelsea need to cut out individual errors after they twice relinquished a lead to draw 3-3 with Southampton.\nJannik Vestergaard headed in a dramatic injury-time equaliser to claim the Saints a point, after Danny Ings and Che Adams had earlier brought the visitors back from 2-0 down to 2-2 at Stamford Bridge.\nAll the goals conceded by the Blues included defensive mistakes, with Kai Havertz needlessly losing possession in his own half for the first, a weak back-pass from Kurt Zouma and poor attempted block from goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga contributing to the second, and an unnecessarily conceded free-kick and poor attempted clearance enabling the third.\n\"We have to not give those goals away,\" Lampard told BBC Sport. \"We are making individual mistakes in games and it gives other teams chances at all times. It is something we need to get better at.\n\"It goes through the team. We are seeing a lot of goals in the Premier League at the moment and no manager is happy with that. We all want clean sheets. It has to be better.\"\nChelsea were in control courtesy of two superb Timo Werner goals - the first courtesy of a sublime dummy which bamboozled Jan Bednarek before drilling in, and the second as he lobbed the ball over goalkeeper Alex McCarthy and nodded home.\nWhen it looked like the hosts were cruising, Southampton hit back as Danny Ings went round keeper Arrizabalaga to finish and Adams punished dire Chelsea defending to smash home an equaliser.\nThe Blues responded just 121 seconds later with Werner sliding the ball across the box for compatriot Kai Havertz to convert an easy finish which seemed to be the winner, but Vestergaard's late effort sealed a draw.\n\"You go 2-0 up and you want to finish the game, as at that point we were playing great football. The first half was as good as we have played this season,\" added Lampard.\n\"Southampton are a good side and we allowed the pressure they want to put you under off the ball to gain traction.\n\"When they got their first goal, just before half-time, they put us under pressure and our game management could be better.\n\"My message at the break was that it shouldn't change the game and the players should be happy with how they have played for 40 minutes. But we never reached those levels in the second half.\"\nRelive Chelsea's draw against Southampton\nChelsea's defensive frailties prove costly\nDespite a top-four finish last season, the problems for Frank Lampard's side were obvious - weak at the back, they paid a heavy price for their frailties against Southampton.\nChelsea conceded 54 goals last term, more than any other team that finished in the top 10, but a heavy spending spree in the summer invested more in attacking additions than defensive reinforcements.\nThe experienced Thiago Silva, brought in on a free after leaving Paris St-Germain, missed out and goalkeeper Edouard Mendy suffered an injury on international duty with Senegal.\nIt meant the error-prone Kepa was back in goal and his contribution for Southampton's second goal was far from impressive, but he could do nothing about their equaliser.\nLampard insisted that he and the team have faith in the keeper, but it will require hard work and mental strength from the 26-year-old to rediscover his form.\n\"He has to be strong enough mentally; that's the job we're in,\" said Lampard. \"He has to deal with that, he has the support of myself and his team-mates.\n\"He has to keep working, that's the only way through it. It's unfortunate because he did make two really good saves today, but obviously with something like the second goal, then eyes are drawn to that.\"\nThe home side failed to capitalise on champions Liverpool's 2-2 draw at Everton earlier on Saturday, with them missing out on the chance to go second and instead staying sixth.\nBut while they work on resolving their backline problems, they will have no problems going forward with the fire power they possess.\nProlific striker Werner looked like heading to champions Liverpool but the transfer did not materialise and he showcased why Chelsea were quick to pay \u00a354m for the RB Leipzig man.\nWerner, who scored 34 goals last season, was a constant menace for the Saints backline, his low centre of gravity allowing him to shift left and right, bringing about the first goal.\nHe had his back to goal a long way, but his step-over and dart left Bednarek trailing and, despite having work to do with three defenders and the goalkeeper in attendance, Werner slipped a cool finish into the bottom corner.\nWerner caused problems for the same defender for the second goal, holding off the towering Bednarek from Jorginho's raking pass, calmly lofting the ball over the advancing McCarthy and heading in from close range.\nChelsea's dangerous trio of attackers combined for the third as Christian Pulisic found Werner's run into the box and he moved it on for Havertz's first league goal.\nWith Hakim Ziyech making his debut off the bench in the final 18 minutes, as well as the options of Tammy Abraham, Olivier Giroud and Callum Hudson-Odoi available to Lampard, Chelsea will not have problems scoring goals.\nIt is at the back where they remain most vulnerable.\nWalcott sends reminder of talents\nSouthampton started the season poorly with back-to-back defeats but have responded in excellent fashion by picking up two victories and a draw.\nThey were outplayed for large parts by Chelsea's vibrant offence but Hasenhuttl will be delighted with them maintaining their unbeaten run so late in the day.\nThe visitors punished Chelsea's individual errors for their first two goals, Adams picking off Havertz in the final third, slotting the ball through to partner Ings to finish.\nAnd it was Adams' industry which saw him net, harrying Kurt Zouma into a backpass which sold Arrizabalaga short, though the goalkeeper should have done better to clear it, allowing the Southampton striker to keep the ball in play and smash into the net.\nMeanwhile, Walcott, who was the club's youngest first-team player at 16 years old, returned to Southampton on loan from Everton, 14 years after leaving to join Arsenal.\nThe former England international faded at the Toffees and was anonymous for much of this contest, but sprang to life in the second half to remind people what he is still capable of.\nThe 31-year-old burst forward with pace and laid the ball off for Adams, who drilled wide and it was his pass to Ings which forced Arrizabalaga into a good save.\nWalcott stayed alert in the 92nd minute, drilling a half-cleared corner back into the danger zone for Vestergaard to stoop and earn a draw.\nWhat next?\nChelsea open their Champions League campaign against Sevilla on Tuesday (kick-off 20:00 BST), while Southampton are in action again in the league next Sunday against Everton (14:00).\nChelsea defence gets the Blues - the stats\nChelsea have lost just one of their last nine home Premier League games (W7 D1), after losing four of the seven before that (W2 D1).\nSouthampton have lost just one of their last eight away Premier League games (W4 D3) after losing two in a row directly before that in February.\nChelsea have conceded an average of 1.5 goals per game in the Premier League under Frank Lampard (63 in 43 games), the Blues' worst rate under any boss to oversee more than one game in the competition.\nSince the start of last season, only Robert Lewandowski, Ciro Immobile and Cristiano Ronaldo have scored more goals in Europe's top five leagues than Timo Werner (30), with today's strikes the German's first two league goals for Chelsea.\nTimo Werner and Kai Havertz became the fifth and sixth Germans to score for Chelsea in the Premier League, a joint-high along with Arsenal and Manchester City (six each).\nSince the start of last season, only Jamie Vardy (28) has scored more Premier League goals than Southampton striker Danny Ings (26).\nChelsea's Ben Chilwell has been directly involved in four goals in the Premier League against Southampton (one goal, three assists), his best return against any side in the competition.\nSouthampton's Che Adams scored and assisted in the same game for the first time since October 2018 for Birmingham against Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship.\nTheo Walcott made his first appearance for Southampton in 14 years and 276 days, when he played against QPR in the Championship in January 2006.\nThe Trump Show: Behind the scenes of his presidency\nThe Young Offenders: All episodes are streaming now"

        "article_text": "Man City 1-0 Arsenal: Raheem Sterling scores winner\nStand-in skipper Raheem Sterling scored the only goal as Manchester City returned to winning ways in their Premier League clash with Arsenal.\nSterling, given the armband by manager Pep Guardiola with Fernandinho on the bench and Kevin de Bruyne injured, finished off the rebound after Phil Foden's 23rd-minute shot had been saved.\nArsenal had chances to level but City keeper Ederson denied them with three excellent first-half saves and both David Luiz and Pepe were off target with free-kicks in good positions after the break.\nThe result extended a miserable run of away results against their fellow 'top six' members for Arsenal. They have now failed to win in their last 29 such meetings, since a success at City in 2015.\nGuardiola is yet to drop a point against the Gunners in five encounters at Etihad Stadium since he succeeded Manuel Pellegrini as City manager in 2016.\nMore importantly for his side, after picking up a single point from their last two games, they were able to claim maximum points in this one.\nThe three points came even without De Bruyne and with the returning Sergio Aguero restricted to an hour's action on his first appearance since June after recovering from a knee injury.\nAguero escaped a caution after placing his arm on assistant referee Sian Massey-Ellis' neck as he argued against a decision.\nRelive Man City's win over Arsenal\nMaster beats pupil\nAs might have been expected from a meeting between Guardiola and the man he spent three-and-a-half years alongside in the City dug-out, Mikel Arteta, this was a tactical blitz.\nAt one point, Willian was operating as centre-forward and Sterling was sitting deep in midfield. After Aguero's exit, Bernado Silva briefly went into the false nine role as both men tried to keep the other guessing.\nArteta was able to bring on \u00a345m new-boy Thomas Partey for his debut near the end but the truth is, he doesn't have the strength in depth afforded to Guardiola.\nBoth sides suffered disruption in the build-up, although the loss of Aymeric Laporte and Mendy to injury had less of an impact on City as the delay in finding out the Premier League were prepared to allow Kieran Tierney to play had on the Gunners.\nThe Arsenal defender had been told to isolate by the local health authority in Scotland due to a 'close contact' breach on international duty.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the Gunners then lost defender Rob Holding to a hamstring injury in the warm-up.\nThis all contributed to a slow start they never really recovered from as City kept their first clean sheet of the season with a defensive performance far removed from the one which saw them concede five against Leicester in their previous home game.\nExcellent Ederson\nWhen it comes to debating who has been Guardiola's best signing as City boss, for all the excellence of Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva and - briefly - Leroy Sane, Ederson must surely come out on top.\nA \u00a335m purchase from Benfica after Joe Hart had been ditched and Claudio Bravo had flopped, Ederson won Premier League titles in his first two seasons and the Golden Glove last term, even though City's only silverware was the EFL Cup.\nWith new signing Ruben Dias still settling in, Laporte missing and Nathan Ake only making his fifth Blues appearance, Guardiola needs the Brazilian to be a steady presence.\nIt may have been that Bukayo Saka's shot from an angle was going over as the visitors tried to respond to Sterling's opener but Ederson took no chances.\nHowever, his two saves at the end of the opening period were superb. Saka was again the man denied by a feet-first stop when the teenager found himself clean through after playing a one-two with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\nWithin minutes, Ederson was denying Aubameyang with an even better save. As the flag immediately went up to signal offside, there appeared nothing in it. The true value of Ederson's work was not apparent until TV replays showed the assistant referee's ruling was incorrect. Without the keeper's intervention, Arsenal would have been level.\nEderson made another save, from a Pepe header, at the start of the second period, although compared to what had gone before, that was fairly routine.\nWith Arsenal unable to find their range with a couple of free-kicks either, Ederson's efforts mean the Gunners have now lost seven league matches in a row against City, the first time they have done that against any opponent since Ipswich in the 1970s.\nBoss Guardiola said post-game that full-back Benjamin Mendy will be out injured for three to four weeks, while centre-back Aymeric Laporte could return within a week.\nGuardiola also defended striker Aguero, who put his arm on the shoulder of assistant referee Massey-Ellis after disputing a throw-in call which went against him early in the second half.\nAfter arguing his case with Massey-Ellis, Aguero put his arm on her shoulder as she began to walk away - actions which drew attention on social media and led his former team-mate Micah Richards to say on Sky Sports that Aguero should \"know better\".\nPlayers can be cautioned or sent off for touching match officials if done in an in an \"aggressive, confrontational or violent manner\".\nIn his post-match news conference, Guardiola said: \"Come on, guys. Sergio is the nicest person I ever met in my life. Look for problems in other situations, not in this one.\"\n'I am upset' - what they said:\nMan City manager Pep Guardiola: \"It was difficult but we have won 1-0 and Ederson again was incredibly active like he was against Leeds.\n\"We are still a little bit away from our best performance that we are wishing but for many reasons it is not possible. The victory helped us a lot, we defended really well deep and up front and it's a good three points against an impressive opponent.\"\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta: \"I am upset as I feel we deserved more. I am extremely happy with the performance though, which we put in against a top team.\n\"I cannot demand more from players apart from we had three chances and had to score.\n\"Every goal the opponent scores there is something we can do better, we cannot change that. We know everything has to be perfect in both boxes to beat Manchester City.\"\nAsked if his side need to change their dismal record away at the top six, Arteta said: \"Absolutely. You want to go to every ground and win.\n\"To get into the position you have to do so many good things, throughout 96 minutes, and we did a lot of them but in the end, games are decided in the boxes.\n\"Against big teams, when you get there, you have to put them away.\"\nWhat next?\nCity are next in action against FC Porto at the Etihad in the Champions League on Wednesday (kick-off 20:00 BST) before taking on West Ham at the London Stadium next Saturday, 24 October (12:30).\nArsenal also have a European engagement, in Austria against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday (17:55 BST). The Gunners entertain Leicester in the league next Sunday (19:15).\nArsenal's nemesis Sterling - the stats\nManchester City are unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League encounters with Arsenal (W8 D2), since a 2-1 loss in December 2015.\nArsenal are winless in their last 29 Premier League away games against \"big six\" opponents (D10 L19) since a 2-0 win v Manchester City in January 2015.\nManchester City have conceded just one goal in their last six Premier League games against Arsenal, keeping a shut out v four different managers in this run (Arsene Wenger, Unai Emery, Fredrik Ljungberg and Mikel Arteta x2).\nArsenal have lost each of their last seven league games against Manchester City, their longest such run against an opponent since losing seven in a row v Ipswich between 1974-1977.\nPep Guardiola has won 500 games in all competitions as a manager (including Barcelona B), winning 172 as Manchester City boss.\nManchester City goalkeeper Ederson has kept 53 clean sheets in the Premier League since his debut in August 2017; 15 more than any other goalkeeper in this time.\nRaheem Sterling has had a hand in each of Manchester City's last five goals in all competitions (4 goals, 1 assist).\nMan City's Sterling has been directly involved in six goals in his last five Premier League appearances against Arsenal (4 goals, 2 assists).\nThe Trump Show: Behind the scenes of his presidency\nThe Young Offenders: All episodes are streaming now"

        "article_text": "Newcastle 1-4 Man Utd: Visitors produce late flourish to earn welcome win\nManchester United scored three late goals at Newcastle to earn victory and help ease the misery inflicted by the heavy defeat against Tottenham.\nIt was an incredible final few minutes for a team who looked as if they had blown their chance of three points following Bruno Fernandes' failure from the penalty spot in the 58th minute.\nUnited needed a positive reaction following that 6-1 thumping by Spurs before the international break, but their hopes suffered a blow when Emil Krafth's cross came off defender Luke Shaw and beat keeper David de Gea.\nHarry Maguire, who like his side has endured an unsettled period, equalised to haul the visitors back into the game.\nAnd it looked as if the match was set to turn in their favour in the second half when referee Craig Pawson, after consulting the pitch-side monitor, judged Jamal Lewis to have fouled Marcus Rashford and awarded a penalty.\nHowever, Fernandes, who previously had a 100% record from the spot for United, saw his fierce strike brilliantly pushed away by Karl Darlow.\nThe Portugal midfielder was not to be denied though and with four minutes remaining he finally beat the Magpies keeper with a thumping finish, before Aaron Wan-Bissaka, with his first for the club, and Rashford ensured United's second win of the season.\nReaction to Newcastle v Man Utd\nLawro's Premier League predictions v Afrobeat star & Man Utd fan Rema\nMan Utd patience pays off on Tyneside\nThere were sub-plots coming into this match, centring around how United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would have his team set up after the defeat by Spurs, and how Maguire would perform.\nThe Norwegian stuck by his skipper, whose form has been inconsistent this season and who had been sent off playing for England during the recent international break.\nThe centre-back produced arguably his most confident display of the season and it was somewhat poetic that his precision header brought his side back into the match.\nThe other person in the United camp who experienced both bitter and sweet was Fernandes. He had previously scored 10 out of 10 from the spot for the Red Devils but his run was brought to an emphatic stop by the flying Darlow.\nBut the visitors did not allow their heads to drop, unlike at Old Trafford two weeks ago, and breached the final line of defence once again when Fernandes smacked his angled strike high past the past the Magpies keeper after a glorious move down the left.\nWan-Bissaka, on his 50th appearance for the club, produced an equally thunderous finish from the right before Rashford slotted in a well deserved goal for himself.\nThe England striker, 22, without his familiar strike partners Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood, once again produced a very mature display.\nMagpies impress despite defeat\nThe scoreline reads 4-1, but against one of the 'big six', Magpies boss Steve Bruce's side fought fire with fire, particularly in the first half.\nFrench winger Allan Saint-Maximin, who dazzled against Burnley in the 3-1 win, starred again - albeit in spurts - and was integral to the move that led to the opener.\nHe then provided the cross for striker Callum Wilson which should have resulted in Newcastle's second, but instead resulted in one of the saves of the season from De Gea.\nDarlow, 30, made several good stops and continued until the end of the match despite appearing to be suffering from an injury in the final quarter of the game.\nBut even at full fitness the keeper could not have done much about the late goals though, as his team-mates in front of him tired, allowing their opponents to exploits the gaps in defence.\n'The defeat looks worse than it really was' - reaction\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce speaking to BBC's Match of the Day:\n\"They were a handful all night. Some of their forward players and their movement, we found it difficult. They scored from a free-kick we had and broke away [for the second goal] and then towards the end we were a bit naive.\n\"Darlow has been fantastic. He was brave when we needed him to be. You know your goalkeeper will have to play well against the big teams, I hope he will be OK next week.\n\"I thought we were a little bit too easy at times to play against. We will go away really, really disappointed because we were 10 minutes away and it could have gone either way when it gets that late.\n\"It is a work in progress for us. We have tried to change and with that it will take time. The defeat looks worse than it really was.\"\nMata shines against Newcastle again - the stats\nNewcastle conceded four goals at home in the Premier League for the first time since 5 April 2014, also against Manchester United (4-0).\nManchester United enjoyed their 10th comeback win against Newcastle in the Premier League, the most by any side against a single opponent in the competition.\nNewcastle are without a clean sheet in seven Premier League home games, their longest such run without a shut-out on home soil since February 2014 (eight).\nManchester United have been awarded 17 penalties in the Premier League since the start of last season, five more than any other side in the competition (12 scored).\nManchester United have scored five own goals against Newcastle in the Premier League (Henning Berg, Wes Brown, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw), only two sides have scored more against a single opponent (Sunderland v Man Utd and Liverpool v Tottenham).\nMata has been directly involved in nine goals against Newcastle United in the Premier League (four goals, five assists); against no other side has he had a hand in more (also nine v Norwich).\nFernandes has been directly involved in 20 goals in his 18 Premier League appearances for Manchester United (11 goals, 9 assists), scoring in each of his last three games.\nWan-Bissaka became the 116th different player to score for Manchester United in the Premier League in what is his 38th league appearance for the club.\nRashford registered three goal involvements in a single Premier League game for the third time (one goal, two assists), also doing so against Fulham in December 2018 and Arsenal in February 2016.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United are at Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 BST) and then host Chelsea at home next Saturday (17:30 BST).

They dominated the second half.\n\"It is a bit of a battle at the moment, a bit of a grind, but delighted to get something out of the game.\n\"I am not going to complain about the (penalty) decision because we have talked about some that have gone against us this season, so we have had a touch of luck today. We will take that and I think it is due.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker told Match of the Day: \"I thought in the second half we were exceptional. In the first half, we came with a bit of plan, we needed to tinker things at half-time and the players responded very well.\n\"The second half, I saw a dynamic team, a team that could create chances and I was pleased overall in that sense. There is still plenty of learning and plenty of improvement to do - a young team with young players coming in and making their debuts.\n\"The team is going in the right direction, not just today. The last performance as well was very pleasing. From where we were in the first three games where we had our struggles we appear to be coming out of that and pushing in the right direction.\"\nThe stats - rare Premier League draw for Fulham\nSheffield United have failed to win any of their opening five league games to a season for the first time since 2006-07, when they were relegated from the Premier League.\nThis was Fulham's first draw in 15 Premier League matches under manager Scott Parker (won three, lost 11), and their first in 24 matches in the competition since a 1-1 draw with Wolves in December 2018.\nFulham have missed three of their past six Premier League penalties, as many as in the previous 34 they had taken in the competition.\nFulham's Ademola Lookman scored his first goal in 37 Premier League appearances; his only previous goal in the competition came on his debut against Manchester City for Everton in January 2017.\nWhat next?\nSheffield United visit Liverpool on Saturday (kick-off 20:00 BST), while Fulham host Crystal Palace earlier that day (15:00).\nNewscast: Is it time for a national 'circuitbreaker'?\nSir David Attenborough: What impact has Covid-19 had on the climate?"

We have so much faith in his ability and always feel, with a bit of luck, there's more there to give.\n\"What I will be preaching to him for the rest of the season is that a player of your ability has got more to give and it is not sufficient to just score a few more goals than last season.\n\"I want to see him create havoc in the opponents' defence and he didn't really do that today.\"\nBrighton pushed for a winner in 10 minutes of injury time but in captain Lewis Dunk's desperation to pounce on a loose ball, he caught Gary Cahill with a stud-high challenge and was sent off.\nThe draw moves Palace up a place to 12th, while Brighton stay 16th in the table.\nRelive Palace's draw against Brighton\nPalace punished late on\nPalace came into the game showing inconsistent form, claiming victories in their opening two league games before back-to-back defeats. A draw now extends their winless run.\nThey defended resolutely for 89 minutes and looked like coming away with a smash-and-grab victory thanks to Zaha's penalty - but have now kept just one clean sheet in their past 13 games.\nHodgson will have been impressed by the performance of holding midfielder Jairo Riedewald, given a first start at Selhurst Park since January.\nThe Dutchman has struggled to show his best form since joining Palace from Ajax in 2017, but was much improved in this contest.\nDeployed in front of the backline, Riedewald won possession eight times, more than any other player on the pitch, and misplaced just one of his 23 passes.\nAnd it was his delightfully threaded through ball that led to Batshuayi thundering a finish into the roof of the net, but it was disallowed by a marginal offside decision.\nOtherwise, though, Palace's lack of attacking intent meant they had to settle for a point.\nSeagulls break down the Eagles\u2026 eventually\nBrighton had more possession (65%), made more passes (539) and had more shots (20) at goal than their opponents, so will have mixed emotions after the game - delighted at salvaging a draw but aggrieved at not having scored more.\nGraham Potter's side play attractive football, their passing is neat and crisp but attacks fall apart too often in the final third or they fail to work the goalkeeper.\nJust three shots were on target, with Mac Allister's goal punishing Joel Ward's clearance, but the other two efforts from Neal Maupay were comfortable for Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita to deal with.\nThe Seagulls finished 15th last season, seven points clear of the relegation zone, and they may be looking over their shoulders again if finishing and results do not improve.\nBrighton have won just one of their opening five matches this season and will have to make do without captain Dunk for the next games after he received a straight red card for a horrible challenge on Cahill.\n'I was pleased' - what they said\nBrighton manager Graham Potter: \"Putting the ball in the net was missing. We created chances and were the dominant team. You can see that quite clearly.\n\"The scoreline affects it a bit because we were 1-0 down, but I was pleased. They scored one goal from their only entry into our box. One slight mistake will go against you and you have to respond.

        "article_text": "Tottenham 3-3 West Ham: Manuel Lanzini stunner seals dramatic draw\nWest Ham came back from three goals down with under 10 minutes to go to rescue a point in an astonishing comeback against Tottenham.\nManuel Lanzini's brilliant long-range strike in injury time levelled the scores after Spurs had taken complete control in the opening 16 minutes through two goals from Harry Kane and one from Son Heung-min.\nFabian Balbuena's header began West Ham's fightback, with Davinson Sanchez's own goal giving even more hope with five minutes to go.\nGareth Bale, on as a substitute in his first appearance since his return to Spurs from Real Madrid, missed a great chance in stoppage time before Lanzini lashed the ball in off goalkeeper Hugo Lloris' fingertips to cap an incredible climax.\nWest Ham improved markedly in the second half, but when Kane hit the post with 12 minutes to go there was no sign that the final result would be anything other than another win for Spurs.\nThe result sees Spurs remain in sixth place, while West Ham move up two places into eighth.\nHow Spurs' late collapse took shine off Kane masterclass - analysis\nSpurs go from sublime to ridiculous\nSpurs looked irresistible in the opening stages, carrying on in the same vein from their 6-1 thrashing of Manchester United at Old Trafford.\nKane's sublime pass from inside his own half set up Son's opener after only 45 seconds when the South Korean bent his shot around Balbuena and into the bottom corner.\nSon then assisted Kane for the second after just eight minutes, the Spurs skipper's excellent close control being followed up by a shot lashed past Lukasz Fabianski.\nAnd when Kane then nodded in from a nicely floated cross by Sergio Reguilon, the hosts looked set to move up into second place ahead of the Sunday night Leicester v Aston Villa match.\nThe impressive Kane was even heavily involved at the other end, making an excellent block to deny Vladimir Coufal's shot just before half-time.\nBut Spurs looked to ease off in the second half, and the introduction of Bale with 18 minutes left should have injected some much-needed urgency.\nHowever the Spurs defence, barely tested before the break, creaked and then collapsed when it finally came under pressure at the crunch.\nHammers dig deep\nFaced by a daunting scoreline before a quarter of the game had gone, West Ham dug deep and didn't collapse completely as might have been expected after Spurs' opening onslaught.\nBut when Pablo Fornals somehow headed over from two yards out with keeper Lloris not in the picture, it seemed to suggest that David Moyes' side would leave north London empty-handed.\nBut Moyes, back in the technical zone after a spell away with coronavirus, then saw his side go onto the front foot even after the introduction of Bale suggested that Spurs were closing in for the kill.\nBalbuena's goal jangled the hosts' nerves, and when Sanchez diverted Coufal's cross into his own net it was the away side who scented blood.\nLanzini's brilliant shot, his first goal since May 2019, gave West Ham a draw that sees them putting a poor start to the season behind them with seven points from their last three Premier League outings.\nBale is back, if only briefly\nJose Mourinho had been coy about the prospects of Gareth Bale making his first appearance since his return from Real Madrid, saying the Welshman would \"probably\" play against West Ham.\nBut instead of Bale, Mourinho opted for Steven Bergwijn to line up alongside Kane and Son in Spurs' front three.\nBale lining up alongside Kane and Son makes Spurs a tantalising prospect - in attack, at least.\nInstead, Bale may have to wait until Thursday to make his first start for Spurs since 19 May 2013 when they take on LASK in the Europa League.\nThe Welshman's very first touch after coming on was at a free kick, but he looked rusty as he drove it tamely at Fabianski.\nThe 31-year-old will look more ruefully at the chance he had to seal the win while Spurs were wobbling at 3-2, but his shot curled just wide and left West Ham with a slight chance that they eventually seized upon.\nWhat the managers said\nSpurs boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is easy for me to praise West Ham. They were losing 3-0 for the majority of the game. The game was controlled, they didn't have chances and then late in the game, they score and increased their belief.\n\"They were lucky but maybe they deserved that luck. We were unlucky but maybe we deserved that.\n\"Harry Kane hit the post, it could be 4-0. Bale can score the fourth and kill it. Out of context, based on free-kicks and and second balls, they found a style.\n\"We should be stronger. In the second half they risked quite a lot, pressing up and gave us more space. We should get an occasion to win the game.\n\"I don't know if it was us inviting them or them with the extra motivation of getting in the game. I cant identify us or them, maybe both.\"\nIs it a lesson for the players? \"For the team, yes. For individuals, no.\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes to BBC Sport: \"I hadn't thought we played badly in the first half, that's what I said at half-time, sometimes you feel you have to do something - we didn't, we made changes later on and they certainly made a big difference.\n\"The plan was not to go 4-0 down, we said if we got one we would see what happened. It is a growing confidence we have at West Ham at the moment, we missed some chances today.\n\"A really good performance from the players got us back into it. We thought we played really well, the football was good, we threatened them. We are playing against a team everyone is talking about and after 10 minutes I was thinking 'is this going to be six or seven?' We changed and it made us better.\n\"Since we came back from lockdown we've been a completely different team. We keep scoring goals, but need to get back to clean sheets.\"\nThe comeback kids - the stats you may have missed\nWest Ham are the first team in Premier League history to avoid defeat in a game having trailed by 3+ goals as late as the 81st minute.\nTottenham (D1 L2) have failed to win any of their opening three home games of a Premier League season for just the fourth time (and first time since 2017-18), conceding stoppage-time equalisers in each of their last two.\nTottenham were 3-0 up within 16 minutes against West Ham, the earliest they have scored three times in a single Premier League game since August 2007 v Derby County (14 mins).\nSince Jose Mourinho took charge of Spurs in November 2019, Harry Kane (33) and Son Heung-Min (30) have had a direct hand in more goals in all competitions than any other Premier League players.\nGareth Bale came off the bench to appear in his first Spurs match in 7 years & 152 days, since scoring the only goal of the game v Sunderland in May 2013. Indeed, it is the longest gap between appearances by a Tottenham player in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nSpurs host LASK in the Europa League at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 22 October, then travel to Turf Moor to play Burnley in the Premier League at 20:00 GMT on Monday, 26 October.\nWest Ham will face Man City at the London Stadium on Saturday, 24 October at 12:30 BST.\nNewscast: Is it time for a national 'circuitbreaker'?\nSir David Attenborough: What impact has Covid-19 had on the climate?"

He had a knock to the knee, but a great goal and a real battling performance by the whole team.\"\nFoxes fail to fire\nLeicester were in the top four for much of last season before falling away after the restart, and they began this term with three straight victories.\nBut they have since faltered, losing back-to-back games, and rarely looked like finding the net against Villa.\nWithout the injured Jamie Vardy to call upon up front, Leicester struggled to carve out meaningful chances and Belgium full-back Timothy Castagne and Nigeria forward Kelechi Iheanacho both saw their efforts comfortably saved by Martinez.\nEven the introduction of the rarely-sighted Algerian Islam Slimani, making his first Foxes appearance since January 2018 following loan spells away, could not spark any attacking impetus for Brendan Rodgers' side.\nPromising defender Wesley Fofana, 19, was given his debut after signing for \u00a330m from Saint-Etienne, but there was little the French teenager could do to prevent Barkley's superb strike.\n\"I didn't think we deserved to lose,\" said Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers.\n\"We tried to be too precise in the final third of the pitch. It was just that final ball when we get into the box. It is still very early and we will continue to work hard.\n\"We are disappointed but we will go again.\"\nWhat next?\nLeicester are in Europa League action on Thursday against Zorya Luhansk (kick-off 20:00 BST), while Villa look to maintain their impressive Premier League start when they host Leeds next Friday (20:00).\nVilla keep it clean - the stats\nAston Villa have won their opening four games of a league season for the first time since the 1930-31 campaign, when they went on to finish second in the top flight.\nLeicester have suffered consecutive Premier League home defeats without scoring for the first time since February 2017.\nAston Villa are unbeaten in their last eight Premier League games (W6 D2); their longest run without defeat in the competition since October 2011 (10 games).\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers suffered his first defeat against Aston Villa in the Premier League since September 2014 (1-0 in charge of Liverpool), having won each of his previous four meetings with them since then.\nAston Villa have kept a clean sheet in both of their two away games in the Premier League this term, after keeping none in 19 away games in the competition last season.\nRoss Barkley has scored in each of his two Premier League appearances for Aston Villa (2 goals), as many as he managed in his last 42 for Chelsea before moving to Villa Park.\nSince the start of last season, Aston Villa's Jack Grealish has won 182 fouls in the Premier League (including five tonight) - the most of any player in the competition.\nNewscast: Is it time for a national 'circuitbreaker'?\nSir David Attenborough: What impact has Covid-19 had on the climate?"

He caused trouble for defenders Kevin Long and James Tarkowski and had the ball in the back of the net when he nodded in Grady Diangana's cross, before the offside flag went up.\nThere was also a first start for three-time Premier League winner Ivanovic - who last featured in England's top flight for Chelsea in December 2016.\nThe defender almost got on the end of a flick-on from a set-piece in the first half but Long was there to make the block, and the 36-year-old Serb was then denied from close range by Pope in the second half after Jake Livermore's shot had rebounded out.\nIvanovic's presence in both boxes was evident but West Brom lacked quality overall in the final third and were unable to test Pope enough.\nThe Baggies defended well, particularly in the first half, but while their performance showed plenty of promise, it was an opportunity missed before facing two other teams in the bottom five - Brighton and Fulham - in their next two away games.\nChance missed for Burnley?\nBurnley will surely have come away frustrated they were not able to leave The Hawthorns with all three points.\nBoth teams had chances in the first half and were well organised in defence, but as the game wore on it was the visitors who created the better opportunities.\nBarnes failed to score from his three efforts on target and that was largely down to some smart saves from Johnstone, who reacted well to his half-volley in the first half and clawed away his goal-bound header later on.\nThe Burnley forward was given service all match by left-winger Dwight McNeil, who signed a new long-term contract last week and once again proved his worth to Sean Dyche's side.\nMcNeil's deliveries caused problems throughout for West Brom, though it was Ashley Westwood's cross that Wood headed on to the bar, as the Clarets' best chance of the game went begging.\nThe visitors continued to push for a winner as the match opened up in the final 20 minutes, but Johnstone remained resilient in the West Brom goal.\nBurnley now face tough opposition as they look to add to their single point, hosting Tottenham and Chelsea in their next two fixtures before a trip to Brighton.\nA long wait for nothing - the best of the stats\nWest Brom 0-0 Burnley ended the longest wait for a goalless draw from the start of a campaign in Premier League history (47th game).\nThis is the third time Burnley have started a Premier League season without winning one of their opening four matches (also in 2014-15 and 2018-19).\nWest Brom have failed to win one of their first five league games for the first time since 2004-05.\nSince Burnley's return to the Premier League in 2016-17, only Southampton (16) have had more goalless draws in the competition (13).\nThe Baggies made six changes to their starting XI for this game - the first time since December 2013 against West Ham (also six) they have changed as many players from one Premier League fixture to another.\nAt 36 years 240 days old, West Brom's Ivanovic became the oldest outfield player to make his debut for a Premier League team since striker Peter Crouch for Burnley against Southampton in February 2019 (38 years three days).\n'We have to win these types of games'\nWest Brom boss Slaven Bilic speaking to Sky Sports: \"We gave everything. I told them after the game we were looking for three points, but they should build on this. We created a few chances - more than enough to score. They also had a couple, to be fair. A draw was probably a fair result. It's a clean sheet and a point.\n\"Let's be positive and build on this in a positive way. We knew these are the games - I respect Burnley a lot - where you really need to win, or at least not lose. If we want to stay up then we have to win these types of games.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to BBC Sport: \"I spoke to the team before the game about form. We looked more like us.

        "article_text": "Leeds 0-1 Wolves: Win a 'massive result', says defender Conor Coady\nWolves' win at Leeds United, which moved them into sixth in the Premier League, was a \"massive result\" according to defender Conor Coady.\nAfter losing two of their first three games of the season, Nuno Espirito Santo's side have now won their past two, although Coady said it was difficult to achieve this victory, decided by a 70th-minute deflected Raul Jimenez strike.\n\"It was a massive result for us, we knew how tough it would be,\" he said.\n\"They were fantastic last season and play at 100mph, but we stuck at our plan. It's hard to get after them, you have to play with your brain.\"\nAlthough Leeds dominated the opening period, the visitors were in charge from the final minute of the half when Daniel Podence's shot was saved.\n\"They were very attacking, we looked at that and then we got a bit of control in the second half,\" Coady added to Sky Sports.\nIn only the second top-flight Elland Road meeting between these two famous old clubs since 1981, Wolves were well on top by the time Jimenez took the ball across field from the right flank after 70 minutes, before checking inside to shoot from the edge of the box.\nKalvin Phillips tried to block the Mexican's effort but only succeeded in heading into the opposite corner, leaving goalkeeper Illan Meslier stranded and unable to stop Jimenez netting his third goal of the season.\nWolves thought they had scored earlier in the half when Roman Saiss lashed home Podence's cross, but after taking guidance from VAR Michael Oliver, referee David Coote ruled it out for offside.\nThough close, it was the right call. It certainly created far less controversy than the incident the pair were involved in on Saturday when - with Oliver in charge and Coote at Premier League HQ - they deemed Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford did not deserve a red card after injuring Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk with a reckless challenge.\nReaction from the match at Elland Road\nLawro's Premier League predictions v Afrobeat star & Man Utd fan Rema\nReality check for Leeds\nLeeds have enjoyed an excellent start to their first top-flight season since 2004 and victory would have taken them into third, but this first home defeat since February was a bit of a reality check for Marcelo Bielsa's side.\nThe Argentine's deep thinking about the game has turned the West Yorkshire side into a tactical conundrum.\nAt different times they can have three, four or five players in defence depending whether Stuart Dallas is pushing up the left flank or Phillips is dropping deep.\nAnd as they did in their thrilling draw with Manchester City in their last home game, Leeds enjoyed long periods when they were the better side.\nLuke Ayling had a shot blocked by Max Kilman and Patrick Bamford got to Jack Harrison's cross but was unable to turn his first-time effort goalwards.\nThey rallied after Jimenez had broken the deadlock and Pablo Hernandez did have chance to level, but the effort was blocked and with it went Leeds' hopes of avoiding a second defeat of the season.\nWolves in transition\nWolves will be delighted at three wins from their opening five games, particularly as manager Nuno is in the early stages of revolutionising his team's style of play, changing them from a largely counter-attacking unit into one that is comfortable in possession.\nHowever, with three of his new recruits on the bench, including \u00a335.6m teenager Fabio Silva, the indications are Nuno has not quite settled on his preferred use of the talents at his disposal.\nA first-half possession statistic of 31% underlined Wolves' labours, as did their return of zero shots on target before Podence drove the best chance of the opening period straight at Meslier with virtually the final kick before the whistle.\nJimenez's forward partnership with Podence will be the key to Wolves' hopes of progress as Nuno's rebuilding work continues.\nThe Mexican remains one of the Premier League's most feared strikers - only Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have also scored 30 top-flight goals since the start of last season - and Podence is blossoming into a capable replacement for Diogo Jota.\n'They were so dynamic' - reaction\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a good performance with some aspects to improve. We were better in the second half, but at the start it was very difficult for us.\n\"They broke us, created chances, they were so dynamic. We had to adjust and be more clinical in front. The goal was fortunate but we had chances.\n\"There was a proposal from [former Arsenal manager] Arsene Wenger for daylight for offsides - VAR is fine margins and we want them to make good decisions. It is a challenge for referees to improve, to be better, be faster and let the game flow.\n\"Nobody likes to celebrate and then come back. VAR can go both ways, let's try to help and make things better together.\"\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa: \"In the first half we should have established a difference. In the second half it was more even.\n\"We had the sensation that we could unbalance them. We created enough opportunities to establish a lead.\n\"I don't think they were better than us, but they neutralised our game better. The game was very hard, very physical and there was a lot of interruptions.\"\nJimenez hits milestone - stats\nLeeds suffered their first home defeat in 12 games in all competitions (W8 D3), since a 0-1 defeat to Wigan in the Championship in February 2020.\nWolves have won four league meetings in a row against Leeds for the first time since February 1958 to April 1960 (a run of five).\nWolves have won three of their first five games (L2) of a top-flight campaign for the first time since 1979-80.\nThis was Leeds' first home defeat in the Premier League since April 2004 (1-2 v Portsmouth).\nJimenez has netted 33 goals in the Premier League for Wolves, 11 more than any other player Steven Fletcher managed, while only Joao Moutinho has more assists (14) than the Mexican (13).\nMax Kilman registered his first goal involvement in his 14th game for Wolves in all competitions.\nWhat's next?\nLeeds next play in the Premier League at high-flying Aston Villa on 23 October (20:00 BST), while Wolves entertain Newcastle on 25 October (16:30 GMT).\nNewscast: Is it time for a national 'circuit-breaker'?\nSir David Attenborough: What impact has Covid-19 had on the climate?"

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 0-3 Leeds: Patrick Bamford hat-trick ends hosts' 100% start\nLeeds United ended Aston Villa's winning start and ruined their chance of going top of the Premier League thanks to a brilliant Patrick Bamford hat-trick.\nVilla came into Friday's game having won their first four games of a league campaign for the first time since 1930-31, but three expert finishes from the Leeds striker prevented the hosts making it a club record five victories on the spin to open their season.\nThe result lifts Leeds to third - their highest position at the end of a day in the division since September 2002.\nIt was reward for a relentlessly positive performance from an injury-hit visiting side that should probably have yielded more goals.\nIn the first-half, Bamford missed with a header and then side-footed wide after being found by Jack Harrison's low cross at the end of swift counter-attacking move.\nLeeds' record signing Rodrigo was also guilty of spurning good opportunities, slicing one shot wide before seeing an effort blocked by Ezri Konsa.\nDean Smith's Villa team, who had put seven goals past champions Liverpool in their previous home game, saw a Jack Grealish shot cleared off the line by Luke Ayling after the ball had fallen to the midfielder from Trezeguet's miscued shot.\nVilla's captain also went close with a saved effort from close range after he had shown great tenacity and skill to carry the ball from within his own half.\nBut Bamford had the decisive say, finding the corner of the net from just a few yards out after Emiliano Martinez had palmed out Rodrigo's low shot.\nIf his first was simple, his second and third were stunning - a rising effort into the top corner from 20 yards after he was found by Mateusz Klich on 67 minutes and a dug out, curling finish following Helder Costa's low ball seven minutes later.\nLeeds are now two points and a place behind Villa, who remain second, a point behind leaders Everton.\nHow Bamford and Leeds are proving doubters wrong\nBest action and reaction from Aston Villa v Leeds\nLawro's Premier League predictions v Style Council drummer Steve White\nFootball Daily podcast: Hat-trick Bamford and what next for Wilshere?\nBamford and Leeds make their presence felt\nLeeds maybe have not been as spectacular as Villa in the early stages of 2020-21, but they are certainly making their mark on a top flight that had been without them for 16 years.\nThere were plenty of times during that period when little was missing in their absence, but now - with Marcelo Bielsa in charge - the pleasure is all the Premier League's.\nLeeds have already shown they are unwilling to be daunted and compromise their attacking principles, even when facing the elite sides.\nAnd at Villa Park, with influential midfielder Kalvin Phillips and captain Liam Cooper missing through injury and a makeshift defence in place, they took apart the division's form team on their own patch.\nUnder Bielsa, Leeds create chances but they have not always had the cutting edge to make them count, with Bamford too often frustratingly profligate.\nPremier League life with Leeds clearly suits the English striker, though, and Friday's hat-trick took him to six goals in six matches this term. His treble is also the sixth in the top flight already in 2020-21 - after 49 games, it is the earliest that has happened.\nLeeds themselves have now scored 12 league goals, the most by a newly promoted club after six games of a season in the competition since Middlesbrough also netted 12 in 1992-93.\nVilla suffer first setback\nIt is perhaps in-keeping with what has been a chaotic Premier League season so far that Villa, yet to drop points and whose last appearance on their own ground saw them put seven past Liverpool, would be put to the sword by newly promoted Leeds.\nBut still it defied all expectation. Villa were second best throughout, unable to compete with the visitors' intensity and energy.\nEven Grealish, who has impressed so much, was unable to inspire his side, although he did have moments - not least of all with the solo run that almost brought an opener for the hosts early in the second half.\nBamford's first goal was a big blow, his second sent Villa to canvas and the third knocked them out.\nIt was a bad night at the office, but Smith's side remain a work in progress - and while he is unlikely to be pleased after defeat, one poor showing in five is a percentage he will surely take.\nThe key now will be whether Villa can respond to such a ruthless ending to one eight-game unbeaten streak by building another.\n'We probably got away with a 3-0' - what the managers said\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Very frustrated, especially with the last 40 minutes. I thought the first half was very even. They scored the first goal and we got worse and they were very good. We probably got away with a 3-0 in the end with the chances they had.\n\"Who knows what would have happened if we had scored? That is the first time we have been behind in a game and we didn't handle it very well.\"\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was an important game for us and a deserved triumph. We scored first and were a little bit lucky they didn't score some of the chances they had. We were playing well even before the goal and had played well enough to go ahead.\"\nOn striker Patrick Bamford, Bielsa added: \"Very happy for Patrick because he scored some wonderful goals. Apart from that [he is] a noble player who sacrifices a lot for the team - generous also. I think his development is more to do with him and less to do with me.\"\nBamford matches Cantona - the best stats\nThis was Aston Villa's first defeat in nine Premier League matches (six wins) and also the first time they had fallen behind at any stage in any of those nine matches.\nThis was the biggest win by a newly promoted side in an away Premier League match since October 2019, when Aston Villa won 5-1 at Norwich, and the biggest by a promoted club away from home while also keeping a clean sheet since Brighton won 3-0 at West Ham in October 2017.\nSince the start of last season, Aston Villa have lost 22 Premier League games and conceded 72 goals in the competition - only Norwich City (27 defeats, 75 goals conceded) have lost and conceded more in the division in that time.\nBamford has scored six goals in Leeds' first six league matches this season - only Eric Cantona in 1992-93 (also six) has scored as many goals for the club at this stage of a Premier League campaign.\nThe Englishman is only the second player to score in Leeds United's first three away games in a top-flight league season, after Gordon Hodgson in 1937-38.\nBamford is the ninth Leeds player to score a Premier League hat-trick and the first since Mark Viduka away at Charlton in April 2003.\nNew drama - Roadkill: Can a government minister outrun the secrets of his past?\nBringing Football Back: Behind the scenes of a club reborn"

        "article_text": "West Ham United 1-1 Manchester City: Michail Antonio scores spectacular goal for Hammers\nMichail Antonio scored a wonderful goal to earn his side a hard-earned point against Manchester City, who have now won once in four Premier League games.\nAntonio's spectacular acrobatic overhead volley from Vladimir Coufal's cross put the Hammers ahead at London Stadium - and provided another twist in this unpredictable top-flight season.\nBut substitute Phil Foden equalised for City six minutes after coming on at the start of the second half, producing a really good turn to score following Joao Cancelo's pass.\nCity dominated possession and sent on Kevin de Bruyne, who had missed the previous two games through injury, but could not find a winner and remain anchored in the bottom half of the table after five games.\nIn a setback for the visitors, Sergio Aguero did not appear for the start of the second half because of an injury.\nAguero faces another lay-off with leg injury\n'We will see how good Pep really is now'\nHard-working West Ham building momentum\nHaving lost their opening two games, West Ham have taken eight points from their past four matches, and can add a well-earned point against City to impressive wins over Leicester and Wolves.\nLast Sunday, it was Manuel Lanzini who came up with a brilliant goal as the Hammers battled back from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 at Tottenham.\nLanzini's heroics were not enough to earn him a starting place as Antonio produced a wonder goal, beating Ruben Dias to power an overhead kick beyond Ederson and give David Moyes' side a lead against the run of the play.\nCity complained there was a handball in the build-up by Tomas Soucek, which VAR checked. The goal would have been ruled out if Soucek, who had kept the ball in play before passing for Coufal to set up Antonio, had been judged to have deliberately handled - but VAR ruled that was not the case.\nWest Ham worked hard but had to dig deep to secure a first point against City since January 2016.\nKeeper Lukasz Fabianski produced two excellent saves to keep out substitute De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Riyad Mahrez as City finished strongly.\nIn the end it was an impressive point for West Ham, who had lost their previous eight games against City by an aggregate score of 25-3.\nEverything but the (second) goal\nCity did everything but score a second goal as they peppered West Ham's net with 14 attempts, and have now dropped seven points from their first five games.\nDespite dominating the opening 45 minutes, they struggled to create clear-cut chances and it was only after the introductions of Foden and De Bruyne that Fabianski was seriously tested.\nDe Bruyne looked sharp for the 22 minutes he was on the pitch, and his return is a huge positive before a packed schedule for Pep Guardiola's side; they do not have a free midweek before the next international break in November.\nSeveral key players are still missing for City, among them Gabriel Jesus, whose return date remains unclear.\nIn addition, it is unclear if Aguero is facing another spell out after the Argentine suffered what Guardiola described as a \"muscular injury\".\nWith injuries impacting, City named an unchanged line-up in consecutive games under Guardiola for the first time since October 2017.\nGuardiola said on the eve of this game that he expected \"normality\" to return to the Premier League, with no runaway winners as has happened in recent seasons when City and Liverpool have gone on to claim the title.\nHowever, the home game with Liverpool on 8 November already looks like a pivotal fixture in terms of City's Premier League ambitions this season.\n'I'm thrilled with the points total' - what the managers said\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, speaking to BBC Match of the Day, on Michail Antonio's goal: \"It's the sort of thing as a kid you always wanted to do, to score an overhead kick. It was a terrific goal.\n\"He has been great for us, he can run, we can play into him - all good teams need a good centre-forward and we have a good centre-forward at the moment.\n\"I'm thrilled with the points total because I don't think many people would have given us much. We showed real character to stick at it and we're going in the right direction. We want to get better and I hope we will.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"We started really well. We suffered in the last 10 or 15 minutes of the first half. In the second half, we were better and scored early. We had the chances we needed to win the game.\n\"I'm not a guy who can predict the future. We've already dropped seven points, which is a lot. But we've struggled a lot for many reasons. We have to take things game by game and see what happens.\"\nMoyes' first point against City for seven years - the best of the stats\nDavid Moyes registered his first point against Manchester City in the Premier League since March 2013, when he won 2-0 with Everton. Prior to this game, he had lost the past seven against City in the top flight.\nCity have won eight points from their five Premier League games this season - their lowest total at this stage of the season since 2014-15.\nWest Ham have lost two of their past 10 Premier League games (W4 D4 L2), going unbeaten in each of the past four (W2 D2).\nCity have conceded in three consecutive Premier League games in London for the first time since January 2016 under Manuel Pellegrini, when the third game in that run also came against West Ham.\nAll 39 of Michail Antonio's Premier League goals have been scored from inside the penalty area.\nCity have never lost a match in all competitions in which Phil Foden has scored (W15 D1).\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham have a week to prepare for next Saturday's trip to reigning champions Liverpool (17:30 GMT), while Manchester City are in France on Tuesday to face Champions League Group C rivals Marseille (20:00 GMT).\nCillian Murphy: Peaky Blinders star shares a chill playlist\nThe Yungblud Podcast: Fun, chaos and modern-day dilemmas"

        "article_text": "Fulham 1-2 Crystal Palace: Wilfried Zaha and Jairo Riedewald goals secure away win\nWilfried Zaha \"deserves all the praise he is going to get\", said Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson after the winger scored and made another goal to inspire a victory and inflict more misery on bottom side Fulham.\nPalace were on the back foot for much of the encounter, with the hosts having almost 70% possession, but netted twice on the counter-attack.\nZaha's thumping strike was saved by Alphonse Areola but in the next move the Ivorian slipped a sublime reverse ball through to Jairo Riedewald to slot in the opener.\nFulham could have got back into the contest but Ademola Lookman twice hit the woodwork in the opening period, seeing an effort tipped onto the near post by Vicente Guaita and drilling a drive across goal which rattled the other post.\nThe visitors capitalised in the second half as Michy Batshuayi picked out Zaha for an easy finish at the back post.\nHodgson said of Zaha: \"He reminds us that when he's on top of his game he's a very hard player to stop.\n\"He's an excellent player and that's what he's capable of doing. He deserves all the praise he's going to get.\"\nFulham were reduced to 10 men late on when substitute Aboubakar Kamara was shown a red card for raking his studs on the back of Ebere Eze's leg, and skipper Tom Cairney's stunning, long-range strike proved merely a consolation.\nPalace made a huge leap up the table, jumping from 14th place to fifth, while Fulham remain rooted and stay in search of their first win.\nRelive Palace's win over Fulham\nZaha causes havoc\nPalace conceded late on against Brighton in their previous game and had to be content with a point, but the win over Fulham ends a run of three without victory.\nAfter that home draw against the Seagulls, ex-Fulham manager Hodgson took aim at his star man Zaha suggesting he could have contributed more and expects his player to \"cause havoc\".\nThe former Manchester United man responded by doing just that against the Cottagers, showcasing dancing feet and superb skills to lead Palace to their third win of the campaign.\nHodgson said: \"If ever I sound mildly critical he thinks I'm picking on him, but every press conference I go to he's the only player they want to talk to me about.\"\nZaha's step-overs and darts forward often left Fulham full-back Ola Aina floundering, while one 'scorpion kick' pass to a team-mate was particularly outrageous, stretching out his leg and flicking the ball over his head.\nAnd his menace turned into a match-winning contribution too, a delightful 'no-look' pass carved open the Fulham defence for Riedewald's first Palace goal.\nZaha somehow nodded a free header wide from six yards out but did get his fifth goal this term by converting Batshuayi's lay-off, although there was concern when he collided with the post in scoring.\nHe managed to finish the game and could have been on the scoresheet again in injury-time, but his effort from close range was ruled out for offside.\nZaha added: \"I love football so there's no day I don't enjoy it really. I've set myself personal goals and that's what I'm attacking every day.\"\nProblems for Parker everywhere\nWhere do you even start with Fulham?\nTheir six games played since returning to the top flight has yielded just a solitary point from a possible 18 available and Scott Parker's side look prime candidates for relegation.\nThey have netted just five times but Cairney's brilliant, 95th-minute effort avoided the prospect of going their opening three games at Craven Cottage without a goal.\nTheir problems in defence are even more stark with three of the back four - Aina, Tosin Adarabioyo and Antonee Robinson - all signing this season and Fulham have shipped 14 goals, more than any other team in the top flight.\nFulham enjoy keeping the ball, they had 612 passes to Palace's 331, but badly lack incisiveness in the final third.\nStriker Aleksandar Mitrovic was left frustrated with a lack of service and on-loan Lookman looked sharp at times, but did not get on the ball enough in threatening positions.\nHad his two shots that struck the posts gone in, it could well have been a different story.\nSub Kamara was sent on to add more attacking threat but ended up being dismissed - referee Graham Scott initially gave a yellow card which seemed fair, but changed his decision after watching the replay on the pitchside monitor.\nWhat next?\nFulham host West Brom on Monday, 2 November (kick-off 17:30 GMT), while Palace travel to Wolves on Friday, 30 November (20:00 GMT).\nZaha king of the Palace - the stats\nFulham's haul of just one point after their first six games is their worst-ever return at this stage of a top-flight campaign.\nCrystal Palace have won three consecutive league matches against Fulham for the first time since October 1930.\nOf managers to oversee at least 15 Premier League games, only Jan Siewert (80%) and Brian Laws (78%) have lost a higher percentage of their games than Fulham boss Scott Parker (75% - 12 losses out of 16).\nCrystal Palace directed 10 shots on target in the game, the most they've managed in an away Premier League since August 2018, also against Fulham (10).\n33 years and 65 days separated the ages of Fulham boss Scott Parker and Crystal Palace's Roy Hodgson, the second-biggest gap in age between two English managers in a Premier League game after the 35 years and 38 days difference between Hodgson and Swansea's Leon Britton in December 2017.\nCrystal Palace midfielder Jairo Riedewald netted his first Premier League goal in his 33rd game in the competition, with what was his first-ever shot on target.\nWilfried Zaha has scored five goals in his last six Premier League games for Crystal Palace, as many as in his previous 41 combined.\nWilfried Zaha has been directly involved in 65 goals for Crystal Palace in the Premier League (41 goals, 24 assists), over twice as many as the next best tally (32 for both James McArthur and Jason Puncheon).\nAboubakar Kamara's sending off was Fulham's first Premier League red card since December 2018, when Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa was dismissed against Manchester United.\nCillian Murphy: Peaky Blinders star shares a chill playlist\nThe Yungblud Podcast: Fun, chaos and modern-day dilemmas"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 0-0 Chelsea: Hosts still searching for first home win this season\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard was adamant his team should have been awarded a penalty for a first-half foul on Cesar Azpilicueta in Saturday's goalless draw at Manchester United.\nBlues captain Azpilicueta was hauled to the ground by United skipper Harry Maguire, whose left arm was wrapped tightly around the Spaniard's neck.\nThe incident was reviewed by VAR, but Maguire and United escaped punishment.\n\"I thought it was a clear penalty,\" Lampard said. \"Holding goes on, but headlocks don't.\n\"Obviously I didn't see it at the time from where I'm standing. They are hard calls for referees on the pitch, but the VAR was very quick to dismiss it in my opinion.\n\"I think they should have taken time and advised the referee to watch the monitor. If the referee goes to the monitor, he gives a penalty.\"\nUnited, who remain stuck in the bottom half of the table, were at least able to avoid losing a third straight home league game at the start of the season for the first time since 1930.\nIn addition, they can also point to three good saves from Edouard Mendy, two to deny Marcus Rashford, including one in the final minute, and one where Bruno Fernandes was thwarted.\nChelsea's biggest scare was Mendy passing the ball across his goal and out for a corner in the first half when trying to pass to Thiago Silva.\nNeither Edinson Cavani, on his debut, nor Paul Pogba could change things in the home side's favour after they were introduced as substitutes. Mason Greenwood was given the final eight minutes to make an impression - but did not.\nChelsea gain in defence, lose in attack\nAfter conceding three times in two of their previous three league games, today's clean sheet, after denying Sevilla in similar fashion on Wednesday, does provide Chelsea with the kind of platform they have been lacking so far this season.\nThe return of Thiago Silva to anchor a three-man defence provided solidity. Yet it also seemed to cost Chelsea their edge in attack.\nToo often Timo Werner and Christian Pulisic were left trying to take United's defence on alone and rarely did the visitors mount concerted pressure around the United box, even though they dominated possession for long periods.\nEngland defender Reece James looked their most inventive attacking threat with his forceful bursts down the right flank. However, his final ball was poor and United keeper David de Gea did not have to make a meaningful save.\nSixth place may look presentable for Lampard's men at the moment but they could slide down the league over the weekend and evidently, a large summer outlay is yet to pay dividends.\nRashford repelled by Mendy\nIt has been another amazing week for Marcus Rashford.\nAfter getting the Government to overturn its own policy on providing free school meals to children forced to stay home during the spring lockdown, the England striker responded to a lacklustre response to his request for half-term meals by summoning support from everywhere apart from Downing Street.\nEven Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp publicly backed Rashford, which considering the antipathy between their respective clubs is some going.\nWhat Rashford does on the pitch is also important and this was a frustrating experience.\nHe was caught up in the general non-event of the first 25 minutes. On one United counter, he was screaming for a pass over the top from Juan Mata that he could chase beyond the Chelsea defence. Instead, the ball went sideways to Luke Shaw and was lost.\nMata did send Rashford through after Fernandes won possession inside the visitors' half but Mendy denied him with a feet-first stop. By half-time, Rashford still looked in discomfort after he had gone down in pain after a tangle of legs with N'Golo Kante.\nHe recovered and after being moved to the left following the introduction of Cavani, remained a threat, with Azpilicueta blocking his low shot before Mendy kept out his final effort.\nIt was largely an evening of frustration, summed up as he smashed the ball away in irritation as the final whistle sounded.\nRare away clean sheet for Chelsea - the best of the stats\nManchester United have failed to win any of their first three home games to a league campaign for the first time since the 1972-73 season.\nChelsea have kept their first Premier League clean sheet outside of London since a goalless draw at Leicester on the final day of the 2018-19 season under Maurizio Sarri.\nManchester United are without a home league win in five games (D3 L2), their longest run without victory at Old Trafford since February 1990 (6 games).\nEdouard Mendy became the first Chelsea goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet in both of his first two Premier League games for the club since Petr Cech in August 2004.\nMendy became the first Chelsea goalkeeper to keep a Premier League clean sheet at Old Trafford since Thibaut Courtois in December 2015, while he was the first to do so in his first such game at the ground for the Blues since Kevin Hitchcock in December 1994.\nDespite playing just half of Chelsea's six Premier League games this season, Ben Chilwell has created more chances than any other player for the Blues in the league this season (9).\nAt 33 years and 253 days, Edinson Cavani became Manchester United's oldest Premier League debutant since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in August 2016 (34y 316d).\n'It's about kicking on after a poor start' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on BBC Match of the Day: \"It was an even game. After a slow start, we grew into the game and played some decent stuff.\n\"We missed the crowd behind the goal there to suck the ball into the goal, which happens so many times at this place.\n\"There were good players at the other end of the pitch. Their keeper made some fantastic saves.\n\"The quality in the defending was very good. I've said all the time we have a squad full of good players and good characters but now it's about kicking on after a poor start.\"\nOn debutant Edinson Cavani: \"He gives us something different to what we have. We now have a centre-forward who is different to the ones we already had.\"\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard on BBC Match of the Day: \"It's a tight start to the season and I think this is just a continuation of that. It was in the final third where we lacked today but the clean sheet was a big plus for us.\n\"Sometimes we want to be flexible. We looked at Manchester United and we had games last season where we were the better team but lost to them on the counter-attack.\"\nOn whether Cesar Azpilicueta should have been awarded a penalty: \"Yeah, holding goes on, but headlocks don't. I don't know why VAR didn't take long and there's also a monitor to look at. I think if the referee goes to the monitor he gives a penalty.\"\nCillian Murphy: Peaky Blinders star shares a chill playlist\nThe Yungblud Podcast: Fun, chaos and modern-day dilemmas"

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-1 Sheffield United: Diogo Jota heads winner for hosts\nDefending champions Liverpool returned to winning ways in the Premier League with a hard-fought comeback victory over struggling Sheffield United at Anfield.\nDeputising at centre-back for the injured Virgil van Dijk, Liverpool midfielder Fabinho conceded a 13th-minute penalty for a foul on Oliver McBurnie on the edge of the box, allowing Sander Berge to slot in following a video assistant referee review.\nDespite Liverpool facing spirited opposition, Roberto Firmino converted from Sadio Mane's saved shot four minutes before half-time and Diogo Jota's header completed the turnaround midway through the second half.\nAfter two league games without victory, including their astonishing 7-2 defeat by Aston Villa, Jurgen Klopp's side moved level on points at the top of the table with Merseyside rivals Everton, who face Southampton on Sunday at 14:00 GMT.\nJota's decisive goal arrived two minutes after Mohamed Salah's fine finish from Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross was ruled out by VAR for offside, while Salah was denied by the woodwork late on.\nJohn Egan's sliding intervention had prevented Salah from putting Liverpool ahead inside the first minute, while Alexander-Arnold's ambitious free-kick from the halfway line forced Aaron Ramsdale to tip over as the Blades endured early pressure.\nUnited remain winless and with a single point after six games, but they offered manager Chris Wilder plenty of encouragement and were denied a 2-0 lead when returning Liverpool keeper Alisson pushed away Ben Osborn's excellent volley.\nReds find a way despite Van Dijk's absence\nThe potentially season-ending knee injury suffered by Van Dijk in the Merseyside derby is a seismic blow for Liverpool as they aim to defend their crown this season, but Klopp will have taken much comfort from Fabinho's near-faultless performance in the 1-0 midweek victory over Ajax in the Champions League.\nLining up without their Dutch centre-back for the first time in 75 league games, Fabinho once again partnered Joe Gomez in defence, although the Brazil international was at fault as he lunged in to his tackle on McBurnie.\nForced to play catch-up despite their early chances, the Reds wrestled parity through Firmino's instinctive finish and the lively Salah almost completed a rapid turnaround before the break when he ran the ball too close to Ramsdale.\nDespite the return of Alisson, out since September with injury, there were moments of uncertainty at the back as Liverpool allowed United 13 shots at goal - but their own quality in attack ultimately told.\nJota, quiet in front of goal for much of the contest, claimed the points with his first shot of the match, diverting Mane's looped cross beyond Ramsdale's reach, to extend Liverpool's impressive unbeaten home record to 62 league games.\nBlades show there's more to come\nWilder said he had seen sufficient signs of improvement after United's winless start to the season continued with a first point against bottom-placed Fulham last weekend.\nDespite this admirable and energetic display at Anfield, United must begin to put points on the board soon.\nThe Blades' sluggish start was fast developing into a concerning drop in form, but on Saturday they showed the determination which saw them flirt with European qualification last season.\nEnda Stevens' first-half block from Jordan Henderson's shot epitomised United's defensive spirit. However, it is in attack where they have lacked - with Berge's penalty their third goal in six games this season.\nClub-record signing Rhian Brewster lined up against former side Liverpool for his first Premier League start since a \u00a323.5m move in October, but the 20-year-old struggled to impose himself before his exit after 54 minutes.\nUnited still proved a real nuisance and had two first-half penalty appeals turned down after the ball struck Andrew Robertson's hand in the penalty area and McBurnie went down following an aerial challenge.\nThey pressed for an equaliser until the end, but substitute Oliver Burke was unable to control his late attempt.\nLiverpool's Anfield comebacks - the stats\nLiverpool have won their past four Premier League games against Sheffield United by an aggregate score of 9-1.\nThey have won 28 of their past 29 league games at Anfield.\nThey are also unbeaten in their last 13 home league games when conceding the first goal - winning each of the past nine.\nSheffield United's nine-game winless run in the Premier League is the longest run of any current side in the competition.\nLiverpool have conceded 14 goals in their first six Premier League games this season - a tally it took them 15 games to reach in 2019-20.\nDiogo Jota is the first player to score in each of his first two Premier League home games for Liverpool since Sadio Mane in September 2016.\nMane has been directly involved in five goals - scoring four - in his past four league games\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool host FC Midtjylland in their second Champions League group match on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) before welcoming West Ham to Anfield in the Premier League game next Saturday (17:30).\nSheffield United face Manchester City at Bramall Lane next Saturday (12:30), then travel to Chelsea the following Saturday (17:30).\nCillian Murphy: Peaky Blinders star shares a chill playlist\nThe Yungblud Podcast: Fun, chaos and modern-day dilemmas"

        "article_text": "Wolves 1-1 Newcastle: Jacob Murphy free-kick cancels out Raul Jimenez goal\nNuno Espirito Santo wants his side to be \"more clinical\" after Newcastle's late equaliser denied Wolves a third consecutive win.\nJacob Murphy's 89th-minute free-kick rescued a point for Newcastle shortly after Wolves had taken the lead through Raul Jimenez.\nNewcastle midfielder Murphy bent his low effort around the wall and just inside the post past goalkeeper Rui Patricio.\nIt was just the second shot on target from the visitors.\n\"We were patient, we were a threat, we didn't concede many chances and it is a game that we should finish with a victory,\" said Nuno.\nJimenez had fired home with 10 minutes to go of what had been a lacklustre encounter that Wolves had dominated for long stretches.\nBoth sides managed just one shot on target in the first half, and while Wolves seemed the likelier to take three points they had to settle for a point that takes them into eighth.\n\"The mistake is that we need to be more clinical,\" Nuno added. \"We had many chances but we did not test the goalkeeper too many times. We were the better team.\"\nFollow live coverage of today's Premier League matches\nNewcastle remain in 14th after the fourth consecutive 1-1 result between the two clubs.\nKarl Darlow saved Daniel Podence's shot in the sixth minute in what turned out to be Wolves' best chance of the first half, while Allan Saint-Maximin's effort pushed away by Patricio just before the break was Newcastle's first attempt on target.\nBlocks by Jamaal Lascelles and Federico Fernandez to deny Daniel Podence and Pedro Neto typified a dogged display by the away side in the second half, and they battled back strongly after Jimenez's fine goal had seemed set to send them home empty-handed.\nWolves fail to land killer blow\nWolves lived up to the statistic that says they are the Premier League's slowest starters, failing to score in the first half for the 58th time - more than any other side in the top flight.\nPodence forced Darlow into a save low to his left after six minutes, but after that the home side failed to make the most of having nearly two-thirds of the possession.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side showed was more urgency after the break, and even had vague hopes of a penalty shout for handball when Fernandez got in the way of Podence's effort, but replays showed the Newcastle defender could have done nothing to get the back of his arm out of the way.\nJimenez's excellent shot from just outside the area from a corner had enough power behind it to take it in off Darlow's left hand, giving Wolves' leading scorer his fourth of this campaign and what seemed to be the game's decisive moment.\nBut with their next three games all against sides near them in the table - versus Crystal Palace, Leicester and Southampton - Nuno will be keen for his team to finish off sides when they have the chance.\nGutsy Newcastle battle through\nA heavy defeat to Manchester United last time out, combined with illness and injuries affecting his squad, saw Steve Bruce make four changes to his starting line-up.\nJonjo Shelvey's groin problem and an illness affecting Sean Longstaff resulted in a redrawn side with an attacking edge, and included Ryan Fraser making his first Premier League start since his transfer from Bournemouth.\nBut for all their potential threat going forward, Newcastle worked hard without the ball for much of the match and Wolves' main threats came from shots a long way from goal.\nFraser and his former Bournemouth team-mate Callum Wilson lined up alongside each other for the first time this season, while Murphy, who spent last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, made his first Premier League start since December 2018.\nThe 25-year-old Murphy, named at wing-back, took his chance with a clever free-kick that just squeezed in to give Newcastle a point from a match that they were never quite out of despite spending so much of it on the back foot.\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce on BBC Sport: \"We didn't have any natural midfield players who want to win the ball back today. We have to defend better than we have done of late, we have to be hard to beat.\n\"It was hard work but that's the Premier League. Almiron does the hard work, it's very hard for me to leave him out, he's a manager's delight. He ran himself to a standstill.\n\"We are trying to find a balance to the team, it won't happen overnight but we are trying to change the way we play.\"\nThe draw specialists - the stats you may have missed\n73% of the Premier League matches between Wolves and Newcastle have ended level (8/11); of Premier League ties to have been played at least 10 times, this is the highest percentage.\nAll 11 Premier League games between Wolves and Newcastle have seen both sides score a goal, making it the most played tie in the competition in which neither side have kept a clean sheet.\nWolves have won just one of their 11 games under Nuno Espirito Santo in which they have had at least 60% possession (D5 L5), with that win coming against a Manchester City team who played with 10 men for more than 75 minutes.\nRaul Jimenez has been directly involved in 27 Premier League goals since the start of last season (21 goals & 6 assists - more than twice as many as any other Wolves player.\nEach of Jimenez's last two Premier League goals have been scored from outside the box after each of his previous 32 goals in the competition had been scored from inside the penalty area.\nJacob Murphy scored Newcastle's first direct free-kick goal in the Premier League since a Jonjo Shelvey strike against West Ham in November 2019.\nWhat's next?\nWolves are at home again in their next outing when they host Crystal Palace at 20:00 GMT on Friday, 30 October, while Newcastle are back at St James' Park when they play leaders Everton at 14:00 on Sunday, 1 November."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 0-1 Leicester City: Jamie Vardy scores to give Foxes win\nJamie Vardy came off the bench to score a customary goal against Arsenal and send Leicester to within a point of the Premier League summit with a first win at the Gunners' home since 1973.\nVardy, 33, had missed two games with a calf injury but was reintroduced after a largely sterile opening hour at Emirates Stadium and promptly ended a 262-minute Leicester goal drought in the league.\nThe former England international headed home fellow substitute Cengiz Under's smart pass to bring up a remarkable 11th Premier League goal against Arsenal in 12 appearances. Only Wayne Rooney, with 12, has more goals.\nUntil Vardy's arrival Leicester had barely threatened but they have now won their opening three away league games for the first time.\nThe big name for big games - Vardy's at it again\nArsenal were disappointing and, despite dominating possession and having 12 shots on goal, never looked like seriously testing Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel as they slipped to a first home league defeat of 2020.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta criticised the decision to disallow an Alexandre Lacazette header for offside early in the first half.\n\"I'm really disappointed. We had it in our hands in the first half and I don't know how the hell the goal was disallowed.\n\"They caught us with space at the back and in that moment we lost the game.\"\nThe scourge of Arsenal\nFour summers ago Arsenal tried to prise Vardy away from Leicester and he continues to pile on the regret with every game.\nHe had only 11 touches after replacing Dennis Praet, but still scored the winner and was only denied a second by the head of Bernd Leno as he raced through on goal late on.\nLeicester lined up with no forward at all in his absence, with winger Harvey Barnes nominally playing up front, and their lack of cutting edge meant James Maddison had all four of their efforts, all from outside the area, before number nine Vardy came on.\nTheir improvement was as marked as it was predictable with Vardy on the field, and it was no surprise when they grabbed the lead.\nYouri Tielemans' excellent pass over the top freed Under, and he squared for the free Vardy to score with a stooping header.\nThere is no more clinical player in the Premier League. Vardy has scored six goals from just nine shots this season - 20 fewer than Liverpool's Mohamed Salah and one fewer than the champions' full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nLast season Leicester capitulated from a position which seemed certain to deliver Champions League football, when they were 14 points ahead of Manchester United at the start of February. Could they seal the deal this time around?\nPredictable Gunners firing blanks\nArsenal thought they had scored in the opening minutes when Lacazette headed in from a corner, but Granit Xhaka and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were both offside.\nFrom that point Arsenal controlled the game for the most part, but, despite Kieran Tierney raiding with intent down the left, they struggled to bust open the organised visitors.\nArsenal had 11 shots in the first half but Schmeichel's only save of note came from the one effort after the break, pushing out a decent volley from Hector Bellerin.\nAubameyang, who has now gone five Premier League games without a goal for the first time, was largely anonymous.\nThomas Partey made a much-vaunted full league debut in midfield but was not alone in failing to shine as Arsenal moved the ball painfully slowly at times.\nThey have scored only eight goals in six league games this season. They have managed fewer at this stage in one of the previous 20 campaigns, when they scored five goals in 2015-16.\n'We deserved it' - what they said\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta told BBC Sport: \"The game the way it went, I felt we had total control in the first half and restricted them to nothing. We were winning every ball, created a few chances and scored a goal I don't know how it got disallowed. They defended deeper in the second half, waiting for the mistake and in one moment they did it,\n\"Against this block, against well-organised teams, when you open them up you have to put the ball in the back of the net. They were similar against Manchester City, they scored with two set-pieces and credit to them for what they have done but our players responded and I feel sorry for them.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers told BBC Sport: \"The boys were outstanding - against top quality players, you have to deny them space. You set up slightly different for the game. They executed it really well.\n\"We deserved it, we played against a really good side and have players who can run in behind. To keep a clean sheet and play with the quality and calmness was good.\"\n28th time lucky - the stats\nLeicester picked up their first win at Arsenal since September 1973, ending a run of 27 games in all competitions.\nThis was Leicester's fourth victory in the Premier League this season, their joint-highest after six games of a top-flight campaign, having also won four of their opening six in 2000-01.\nArsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has gone five league matches without a goal for the first time since November 2014, while playing for Borussia Dortmund.\nBukayo Saka made his 50th appearance for Arsenal, with 31 of those coming in the 38 games the Gunners have played under Mikel Arteta.\nCillian Murphy: Peaky Blinders star shares a chill playlist\nThe Yungblud Podcast: Fun, chaos and modern-day dilemmas"

None was more important than Grant's powerfully struck first goal for the club. The striker later admitted he found it \"lonely\" up against three central defenders and although he was kept quiet for long spells, he took his chance when it came, firing high into the net after a good first touch.\n\"If I had to pick one player to score it would be him and he took it like a proper centre forward,\" said Bilic.\n\"We were still looking for the win but the point is very good for us. Our approach was to win but we have to be positive and take this point, especially with this type of performance.\"\n'Frustration and determination' - what the managers said\nBrighton boss Graham Potter, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Frustrated, certainly the second half.\n\"Credit to West Brom, I think they responded well. They played better in the second half and pushed us back and they deserved their equaliser. We have to learn from that.\"\nWest Brom boss Slaven Bilic, speaking to BBC Sport: \"To come here and that second-half performance made me happy and made me proud. If it was 10 more minutes I had he feeling it was us who would score a second goal.\n\"I said to be more brave and to risk a bit more in their box. Show determination. We passed so many good balls in the second half in this pockets that was hurting them. The whole package beyond the point makes it a very good result for us.\"\nBrighton leaking goals - key stats\nSince the start of last season, no side has benefited from more own goals in the Premier League than Brighton (5, alongside Tottenham).\nBrighton have kept just one clean sheet in their 12 Premier League home games in 2020, the fewest of any ever-present side during this calendar year.\nWest Brom striker Grant has scored four goals in his last six away league games, after netting just one in his six before that.\nLivermore's own goal was the first West Brom have conceded in the Premier League since 31 December 2017 against Arsenal (via James McClean).\nUp next?\nBrighton travel to Tottenham on Sunday 1 November (19:15 GMT) before West Brom face the side bottom of the Premier League - Fulham - at Craven Cottage the following day (17:30).\nNew - The Rap Game UK: The search for a new British rap star is on\nMOTDx is back: The very latest on fashion, music and culture from the Premier League"

Only Chelsea's Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard (36) have ever managed to do so more often.\nSpurs and boss Jose Mourinho will be happy that is the focus of the game, because they had been poor otherwise.\nThey were sloppy in possession, gifting Burnley several chances with defensive mistakes - and barely created a chance before Son's goal.\nKane's main role until then had been to clear a Tarkowski header off his line.\nSpurs are the top scorers in the league - they were averaging three goals a game until Monday night's match - but had perhaps taken criticism of their last league game to heart.\nThey led that one 3-0 against West Ham after 16 minutes before conceding three times in the final eight minutes to draw 3-3.\nThere was no danger of such drama this time.\nPositives to take... but it's another slow Burnley start\nBurnley struggle at home against the big sides, despite their reputation for being difficult opponents. Their only win in their past 24 Premier League home fixtures against 'the big six' came against Spurs in 2019.\nThey are traditional slow starters. They have failed to win in their opening five Premier League games twice before, in 2014-15 when they had three points and in 2018-19, when like this year they picked up one point.\nThey were relegated in 2015 and stayed up by six points two years ago.\nThe Clarets will have to start picking them up soon as they are level on points - well point - with Sheffield United and Fulham in the relegation zone.\nBurnley boss Dyche will see the positives from this performance though and on another day they could have scored a couple.\nBarnes was well offside when he slammed home in the first half and they forced Lloris into three saves and Kane into his clearance.\nThey were solid at the back for the most part too, with Kevin Long doing well to block a Son effort and Tarkowski denying Kane.\nA pleasing night for both - manager reaction\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a very good performance, a very thorough performance.\n\"We are getting players back to true match fitness, there's a lot of good things.\n\"If you perform like we did against West Brom and tonight enough times, you start looking after yourself. We got done a little bit by a soft goal tonight but we quelled a lot of good attacks tonight.\"\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport: \"6-1 or 1-0, three points so I am happy as I was at Manchester United at Old Trafford.\n\"I said before the game this was not the game for beautiful football or the game to score many goals - Sean Dyche knows how to organise a team and to stop the better teams from playing through it.\n\"I'm very happy, this is the typical match where you can easily leave two points behind.\"\nMatch stats - Mourinho's favourite opponents\nTottenham recorded clean sheets in successive games in all competitions, having failed to record a shutout in 10 games stretching back to last season.\nJose Mourinho has not faced any side as manager more often without losing than Burnley (10 - W6 D4), winning five of his six away matches against the Clarets.\nTottenham have lost just one of their past 12 Premier League games played on Monday (W9 D2), going down 1-0 against Man City in October 2018.\nHarry Kane has recorded eight assists in six Premier League appearances this season, the most he has ever provided in a single campaign in the competition.\nJosh Brownhill's booking for Burnley after 63 seconds was the earliest in a Premier League game since Scott McTominay for Manchester United against Newcastle in December 2019 (24 seconds).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host Chelsea in the league on Saturday (15:00 GMT).

Playing without fans requires a lot of focus, we haven't the edge of Molineux.\"\nWolves went close to more first-half joy as Nelson Semedo and Leander Dendoncker narrowly missed with efforts from outside the box, while the video assistant referee denied Palace a lifeline from the penalty spot when Patrick van Aanholt was found to be offside, prior to being felled by Willy Boly.\nPalace were much improved after the break but a frustrated Wilfried Zaha had a penalty appeal dismissed and a disappointing night for Roy Hodgson's side was compounded when Luka Milivojevic was shown a red card for a tackle on Joao Moutinho in the closing stages.\nReferee Martin Atkinson watched the incident back on the pitchside monitor, but Hodgson said: \"My view is it's not a sending-off and I've told Martin Atkinson that.\"\nA fourth victory from seven games moved Wolves up to third in the standings, level on 13 points with Everton and Liverpool who both have a game in hand.\nReaction to Wolves v Crystal Palace\nAit-Nouri typifies confident Wolves display\nWhile his last match in an Angers shirt was a 6-1 defeat by Paris St-Germain, this was a night that will live long in the impressive Ait-Nouri's memory.\nManager Nuno had challenged his side to become much more clinical after they were held 1-1 by Newcastle last weekend, their failure to kill the game punished by Jacob Murphy's 89th-minute free-kick.\nOnly the bottom three sides had scored fewer Premier League goals than Wolves prior to kick-off, while another well-documented concern has been their slow starts to matches.\nBut debutant Ait Nouri's goal - Wolves' first in the first half since the opening day - marked the start of a pleasing evening for the Portuguese coach.\nPodence, whose two Premier League goals have both come against Palace, led the early Wolves charge as his curling shot forced Vicente Guaita to tip over, after Dendoncker had earlier headed on to the post from his cross.\nDendoncker struck the bar before denying Scott Dann from a corner at the other end as Wolves effectively kept Palace at bay - and though they were forced to work much harder after the interval, they never looked at risk of relinquishing their lead.\nWith Podence's goal proving crucial in avoiding another nervous finish, Nuno will be eager for his team to build on their rapid start at Molineux going forward.\nHalf-time response not enough for Palace\nCrystal Palace arrived at Molineux looking to take 13 points from their first seven games of a Premier League season for the first time ever, with the added incentive of climbing into the top four.\nDespite returning to winning ways against Fulham last weekend, Hodgson's side were second best for much of the first half and were lucky not to find themselves more than 2-0 down at the break.\nIt was a night when things did not fall the Eagles' way, as Michy Batshuayi had a goal ruled out for offside after 17 minutes and Zaha was shown no sympathy after going down under a challenge by Ait-Nouri after the restart.\nA consolation for Hodgson on a disappointing evening was the notable second-half response from his players, despite the all-important absence of a breakthrough.\nZaha, having contributed five goals and one assist to Palace's eight league goals to date, cut an increasingly frustrated figure in attack, most evident as he received a yellow card for a shove on Ait-Nouri.\nMilivojevic's dismissal, awarded retrospectively by VAR for a studs-up challenge, only served to further dampen a result Hodgson will want to bury quickly after a promising start to the campaign.\nOn the red card, Hodgson said: \"I'm very disappointed with that one. It's the worst part of the evening in a way. There would have been positives to take, but to lose a player for three games for a challenge I didn't even consider a foul will be very hard to take.\n\"If it's up to me I certainly want to appeal against it.\"\nWolves' highest position in 41 years - the stats\nWolves' third-place position in the Premier League is their highest at the end of a day this far into a top-flight season since October 1979, when they went on to finish sixth and win the League Cup.\nWolves' Rayan Ait-Nouri is the 15th Frenchman to score on his Premier League debut and, at 19 years and 146 days, he is also the youngest Frenchman to do so.\nWolves striker Raul Jimenez has now played more Premier League minutes against Crystal Palace without scoring than against any other team (421).\nOnly relegated Norwich City (14) have lost more Premier League games in 2020 than Crystal Palace (13).\nSince Roy Hodgson's first game in charge in September 2017, the Eagles have failed to score in 39 Premier League matches. Only rivals Brighton have done so more (40).\nPalace midfielder Luka Milivojevic received his first red card in league competition since February 2016 for Olympiakos, with this his 145th game since.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace host Leeds United on Saturday (15:00 GMT), before Wolves travel to Leicester on Sunday (14:00).\nRugby Union Weekly: The Premiership review, a Six Nations preview and Eddie Jones\nAmericast: All you need to know as the US election day nears"

This was a second successive clean sheet with Walker and Joao Cancelo impressing in the full-back positions while Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias are developing into a strong central defensive partnership.\n\"I'm happy to get on the scoresheet and obviously happy to get the three points, which was the main thing coming up here,\" said Walker, who did not celebrate his goal.\n\"My mum and dad live here, so if I'd celebrated I'd have got a lot of stick. I'm a Sheffield United fan, so I couldn't celebrate.\n\"I'm enjoying my football. We don't sit back and defend. We want to score three or four, but it's great to get the clean sheet on the board as well.\"\nBlunt Blades need to sharpen up\nHaving enjoyed a fairy tale return to the Premier League last season, when they finished ninth, it is looking increasingly likely that this is going to be a long and difficult campaign for the Blades.\nThey have taken just one point from their first seven games - compared to eight at the same stage of last season - and while a win against City was always going to be a tall order, they rarely looked like they believed they could cause an upset.\nThe hosts barely laid a glove on City in the first half but a good 15-minute spell after the break - when they provided a glimpse of their old selves - produced their best chance when Lundstram fired over.\nScoring goals is proving difficult for the Blades this season despite the addition of striker Rhian Brewster from Liverpool for a club-record \u00a323.5m.\nThey had just one shot on target in this game and have not scored more than one goal in a game so far this season, leaving them heavily reliant on a defence that has yet to keep a clean sheet.\n\"If people think we can go toe to toe with Man City they're deluded, really deluded,\" said Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder.\n\"We have to find a way to catch up with these teams who have spent about a billion pounds on their structure and their players.\n\"It's frustrating because I think we've got a lot more quality in those areas.\"\nWilder's rare winless run - the stats\nManchester City have won more top-flight matches on 31 October than any other team in English top-flight history (11).\nSheffield United have picked up just one point from their first seven league games in a season for the first time since 1975-76.\nManchester City have won four consecutive league games against Sheffield United for the first time since March 1930.\nSheffield United have failed to win any of their past 11 games in all competitions - the longest winless run of Chris Wilder's managerial career.\nAfter losing three consecutive away games between March and July, City are unbeaten in their past six on the road in the competition.\nSince the restart in June, Sheffield United have failed to score in more Premier League games than any other team (nine).\nManchester City's Kevin de Bruyne has been directly involved in four goals in three Premier League games versus Sheffield United (one goal, three assists), assisting in all three appearances.\nSix of City defender Kyle Walker's eight Premier League goals have been scored from outside the box, with today's strike his first away goal in the competition.\nWhat next?\nSheffield United travel to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday, 7 November (17:30 GMT) while Manchester City are in European action, hosting Olympiakos in the Champions League on Tuesday, 3 November (20:00 GMT)\nNo Passion, No Point: Gary Lineker on his move from player to presenter\nAmericast: All you need to know as the US election day nears"

I could see his personality and work-rate off the ball,\" Lampard said.\n\"That bit of quality gives us something different.\"\nChelsea rise to fourth while Burnley remain 18th in the table, with Ashley Barnes missing one of the Clarets' few chances when through on goal in the opening minutes.\nReaction to Burnley v Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's football action\nLawro's full predictions v The Rap Game UK judge DJ Target\nLampard's side strike perfect balance\nChelsea ended a run of back-to-back goalless draws by emphatically beating Russian Premier League side FK Krasnodar 4-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday.\nAnd their attackers were once again in full force with an Abraham header forcing Pope into a routine save shortly before Ziyech's opener.\nHaving fired blanks in his first three Chelsea appearances, former Ajax winger Ziyech has now scored two in two. The 27-year-old looked increasingly lively, scoring and assisting as Chelsea's new-look attack continued to shine.\nThe visitors' six key summer signings, Kai Havertz, Ben Chilwell, Edouard Mendy, Thiago Silva, Ziyech and Werner all started for the first time after Werner replaced Christian Pulisic who awaits a scan after tweaking his hamstring in the warm-up.\nAnd, after rallying against some early Burnley pressure in the second half, goals from Zouma and Werner sunk the hosts before substitute Olivier Giroud poked in a low cross from Chilwell only to be flagged for offside.\nThe Blues, who have often been criticised for looking top heavy this season, were rarely threatened at the back, Barnes' early chance the only moment a fourth consecutive clean sheet looked in doubt.\nClarets look out of ideas\nThe Lancashire side were unlucky in their loss to Tottenham last week and should have come away with all three points in the fixture before at West Brom.\nBut against an in-form Chelsea side they looked toothless, with this latest defeat meaning they have collected only one point from their opening six games.\nAfter the game, Burnley manager Sean Dyche remained pragmatic, saying he did not think \"panicking would change anything\".\nHe added: \"I don't panic in general, to be honest. I think structure, organisation and hard work - that may change things.\n\"There has to be a bit of realism - playing against these sides, top-six sides, they can punish you, and they punished us today.\"\nBurnley's loss comes against the backdrop of a \u00a3200m takeover bid from Egyptian businessman Mohamed El Kashashy and lawyer Chris Farnell.\nDespite Sean Dyche repeatedly calling for his squad to be strengthened, permanent signings this summer were limited to Brighton midfielder Dale Stephens and back-up goalkeeper Will Norris.\nAnd Stephens, starting for just the third time this season, was taken off by Dyche at half-time as Burnley struggled to maintain possession.\nBarnes could have given the hosts an early lead but failed to punish Chelsea's high line, looping his effort off target when put through on goal by full-back Matthew Lowton.\nBut it was Chelsea's afternoon, and once they netted their opener, there looked to be only one winner.\nZiyech's bright start - the stats\nChelsea have won six of their seven away Premier League matches against Burnley (D1), winning each of their past four in a row.\nBurnley suffered their heaviest home Premier League defeat since December 2019, when they were beaten 4-1 by Manchester City.\nHakim Ziyech became the first Chelsea player to score in his first two starts for the club since Diego Costa in August 2014.\nSince the start of last season, Ziyech has been directly involved in 30 goals in 40 matches in all competitions across spells with Ajax and Chelsea (11 goals, 19 assists).\nZiyech is the first player to score and assist on his first Premier League start since Ruben Neves in August 2018, and the third African player to ever do so, after Mohamed Salah and Dame N'Doye.\nEdouard Mendy has conceded just one goal in six appearances for Chelsea in all competitions - Kepa Arrizabalaga has conceded 14 goals in his past six appearances for the Blues.\nWhat next?\nBurnley are away at Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Friday, 6 November (17:30 GMT) while Chelsea return to European action, hosting Rennes in the Champions League on Wednesday, 4 November (20:00).\nNo Passion, No Point: Gary Lineker on his move from player to presenter\nAmericast: All you need to know as the US election day nears"

He has the speed, physicality, technique, and he's both-footed.\"\nWith this win, Liverpool equalled a club record 63 league games unbeaten at Anfield set by Bob Paisley's all-conquering side between 1978 and 1981.\nBack on top - but defensive lapses continue\nLiverpool are back on top of the Premier League table for the first time since they ended last season as champions but they were far from their fluent best.\nThey are three points clear of neighbours Everton, who will return to the summit if they win at Newcastle on Sunday (14:00 GMT).\nQuestion marks remain over Liverpool's defence, which has now conceded 27 in 14 matches since Klopp's side were confirmed Premier League champions in June.\nPhillips, whose dad, Jimmy, played against Liverpool for Bolton in the 1995 League Cup final, at least provided an aerial presence, the 23-year-old making a series of headed clearances during a commanding performance.\nIt was his more experienced defensive partner Gomez who was at fault for West Ham's goal, the England centre-back heading Masuaku's cross straight into the path of Fornals to put David Moyes' side ahead.\nSalah levelled with his eighth goal of the season after hitting his penalty straight down the middle before Jota's introduction from the bench lifted the side.\nThe Portugal forward had the ball in the back of the net but it was ruled out for Sadio Mane's foul on Angelo Ogbonna after referee Kevin Friend watched a replay on the pitchside monitor.\nHowever, Jota was not to be denied as he lashed past keeper Lukasz Fabianski in front of an empty Kop following a delightful pass by Shaqiri that split the West Ham defence.\nGutsy West Ham fall short\nHaving held Manchester City last week, this was another gutsy performance by West Ham, who attacked in numbers and gave Liverpool a real scare.\nThey arrived at Anfield unbeaten in their previous four games against sides who finished in the top seven last season.\nHowever, they were without key forward Michail Antonio, who scored a superb goal against City before suffering a hamstring injury.\nAfter being restricted to 50 minutes of Premier League football this season, Sebastien Haller was handed his first top-flight start of the season in place of Antonio.\nBut it was midfielder Fornals who produced a lovely finish to put his side ahead.\nAfter Salah equalised, the former Villarreal player was denied a second goal by Andrew Robertson's important block, yet West Ham were unable to secure a point their hard work deserved as they were undone at the end by Jota.\n\"It's a good sign that we're disappointed not to take anything from Anfield,\" said Moyes after West Ham's first league defeat since 19 September.\n\"We had really good opportunities to maybe get a second goal. I wanted it to be more than just the odd counter-attack. We were a threat, we were well organised and disciplined in the jobs we had to do.\"\n'Masuaku disappointed with the dive' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It's so difficult with the number of games we have. Seeing the determination and desire of the boys, the will to play football, to deal with setbacks is really exceptional.\n\"The tricky thing is that you have to be patient, but also lively to keep them moving. It's a constant concentration level you have to keep up, which we did - except maybe for their goal.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes on Liverpool's penalty: \"It's not the sort of football I want to be involved in.\n\"I think our player stops and throws his arms up because he's so disappointed about the dive.\n\"I'm just disappointed they didn't turn the decision around. Maybe in the second half the decision [Jota's disallowed goal] went for us, but the first-half one didn't.\"\nHammers drop more points from winning position - the stats\nOnly Aston Villa in 1897-98 (17) have conceded more goals in their first seven league matches as reigning top-flight champions than Liverpool this season (15). The Reds took 23 games to concede 15 Premier League goals last season.\nSince David Moyes' first game back in charge of West Ham in January, the Hammers have dropped more points from winning positions than any other side in the Premier League (16).\nLiverpool have conceded the first goal in three of their four home league games this season - as many times as they did in all 19 league matches at Anfield last term.\nSince the start of last season, West Ham's Pablo Fornals is the only visiting player to score two Premier League goals away to Liverpool, also netting in this exact fixture for the Hammers in 2019-20.\nLiverpool are only the second side in Premier League history to concede the first goal in three consecutive home matches but still win all three, after Blackburn Rovers in November 2009.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool head to Italy next to face Champions League Group D rivals Atalanta on Tuesday (20:00 GMT), while West Ham have a week to prepare for a London derby with Fulham at London Stadium on Saturday, 7 November (20:00 GMT).\nNo Passion, No Point: Gary Lineker on his move from player to presenter\nAmericast: All you need to know as the US election day nears"

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 3-4 Southampton: James Ward-Prowse free-kick double sends Saints third\nClub stalwart James Ward-Prowse marked his 26th birthday with two goals from fantastic free-kicks as Southampton survived a late Aston Villa rally to move up to third in the Premier League.\nThe England midfielder also provided the assist for the opener for Jannik Vestergaard before Danny Ings made it 4-0. Two stoppage-time goals from the home side took some of the gloss off the victory for Ralph Hasenhuttl's men.\nAs for Villa's Dean Smith, his side have now lost their past two games and conceded seven goals in the process having won their first four fixtures.\nAfter having been denied a goal by the finest of margins following a VAR check in the third minute, Saints took the lead when defender Vestergaard thumped home a header from Ward-Prowse's delivery from the right. It was the Dane's second goal in the past two away games.\nIt was 2-0 shortly after the half-hour. Winger Theo Walcott, back in the starting line-up, won a free-kick near the edge of the area for a foul by Douglas Luiz. Ward-Prowse stepped up and whipped the ball past Emiliano Martinez.\nAnd just before half-time, the club's former youth player repeated the trick after Matthew Cash had handled a yard outside the box.\nIngs curled in an exquisite shot after the break for Saints' fourth before Tyrone Mings managed to pull a goal back with 28 minutes of regular time still remaining, but the hosts could not build on it until the game was in its final moments.\nOllie Watkins fired in from the penalty spot in the third minute of stoppage time, before Jack Grealish struck home from outside the area with almost the final kick of the match.\nSmith's side drop to seventh, a point behind Southampton.\nIs Ward-Prowse the Premier League's free-kick king?\nLive text commentary of Sunday's match\nLawro's predictions v The Rap Game UK judge DJ Target\nHasenhuttl's general Ward-Prowse shines at Villa\nThe current longest-serving player, Ward-Prowse has experienced a handful of highs and a clutch of lows with the club in his nine seasons at St Mary's.\nWhen Hasenhuttl was at his lowest ebb last October, following the 9-0 drubbing by Leicester, he looked to the likes of his skipper and Ings to bail him out of trouble. They did so and now the Austrian boss is getting the most out of the pair at the other end of the table.\nWard-Prowse's ability from set-pieces is unquestionable, but on Sunday he reached new heights:\nHe has now scored seven direct free-kick goals for Southampton in the Premier League, equalling the record of ex-player Matt le Tissier.\nHe is the ninth player in Premier League history to score two direct free-kick goals in a game, and the first since Christian Eriksen for Tottenham against Swansea in October 2015.\nHe is the first player to score two direct free-kicks in the first half of a PL game.\nHe also scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the second time, the first being in February 2018.\nThe team as a whole have improved markedly having lost two of the first three matches of the season. A comeback against Chelsea in a 3-3 draw was followed by their 2-0 win over previously unbeaten Everton last week.\nThis match saw them build on those past two displays, especially in attack. It was the first time they had been three goals up at half-time since a 5-1 win over the same team in May 2015.\nThis current crop of Saints are impressive in counter-attacks and carry a big threat from set-pieces. In what could be a Premier League season of surprises, Southampton might be a team that takes full advantage.\nHasenhuttl was delighted with his side's overall performance but said they found it \"mentally difficult\" in the second half.\n\"You concede the first, then you look at the time and you stop playing - this is always dangerous,\" said the 53-year-old, in his third season with the club.\n\"The first two games at the start of the season were a disaster. But we showed a good reaction and now we play how we should. It's good to see how the guys are developing. It's a good message from the boys.\"\nHe said there would be no birthday celebrations for Ward-Prowse.\n\"We travel home in three team buses - we'll have to be celebrating for him on the inside,\" added the Saints boss.\nVilla leave it too late\nThe final scoreline flattered Villa, who only sporadically showed the form that earned them a full 12 points from 12 at the start of the campaign.\nIt was defensive errors that cost them on Sunday. Vestergaard was unchallenged for the opener, Luiz produced a clumsy tackle, while Cash handballed needlessly before he generously gifted Ings space and time to shoot from the edge of the area.\nMings' header with just less than 30 minutes of normal time remaining made the improbable slightly less so, but it was not until stoppage time that they added a second when Watkins fired in after Grealish had been fouled.\nTheir talisman, who had another quiet game, then sent a third past Alex McCarthy, who remained motionless. The home side raced back to the centre circle with the ball but their hopes were dashed by referee Darren England seconds after the restart.\nAfterwards, manager Smith said: \"It's a hard game to decipher. They have a specialist free-kick taker and he's put one on a plate for the first goal and scored two great goals. We were 3-0 down at half-time - we weren't at our best, but it was a bitty half with lots of stoppages.\n\"We had to try and change the game and if it had gone on another five minutes we might have won it, never mind get a point.\"\nIngs' great form continues - stats\nSouthampton have now won 14 of their 34 Premier League away games under Hasenhuttl - their joint highest tally under one manager in the competition, along with Ronald Koeman (14 wins in 38 away games).\nVilla have lost consecutive Premier League games for the first time since July, having gone eight without defeat (W6 D2) prior to their past two games.\nSince the start of last season, only Leicester's Jamie Vardy (29) has scored more Premier League goals than Saints' Danny Ings (27). No player has scored more from outside the box than Ings (five) in this period.\nJannik Vestergaard has scored in each of his last two away games for Southampton in the Premier League, after netting none in his first 22 on the road in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Newcastle on Friday at 20:00 GMT and Villa are at Arsenal next Sunday at 19:15 GMT.\nBecoming President: How does the voting system work?\nUS election: What you need to look out for on the night"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 2-1 Everton: Callum Wilson's double sees Magpies to victory\nEverton missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as Callum Wilson scored twice to give Newcastle a first win in three matches.\nFormer Bournemouth forward Wilson opened the scoring - converting a penalty he had won after being fouled by Andre Gomes - and then tapped in a second from Ryan Fraser's looping cross.\nThe result means Carlo Ancelotti's side remain second, three points behind Liverpool, while the Magpies move up to 10th.\nAfter a largely uneventful first half, the game sparked into life in the second period.\nAnd Newcastle, who had taken a point from their two previous matches, had Wilson to thank for their victory.\nSteve Bruce's side could have added to their tally but Sean Longstaff's powerful close-range effort was brilliantly saved by Robin Olsen, starting in goal for Everton in place of England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin's late goal was not enough to prevent Ancelotti from losing consecutive league games for the first time since September 2014, when he was in charge of Real Madrid.\nFollow all Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v The Rap Game UK judge DJ Target\nEverton's absence of attacking guile\nEverton began the campaign with four consecutive victories to move to the top of the Premier League, but this was another result that will have grounded expectations at Goodison Park.\nNow without a win in three games, Everton's big news prior to kick-off was that Pickford, who has come under scrutiny for several high-profile mistakes, had been dropped after 120 consecutive Premier League appearances.\nIn his place, on-loan Roma goalkeeper Olsen made a confident debut, saving superbly from Allan Saint-Maximin and turning away Longstaff's powerful shot.\nThe Sweden international could not be faulted for either of Newcastle's goals but Everton's biggest problem was at the other end of the pitch.\nWithout suspended forward Richarlison and injured playmaker James Rodriguez, Ancelotti's side struggled to create meaningful chances, mustering just four shots on target.\nA five-man midfield containing players who all prefer to operate from central roles did not help, with Calvert-Lewin not seeing enough of the ball to make an impact until late on.\n\"They are important players missing,\" Ancelotti said.\n\"When you don't have these players you have to play differently, maybe with less quality but with more focus. The goals we conceded, we lacked focus. We have to try to recover players for the next games.\"\nEverton's limitations in attack were highlighted further by 19-year-old Ellis Simms' inclusion as a substitute along with Cenk Tosun, who came on for the first time since 21 December 2019.\nNewcastle's blueprint for success\nAs Premier League contests go, this will not live long in the memory for neutrals - but Bruce will have been pleased by the way his side set out to defend with numbers and break with pace.\nIn the two matches since their 4-1 home defeat by Manchester United on 17 October, Bruce has reverted to a three-man central defence and reaped rewards on both occasions.\nHis team took a point at high-flying Wolves and again looked solid against an Everton side looking to move back to the summit of the table.\nFabian Schar, Jamaal Lascelles and Federico Fernandez - who made more clearances than any other player (10) - were disciplined and dominant at the back.\nAt the other end of the pitch, Miguel Almiron, Allan Saint-Maximin and Wilson provided the pace and power to threaten on the counter.\nNewcastle served notice of their intentions in the first half with Wilson firing over in the sixth minute and then combining with Paraguay international Almiron to create an excellent chance for Saint-Maximin following an Everton corner.\nThat pattern continued and was more effective in the second period, particularly once Wilson had scored from the spot.\n\"It's very rare that you see a team come back to win, so the first goal was critical,\" Bruce said.\n\"I think only he gets the second one. He has got that instinct that you don't coach. He has proved to be a great signing for us.\"\nAnd as Everton pressed for an equaliser, substitute Fraser break down the left allowed Wilson to put the game beyond them.\nNewcastle's penalty gains - match stats\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti has lost consecutive league matches for the first time since September 2014 with Real Madrid in La Liga - 2-4 against Real Sociedad and 1-2 against Atletico Madrid.\nNewcastle have won two of their past three Premier League matches at St James' Park, as many as they had won in their previous 11 top-flight games at home (D4 L5).\nNewcastle have won three penalties in their past five Premier League games, as many as in their previous 76.\nThere has been a penalty awarded to either side in each of the past four Premier League games held at St James' Park, the longest run at this stadium in the top flight since a five-game stretch ending in October 2008.\nEverton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored more Premier League goals against Newcastle (five) than he has versus any other opponent.\nCallum Wilson has scored six goals in his first seven Premier League appearances for Newcastle - only Les Ferdinand has reached six goals in fewer appearances in the Premier League for the Magpies (six).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Southampton for their next Premier League match on Friday, 6 November (20:00 GMT).\nEverton welcome Manchester United to Goodison Park in their next top-flight game on Saturday, 7 November (12:30 GMT).\nBecoming President: How does the voting system work?\nUS election: What you need to look out for on the night"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang penalty decides tight encounter\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang's second-half penalty gave Arsenal their first Premier League away win over Manchester United since 2006.\nAubameyang ended a run of five games without a goal by sending David de Gea the wrong way on 69 minutes after Paul Pogba had fouled Hector Bellerin.\nUnited tried to rally but came no closer to an equaliser than when Donny van de Beek's cross-shot flicked off Mohamed Elneny and then into the face of goalkeeper Bernd Leno before bouncing to safety off a post.\nIt was not the greatest contest between two clubs who used to fight it out for the biggest prizes but are now a pale imitation of their former selves.\nWhile Arsenal will be delighted at the deserved victory, this was not the kind of United performance that did justice to the memory of club legend Nobby Stiles, who died on Friday.\nPogba is the most high-profile figure in the United midfield that World Cup winner Stiles used to operate in. But the Frenchman had a day to forget, giving the ball away too cheaply when his side attacked and needlessly fouling Bellerin to turn the contest Arsenal's way.\nThe Gunners now have 12 points and are up to eighth and United remain in 15th on seven points.\nPogba says he made 'stupid mistake' to concede penalty\nWhy Arsenal win could be defining moment for Arteta - Keown analysis\nReaction from Old Trafford\nArsenal end long wait for a 'big six' away win\nIt is only two weeks since Arsenal visited Manchester and did quite well, only to lose to a Raheem Sterling goal at City. Last week, United and another London club, Chelsea, played out a thoroughly forgettable goalless draw at Old Trafford.\nThe first-half of this contest felt like a combination of the two games.\nUnited were a shadow of the side that hammered RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Tuesday. Their one decent opportunity came when Marcus Rashford found Mason Greenwood with a superb pass across the area but Bernd Leno saved with his feet and would have been disappointed if he had been beaten at the near post.\nArsenal were decent. Egypt midfielder Elneny justified his selection ahead of Granit Xhaka with an excellent performance screening the visitors' defence. Willian schemed ahead of him and Arsenal enjoyed the majority of possession.\nBut they never really looked as though they believed they could score.\nAlexandre Lacazette might have done had Victor Lindelof not nudged Aubameyang's pass away from him.\nWillian skimmed the bar with shortly afterwards and Bukayo Saka should have done far better when Bellerin picked him out with a right-wing cross.\nAubameyang also lacked conviction when he curled an excellent chance wide after the break but given an opportunity from the spot, the former Borussia Dortmund man delivered, in the process ending Arsenal's unwanted 29-game wait for an away win against a fellow 'big six' rival.\nSolskjaer's not celebrating his century\nThis was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 100th game in charge of United - and it still feels like they are taking a step forward, before another going backwards immediately follows.\nOver the past two weeks, United have been excellent at Newcastle, superb in Paris and brilliant against RB Leipzig. In between they were tepid against Chelsea and worse in this game. Add in the 6-1 home defeat by Tottenham just before the international break and it is little wonder questions remain about Solskjaer being the right man for the job.\nHe stuck with the same diamond formation that worked perfectly against Leipzig, only to find it completely ineffective against Mikel Arteta's well-drilled side, who did not allow United the space they had enjoyed in midweek.\nIn addition to Pogba, Bruno Fernandes was anonymous and it can only be concluded Edinson Cavani is still not properly fit, otherwise he would have been introduced far earlier than he was.\nAs it is, United are only three places above the relegation zone and while the season is still early - and they do have a match in hand - they remain without a home win.\nIt is the first time this has happened since 1972 and the gap to the clubs for whom they are expected to challenge for honours with is growing.\n'We didn't turn up' - reaction\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"That's football for you. It goes up and down.\n\"We didn't turn up, especially in the first half. That's what we have to address because we know these boys can be so good.\n\"We knew that this was the big game this week. And unfortunately in the first half we didn't play well enough.\n\"Second half we played better, we never seemed to have to defend too much. But when we did have to, we were too slow and gave away the penalty.\"\n\"The boy is running away from goal, there is no need to go for the ball. Not much of a touch, but it's probably a penalty.\n\"It's for other people to judge if we're making progress.\"\nUnited midfielder Paul Pogba: \"We know it's a poor performance. Myself, I cannot give a foul away like this.\n\"I thought I would touch the ball, but I didn't. (I) cost us the goal today with the penalty.\n\"Like I say, details. We have to do better, the team, myself, it starts with me.\n\"I felt like I touched him a bit, I knew I was in the box, I shouldn't have given a penalty away like that.\n\"Maybe I was a bit out of breath, it made me do this stupid mistake.\"\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta speaking to Match of the Day: \"I wanted to generate belief and I asked them to be who we are as a team right now.\n\"I'm delighted because we played with a lot of courage and big personality.\n\"They played a really tricky formation with four midfielders and two that constantly strain your back four. We could have scored twice in the first half and when we scored the goal we had to manage those moments. There was high stress, it is different to any other ground.\n\"Individually you have to win the fights and step up to the occasion and the performance of every player today was top drawer.\"\nUnited's home slump - the stats\nOnly Chelsea (18) have won more Premier League games against United than Arsenal, with this their 16th victory against the Red Devils.\nUnited have taken just seven points from their six Premier League games this season - their lowest tally at this stage since David Moyes' short stint at the helm in 2013-14 (seven), a campaign in which they went on to finish seventh.\nUnited have failed to win any of their opening four top-flight games at Old Trafford for the first time since 1972-73 - a campaign in which they finished 18th.\nUnited have conceded five penalties in their past seven Premier League home games; the previous five penalties they had conceded at Old Trafford in the competition came over a period of 101 games.\nPogba has conceded three penalties in the Premier League under Solskjaer, while no other Manchester United player has conceded more than one.\nAubameyang is the first Arsenal player to score a penalty at Old Trafford in the Premier League - neither of the previous two attempts were converted (Robin Van Persie in 2011 and Gilberto Silva in 2006).\nWhat's next?\nUnited are next in action in the Champions League, when they have a trip to Istanbul Basaksehir on Wednesday (17:55 GMT). They visit Everton in the Premier League on 7 November (12:30 GMT). Arsenal play Solskjaer's former club Molde in the Europa League on Thursday (20:00 GMT) and then Aston Villa at the Emirates in the Premier League on 8 November (19:15 GMT).\nBecoming President: How does the voting system work?\nUS election: What you need to look out for on the night"

They created lots of difficulties but we had a very good reaction after they equalised.\"\nOn Brighton's controversial equaliser: \"I have to try and stay away from this. I don't know what to say.\"\nOn Gareth Bale's winner: \"We were in need of a goal and I've been telling you for a couple of weeks that Bale is improving. I know he doesn't have 90 minutes of Premier League in his legs.\n\"The good thing with him is he is very intelligent, very experienced and very Tottenham. He understands.\n\"We are using the Europa League matches to improve his condition and today he scored a winning goal, which is a great feeling for the team. It's also a great feeling for the fans because Tottenham fans love Gareth.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter: \"There is a little bit of a talking point about our penalty decision. It is another conversation around refereeing and VAR, which I am not too interested in.\n\"I can't control what they do, when I saw them live I wasn't sure about Harry Kane's one. I'd rather focus on our performance, it was really, really good.\n\"I'm disappointed with the result, but really pleased with the positives. We pushed Tottenham hard and are disappointed to come away with nothing.\"\nKane breaks into all-time top 10 - the stats\nHarry Kane has moved into the top-10 all-time Premier League goals list, notching his 149th strike to move level with Les Ferdinand.\nOnly the bottom three sides have lost more games in the Premier League this season than Brighton (four).\nTottenham (14 points) end the day as high as second in the Premier League table for the first time since February 2019 under Mauricio Pochettino.\nOf the 12 players to have taken at least 25 Premier League penalties, only Matt Le Tissier (96%) and Thierry Henry (92%) have a higher penalty conversion rate than Harry Kane (88%, 22/25).\nWhat's next?\nTottenham are off to Bulgaria to face Ludogorets in the Europa League on Thursday (17:55 GMT), while Brighton are back in action on Friday at home to Burnley in the Premier League (17:30 GMT).\nBecoming President: How does the voting system work?\nUS election: What you need to look out for on the night"

However, the hosts then became the better side with the lively Ademola Lookman shooting wide from 20 yards out.\nFulham's opening goal came in the 26th minute as Antonee Robinson's left-wing cross was headed back into the danger zone by the impressive Mitrovic and Decordova-Reid converted for his third goal of the season in all competitions.\nIt only took the home side four minutes to move 2-0 in front. Aina started the move on the right flank, he linked up with Cordova-Reid and played the ball into the feet of Mitrovic, who, with his back to goal, laid the ball back into Aina's path and he struck a beautiful effort into the top corner for a spectacular first Premier League goal.\nAndre-Frank Zambo Anguissa could have even made it 3-0 before the break as he collected the ball following a fine run from captain Cairney but could only shoot at West Brom goalkeeper Sam Johnstone.\nFulham had been on a run of four away matches since losing 3-0 at home to Aston Villa, after which co-owner Tony Khan apologised to the club's fans, but their supporters would have been much happier after this showing.\nWest Brom need to quickly improve\nWest Brom boss Bilic would have targeted this match as one where three points were possible, but, despite having more possession, will be frustrated with the performance of his players.\nThe Baggies have now conceded a league-high 16 goals and it was poor marking for Fulham's first as Mitrovic then Decordova-Reid were able to head the ball unchallenged, although West Brom could have done little about Aina's strike for 2-0.\nKarlan Grant should have pulled a goal back at the end of the first half, shooting wide from the edge of the penalty area, as the Baggies went the opening 45 minutes without a shot on target.\nBilic brought on Romaine Sawyers, Callum Robinson and Matt Phillips, with captain Jake Livermore one of those replaced, in an attempt to change the game in the second half, but they were unable to make a difference and it was a comfortable night for Areola in the home goal.\nThis is West Brom's first season in the top flight since 2017-18, but Bilic will be looking for an instant improvement all over the field if they are to avoid being in a relegation battle for the rest of this campaign.\nMan of the match - Aleksandar Mitrovic (Fulham)\nWest Brom's worst start in 35 years - the stats\nFulham are unbeaten in their last 10 league meetings with West Brom (won four, drew six) since a 2-1 loss in the Premier League in October 2010.\nWest Brom have not won away at Fulham in the league since October 1967 (2-1), drawing seven and losing 10 of their 17 visits since then.\nFulham have picked up their first victory and clean sheet in the Premier League since April 2019 against Cardiff (1-0), ending their eight-game winless run in the top flight.\nWith just three points from their opening seven Premier League games this season (drew three, lost four), West Brom have made their worst start to a league campaign since 1985-86 (one point), failing to win any of their opening seven games for the first time since 2004-05.\nOn his 50th league appearance for Fulham (including play-offs), Bobby Decordova-Reid netted Fulham's opener - he has scored two goals in his last five league games for the Cottagers, as many as in his previous 25.\nFulham's Ola Aina netted his first ever goal in English League football in what was his 51st appearance across spells with Chelsea, Hull and Fulham.\nAleksandar Mitrovic has been directly involved in 57% of Fulham's Premier League goals this season (four of seven - two goals, two assists).\n'The work rate was nowhere near good enough' - what they said\nFulham manager Scott Parker: \"Of course there is relief because we had not won a game. We have won but along the journey there are going to be many bumps.\n\"There has been a narrative around us because of the money we spent last time. But there has been a single-mindedness about us this season. Defeats are going to happen but they can't bury us.\n\"The noise surrounds everyone in this league. My message is very different: Try not to let the noise reach the players. Wins breed a bit of confidence - you need wins to get that uplift.\n\"We definitely got what we deserved. We are definitely maturing and definitely improving. We got a result and it is brilliant but we have to keep moving forward.\"\nFulham's Ola Aina told Sky Sports: \"I'm happy to score my first Premier League goal. It was vital and I'm just happy I was able to help the team to get a lead that we could build on and try to be comfortable.\n\"It was a very important win for the club. It has been a difficult start to the season. We needed this to build momentum and I'm hoping that's what we can do going on.\"\nWest Brom boss Slaven Bilic told BBC Sport: \"The lads have been good in training but we only played for 25 minutes.\n\"They were better than us in everything, one v one, two v two, passing the ball, aggression and commitment, everything really and I'm extremely disappointed - we can't play like this.\n\"We have to be what we were in the last couple of games. You lose a bit of commitment when you see that the opponent is stronger than you. They were better and I'm really disappointed.\n\"We need to be much better in everything. It all starts with the work-rate, it was nowhere near good enough. We didn't hurt them enough, it was very slow, waiting for something to happen, that's why we couldn't do anything.\n\"It's worrying - not the points or position, but the performance. Everything starts with the work rate, commitment, dedication and we simply didn't match them and have to work much, much harder.\n\"We don't have the most quality.

        "article_text": "Leeds United 1-4 Leicester City: Foxes move within a point of top\nYouri Tielemans struck twice as Leicester recorded an emphatic win at Leeds to move to within a point of Premier League leaders Liverpool.\nJamie Vardy was involved in the Foxes' first three goals - teeing up Harvey Barnes within two minutes for the opener after a costly mistake by Robin Koch.\nTielemans netted Leicester's second - pouncing on a rebound from Vardy's diving header - before Stuart Dallas' cross flew all the way into the net for Leeds after half-time.\nBut Leeds' response in the second half was stumped as Vardy netted a third for Leicester before Tielemans scored from the spot in stoppage time.\nMarcelo Bielsa's side - without record-signing Rodrigo, forced to self-isolate after coming into contact with somebody who tested positive for coronavirus - were made to pay for a sloppy first half.\nPatrick Bamford had headed it tamely into Kasper Schmeichel's arms seconds before Barnes' early opener and Pablo Hernandez struck the post in the second half.\nBut the Foxes killed off the game late on to pick up their fourth win in a row.\nRuthless start sets Leicester on way\nLeicester started last season in blistering form and they are doing the same in 2020-21.\nThere was an intensity to their start in this match too - Barnes hurrying Koch into the early mistake, as the defender's pass back was picked up by Vardy, who selflessly laid it on a plate for his team-mate.\nVardy and Barnes combined throughout the first half and the striker's presence alone seemed to cause anxiety among the Leeds defenders.\nIt was only a matter of time before Vardy - whose diving header rebounded kindly for Tielemans to make it 2-0 - got on the scoresheet himself. He did so in the 76th minute, just as Leeds threatened to get back into the game.\nLeicester's aggressive pressing in the first half saw possession overturned on countless occasions and the hosts were unable to deal with transitions on the counter-attack.\nTheir first-half dominance set the foundations and Brendan Rodgers was then smart to react as Leeds gained momentum in the second half - the Leicester manager bringing on James Maddison and Cengiz Under, who contributed to the third and fourth goals.\nMaddison's through ball picked out Under, who smartly chipped it into Vardy's path for the third. Mateusz Klich was then penalised for a foul just inside the box on Maddison - referee Andre Marriner confirming the decision only after reviewing the incident on the VAR pitchside screen.\nLeicester maintained a sense of maturity and never looked like throwing away the win, thanks largely to Vardy's consistent threat. It was a display that offered a reminder as to why the Foxes were top-four contenders last season - and a statement that they intend to be in the fight again.\nEarly mistakes prove costly for Leeds\nBamford went into this match having scored six times in Leeds' opening six Premier League matches, a run that included a hat-trick at Aston Villa.\nBut when the striker headed tamely into Schmeichel's arms from an unmarked position a few yards out within two minutes, it set the tone for the first half.\nLeicester were sharp, ruthless and clinical, whereas Leeds looked shaky in possession and indecisive off the ball.\nKoch's mistake, seconds after Bamford's missed chance, was a gift for Barnes, and Leeds struggled to settle afterwards.\nSkipper Liam Cooper misjudged the bounce of the ball under pressure from Vardy in the minutes that followed, while goalkeeper Illan Meslier almost fumbled a cross inside his near post and Helder Costa turned into trouble in the build-up to a chance for Luke Thomas later on.\nBamford's poor touch when he was played through on goal towards the end of the half summed things up but Bielsa's team talk at the break seemed to spur Leeds on.\nThey were fortunate when Dallas' cross flew over everybody in the box and into Schmeichel's net - but Hernandez's curling effort, which struck the post, could have changed the game.\nLeeds were more urgent - Dallas picking up a yellow card for an overly aggressive tackle on Marc Albrighton, while the coaching staff encouraged quick throw-ins to keep the intensity up.\nBut Leeds failed to deal with the runs in behind from Vardy and when Maddison came on, he had a big impact in midfield - regaining control and creating opportunities with his direct passing.\nThe result leaves Leeds 12th - yet only three points outside the top four - going into matches against Crystal Palace, Arsenal and Everton, which will give a clearer indication as to where their season is heading.\n'There is a long way to go' - what they said\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa to BBC Sport: \"In the first 30 minutes, we defended poorly and after that we didn't create enough danger. That is one of the main responsibilities of the manager.\n\"I am not taking the blame, just stating the players were not correctly distributed. The players are disappointed.

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 0-0 Burnley: Premier League strugglers play out draw\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said \"it needs to come quickly\" as they look \"to get on the right side of the margins\" after a goalless draw with fellow strugglers Brighton.\nThe Clarets, having their worst ever start to a top-flight season, are on two points from seven games, while the Seagulls have not won in six league games.\nBurnley's best chance was accidental as Matt Lowton's deep cross flew over Mat Ryan but hit the crossbar.\nBrighton dominated as they often do but could not beat Nick Pope in Burnley's goal. Pope did well to deny Danny Welbeck on his first start for Brighton.\nThis was a game that will have not been watched by many - behind closed doors and on pay-per-view - and that is probably for the best.\n\"We didn't create as much as we'd like,\" Dyche told BBC Sport. \"I thought the mentality was right. We looked more like ourselves with our defensive shape and urgency.\n\"We know we have to create better chances but it's a base to build on. We're never a million miles away. We're getting closer.\"\nReaction plus Southampton v Newcastle updates\nDifferent styles, same disappointing result\nThis was always going to be a game of contrasting approaches - Graham Potter's ball-playing Brighton against Sean Dyche's pragmatic Burnley, and so it proved.\nThis is Burnley's joint-worst start to a league season, along with 1977-78 when they were in the second tier. The last time they failed to win their opening seven games, back in 2014-15, they were relegated.\nThe big positive was the return of captain Ben Mee for his first appearance of the season following a thigh injury.\nBut there was little to cheer on the pitch, with Chris Wood heading the ball at Ryan in their only shot on target and Robbie Brady putting a bicycle kick wide.\nYou always know what you will get with Brighton - they passed 100 Premier League shots for the season in this game. Only Liverpool have had more. They rank sixth in the league for possession too.\nBut they nearly always fail to take their chances.\nTariq Lamptey had an opportunity to put them ahead after 60 seconds but fired over from Welbeck's lay-off.\nWelbeck was sent into the box by Neal Maupay - back after being left out last weekend for disciplinary reasons - but his shot was saved by Pope.\nThey ended with 19 shots, but nine of them were blocked. Adam Webster headed over and Maupay hit the target, but it felt as if both teams could be there all day and not score.\n\"You've got to score,\" Potter said. \"That was the only thing missing from our performance. We restricted Burnley to pretty much nothing.\n\"Performance-wise, I'm really happy. We're always looking to improve. It's disappointing to only get one point.\n\"The team gave everything. We were playing a dangerous opponent but we had a good control of things.\"\nThe two 0-0 kings - match stats\nBrighton had 19 shots - the most by any side without managing to score in any Premier League match this season so far.\nBurnley's tally of two points is their joint-lowest after their first seven league games of a season in their history (D2 L5), along with 1977-78 in the second tier (assuming three points for a win all-time).\nSince they were promoted to the Premier League in 2017, Brighton have played out more goalless draws in the competition than any other side (12), while Burnley are also second for most top-flight 0-0s in this time (11).\nBrighton have picked up six points in their eight Premier League games this season (W1 D3 L4), their lowest tally after their first eight matches of a league campaign since 2002-03 (four points), when they were eventually relegated from the second tier.\nBurnley have failed to score in four consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since May 2015 (six in a row).\nBrighton had 12 shots in the first half against Burnley, the most the Seagulls have ever attempted in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game.\nWhat's next?\nIt is the international break now - with both sides back in action on Saturday, 21 November at 15:00 GMT.

We should stay hungry and we should feel anything is possible with this team.\nQuiz: Can you name every Premier League table topper?\nReaction as Southampton go top of the Premier League\n\"I must be very proud. We developed not with a lot of invested money but with a lot of invested work.\n\"We had some good results in the past two or three months and it was important everyone can see the philosophy we are following can be successful.\n\"Everyone was on the highest level and it's a little bit scary what we're doing at the moment. But it's not surprising because I see them working.\"\nIt was a dominant performance for Hasenhuttl's side, who moved the ball well and deservedly ran out winners after Che Adams' superb first-half volley and Stuart Armstrong's drilled effort late on.\nNewcastle, who remain 11th in the table, were the exact opposite and contributed to their defeat by carelessly losing the ball in dangerous positions for both goals.\n\"The goals we gave away probably summed up our evening,\" said Magpies manager Steve Bruce.\n\"We gave it away far too cheaply and far too often. We were a shadow of the team I saw against Everton.\"\nNo Ings, no problem\nWith top scorer Danny Ings injured Saints fans could have been forgiven for wondering just where their goals were going to come from.\nIngs, whose impressive early-season form led to an England recall five years after his last cap, had been responsible for 36% of Southampton's goals prior to this fixture after forming an effective partnership with Adams.\nSo, in his absence it was hardly a surprise to see Adams assume more responsibility, with Theo Walcott - back at his first club on loan from Everton after 15 years away - cast in a supporting central role.\nOnly an excellent save from Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow prevented Adams from scoring with a curling effort towards the top right corner.\nBut moments later he opened the scoring with a wonderful volley from 12 yards after good work from Kyle Walker-Peters and Walcott.\nWith Oriol Romeu and James Ward-Prowse controlling the tempo and popping passes around and through the visitors, Saints eventually got a merited second goal.\nLongstaff's dawdling saw Armstrong deprive him of the ball and cut inside before dispatching a left-foot shot into the bottom left corner.\nIt was no more than Saints - who saw Darlow tip a sparkling Romeu effort onto the crossbar - deserved and it underlined a remarkable turnaround in their fortunes from 12 months ago.\nLanguishing in the bottom three and still reeling from that loss to Leicester, Hasenhuttl and Southampton appeared to be in turmoil.\nNow they are top of the pile and the Austrian is being linked with the Manchester United manager's role currently occupied by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nNewcastle's profligacy in possession costs them\nDefensive solidity had been a key facet of Newcastle's previous two Premier League outings.\nSo Magpies boss Bruce's frustration in the technical area was evident as his team appeared to dispense with a formula that worked so well against Wolves and Everton.\nNot only did Newcastle fail to play the percentages in defence, they constantly lost possession cheaply as they over-played.\n\"You have to be good with the ball and make sure you look after it better than we did,\" Bruce added.\n\"That's why the players play at this level because they are expected to. From six minutes in we gifted them the first goal, then it was a difficult night all round.\n\"We were nowhere near where we were five days ago. That's my biggest issue - that we go up and down. It was a poor, poor performance.\"\nOnly two Newcastle players managed a passing accuracy of over 80% and that ensured they were unable to construct any sort of foundation to attack.\nAlmiron and Longstaff will bear the brunt of Bruce's anger over the goals but Jamal Lewis, Federico Fernandez and Jacob Murphy also put their side into difficulty on several occasions.\nNot even a tweak in style to be more direct with the introduction of Andy Carroll and Joelinton could rouse Newcastle, who won on the same ground in March.\nSaints on the march - the stats\nNewcastle have conceded a goal in seven consecutive league games; it's their longest run without a Premier League clean sheet since December 2017 (11 in a row).\nSouthampton have won three consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since winning four in a row in May 2016 under Ronald Koeman.\nSouthampton have picked up 16 points in their eight Premier League games this season (W5 D1 L2); they have never had more at this stage of a campaign in the competition (level with 2014-15).\nChe Adams has scored in three of Southampton's eight league games this season (three goals), as many different Premier League matches as he found the net in in 30 appearances last term (four goals).\nSouthampton's Theo Walcott, who has assisted a goal in three of his last four league starts, has been directly involved in more Premier League goals against Newcastle than any other opponent in his career (11 - five goals, six assists).\nStuart Armstrong scored just his third Premier League goal on home soil for Southampton, and his first in the competition at St Mary's since February against Aston Villa.\nIn what was his 350th Premier League appearance, Walcott finally made his home Premier League debut for Southampton, 14 years and 314 days after his last league match for the club at St Mary's in December 2005 in the Championship.\nWhat's next?\nFollowing the international break both sides return to action in the Premier League on Saturday 21 November.\nSouthampton travel to Molineux to face Wolves (15:00 GMT) with Newcastle hosting Chelsea earlier in the day (12:30 GMT).\nWatch 13 first-round ties on iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app this weekend.

        "article_text": "Everton 1-3 Manchester United: Bruno Fernandes scores twice at Goodison\nBruno Fernandes' double eased the pressure on boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as Manchester United got back to winning ways at Everton.\nFollowing their calamitous defeat against Istanbul Basaksehir in midweek and a loss to Arsenal last Sunday, it looked like the visitors were heading for more negative headlines when Everton took the lead after 19 minutes.\nJordan Pickford's punt forward was flicked on by Dominic Calvert-Lewin before Bernard found the bottom corner with a crisp strike.\nBut within the space of 13 minutes, Solskjaer's team completed a turnaround.\nThey equalised five minutes after going behind when Fernandes ghosted into the box and headed past Pickford from Luke Shaw's cross for his fifth goal of the season.\nThen after Lucas Digne had hit David de Gea's right post with a rising shot, United went ahead as Fernandes's lofted cross towards Marcus Rashford dropped into the bottom corner.\nThere were further chances for a much-improved United before Edinson Cavani scored his first goal for the club on the counter-attack in the final minute of added time.\nThe win sees United avoid their worst start to a top-flight season after seven games since 1989-90, and gives Solskjaer breathing space as the Premier League heads into the International break.\nVictory for Everton would have taken them to the top of the table, but they struggled to break down United after their opener and were thankful to Pickford who returned to the side and made several saves.\nA third successive defeat means they remain fifth in the table as United climb to 13th.\nMan Utd were set up to fail with kick-off time - Solskjaer\nIs under-pressure Solskjaer back from the brink again?\nFollow Saturday's Premier League live\nUnited offer perfect response to Solskjaer pressure\nPressure had mounted on Solskjaer after poor results and performances in two games over the past week.\nBut the Norwegian maintained that he would not \"fall like a house of cards\" and insisted he is the right man to take the club forward, despite former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino being linked with his job.\nOnce again, Solskjaer showed that when the pressure is on his team can produce a positive result, and it underlined his point that maybe the team is not in crisis but lacking consistency.\nHaving made four changes to the side that lost in Istanbul, Everton's opener did little to calm fears about the United defence, which conceded a shocking first goal on Wednesday from their own corner.\nEverton took a route-one approach with Calvert-Lewin's flick leading to Bernard's shot which hit the post on its way in.\nBut with Victor Lindelof back in the side, and more protection from Fred and Scott McTominay in midfield, United were more solid in defence, and had the wizardry of Fernandes to get them back into the game.\nThe Portuguese likes Goodison Park, having scored here last season in a 1-1 draw, and his header was well-taken after he found space in the Everton box.\nShaw, who took advantage of James Rodriguez failing to track back, also helped in United's second by allowing Rashford to drift inside and support Fernandes for his sixth goal of the season.\nHarry Maguire was much improved, but was involved in successive dramas around the hour mark when he had a penalty appeal turned down by the video assistant referee before taking out Digne with a hefty challenge despite getting the ball.\nBut Solskjaer, who could rightly point to further chances for Rashford, would have been relieved by Cavani's injury-time goal as Everton searched for an equaliser.\nThe Uruguayan swept in from Fernandes' pass to get off the mark and make it an almost perfect day for United and their under-fire manager.\nThe only concern was that Shaw and Rashford were both taken off because of injury.\nEverton search for defensive answers as Pickford has mixed afternoon\nEverton's early-season form, where they won their first five league games, has quickly unravelled and despite making six changes from the side which lost to Newcastle last weekend, Ancelotti will have been disappointed his side failed to avoid defeat once more.\nWith Pickford, Rodriguez, Seamus Coleman, Mason Holgate, Digne and Bernard back, there was an improvement from the hosts, who began the game brightly.\nThe goal was direct but effective, something which Everton's manager has called for.\nBut there will be questions about Everton's defending as they let Fernandes drift into the penalty area for the equaliser and how they then conceded again seven minutes later.\nThe visitors, like Southampton before them, took advantage of the weak spot down Everton's right hand side, where Rodriguez tends not to track back.\nThe Colombian, who returned from injury had a shot blocked but failed to impose his undoubted quality on the game, and the performance once again underlined the importance to the team of the suspended Richarlison.\nEverton have never won a league game without the Brazilian in the side, following his arrival in 2018.\nPickford, who was told by Ancelotti to trust his instinct more in games, had a mixed afternoon.\nHe saved well from Rashford's effort, but also nearly contributed to what would have been a poor goal after 59 minutes when he dropped Juan Mata's free-kick before Maguire clipped it over the bar from close range.\nIn the end, it was not decisive, but if Everton have European hopes this season, their defence, Pickford included, is in need of improvement and they have now failed to keep a clean sheet in seven league games.\n'This was a really difficult, bad period for us' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to BBC Sport: \"The kick-off time set us up to fail. We have been to Turkey, played loads of games this season already, we got back Thursday morning and we are playing Saturday lunchtime, it's an absolute shambles.\n\"We got back on Thursday morning at 4am, what is the problem with playing on Sunday? Look after the players, we already have too many injuries in the Premier League, not just my players but others too.\"\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti to BBC Sport: \"We have to stabilise the defence, this is for sure, but it is not a problem individually - it is collective work and this is absolutely normal.\n\"It is fortunate that there is an international break This was a really difficult, bad period for us and I hope that is finished. I hope we can come back from the international break in the way we started this season.\"\nThe best of the stats\nManchester United are just the third team to win three consecutive Premier League away games after conceding the first goal, after Leeds United (October 1999) and Tottenham Hotspur (December 2013).\nThey have now won 17 Premier League away games at Goodison Park, the most victories for a visiting side at a specific venue in the competition.\nIt's the first time Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti has lost three league games in a row since November 2006 with AC Milan.\nBoth sides scored with their first shots on target in this match, with Everton's goal in the 19th minute their only effort on target in the whole match.\nManchester United's first two goals in this match both had 15+ passes in the build-up, the first time the Red Devils have scored 2+ such goals in the same league match since November 2016 (vs Swansea).\nFernandes has had a hand in 15 Premier League goals in his 10 Premier League away matches (10 goals, 5 assists); it's the most goal involvements a player has had in their first 10 games on the road in the competition, while only Kevin Phillips scored as many (10).\nHe has now scored 18 goals in all competitions for Manchester United, with his equalising strike today his first headed goal for the club.\nCavani (33y 267d) became the oldest player to score his first Premier League goal since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in August 2016 (34y 316d).\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to Fulham on Saturday, 21 November (15:00 GMT kick-off), while Manchester United host West Brom at Old Trafford on the same day, also at 15:00 GMT.\nWatch 13 first-round ties on iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app this weekend.

They could ill afford the same against Leeds.\nWith Eze and Ayew handed starts - along with James McArthur in place of suspended captain Luka Milivojevic - Palace duly responded at Selhurt Park as Eze set up Van Aanholt to force an early save from Illan Meslier.\nEze's influence grew from there as the England youth international offered boundless energy in both attack and defence, though it was his quality from set-pieces which allowed Palace to stamp their authority.\nAfter Dann managed to squeeze his header past Meslier's fingertips, Eze, in just his third Premier League start since moving from Queens Park Rangers, won his free-kick with a driving run before whipping the ball over the wall with power and precision.\nUnshaken by Leeds' response, the hosts enjoyed good fortune as Costa's own-goal restored a two-goal cushion and Hodgson's side remained comfortable as Ayew slotted in from Wilfried Zaha's pass to add gloss to the scoreline.\nPalace have now already registered three or more goals in two of their eight league games so far, including their 3-1 win over Manchester United, despite failing to do so in any match last term.\nBamford displays progress on Selhurst return\nAfter enjoying a run of one defeat in five games, Marcelo Bielsa's side have now fallen to successive 4-1 defeats following Monday's loss to Leicester.\nDespite recording an impressive 3-0 win against Aston Villa in their game prior, Bielsa lamented a lack of \"danger\" created by his side six days ago. Eight goals conceded in two games would suggest the problem lies at the opposite end.\nOn the evidence of Saturday's defeat, there appear to be few concerns in attack as Bamford continues to deliver some wonderful finishes - even if his best at Selhurst Park was not allowed to stand.\nThe 27-year-old made it seven goals in eight Premier League games after his well-taken goal put Leeds back in contention, but he had already been harshly denied with the score at 1-0.\nBamford's arm was found to be offside by VAR as he pointed to where he wanted the ball to be played, though he responded with another great finish to demonstrate his progress since his loan spell at Selhurst Park - a stint that ended early because of a lack of opportunity.\nOnly defending champions Liverpool had amassed more shots after seven Premier League games than Leeds, but neither Struijk nor Alioski could find a breakthrough and Bamford headed wide as the game drifted from their grasp.\n'It was a fair defeat' - what the managers said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson told BBC Sport: \"We played very well. It was important we had the tactical discipline that we had and important we played as well on the ball as we did. We took those opportunities well and were very good value for those four goals.\"\n\"Wins are hard to come by and when you get one you have to be happy with that success, then come down to earth quick enough so you start from zero the next time you take to the field.\"\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa said: \"It is not only two games, it has been four games where he have conceded four goals. We are receiving a lot of goals.\n\"It was a fair defeat. It could have been by a shorter distance, the goals of Palace arrived when we looked like getting back into the game.

        "article_text": "Chelsea 4-1 Sheffield United: Comfortable win for Blues leaves Sheff Utd bottom\nChelsea came from behind to beat Sheffield United comfortably at Stamford Bridge, leaving the visitors bottom of the Premier League on another frustrating evening for Chris Wilder's side.\nDavid McGoldrick gave the Blades the lead in the ninth minute with a deft flick from close range.\nBut Tammy Abraham's scuffed half-volley bounced past Aaron Ramsdale for Chelsea's equaliser, before Ben Chilwell touched in Hakim Ziyech's cross at the back post.\nZiyech turned provider again after the break when Thiago Silva headed in his free-kick at the near post, before Timo Werner added a fourth.\nThe result leaves Sheffield United with one point from their opening eight matches, while Chelsea move up to third, a point behind leaders Southampton.\nHow much trouble are Sheff Utd in this season?\nReaction from Stamford Bridge and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\n'Amazing' Ziyech impresses\nThree of Chelsea's new signings were on the scoresheet but it was another summer recruit who stole the show in west London on Saturday.\nZiyech, who picked up two assists, showed his quality with countless deliveries into the box from set-pieces and a range of exquisite passing.\nHe was involved in the build-up to the opening goal and his deep cross caused Ramsdale problems minutes later and the ball was parried into the path of Werner, who slid in to smash it on to the crossbar.\nAnother ball in from Ziyech - almost identical to the previous one - bounced in off Chilwell after Ramsdale failed to deal with it to make it 2-1, and the Moroccan's free-kick was then nodded in by Silva.\nThe midfielder could have set up a few more too. His sublime ball through to Werner was chipped inches wide by the former RB Leipzig man, who gave a big thumbs up to Ziyech in return.\nManager Frank Lampard was full of praise for Ziyech afterwards, describing the 27-year-old's performance as \"amazing\".\n\"He was probably at his best today,\" Lampard told BBC Sport. \"He has a good confidence and arrogance about him - a good arrogance. He will keep trying those passes and keep trying to get those assists.\"\nSheff Utd's rotten form continues\nSheffield United started the day propping up the Premier League table following Burnley's draw at Brighton on Friday and they will not have a chance to move off the bottom for another 15 days.\nIt has been a disappointing start for the Blades and any hopes of turning things around at Stamford Bridge seemed to evaporate before half-time.\nMcGoldrick's delightful flick gave them a surprising lead - it was the first goal Chelsea had conceded in 459 minutes - but it prompted the visitors to drop deeper off the ball rather than play on the front foot.\nThe Blues took advantage, exploiting their opponents' vulnerability and testing goalkeeper Ramsdale with constant deliveries into the box.\nRamsdale himself had a few nervous moments - the hesitation for Chilwell's goal, the parry which was almost rebounded in by Werner and a fumble from Ziyech's cross in the second half.\nSheffield United, who were able to keep the scoreline down against Manchester City on 31 October, could not do the same at Stamford Bridge and they provided very little threat going forward.\nThe international break potentially comes at a good time for the Blades, after defeats by Liverpool and Arsenal, as well as City and Chelsea, in the past month.\nIt will be a crucial period when they return too, as they take on 15th-placed West Ham United and West Bromwich Albion, who are third from bottom before they host Tottenham on Sunday.\n'The balance of the team felt great' - what they said\nChelsea manager Lampard to BBC Sport: \"It was enjoyable. This is a team that is so difficult to play against. They are a great team with an incredible coach. The reaction was brilliant to the goal - we created a lot and were really secure. I'm happy with everybody.\n\"The balance of the team felt great. There were so many good things in what we were creating, we scored two goals from set-pieces.\n\"I don't want to get too carried away but I'm happy.\"\nSheffield United boss Wilder to BBC Sport: \"At times my teams are naive.

        "article_text": "West Ham 1-0 Fulham: Ademola Lookman misses penalty as Tomas Soucek seals win\nFulham's Ademola Lookman missed a Panenka-style penalty with the last kick of the game as West Ham clinched a dramatic victory with an injury-time winner of their own.\nThe game had looked on course to end goalless before Tomas Soucek drove home from substitute Said Benrahma's pass inside the box in the first minute of injury time.\nBut Fulham were awarded a 95th-minute penalty when Benrahma caught Tom Cairney and, after a check by the video assistant referee, the spot-kick was awarded.\nAleksandar Mitrovic had missed his previous penalty so Lookman stepped up but his chipped effort lacked any sort of power, leaving Lukasz Fabianski waiting to make an ultimately comfortable catch.\n'You can't take a penalty like that' - Parker angry with Lookman\nLookman, who has been one of Fulham's better players so far this season, understandably looked devastated when the referee blew for full-time as the chance of what would have been a well-earned point slipped away.\nFulham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola had made a number of excellent saves to deny West Ham and put the visitors within minutes of a second successive clean sheet after claiming their first win of the season against West Brom last time out.\nAreola, who is on loan from Paris St-Germain, kept out Arthur Masuaku, Aaron Cresswell and Jarrod Bowen inside the first 10 minutes and also pushed Cresswell's free-kick onto the bar early in the second half.\nFulham finished strongly and had good chances to take all three points themselves as Lookman and Bobby Decordova-Reid both drew saves out of Fabianski.\nBut just as they looked to leave West Ham with a point, Soucek's late winner and Lookman's poor penalty ensured it was the hosts who claimed their third win of the season.\nShould the West Ham goal have stood?\nTo add to Fulham's frustrations, both managers were in agreement after the game that there were question marks over whether Soucek's goal should have even stood.\nThe contentious issue was that a ball into the box was aimed at Haller, who was in an offside position, but play continued and the ball was headed down to Benrahma by the Fulham defence to produce the assist for Soucek to strike.\n\"A tough call on Fulham for our goal because the offside rule is not a good rule. I would claim offside for that, but we get a goal from it,\" said West Ham boss David Moyes.\n\"None of us really know the offside rule now,\" said Fulham boss Scott Parker. \"We've got VAR, every gadget and gimmick and there are so many things to look at nobody knows.\n\"He's (Haller) interfering with play, my defender can't leave it.\"\nDefeat unfortunate for much-improved Fulham\nFulham had made a terrible start to the season that suggested they would be heading back to the Championship with a whimper, losing their first four games.\nBut in their last two matches there have been significant signs of improvement. They were good value for their win against West Brom and they withstood some early pressure in this game that previously might have seen them wilt.\nAfter that, their defence was rarely troubled as a West Ham side missing the attacking spark of Michail Antonio struggled to make an impression in the final third.\nFailing to take a point in such a cruel fashion will be difficult to take for Fulham fans but their overall display in the 90 minutes before then should provide encouragement for the future.\nHammers run continues - the stats\nWest Ham are unbeaten in their last 11 home league games against Fulham (won seven, drawn four), with the Hammers currently on a four-game winning streak, their longest since a five-game run between September 1953 and September 1957.\nFulham are winless in their last 17 Premier League London derbies (16 losses), with their current run of 13 consecutive defeats in such matches a top-flight record.\nFulham have won just one of their last 25 Premier League games on the road in the Premier League, a 1-0 victory against Bournemouth in April 2019.\nWest Ham manager David Moyes is unbeaten in his 14 Premier League home games against Fulham (W13 D1).\nSince scoring with two consecutive efforts in January 2019 against Brighton, Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored with just three of his last 77 shots in the Premier League. He hasn't scored with any of his last 46 non-penalty shots with his right or left foot since a goal against Huddersfield Town in December 2018.\nWest Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski has saved seven penalties since the start of the 2016-17 Premier League campaign; three more than any other goalkeeper.\nWest Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek's goal was West Ham's first 90th-minute winner since Javier Hernandez scored in a 4-3 thriller against Huddersfield Town in March 2019.\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break West Ham travel to Sheffield United on Sunday, 22 November (14:00 GMT) while Fulham host Everton on Saturday, 21 November (15:00 GMT).\nWatch 13 first-round ties on iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app this weekend.

        "article_text": "West Brom 0-1 Tottenham: 'Special' Harry Kane scores 150th goal in win\nManager Jose Mourinho hailed Harry Kane's \"special\" qualities after the striker's 150th Premier League goal earned Tottenham victory at West Brom.\nA third successive league victory temporarily lifted Spurs to the top of the table on Sunday before Leicester replaced them after their 1-0 win against Wolves.\nA game of few chances seemed destined to end goalless after Hugo Lloris had kept out Darnell Furlong's second-half header and a flurry of Tottenham chances had come and gone without reward.\nBut, as has been the case so often in the past, Kane punished a minor lack of concentration to head home an 88th-minute winner.\nMourinho said: \"This guy does much more than scoring goals. For example, last five minutes he was playing as a number six and winning balls in front of the defence. Special.\"\nHe added: \"Harry Kane you have to say has this many goals, this many assists, this number of balls recovered, this number of duels won. This number of balls that he saved his team in defensive set-pieces. This is Harry Kane. It's goals plus this and this and this and that.\"\nThe England captain's latest feat comes only days after he scored his 200th goal for the club. Midfielder Eric Dier paid tribute to his team-mate's latest \"fantastic record\".\nHe said: \"He broke one in midweek and now he has another one. It won't affect him too much, he will want another 150.\"\nThe decisive moment arrived when West Brom's defence failed to track Kane's run into the box, allowing him to leap unchecked to meet Matt Doherty's cross and guide the ball over goalkeeper Sam Johnstone.\nFor West Brom, who have now scored once in their last five games, it was a result that keeps them in the relegation zone and already facing a tough battle to retain their top-flight status.\nIs Mourinho gearing up for Spurs title challenge?\nLive coverage of Sunday's Premier League games\nSpurs are title contenders\nIt is too early for Spurs fans to get carried away, but when you look at some of the players who did not even make Mourinho's matchday squad - Harry Winks, Davinson Sanchez and Steven Bergwijn - there is no reason why they should not be competing for the biggest prize.\nApart from the start of his final season at Manchester United, when they played a day before everyone else, this was the first time a Mourinho side topped the Premier League - albeit briefly - since September 2017.\nMourinho has infused grit and organisation into an already top side - not to mention added Gareth Bale.\nThe Welshman was not at his best on this occasion but, starting a Premier League game for the first time since 2013, he formed a potentially lethal attacking trio alongside Kane and Son Heung-min that will not be easily subdued.\nSon could have made life a lot easier for Tottenham if he had taken an early chance that came his way, but the South Korean took far too long to set himself when in space at the far post and Kyle Bartley blocked the shot.\nBale an injury concern for Wales\nAfter that, it was a succession of long-range shots, none of which threatened Johnstone's goal.\nAnd when Doherty had an effort saved near the end, it seemed Spurs would have to settle for a point.\nBut Kane had other ideas to send Tottenham into the international break in a very healthy position, with Manchester City and Chelsea their next two opponents.\nMourinho said his team would have to grind out some wins, like Sunday's, in order to attain a \"good position in the table\".\nHe told BBC's Match of the Day: \"I feel satisfaction because we won and have 17 points and have 12 in 12 possible away from home. That compensates the dropped points at home, and for this reason I am happy.\"\nThe Portuguese boss added: \"The Premier League is the most difficult one to be, because in the Premier League you can do a good season, can have lots of points, but in the end: Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Leicester, Arsenal. So you can have a good season and not be champion.\"\nLife is hard at West Brom\nIt has not been an easy few days for West Brom. Defeat at Fulham on Monday brought criticism from Bilic and the absence of veteran defender Branislav Ivanovic was not helpful.\nIvanovic and Matheus Pereira both tested positive for coronavirus in the week, meaning more shuffling of a West Brom squad that has looked short of the class required to drag themselves out of trouble near the foot of the table.\nBilic could not be accused of lacking desire. Quite vocal to start with, by the time the first half was over he had edged on to the pitch as he tried to give instructions, sometimes barely feet from the players.\nWest Brom do have some decent players - including 20-year-old midfielder Conor Gallagher, who is on loan from Chelsea - but they rarely look as though they can score.\nKarlan Grant flicked a Furlong cross out for a throw-in at one point, despite being offered a free header six yards out, while the former Huddersfield forward might also have converted had Eric Dier not got his head to a Callum Robinson cross as it was dropping almost on the goalline.\nAs the Baggies know only too well, the Premier League is a harsh environment - and unless they start scoring, they face a hard task avoiding an immediate return to the Championship.\n'I don't feel under pressure' - reaction\nWest Brom manager Slaven Bilic speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"I am very pleased with the way we played against a top side. Every game is an opportunity, and we showed if we play like this, play committed like this and show awareness in every second of the game then, of course, we will have chances to win the game. Extremely positive, but at the same time gutted about the result.\n\"This is a kind of bonus game when you play against Spurs. It shows if you have chances in this kind of game and we continue like this then we will have a genuine chance to stay in the league.\n\"I don't feel under pressure. I told the guys don't think in a negative way that we did not win the game. The wins will come with performances like this.\"\nAre West Brom set for the drop? - stats\nTottenham have won each of their opening four away games of a league season for just the fourth time in their history (also 1949-50, 1960-61 and 2017-18).\nWest Brom have failed to win any of their first eight games of a league season for only the second time, having last done so in 1985-86, when they would go on to be relegated from the top flight.\nTottenham have kept a clean sheet in back-to-back away league games for the first time since October 2018.\nWest Brom have failed to score in back-to-back home Premier League matches for the first time since doing so in four in a row from April to May 2017.\nKane has been directly involved in 27 goals in his last 14 starts for Tottenham in all competitions, scoring 17 and assisting 10.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom's next game is a trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Saturday, 21 November (15:00 GMT). On the same day, Tottenham entertain Manchester City (17:30).\nWatch 13 first-round ties on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app this weekend. Find out more here."

With the injuries we've got, my admiration for the players grows by the day.\"\nVardy took his tally for the season to nine goals after sending Rui Patricio the wrong way from the penalty spot, with Wolves' players incensed it was given.\nWolves claimed Kilman had no time to move his hand out of the way of Praet's cross but referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot after consulting the pitchside monitor.\nPortugal keeper Patricio saved a second Vardy penalty with his leg before half-time - Leicester's eighth Premier League spot-kick of the season - after Rayan Ait-Nouri brought down James Justin.\nWolves threatened an equaliser after half-time, 19-year-old Wesley Fofana producing an excellent challenge to deny Pedro Neto a certain goal, Kilman fired over from close range, while Kasper Schmeichel made an outstanding flying save to keep out Ruben Neves.\nLeicester are one point clear of Tottenham, who beat West Brom earlier in the day to temporarily go top, and Liverpool, who they face at Anfield in their first game back after the international break on 21 November.\nReaction from the King Power Stadium\nCan Vardy inspire Leicester to another title?\nPerfect week for Foxes\nLeicester had to dig deep in the second half as Wolves came back strongly but they head into the international break top of the Premier League - as well as Group G in the Europa League.\nThree wins have come in the past week, the Foxes hammering Leeds last Monday and, in Europe, Sporting Braga on Thursday before Vardy scored for the fourth successive game to defeat Wolves.\nHaving qualified for the Europa League group stages by finishing fifth last season, Rodgers' side are handling the busy workload of Thursday-Sunday football with aplomb.\nThey were hungry chasing the ball and intelligent when they had possession.\nChristian Fuchs went close with a low drilled attempt, Vardy forced Patricio to tip his ferocious attempt over and substitute Harvey Barnes was denied a late goal by a deflection.\nSchmeichel's save to deny Neves was breathtaking.\nHaving turned 34 on Thursday, the Denmark keeper remains a key ingredient of this hard-working side and showed great agility to deny Wolves an equaliser.\nStrong finish but no reward for Wolves\nBut for Schmeichel's wonderful save, Wolves would have headed back to the Black Country with a point.\nNeves' shot from the edge of the penalty area was heading for the net before the Dane stuck out a strong hand to divert it away.\nWolves will be upset by the circumstances that led to Vardy scoring his ninth goal in eight games.\nTheir players surrounded Taylor after he awarded the penalty for Kilman's handball after watching the incident on a screen.\n\"It's very hard to judge the work of the referee, he saw it on the screen, but it's difficult for us to coach a player and tell him he must put his arms away,\" said Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\"What we expect from VAR is fair and simple decisions and this is not happening. Until they get it right we will talk about it over and over again.\"\nWolves started sluggishly but sprung into life after Patricio kept out Vardy's second penalty.\nThey have made a solid start to the season but the Wolves boss has much to ponder during the international break - not least his side's lack of goals.\nThey have managed just eight in the top flight - only the bottom four have scored fewer.\n'We showed real resilience' - what they said\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers: \"The first half we were very good without the football and in the second half we had to show real resilience.\n\"We have seen that this season, the players are developing and to show that mentality and desire is so pleasing.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"We will keep on improving. All the squad will now basically go for international duty and we hope they return healthy.\n\"We are always looking for improvements, the players are working very hard and it's up to us to improve them and get them to fine levels of performance.\"\nBest Premier League start - the stats\nLeicester have won 18 points in their opening eight Premier League games, their best start to a top-flight season and best start to a season since winning 19 points in their first eight games in 2008-09 in League One.\nWolves have won none of their four away Premier League matches against Leicester (D2 L2), failing to score in every match.\nLeicester have won their past six matches in all competitions, scoring 15 goals and conceding just twice.\nThe Foxes have scored seven penalties in the Premier League this season, four more than any other side. They have been awarded eight so far in 2020-21, the earliest in a campaign a team has been awarded that many.

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-1 Liverpool: Kevin de Bruyne misses penalty for hosts in draw\nLiverpool's hopes of returning to the Premier League summit were frustrated as they fought out a high-quality draw at Manchester City, who paid a heavy price for Kevin de Bruyne's missed penalty.\nReds manager Jurgen Klopp opted for an all-out attacking line-up at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, with in-form Diogo Jota included alongside the established front three of Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah.\nLiverpool, who knew victory would see them leapfrog Leicester City and Tottenham, reaped an early reward when Salah put them ahead from the spot in the 13th minute after Kyle Walker brought down Mane - but City levelled just after the half-hour when Gabriel Jesus turned superbly before slotting past Alisson.\nPep Guardiola's side wasted a golden chance to go ahead before half-time when De Bruyne rolled his penalty wide after handball had been awarded against Joe Gomez following a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) deliberation.\nBoth sides pushed for the winner but it was City who grew stronger as the game went on, Jesus sending a glorious headed chance wide to leave both sides having to settle for a point.\n'The boys are on the edge' - Klopp & Guardiola call for fixture changes\n'There are days when a point will do' - why Liverpool will be happier than City\nReaction from Man City v Liverpool and all Sunday's Premier League action\nLiverpool will be happier with a point\nKlopp did not come to the Etihad to hide behind the door - Liverpool's attacking formation that had City on the ropes for the first 20 minutes was proof of that.\nIn the end, however, you suspect he will be happier with a point than Guardiola as the Reds clearly ran out of steam in a second half when the home side looked far more likely to snatch the winner.\nThis is a Liverpool team already missing Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara - and they also lost Trent Alexander-Arnold in the second half - but they still came to a formidable opponent and refused to be beaten.\nEven on the back foot, the reigning champions carry an unmistakeable air of menace in the shape of those attackers - particularly Salah and Mane, who were always on the prowl.\nLiverpool, uncharacteristically, grew sloppier in possession as the game went on, but they still managed to limit City's opportunities.\nKlopp will never be fully content with a point but he will surely still be satisfied because his team showed real defensive resilience, apart from that moment in the second period when Jesus slipped the shackled and headed Ferran Torres' cross wide.\nLiverpool are in third place in the Premier League, a point behind Leicester - and meet the Foxes at Anfield after the international break.\nMan City will still be eyeing title\nAt first glance, the sight of Manchester City in 10th place in the Premier League with 12 points from seven games might represent a disappointing return for a team that has set such high standards in recent years.\nYes, it could have been much better and Guardiola is likely to have been disappointed not to fashion victory against a Liverpool side most will regard as their closest challengers.\nIn reality, though, City and Guardiola can look at the bigger picture and believe they are right in what is shaping up as the most open title race for years.\nA clutch of clubs will fancy this could be their year and City are only five points behind Liverpool, and six behind leaders Leicester, with a game in hand.\nGuardiola's new central defensive partnership of Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias is settling, and he will no doubt hope forward Sergio Aguero can finally shake off the injury problems that have dogged him in recent months.\nThis is shaping up as a topsy-turvy title race - and Manchester City have every right to feel they will be right in it.\n'Five subs are key' - what they said\nManchester City boss Guardiola speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was a tight game. We struggled in the first minutes because they had four players up front. Mane and Salah were playing between the lines, then we adjusted after and had more control.\n\"The way they played and the way we behaved in response was incredible. I'm so proud of my players. The difference today was they got a penalty and we missed a penalty.\"\nWhat he said to Liverpool counterpart Klopp after the final whistle: \"We talked about five substitutions. If people want to give microphones so we can give our opinions...\n\"English player, right-back is injured. There are many guys with many, many cases. Around the world, five subs are key, but here it's totally the opposite. We've talked about this many times.\"\nKlopp, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was an interesting game - a lot of tactical stuff on the pitch. Both teams played with an incredible energy level to close the other team down and use the few opportunities. I thought it was a top, top, top game.\n\"The plan is always to start fast, stay fast and finish fast - but that is not always possible. City are a top team.\n\"I think it is the game with the lowest number of chances for City so far when we have played them - clear-cut chances. They didn't have many and that is a proper compliment for the boys.\"\nWalker paying the penalty - the best stats\nManchester City have drawn three of their past five games in the Premier League, as many as their previous 70 matches in the competition.\nLiverpool have only won three of their past 10 away games in the league, after winning 16 of their previous 17.\nAfter a run of 35 consecutive Premier League wins when scoring first between February 2019 and July 2020, the Reds have now failed to win four of their past seven such games.\nSalah has scored eight league goals for Liverpool this season. No Reds player has ever scored more in the first eight matches of a campaign in the competition (level with Fernando Torres in 2009-10 and Robbie Fowler in 1995-96).\nCity defender Walker has conceded two penalties in the league this season, as many as he had in the previous 11 campaigns combined.\nJesus' equaliser featured the most passes (19) in the build-up to a Premier League goal against Liverpool since September 2017 - also a goal by since at the Etihad.\nDe Bruyne has been directly involved in six goals in eight Premier League games against Klopp's Liverpool (one goal and five assists). Only Leicester's Jamie Vardy (seven) has had a hand in more against Liverpool in the competition since the German took charge.\nDe Bruyne's penalty was the first to miss the target in a Premier League game since October 2018 - when Riyad Mahrez smashed the ball over the bar in the reverse fixture at Anfield.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Manchester City travel to north London to face Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday, 21 November (17:30 GMT).\nLiverpool host Leicester on the same day at 15:00.\nVideo games: How are they helping overcome grief?\nUltra-processed foods: Find out which ones are actually good for you"

        "article_text": "Arsenal 0-3 Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins hails 'unbelievable' win against boyhood team\nOllie Watkins said it was \"unbelievable\" to score against the team he supports as his double helped Aston Villa claim an impressive victory at Arsenal to move up to sixth in the Premier League.\nThe visitors took the lead midway through the first half when Bukayo Saka turned Matt Targett's cross into his own net.\nWatkins, who scored a hat-trick in a 7-2 win against champions Liverpool earlier this season, made it 2-0 with a header towards the end of the second half and scored his second soon after, slotting the ball under Bernd Leno after a quick break.\n\"As an Arsenal fan to score here at the Emirates is unbelievable,\" Watkins told BBC Radio 5 live.\nThe 24-year-old, who has now scored six goals this season, added: \"I think I have another level.\n\"In the second half you saw what I'm about, getting the ball, setting and spinning and making defenders run towards their own goal - hopefully the more I can do that the more goals I can score.\"\nThe Gunners had gone into this game looking to build on their impressive 1-0 win against Manchester United last time out, but despite dominating possession they created very little, with Alexandre Lacazette going closest when he headed over Kieran Tierney's cross.\nInstead, it was Villa who always looked the most likely to score and they could have won by an even bigger margin.\nThe visitors had a goal ruled out inside the first minute when John McGinn thumped home Jack Grealish's cross.\nHowever, after a lengthy check by the video assistant referee, it was ruled out as Ross Barkley, who was in an offside position, was adjudged to have been in goalkeeper Leno's way.\nEgypt midfielder Trezeguet forced a good save from Leno early in the second half before the Arsenal keeper denied Grealish at the near post with a strong hand, while the Aston Villa captain also had an effort cleared off the line.\nDefeat leaves an inconsistent Arsenal 11th in the table while the win maintained Villa's 100% away record so far this season.\nRe-live Sunday's Premier League action\nVilla back to their best after mini-slump\nVilla made a superb start to this season with a run of four successive wins that included eye-catching victories against Liverpool and Leicester.\nBack-to-back defeats against Leeds and Southampton - games in which they conceded a total of seven goals - raised concerns that their excellent start may have been a false dawn, but this performance will have significantly eased some of those fears.\nBoss Dean Smith said before kick-off that he believed the team he had put out possessed the attacking quality to hurt Arsenal and so it proved, particularly in the second half when they looked capable of scoring with every break.\nVilla have now won five of their seven games so far this season and having taken some significant scalps already, there is every reason for their fans to be optimistic.\n\"Coming here is tough, we knew we had to be at our best without the ball,\" said Smith.\n\"What pleased me the most was we could've scored more. We created some great chances from our ball carrying skills with Jack Grealish and Ross Barkley and Trezequet and Ollie Watkins' non-stop running.\"\nMisfiring Arsenal pay the price\nThis defeat will prove particularly concerning for Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, who appeared to have rectified issues with a defence that conceded goals far too easily last season.\nGoing into the match they boasted the Premier League's best defence, having conceded just seven goals in seven games, and it was the Gunners' struggles at the other end of the pitch that Arteta would have been hoping to see an improvement in.\nBut once again the hosts lacked creativity and managed just two shots on target all game, neither of which posed any real danger to their former goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.\nAs pleasing as the performance in the 1-0 win against Manchester United was, this result underlined Arsenal's attacking problems when the defence has an off day.\nVilla part of an elite club - the stats\nAston Villa have won each of their first three away league games in a season for the first time in their history.\nThis was Arsenal's worst home league defeat since December 2019 versus Manchester City (also 3-0).\nOnly Chelsea (five) have won more away league games than Aston Villa (four) at the Emirates Stadium.\nAston Villa are the third side in Premier League history to win each of their first three away games in a season without conceding a goal, after Chelsea in 2005-06 and Manchester City in 2015-16.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang failed to take a single shot today - it is the first time he's played the full 90 minutes in a home Premier League match for Arsenal without attempting a shot.\nOllie Watkins has scored six goals in seven games for Aston Villa in the Premier League this season - only Dean Saunders (seven) and Dion Dublin (nine) have ever netted more in their first seven appearances for Villa in the competition.\nAged 19 years and 64 days, Arsenal's Bukayo Saka became the fourth-youngest player to score an own goal in the Premier League, and youngest since Southampton's Martin Cranie in May 2004 (17 years, 218 days versus Chelsea).\nAston Villa's Jack Grealish has been directly involved in nine league goals this season (four goals and five assists) - only Spurs pair Harry Kane (15) and Son Heung-min (10) have been involved in more Premier League goals.\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break Arsenal travel to Leeds on Sunday, 22 November (16:30 GMT) while Aston Villa host Brighton on Saturday, 21 November (15:00 GMT).\nVideo games: How are they helping overcome grief?\nUltra-processed foods: Find out which ones are actually good for you"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 0-2 Chelsea: Frank Lampard's Blues make it five wins out of five\nManager Frank Lampard says Chelsea need to \"remain humble\" after moving second in the Premier League table following a solid win over Newcastle.\nAn own goal by Federico Fernandez and a Tammy Abraham strike secured a fifth successive victory in all competitions.\nChelsea's fifth league win of the season had left them briefly on top of the table, ahead of overnight leaders Leicester on goal difference, before Tottenham moved two points clear at the summit after beating Manchester City later on Saturday.\n\"I know we are top of the league for five minutes but we have to think about the big picture,\" Lampard said, speaking before the Tottenham game.\n\"We know that there is improvement and work to be done. We have to remain humble.\"\nFernandez's own goal set the Blues on their way, the Argentine defender poking the ball over his own line while under pressure from Ben Chilwell.\nChelsea oozed quality, Newcastle keeper Karl Darlow producing excellent saves to deny the excellent Timo Werner as well as a close-range Abraham header.\nBut Abraham made sure of the points with a smart finish following Werner's pass after Newcastle had threatened through Isaac Hayden and Joelinton, while Sean Longstaff hit the bar for the hosts towards the end.\nReaction from St James' Park plus Premier League updates\nWill there be a shock Premier League winner?\nSix clean sheets in seven for Blues\nThis was the first of nine games in the next four weeks for Lampard's side, and the Chelsea boss had to plan for it without several key players who were still away on international duty 48 hours before this match.\nIt had prompted Lampard to call for Saturday early kick-offs to be scrapped immediately after an international break, but the Blues made a ferocious start that caught Newcastle cold.\nWerner and Abraham had already been thwarted by Darlow when Chelsea swept into an early lead, Fernandez inadvertently turning Mason Mount's cross past his own keeper after a short corner.\nThat was Chelsea's 35th goal in 14 league and cup games but it should have been more before half-time.\nWerner, who had an effort disallowed for offside late on, was a creative force throughout but the Germany forward was also wasteful.\nWhen Newcastle did mount a rare attack, Chelsea were solid at the back.\nAntonio Rudiger, starting in place of 36-year-old Thiago Silva who had played for Brazil in midweek, marked his first league start of the season with an important block to deny Allan Saint-Maximin as the Blues chalked up a sixth clean sheet in seven games.\nAbraham's second goal in as many league games made sure of the points before Mount went close to adding a third.\nWilson a big miss for Magpies\nWithout leading scorer Callum Wilson, Newcastle failed to score for the second successive game.\nWilson, missing with a hamstring injury, has netted six of his side's 10 top-flight goals this season but Newcastle never recovered after going behind early.\n\"That's the fifth time we've been one down with five or 10 minutes played and we have to address that,\" said Magpies boss Steve Bruce.\nDarlow kept his side in the match with some important saves before Abraham's second-half finish killed the game off.\nNewcastle's cause was not helped by the loss of Jamaal Lascelles to injury, the captain failing to appear at the start of the second half after going down heavily.\nBruce sent on Miguel Almiron, who only arrived back from international duty with Paraguay on Friday, and Andy Carroll to try and rescue a point.\nCarroll looked set to score his first goal since returning to Newcastle for a second spell 15 months ago, but his attempt in stoppage time was deflected wide for a corner.\n\"I'm frustrated because we can't get a result,\" added Bruce, whose side have won once in five games. \"I make no excuses but we've played three of the top six in the last few weeks.\"\n'Hugely important win' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce: \"We were better in the second half and we went higher up the pitch and had some big moments.\n\"There was a lot to like about that second-half performance. Unfortunately we couldn't take our chances and Chelsea punished us with a poor goal that we gave away.\"\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard: \"I'm pleased. It was a dangerous game for us. We lost here last season.\n\"We could have scored more goals - that was a frustration - but generally the lads dealt with it very well. It's a hugely important win.\"\nHome discomforts for Magpies - the stats\nNewcastle have lost five of their last seven home matches in the Premier League.\nSince the start of 2019-20, Tammy Abraham has scored 23 goals in all competitions, 11 more than any other Chelsea player.\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce has won only two of his 24 Premier League games as manager against Chelsea.\nKeeper Edouard Mendy has seven clean sheets in nine appearances for Chelsea in all competitions.\nSince his debut in September 2014, no player has scored more own goals in the Premier League than Federico Fernandez (five - level with Lewis Dunk).\nWhat's next?\nWhile Newcastle visit Crystal Palace in the Premier League next Friday (20:00 GMT), Chelsea are in France on Tuesday to face Rennes in Group E of the Champions League (17:55).

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 1-2 Brighton: Seagulls secure first ever win at Villa Park\nBrighton won at Villa Park for the first time in their history, deservedly edging out Aston Villa in a dramatic and entertaining encounter.\nSolly March's delightful curling finish settled it after Ezri Konsa's sliding equaliser cancelled out Danny Welbeck's solo run and chip.\nAll of that preceded a frantic period of stoppage time that saw Tariq Lamptey sent off for a second yellow card and a decision to award Villa a penalty for a foul by March overturned after referee Michael Oliver consulted the pitchside monitor.\n\"I don't know what a penalty is now. We could all hear the contact inside the ground,\" said Villa boss Dean Smith.\nThe defeat is Villa's third in succession at home in the league and also comes at the cost of a hamstring injury to Ross Barkley, who pulled up inside the first two minutes.\nThey stay sixth, but at risk of slipping down the table with the majority of the weekend's fixtures still to be played.\nBrighton's first victory in two months does not improve their position of 16th, but they at least move six points clear of the relegation zone.\nStyles make matches\nThis was made so enjoyable by a relentless back and forth, a consequence of contrasting styles. Whereas Villa pressed high, Brighton sat back, looking to break with pace and exploit an occasionally shaky home defence.\nBertrand Traore, Barkley's replacement, and Jack Grealish pulled the strings for Villa, the latter routinely surrounded by a swarm of blue shirts.\nWelbeck's pace made Brighton's first goal, yet he was outshone by the electric Lamptey, who was a constant nuisance down the the Seagulls' right.\nIn the end, Brighton were simply more clinical, with Villa's threat diminishing after they went behind for the second time.\nBrighton find cutting edge\nBrighton had managed only three goals in their previous four league matches, but despite often having to gather men behind the ball, they kept their attacking threat through Welbeck and his strike partner Neal Maupay.\nWelbeck's first goal for the club and fifth in as many games against Villa came against the run of play. With the Villa defence caught too high up the field, Welbeck latched on to Adam Lallana's poke and ran unchallenged from inside his own half before cleverly lifting the ball over Emiliano Martinez.\nAlthough Brighton lost the creativity of Lallana to a groin injury at half-time and found themselves pegged back soon after, they did not shrink.\nAnd, nine minutes after the Villa equaliser, Pascal Gross rolled the ball across the face of the 18-yard box for March to add the delicious finish.\n\"Our second was a really good team goal and a great finish by Solly March,\" said Brighton manager Graham Potter. \"I'm pleased for him because he influences games.\n\"We've had a few penalties against us this season so I'm not sure what is and what isn't a penalty these days. I know Solly touched the ball so we're just happy it went our way this time.\"\nVilla rue wasted chances - and VAR\nVilla can point to the misfortune of the Barkley injury and the overturning of the penalty decision, but they also engineered their own downfall through a number of missed chances and defensive errors.\nTrezeguet and Ollie Watkins were the biggest culprits, with both guilty of wastefulness in the first half. The Brighton defence also proved resolute, with Ben White's timely interception denying Watkins inside the six-yard box and Mat Ryan making a number of saves, including an unorthodox volley from a Tyrone Mings header.\nVilla's incision deserted them after Brighton's second goal, yet they still seemed to have won a golden opportunity to snatch a point.\nOliver pointed to the spot when March caught Trezeguet but, despite the contact on the man being clear, March also got some of the ball, and that was enough to convince Oliver to change his mind, leaving Villa bewildered.\n\"If VAR thinks it's not a penalty then just tell the referee it's not a penalty,\" said Smith. \"It wasn't given so we have to take it on the chin.\n\"I don't think we were bad. We missed chances and we've made big mistakes for their goals. We have to defend much better. Brighton were a threat on the counter but I wasn't overly concerned.\n\"I thought we had control of the game and if we had taken our chances we would have won.\"\nWelback's happy hunting ground - stats\nBrighton registered only their fifth Premier League win in their past 27 matches, with four of the five wins in this time coming away from home.\nAston Villa lost just their third game in their past 12 Premier League matches (W7 D2), though those defeats have come in each of their past three at Villa Park.\nNo team has conceded more home Premier League goals than Aston Villa this season (11, level with Newcastle United).\nBrighton's Danny Welbeck has scored five Premier League goals against Aston Villa, more than against any other side.\nOnly Robbie Fowler (5) has scored more away Premier League goals at Villa Park than Danny Welbeck (4).\nBrighton and Hove Albion have conceded nine Premier League goals from set-pieces this season, more than any other side.\nPascal Gross has been directly involved in 29 goals for Brighton in the Premier League (12 goals, 17 assists), more than any other player.\nAston Villa's Jack Grealish won seven fouls in this match and has won more than any other Premier League player this season (36). Grealish has won at least one foul in the last 102 league (and play-off) matches he has started, a run stretching back to April 2017.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton host champions Liverpool next Saturday (12:30 GMT), while Villa must wait until Monday, 30 November before travelling to West Ham (20:00).\nWatch Premier League football live on BBC iPlayer: Fulham v Everton - find out more here"

        "article_text": "Tottenham 2-0 Man City: Son Heung-min and Giovani lo Celso send Spurs top\nTottenham Hotspur went top of the Premier League after producing a display of clinical efficiency and tactical discipline to beat Manchester City.\nIn the usual battle of wits between Jose Mourinho and his old adversary Pep Guardiola, the Spurs manager came out on top as his team's season gathered further momentum.\nSon Heung-min put Spurs in front after five minutes, finishing coolly from Tanguy Ndombele's pass before Manchester City had a first-half goal ruled out by VAR for a handball by Gabriel Jesus after Aymeric Laporte's finish.\nCity continued to enjoy greater possession but Spurs, as you would expect from a Mourinho side, were fiercely drilled and resilient, taking their chance when it came to double their advantage and finish the game.\nIt came in the 65th minute after a dream substitution from Mourinho, Giovani lo Celso beating Ederson with a low finish from another Kane pass 35 seconds after coming on for Tanguy Ndombele - the only cloud for Spurs coming with a late injury to Toby Alderweireld after an outstanding performance.\nHas Mourinho won over the Tottenham fans?\nAlderweireld faces spell on sidelines\nReaction to Tottenham v Man City, plus live coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nMourinho revels in statement win\nMourinho was a bundle of energy in his technical area as Spurs took all Manchester City could throw at them to come out with the win that puts them at the Premier League summit and also made a powerful statement about their ambitions and aspirations.\nMourinho's voice echoed around this vast, empty arena as he urged on his players, shouting instructions with regular demands of \"press the ball\". Guardiola, in contrast, was understandably subdued and downcast.\nIt is still early days for a club that has struggled to win silverware over so many recent years, but there is a growing sense of strength and optimism around Spurs, fuelled by a serial winner as a manager who looks revitalised after the acrimonious end to his spell at Manchester United.\nSpurs have the golden threat of the likes of Son - who has now scored 11 goals in all competitions this season - and Kane, with Gareth Bale on the bench here, but they now have some many of the usual Mourinho traits that have always made his teams so difficult to beat.\nIt has been a year since he succeeded the hugely popular Mauricio Pochettino and Spurs are starting to resemble Mourinho's image and likeness, epitomised by the unfussy but highly effective midfield sentry Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, a signing from Southampton that was a managerial priority in the summer.\nSpurs are currently a potent mix of solidity and threat, as proved by the way they dug deep to keep Manchester City out before striking to deadly effect. Spurs had two shots on target and scored twice.\nIn Kane, Spurs also possess the complete forward at the very top of his game, a class act as a provider for the ninth time in as many league games this season - but also the master marksman when his chances come along, as they will with regularity this season.\nSpurs and their fans will not get carried away but there can be no denying Mourinho's tried and trusted methods are having their effect, with the long-time foe Guardiola the victim on this occasion.\nToothless Man City fall short again\nManchester City clearly had a grievance against the decision to rule out Laporte's goal for handball against Jesus that left them nursing a sense of injustice. However, it would still disappoint Guardiola that his team had so much of the ball but actually did so little with it when it came to seriously testing Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris.\nIt has become something of pattern with Manchester City and this was another occasion, although Guardiola did not feel able to risk the likes of Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero other than on the substitutes' bench, reducing their level of threat.\nCity were easily unpicked by Ndombele's pass for Son's early strike and there was almost a sense of inevitability that their toothlessness would end with Spurs sweeping up the other end to add a second through Lo Celso.\nIt is hardly panic stations for City as they stand eight points off the top with a game in hand. This is shaping up as a season with many twists and turns to come - but this was another unsatisfactory result and performance.\nAguero's now regular fitness issues rob Guardiola and City of their most lethal finisher in and around the box, the 32-year-old Argentine still the most reliable goalscorer at the club but now seemingly troubled too much by injury.\nGuardiola will now move into the next phase of his reign at City after signing a two-year contract extension and preparing for the day they have to do without one of their all-time great players will soon be an issue.\nThis is still a Manchester City side packed with world-class players but this was another of those days that have been happening since the start of last season when they simply lack a ruthless edge and end up being punished.\nIt is a problem Guardiola needs to resolve - and quickly.\n'We are not fighting for the title' - what the managers said\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Sport: \"It feels good [to be top], but maybe tomorrow we are second again and honestly that would not be a problem for me, I am just happy with the evolution.\n\"People cannot expect us to come here and after one season we are fighting for the title. We are not fighting for the title, we are just fighting to win every match. But we are going to lose matches, we are going to draw matches.\n\"Dinner tonight will be nice and relaxed and I will watch Atletico Madrid v Barcelona and sleep like an angel. But no problem if Leicester wins [on Sunday] and we are second again.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola said: \"It could be better, we played similar to how we have all season. We did not defend good for the first goal. They then defended so deep, they defended with six and it was not easy. We had our chances, but we couldn't score and they made two or three chances on the counter-attack and we lost the game.\n\"We knew before the game that you cannot give them the first goal. We had more chances than them but we lost. Mourinho's teams are like this, you make a mistake and they punish you on the counter-attack.\"\nSpurs end day top for first time in six years - the stats\nIt is the first time since August 2014 that Tottenham will finish a day top of the Premier League and the first time they have done so after at least nine top-flight games since January 1985.\nMeanwhile, 12 points from eight games is Manchester City's lowest points total at this stage of a Premier League season since 2008-09, while their 10 goals scored is their lowest after eight games since 2006-07.\nTottenham have won back-to-back league games against Manchester City for the first time since October 2016.\nCity have had 41 shots in their past two league games against Spurs but have lost both without scoring.\nTottenham have scored more goals in the first half of Premier League games than any other side this season, with their 11 in the opening 45 minutes more than City have scored in the competition this season (10).\nSon has scored five goals in five games in all competitions against Manchester City and his strike after four minutes 19 seconds was the earliest City have conceded in the league since December 2016, against Arsenal.\nKane has provided nine assists in his nine Premier League games this season, after providing just eight assists in his previous three campaigns, or 94 games, combined.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are in European action in midweek, as Manchester City travel to Olympiakos in the Champions League on Wednesday (17:55 GMT) and Tottenham host Ludogorets in the Europa League on Thursday (20:00).\nCity then host Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00), before Spurs are away to Chelsea on Sunday (16:30).\nWatch Premier League football live on BBC iPlayer: Fulham v Everton - find out more here"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-0 West Bromwich Albion: Bruno Fernandes penalty earns win\nBruno Fernandes' twice-taken second-half penalty was enough to give Manchester United their first Premier League victory of the season at Old Trafford over a battling West Brom outfit.\nFormer United keeper Sam Johnstone made a string of superb stops to deny his old club, included a splendid save from Fernandes' initial kick.\nHowever, VAR intervened as Johnstone was clearly off his line and Fernandes made no mistake with his second attempt. The effort ended a wait of 324 minutes for a United goal in the Premier League on home soil - and that was also a spot-kick from the Portuguese against Tottenham.\nIt was harsh on the visitors, who were awarded a penalty themselves a minute after the restart when Fernandes caught Conor Gallagher. But after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor, referee David Coote decided the United man had just touched the ball, much to Baggies boss Slaven Bilic's frustration.\nThe result leaves West Brom, who were without captain Jake Livermore and defender Kieran Gibbs because of positive coronavirus tests, still waiting for their first win of the season.\nAfter successive victories, United are in the top half of the table for the first time this season. And, given the pressure he was under before the win at Everton on 7 November, there must be some satisfaction for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in going above Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the table.\nIt is only the second time Solskjaer has done that, and the previous occasion - after the first game of last season - only lasted a week.\nJohnstone outstanding on United return\nJohnstone spent nine years at United before leaving them for West Brom in 2018.\nHe still has links to the area, exchanging text messages with David de Gea as the Baggies made their successful bid to seal promotion from the Championship last season. Johnstone also gave \u00a3700 to a Manchester man during lockdown when the van he used to feed homeless people was burned out.\nAt a ground where he had never previously made a first-team appearance, Johnstone was outstanding.\nHe denied Anthony Martial with two excellent saves - the first to his right when the Frenchman flicked a header goalwards, the second to his left when Marcus Rashford and Fernandes combined to set the Frenchman up.\nIt also looked as though the West Brom keeper had the situation covered when Harry Maguire belted a volley straight into the face of Kyle Bartley.\nArguably his point-blank reaction save to turn away Rashford's goal-bound effort after half-time was the best of the lot.\nGiven he had already denied Rashford once in the second period - and saved Fernandes' initial penalty, albeit illegally - no blame for the latest Baggies defeat could be laid at his door and he left the field in deep conversation with De Gea, who must have appreciated his fellow goalkeeper's efforts.\nBattling Baggies have set the standard\nEven though they had collected a single point from their previous four away games, West Brom didn't travel north without hope given they had lost only once in their previous five visits to Old Trafford.\nAnd whilst Johnstone's heroics was the main reason why the final scoreline was close, Bilic's men did have chances.\nDe Gea made a splendid low save to deny Karlan Grant in the first half and substitute Callum Robinson hit the bar after Fernandes broke the deadlock.\nHowever, Bilic, aside from irritation at the penalty decisions, may reflect on the fact his side needed to show such battling qualities on their previous away trip, at Fulham, when they were awful and deservedly well beaten.\n'I'm disappointed with the result and the referee' - what the managers said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's nice after the international break that you get a win. We needed that win at home. We looked unsettled towards the end even though we should score one or two more to have a more relaxed finish.\n\"It's never comfortable against players of this quality. They had a couple of chances and David [de Gea] made two fantastic saves. Tight margins decide games but the mood is decided by the results.\n\"It's up to us to create momentum. We have the chance to continue the good start in the Champions League, and Southampton away is a very difficult game as well. Hopefully we get a few more back and can kick on.\"\nOn the penalty incident: \"It's the same with David [de Gea] early on [in the season] when he made a save but he was an inch off the line. It's probably the beauty of Bruno's [Fernandes] style where the keeper goes a second too early. Sam [Johnstone] has developed into a fine keeper.\n\"The handball rule you can discuss over and over but we get into the box and the ball into feet - so with VAR, a touch can be enough and it's different to when I was playing when you had to be hacked down.\"\nWest Brom manager Slaven Bilic, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We were unlucky. They had a few chances and we expected that. As a promoted team, we need a good goalkeeper and Sam [Johnstone] was really good for us but we had also more than enough chances to go ahead in the second half.\n\"On one hand, I'm really proud of the team. We are playing really good and we have to find the space for us to make confidence and belief. If we continue to play like this - and better - we will have a chance in every game.\"\nOn his side seeing a penalty overturned: \"I saw it a few times and for me it's a penalty. There is no reason for Conor Gallagher to go down without being fouled. He touched his shin. In those few minutes, then it's a penalty for handball [to Manchester United] when before it's a penalty for a foul on Gallagher.\n\"They became nervous because they wanted a goal, but instead of us being one up it is hard to come back. We showed after that we didn't stop believing or playing. I'm very disappointed with the result and the decisions from the referee.\"\nOn Man Utd's penalty: \"If it's for us, I ask for a penalty, but [Darnell Furlong] was unlucky. The new rules - no problem. But I have a problem with the foul before. They checked the foul before so I was quite confident but then it was no foul.\"\nMan Utd end wait for home win - the stats\nManchester United have beaten West Brom in the Premier League at Old Trafford for the first time since November 2015 (2-0), having failed to win their past two such games without scoring a goal (D1 L1).\nUnited have won their first home league game of the season, ending a run of six consecutive games without victory (D3 L3) since July (5-2 against Bournemouth).\nWest Brom have failed to win any of their opening nine games to a league season (D3 L6) for the first time since 1985-86.\nAlbion have lost five of their past six Premier League away games (D1), failing to score in four of those defeats.\nBruno Fernandes' opener was United's first home league goal in 324 minutes of football, since his second-minute penalty in the 6-1 defeat by Spurs in October.\nSince the start of last season, 16% of United's Premier League goals have been penalties (13/79), the highest ratio of any team to have played in both seasons.\nHalf of Bruno Fernandes' Premier League goals for United have been penalties (7/14), the highest ratio of any player to score for the club in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United's next game is against Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir at Old Trafford in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT).

A reaction in the second half should not have to come from a rollicking at half-time.\n\"What I cannot accept from my team is that at times, certainly in the first half, we were second best to the 50-50 challenges.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti: \"Every game will be a test but our target is to fight for the top of the table, not the bottom.\n\"We started the season really well and had a difficult period, now the difficult period is gone and we need to have consistency in our results.\"\nThree points but defensive worries continue - the stats\nEverton have conceded two or more goals in six consecutive Premier League games for the first time since October 2008.\nFulham's Bobby Decordova-Reid scored in back-to-back home league games for the first time since April 2018 for Bristol City.\nOnly Chelsea (12) have scored more goals in the first minute of Premier League games than Everton (10 - level with Tottenham).\nDominic Calvert-Lewin's opener after just 42 seconds was the earliest Premier League goal Everton have scored since April 2017 against Leicester (30 seconds).\nSince making his Premier League debut in August 2018, only Trent Alexander-Arnold (26) and Andrew Robertson (25) have provided more assists in the competition among defenders than Everton's Lucas Digne (15).\nWhat's next?\nFulham have more than a week to prepare for their next Premier League game at Leicester on 30 November (17:30 GMT), while Everton host Leeds at Goodison Park on Saturday (17:30).\nLoyle Carner Residence: Check out his specially selected tracks from influential artists\nThe Players Podcast: A World Cup winner on getting to grips with British slang"

Without being disrespectful to some of the places this football club has had to go, it is no good taking a backwards step and feeling sorry for yourself.\"\nFollow all Sunday's Premier League action\nImproving Blades fall short\nWith a solitary point on the board, Sheffield United began this contest with the joint-lowest points tally at this stage of a Premier League season and without a victory since 11 July.\nHowever, while aspects of this performance will have pleased manager Wilder, they again came down on the wrong side of a tight contest.\nSix of the Blades' eight defeats this season have been by a margin of one goal and on another occasion they might have been a couple of goals ahead before West Ham hit their stride.\nJohn Egan's searching pass provided George Baldock with a third-minute chance to open the scoring but the full-back was unable to beat Hammers keeper Lukasz Fabianski at the near post.\nFabianski then parried McBurnie's rising half volley to safety during a forceful start by the Blades.\nBut after failing to unlock the door their two main failings - a lack of goals and an inability keep a clean sheet - proved the difference again.\nWhile there were signs that they are beginning to cope without the injured and influential Jack O'Connell in their defence - restricting the Hammers to just three shots on target - they were punished for a momentary lapse of concentration that allowed Haller the freedom to get his shot away under little pressure.\nWest Ham building momentum\nAfter coming through a tricky opening spell in the game, Hammers boss David Moyes will have been pleased by the way his improving side grew in stature and confidence.\nWest Ham have now lost just once in their past seven outings and always looked capable of scoring despite the continued absence of Michail Antonio with a hamstring injury.\nGalvanised by England midfielder Rice and his Czech counterpart Soucek, the visitors established control and looked a threat down both flanks.\nBoth were key in snuffing out Sheffield United's early spark and while it is not their forte, both will also think they could have capped fine performances with a goal.\nWhile Rice was unfortunate after expertly meeting Aaron Cresswell's cross from the left, Soucek somehow missed the target from five yards after a lovely cushioned header into his path from Haller.\nWing-back Arthur Masuaku's driving runs were another feature of their play and his charge inside began the move that saw Coufal force a fine save from Blades goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.\n'I am there to lead them' - what they said\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It wasn't the system - it was players' confidence and decision-making at key times that decided the result. It's going to be that way when you have picked up one point from nine games.\n\"We'll go again, we have to. I am there to lead them and I certainly enjoy that challenge.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We were up against a team fighting hard. Clean sheets always give you a chance of winning games.\n\"We are keeping our feet on the ground. We know we are improving and doing a lot of good things. The one thing I will say is you tend to look at the table after 10 games and we have had a good start. I'd like to think we can get better. We are working hard every day.\n\"There might be periods in the season where we have to change system again. I want us to be flexible.\"\nBlades equal unwanted record - the stats\nSheffield United have become the third side in Premier League history to pick up just one point (or fewer) from their opening nine games in a season, after Manchester City in 1995-96 and Sheffield Wednesday in 1999-00 (both sides relegated).\nWest Ham are the first London side to win away at Sheffield United in the Premier League since Chelsea in October 2006 - sides from the capital had been winless in 11 such trips to Bramall Lane (D1 L10).\nSheffield United have gone 13 consecutive matches without a victory across all competitions for the first time since October 2013 (also 13).\nWest Ham are unbeaten in their past 12 Premier League games against sides starting the day bottom, winning their past five in a row by an aggregate score of 14-4.\nSebastien Haller (six) has scored at least twice as many goals as any other West Ham player in all competitions this season.\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United travel to West Bromwich Albion in their next Premier League game on Saturday, 28 November (20:00 GMT).\nWest Ham host Aston Villa in their next Premier League game on Monday, 30 November (20:00)\nLoyle Carner Residence: Check out his specially selected tracks from influential artists\nThe Players Podcast: A World Cup winner on getting to grips with British slang"

        "article_text": "Leeds United 0-0 Arsenal: Nicolas Pepe sent off in goalless draw\nArsenal forward Nicolas Pepe was sent off for a headbutt as Leeds' wasteful finishing cost them a Premier League victory.\nMarcelo Bielsa's Leeds squandered a host of chances, both before and after Pepe was dismissed after video assistant referee consultation for sticking his head into Ezgjan Alioski's face.\nSubstitute Rodrigo, Patrick Bamford and Raphinha - deep into injury time on his first Premier League start - struck the woodwork.\nThe Gunners were poor - yet again - and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 60th-minute effort was their first of two shots on target.\nThey have scored one Premier League goal, an Aubameyang penalty against Manchester United, in five games since 4 October.\nBoth sides came into the game out of form - with three defeats in their previous four league games.\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa will be happy with his side's performance, bar the finishing, with opposite number Mikel Arteta relieved to pick up a point.\nArsenal remain in the bottom half of the table, moving up to 11th, two points above Leeds in 14th.\nPepe let Arsenal down with red card, says Arteta\n'Arsenal have stalled but don't doubt Arteta' - Danny Murphy\nFollow reaction here\nEntertainers Leeds forget their finishing boots\nLeeds were the first promoted Premier League team to score 14 goals in their opening eight matches since Charlton in 2000.\nThey could have used some of those goals at Elland Road, with only four of their 25 shots on target.\nTheir three efforts against the woodwork all came from the 79th minute onwards.\nRodrigo's 18-yard shot hit the angle of bar and post, Bamford headed off the post and Raphinha crashed a shot off the same post late on.\nBamford had scored seven goals this season but did not look on song this time, with two shots straight at Bernd Leno in the first half.\nWinger Raphinha, the first Brazilian to start a Premier League game for Leeds since Roque Junior in 2003, was lively and went close from the edge of the box, with Stuart Dallas forcing a good save from Leno.\nOn another day Leeds could have scored five, but they only have a point to show for their efforts and have only won once in their past six Premier League games.\nConcerning times for Arsenal\nThe good vibes around Arsenal when they won the FA Cup and started this season with three wins in all competitions are starting to feel like a distant memory.\nArteta has helped to solidify their defence, but they have only scored nine goals in nine league games this season. That is their lowest tally at this stage since 1986-87.\nAubameyang got a rare chance to play as their main striker, with Alexandre Lacazette left on the bench - but Arsenal struggled to create many clear-cut chances.\nHe took an hour to test Illan Meslier, whose only other save was to deny substitute Bukayo Saka late on.\nThe Gunners did have a penalty appeal when Liam Cooper blocked an Aubameyang shot with his elbow but the VAR team ruled it was not handball.\nArsenal - who only had 33.7% of the ball - were hanging on, especially after Pepe's red card.\nThe Ivorian, who has rarely justified his \u00a375m fee, had a running battle with Alioski and eventually lost his patience with a 'football headbutt'.\nAlioski threw himself to the ground and Pepe was sent off for the first time in his career.\nArsenal are red card kings under Arteta - match stats\nThis was only Leeds' third goalless draw in 101 league matches under Bielsa.\nSince Bielsa took charge of Leeds in 2018, they have kept 41 clean sheets in 101 league games (excluding play-offs), more than any other side in the top four tiers of English league football in this time.\nArsenal have failed to score in four of their last five league games, this after having only done so in three of Arteta's first 24 Premier League matches in charge.\nLeeds' 25 shots is the most by any side without scoring in the Premier League since Manchester City's 26 against Southampton in July. They are only the third side to have so many shots in the league this season.\nSince Arteta joined Arsenal in December 2019, the Gunners have received five Premier League red cards, at least two more than any other club in this time.\nWhat's next?\nLeeds visit Everton next Saturday (17:30 GMT). Arsenal visit Molde in the Europa League on Thursday (17:55) and host Wolves on Sunday (19:55 GMT).\nLoyle Carner Residence: Check out his specially selected tracks from influential artists\nThe Players Podcast: A World Cup winner on getting to grips with British slang"

I can't pick one that pleased me most - maybe the performance of James Milner at right-back,\" Klopp said.\n\"He played an exceptional game, first there and then in midfield. That is what we expect from ourselves.\n\"The injuries were a massive shock in that moment but the boys have to offer solutions. We have centre-halves, they are really young. They are not experienced, you saw the bench tonight.\"\nKlopp's side took the lead midway through the first half when Jonny Evans nodded a corner into his own net and the advantage was doubled four minutes before half-time when a move of 30 passes ended with Diogo Jota heading in Andrew Robertson's superb cross.\nLiverpool added Salah to their long list of absentees after he tested positive for Covid-19 in Egypt but the prolific Jota, signed from Wolves for \u00a345m in September, once again stepped in - becoming the first player in the club's history to score in his first four competitive home appearances.\nLeicester improved marginally in the second half but it was still Liverpool who dominated, Evans heading against his own post and both Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane being denied by the woodwork and keeper Kasper Schmeichel.\nFirmino was finally on target as he rose to send a fine header out of Schmeichel's reach four minutes from time to give Liverpool the victory margin their superiority deserved.\nLive reaction from Liverpool v Leicester\nLiverpool make light of absentees\nThere was a sense before kick-off that a depleted Liverpool, and their unbeaten Premier League home record stretching back to 2017, might be vulnerable to the in-form Foxes. Not a bit of it.\nLiverpool were rampant from the first whistle and barely gave Leicester City a chance to hit the form that has made them so impressive this season.\nAnd in Jota, Klopp has added another potent threat to go with his long-established world-class attack of Firmino, Mane and Salah.\nThe Portuguese forward has settled in seamlessly at Anfield, making that piece of history with his goal, but Liverpool were impressive in all areas and the final scoreline could and should have been more emphatic.\nLiverpool pinned Leicester in their own half virtually from the kick-off and rivals looking for any signs of potential weakness in the absence of so many key players would have been disappointed.\nKlopp's side were right at the top of their game, taking a stranglehold Leicester never threatened to loosen apart from the moment when Harvey Barnes steered a great first-half chance wide with the score at 1-0.\nJose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Frank Lampard, among others, will harbour ambitions of taking Liverpool's crown. On this evidence, it will take some doing.\nFoxes fail to fire\nThis was a big chance for Leicester City to make another powerful statement about their quality after impressive away victories this season at Manchester City, where they won 5-2, Arsenal and Leeds United.\nSadly, for manager Brendan Rodgers and his talented squad, they came up short here and ended up well beaten.\nLeicester did not move the ball with their trademark speed and were unable to get Jamie Vardy, their most potent threat, into any dangerous areas. They looked shaky under a constant wave of Liverpool attacks.\nThe Foxes felt they were denied an early penalty when the ball struck Joel Matip's hand and Barnes wasted that glorious opportunity but in reality they never deserved anything and this was a chastening experience.\nLeicester are a fine side who will have better days and nights in the season ahead but they were never in serious contention at any point.\n'The problems will not get smaller'\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We scored three goals and didn't concede one; we defended exceptionally well, controlled the game.\n\"It's a tricky situation and when Naby [Keita] goes off with a muscle injury, you know the problems will not get smaller. The boys know when they are allowed to train with us they have the quality to do so. We don't give tickets for training - you have to qualify with talent and aptitude. It is a tough school, there a lot of steps to go.\n\"We have to make sure we recover but the Naby injury didn't help at all.\"\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers speaking to Match of the Day: \"In the first half in particular, we were too passive and defending the space, but didn't have enough contact and gave away poor goals.\n\"We had a good opportunity on the counter with Harvey Barnes, but overall when you are passive like that, your football is not quite the same. We weren't aggressive enough.\n\"Second half was a little bit better; we were more aggressive in our press, and that allows us to play better football. Liverpool deserved to win. The guys coming back from the international break were not as cohesive as what we have been.\n\"It's mentality - you have to get up to the ball. We were happy for them to have it in their own half, but as soon as it came into our territory, we were not as aggressive as I would like.\n\"Unlike the game last year, when we lost at home, this is a game we can reflect on easily and analyse and move on.\"\nFoxes take Jota's fancy\nLiverpool's record-breaking 64-match unbeaten home league run includes 53 wins.\nSince Brendan Rodgers took charge of Leicester, they have lost all three of their Premier League meetings with Liverpool; conceding nine goals in the process - their most against any opponent in the competition under him.\nLiverpool have only conceded three goals in their past seven games across all competitions (W6 D1), with this their fourth clean sheet within this run.\nLiverpool forward Diogo Jota has netted four goals in five Premier League appearances against Leicester; his most against any opponent in the competition.\nRoberto Firmino has scored two goals in Liverpool's five league games at Anfield this season; he only scored once in 19 Premier League home games in the whole of 2019-20.\nJota's goal came after a sequence of 30 passes; since Opta started keeping records of this data in 2006-07, this is the most in the build-up to any Liverpool goal in the Premier League.\nSince the start of the 2018-19 season, only Liverpool team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold has made as many assists as Andy Robertson (26) in the Premier League.\nJonny Evans' own goal for Leicester was his sixth in the Premier League; in the competition's history, only Richard Dunne (10), Jamie Carragher (7) and Martin Skrtel (7) have scored more.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool host Atalanta in the Champions League on Wednesday, 25 November (20:00 GMT) before returning to Premier League action at Brighton on Saturday, 28 November (12:30 GMT).\nLeicester travel to Portugal to face Braga in the Europa League on Thursday, 26 November (17:55 GMT) and then host Fulham in their next Premier League game on Monday, 30 November (17:30 GMT).\nLoyle Carner Residence: Check out his specially selected tracks from influential artists\nThe Players Podcast: A World Cup winner on getting to grips with British slang"

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-0 Crystal Palace: Chris Wood goal gives Burnley first league win of season\nBurnley secured their first win in the Premier League this season as victory over Crystal Palace at Turf Moor moved them out of the relegation zone.\nThe Clarets had lost five and drawn two of their first seven games to leave them second from bottom in the table.\nHowever, Chris Wood's early strike - Burnley's first goal at home this season - proved the difference, the forward driving home from Jay Rodriguez's pass after a mistake in the Palace defence.\nPalace were without influential forward Wilfried Zaha after he tested positive for coronavirus, and they missed his contribution in attack.\nHowever, they did have the chance to equalise in the first half with on-loan Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi just failing to reach an excellent ball by James McArthur before Nick Pope tipped over Andros Townsend's powerful effort.\nBurnley should have put the game out of Crystal Palace's reach soon after the restart but Johann Gudmundsson crashed his shot against the crossbar, a miss that almost proved costly soon after when a Dwight McNeil mistake put Batshuayi in on goal but he could not beat Pope.\nThere was one final chance for Palace to snatch an equaliser but Pope produced a superb save from close range to deny substitute Christian Benteke.\nThe win moves Burnley up to 17th on five points, one point clear of the relegation zone, while Crystal Palace remain on 13 points in 10th place.\nReaction to Burnley versus Crystal Palace\nLawro's Premier League predictions v Idles bassist Adam Devonshire\nA much-needed win to give Clarets hope\nAfter losing five of their six opening games in the league this season it had looked increasingly likely that Burnley's five-year stay in the top flight was going to come to an end.\nClarets boss Sean Dyche has steadfastly maintained that his side have looked more like their old selves in recent games even if results suggested otherwise, but this was a performance reminiscent of those seasons when they have surpassed expectations.\nThey took the very first chance that presented itself to them with Rodriguez pouncing after Cheikhou Kouyate fluffed a clearing header and the forward, restored to the side in place of Ashley Barnes, set up Wood to score his second goal of the season.\nBurnley showed good resilience to hold on to their slender lead and secure three important points, particularly before a tough-looking run of fixtures with games against Manchester City, Everton and Arsenal up next.\nDyche said: \"It's a starting point, it's nice to get that story to calm down a bit when you get that win, it takes your points tally up and you get out of the bottom three for this period but we know there's lots of work to be done.\n\"We are getting players fit again, we do look a more rounded squad at the moment, provided everyone stays fit, so that gives you a better platform to build from.\"\nPalace feel Zaha's absence\nZaha is undoubtedly a pivotal figure for Palace and the forward has made a particularly good start to this season with five goals and two assists in the eight games he has played.\nIt is no surprise that prior to Monday's game the Eagles had lost 13 of their past 15 games without Zaha as in his absence they lack a real cutting edge in attack.\nAgainst Burnley their approach play was good but moves often fell away once they got close to the box, with players either making the wrong pass or not getting into the best positions.\nPalace have failed to keep a clean sheet in the Premier League since the opening game of the season, underlining the importance of scoring goals. This result highlighted their need to find a way to do that without putting the weight of expectation on Zaha.\nHodgson, however, disagreed that Palace are too reliant on Zaha, saying: \"We've scored 12 which is more than we've had in previous years after nine games.\n\"I've had two years of listening to people tell us we don't score enough goals and we don't have enough goalscorers. There are goals in the team, we do have players who can score and who will score.\n\"There are 29 games to go and the goals will come and will come from lots of different sources, I'm convinced of that.\"\nClarets the last to finally score at home - the stats\nBurnley have won back-to-back Premier League games against Palace having lost four consecutive.\nBurnley have picked up their first Premier League victory of 2020-21, with this their first win in the competition since beating Norwich 2-0 in July (winless in eight prior to today).\nPalace have kept just one clean sheet in their past 17 Premier League games, conceding in eight consecutive matches since a 1-0 victory against Southampton in September.\nWood's opener for Burnley was their first Premier League goal at Turf Moor this season (278th minute of action and 30th attempt at goal), meaning all sides across the top four tiers of English football have now scored a home goal in 2020-21.\nSince making his Premier League debut for Burnley (27-08-2017), Wood has scored 36 goals in the competition, at least nine more than any other player for the Clarets.\nSince the start of 2014-15 (when Zaha rejoined Palace), the Eagles have lost 20 of their 28 Premier League games without the Ivorian, including each of the past seven away from home.\nJohann Gudmundsson made his 100th Premier League appearance for Burnley this evening becoming the 10th player to reach this milestone for the Clarets in the competition.\nWhat next?\nBurnley travel to Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday, 28 November (15:00 GMT) while Crystal Palace are at home to Newcastle on Friday, 27 November (20:00 GMT)\nArsene Wenger soundtracks his life: Former Arsenal manager joins Desert Island Discs\nThe Players Podcast: A World Cup winner on getting to grips with British slang"

I just love playing football.\"\nWalcott and Southampton, who are now unbeaten in their past seven matches, may have enjoyed an even more memorable evening had the forward converted a glorious opportunity to make it 2-0.\nBut a draw was no more than Wolves - who move up three places to ninth - deserved for a much-improved attacking display in the closing stages.\nRelive Monday's Premier League action\nName the Premier League players who played every minute for 71 games or more?\nLawro's Premier League predictions v Idles bassist Adam Devonshire\nWalcott takes centre stage\nWith top scorer Danny Ings out with a knee injury, the burden of replacing his goals at Southampton has fallen upon Adams and Walcott.\nThere are signs that Walcott, whose first taste of senior football came as a 16-year-old against Wolves, is starting to relish being back on familiar ground.\nExcellent in Southampton's last outing - a 2-0 win over Newcastle - he took centre stage at Molineux. He had already threatened to score from Stuart Armstrong's clever pass, before he reacted quickly to turn in Adams' driven cross and put his side in front.\nIt was his first goal for the club since scoring in the FA Cup on 7 January 2006 - before he left for Arsenal - and his celebration appeared to be a mixture of elation and relief.\nHowever, his emotions were also on display when he appeared angry with himself for failing to make the score 2-0 from Adams' fine pass.\nWith only goalkeeper Rui Patricio to beat he seemed to be put off by a chasing defender and screwed his shot wide.\nWolves frustrate despite comeback\nWith captain Conor Coady's ever-present run of 84 Premier League games coming to an end - the defender is in isolation after coming into contact with someone with Covid-19 - Wolves deployed an unfamiliar flat back four.\nThe centre-back partnership of Max Kilman and Willy Boly provided Nuno Espirito Santo's side with a relatively solid base as the visitors initially controlled proceedings.\nThey were also well shielded by Ruben Neves and Leander Dendoncker, the former making the most clearances (four) and the latter covering the most ground of any home player (11.12km).\nBut for all those admirable qualities, there was a distinct lack of incisiveness to their attacking play until they fell behind.\nWhile Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy did well to save parry Nelson Semedo's long-range effort and Dendoncker's follow-up attempt early on, he was largely untroubled until the hosts had to respond to falling behind.\nJimenez, who had been isolated and had the lowest number of touches of any outfield home player to start the game, slowly became more involved.\nAnd it was his stinging drive that led to the equaliser, while goalscorer Neto and Daniel Podence all carved out good openings in the second period.\nThe biggest frustration for Nuno and Wolves fans is likely to be that their charge came too late.\n'The way he works for the team is amazing' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl to BBC Sport: \"We had chances, they had chances. We had a chance for 2-0. When you score it's tough for them to come back.\n\"They are a really good side with quality. It's tough to defend for 90 minutes - you cannot play without giving them chances. I'm proud of the team. That was one of our most intense performances of the season.\"\nOn Theo Walcott: \"It was a good first goal for him. He's a little unhappy he didn't make the second one and that he couldn't be the match-winner. The way he works for the team is amazing. As a number 10 or a striker you can trust him.\n\"He's an experienced guy who comes back to the club where he grew up. It means something for him. Maybe that's why he invests so much. You know you have to do that in our team.\"\nWolves boss Nuno to BBC Sport: \"It was a good game. Both teams played with high tempo.\n\"They have very good players and a very good manager. We matched them. We finished the game on the front foot. I'm very proud of the reaction to the goal.\"\nOn whether there was a foul in the build-up to Southampton's goal: \"I think so. After that it was about reacting to that incident, trying to get our mind off the referee's decision and focus on the game. The boys did that. It was a strong reaction. We finished the game well, creating chances. Let's go again.\"\nOn fans coming back: \"We all wish it was tomorrow. We have enormous desire to have the fans back. It's all about them. Let's try our best to bring them back.\"\nSaints extend unbeaten run - the stats\nWolves have lost just one of their past seven home Premier League games.\nSouthampton are unbeaten in seven league games, last going longer without defeat in the competition in November 2013.\nSince the start of last season, Wolves have failed to score in the first half of 34 Premier League games, more than any other side.\nWolves striker Jimenez made his 85th consecutive appearance in the Premier League, the joint-longest current run in the competition (level with Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel).\nAdams has been directly involved in six goals in his past seven league games for Southampton (three goals, three assists), as many goal involvements as he managed in his 32 appearances before that for Saints.\nTwo of Neto's five Premier League goals for Wolves have come against Southampton, while only Sylvan Ebanks-Blake and Steven Fletcher (five each) have netted more goals as a substitute for the club in the competition than the Portuguese (two).\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to Arsenal for their next Premier League game on Sunday, 29 November (19:15 GMT), while Southampton host Manchester United earlier on the same day (14:00).\nArsene Wenger soundtracks his life: Former Arsenal manager joins Desert Island Discs\nThe Players Podcast: A World Cup winner on getting to grips with British slang"

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-2 Newcastle United: Callum Wilson and Joelinton score late\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce says they are starting to see the real Joelinton after the forward had a hand in two late goals in a win at Crystal Palace.\nThe Brazilian set up Callum Wilson for the first in the 88th minute and added his side's second 99 seconds later.\nIt was his first Premier League goal of the season and a third in the top flight since joining Newcastle for a club record \u00a340m in July last year.\n\"Sometimes you need time - it doesn't matter about price tag,\" said Bruce.\n\"In Joe's case, the price tag and number nine shirt meant he struggled at times.\n\"But the kid wants to do well. He had a lot of opportunities tonight but we are starting to see him now with his strength.\"\nThe former Hoffenheim striker had gone 16 Premier League games without a goal or assist, before grabbing one of each in Friday's victory, which moved Newcastle up to 10th in the table.\n\"There is no disputing that Joelinton has found it difficult,\" added Bruce. \"But I've said many times that some take a little more time than others. We're delighted he's scored a goal.\"\nPalace had looked more likely to break the deadlock and the visitors had goalkeeper Karl Darlow to thank for keeping them in the game.\nHe saved well from substitute Christian Benteke's powerful header having earlier made a smart stop to keep out Jeffrey Schlupp's angled left-footed effort, while Patrick van Aanholt fizzed a strike wide.\nThe result moves Newcastle up to 10th in the table, while Palace slip to 13th.\nReaction to Crystal Palace v Newcastle\nJoelinton's hard work pays off\nBruce's Newcastle side had failed to score in their previous two outings but looked far more expansive to start with in south London on Friday.\nJoelinton managed four shots in the opening 20 minutes, as many as he had previously had in any game this season, and the best chance of the half fell to him before the break.\nSloppy defending by the hosts allowed the Brazilian to engineer a low effort on goal, but it was easily gathered by Guaita and the Magpies went in at the break having failed to score in the first half of 20 of their past 26 Premier League matches.\nNewcastle looked set to make it three games in a row without a goal as they were increasingly pegged back, but the breakthrough did eventually come as Joelinton combined superbly with fellow forward Wilson.\nHis pass sent the England forward through on goal and Wilson slid an effort beneath Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita to open the scoring with two minutes remaining.\nThe 24-year-old then got the goal his hard work deserved moments later, beating Guaita with a left-footed effort after Wilson returned the favour with an assist.\nPalace rue missed opportunities\nPalace boss Roy Hodgson named a side with 2,068 Premier League appearances between them - the most for any team in a game this season - but experience could not be converted into goals at Selhurst Park.\nThe hosts were again without talisman Wilfried Zaha, self-isolating after a positive Covid test, and relied instead on the ingenuity of England Under-21 international Eberechi Eze as their creative outlet.\nIt was the 22-year-old who forced Darlow into his first save on 25 minutes and the Newcastle keeper was equal to everything Palace could muster after that.\nThe versatile Schlupp, playing as a centre-forward with recognised strikers Benteke and Michy Batshuayi among the substitutes, squeezed a pass into the path of strike partner Jordan Ayew after the break - but the Ghana international toe-poked wide.\nHodgson threw both his benched forwards on in search of a winner and Benteke fired wide and saw a good header saved, before left-back Van Aanholt had a chance to win it.\nBut Palace were then hit at the other end, and their struggles without Zaha continue, with this their 21st defeat from the 29 games he has missed since 2014.\nHowever, they will be buoyed by the news that their next home match - against Tottenham on Sunday, 13 December - will see the return of 2,000 fans at Selhurst Park.\n'I though it was going to cost us'\nNewcastle manager Bruce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Both teams find it difficult to score a goal and we were looking for that little bit of quality. We weren't clinical enough and I thought it was going to cost us, but then we got it for the goals.\n\"Callum [Wilson] is a goalscorer and he has that instinct. That's his seventh goal now and that's a tremendous return.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Hodgson: \"All defeats hurt and this one did as we didn't play well. I didn't think we were going to lose; I didn't think we would win it either. So to lose it is a bitter blow. Congratulations to Newcastle on winning it.\n\"I would credit the whole Newcastle team. The keeper played his part but I think it is too simplistic to say we didn't win because of their goalkeeper. We didn't create enough.\"\nWilson key to Newcastle attack - the stats\nNewcastle have won five of their past nine away Premier League games in London, after a run of three wins in 24 matches.\nSince the start of the 2017-18 season, Crystal Palace have failed to score in 45 Premier League games, more than any other club.\nPalace have lost their past seven Premier League matches when they have had more than 50% possession.\nNewcastle striker Callum Wilson has been directly involved in nine goals in nine Premier League appearances for the club (seven goals, two assists).\nCrystal Palace have won just two of their last 17 Premier League games without Wilfried Zaha (losing 15).\nThe average age of Palace's starting XI was 30 years 182 days, the oldest of any team in a Premier League match this season.\nWhat next?\nNewcastle travel to Aston Villa next Friday (20:00 GMT), while Crystal Palace visit West Brom a week on Sunday (12:00).\nWatch 13 FA Cup second-round games on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app this weekend.

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Liverpool: Pascal Gross denies Reds\nPascal Gross' controversial injury-time penalty rescued a deserved draw for Brighton, although Liverpool still went top of the Premier League.\nIt was Brighton's second penalty of the game after Neal Maupay fired a first-half spot-kick wide at the Amex Stadium.\nThe Reds thought they had taken the lead when Mohamed Salah latched onto a Roberto Firmino ball before firing home, but it was disallowed for offside by the video assistant referee.\nDiogo Jota broke the deadlock, with his ninth goal since joining the Reds, as he received Salah's pass before going past two defenders and firing into the bottom corner.\nSubstitute Sadio Mane believed he had sealed the game with a late header for Liverpool but that was also ruled out by the VAR for offside.\nAnd they were made to pay when Andy Robertson kicked Danny Welbeck's boot - with Stuart Attwell awarding the penalty after viewing the screen - and Gross slamming the equaliser down the centre.\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was furious with the officials as they walked off the pitch and captain Jordan Henderson said he would like to see VAR scrapped.\nThe visitors lost James Milner to a hamstring injury, while Brighton had to replace both Maupay and Adam Lallana, who had only been on the pitch for eight minutes.\nKlopp criticised broadcasters again afterwards for placing this game on a Saturday lunchtime after a Champions League game on Wednesday.\nThe defending champions go one point above Tottenham, who visit Chelsea on Sunday. Brighton remain 16th, five points ahead of 17th-placed Burnley.\nFollow reaction and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nLate equaliser adds to Liverpool frustrations\nLiverpool still go top of the table, but by one point and not three. The result, and not the performance, was the most important thing in this manic schedule - and they were moments away from getting the result they wanted.\nKlopp warned last week the fixture scheduling means they may not finish the season with 11 players.\nAnd Milner, who started the game in midfield and moved to right-back, suffered a muscle injury in the second half to add to their defensive injury concerns.\nThey made six changes from their 2-0 defeat by Atalanta on Wednesday, a game which had involved several fringe players, for this one.\nThe Reds did not create many chances, with six shots - only two on target - but Jota's goal did look like it was going to be enough until the late drama.\nRobertson tried to clear the ball but instead caught Welbeck's foot. There was definitely contact, although it would not have been given in a pre-VAR world.\nBrighton get point they deserve\nBrighton are often made to pay for missed chances. Only Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester City have had more shots than the Seagulls' 123 this season.\nBut despite that they sit just two places outside the relegation zone.\nNobody could really argue they fully merited a point against the champions.\nThe lively Aaron Connolly - who appeared furious at being replaced in the second half - ran onto Maupay's long ball before curling just wide. The Irishman was then fouled by Neco Williams for the penalty which Maupay missed.\nMaupay's day got worse when he suffered a hamstring injury. He is the first player to start a Premier League game, miss a penalty and be replaced before half-time since Dennis Bergkamp against Derby in April 1998.\nBrighton eventually earned a dramatic point through Gross' penalty to take them onto 10 points.\nBrighton end Reds' nine-game winning run - match stats\nLiverpool have gone unbeaten in each of their past 12 matches against Brighton (W10 D2), with this draw ending a nine-match winning run against the Seagulls.\nBrighton have never won a top-flight home game against Liverpool (D4 L4), failing to keep a clean sheet.\nBrighton are without a win in their past nine home games in the Premier League (D4 L5) - their longest winless run in the competition on home soil.\nDiogo Jota has scored nine goals in his 14 appearances for Liverpool, scoring eight goals in his past eight.\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah has been directly involved in nine goals in his seven Premier League games against Brighton (five goals, four assists). Against no team has he registered more goal involvements in the competition (level with Bournemouth, Watford and West Ham).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool are back in Champions League action on Tuesday, at home to Ajax (20:00 GMT), before hosting Wolves on Sunday, 6 December in the league (19:15).\nBrighton have nine days off. Their next match is at home to Southampton on Monday, 7 December (20:00) in the league.\nWatch 13 FA Cup second-round games on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app this weekend.

It was the first time they had scored three at all since their opening game of the season.\nThese statistics are at odds with previous campaigns, when City have almost scored at will - and Burnley could be forgiven for thinking not much has changed, especially once Torres and Mahrez had converted their second-half efforts.\nNow City's task is to show they can hurt different opposition in the same way.\nA tough afternoon for Clarets\nThis was another chastening afternoon for Burnley, who have won just one game all season and dropped back into the bottom three after West Bromwich Albion beat Sheffield United in the day's late game.\nDyche will surely be unhappy at the lapses in concentration that led to City's first two goals and England keeper Pope needs to regain his fitness quickly given the troubles Peacock-Farrell endured.\nBurnley's other debutant, 20-year-old midfielder Josh Benson, came closest for the visitors when his second-half free-kick was deflected narrowly wide.\nIn truth, Benson was not in the same class as the men he was opposing - although, not for the first time in recent seasons, that could be said for every Burnley player.\n\"You can't start a game with a gameplan then throw it out of the window with a mistake that early against this team,\" said Dyche.\n\"They use the ball so well and there's movement everywhere, so it becomes a tough afternoon.\n\"We have got injuries galore at the moment. We recovered then got four or five more this week. We played into their hands. We played a short pass which wasn't needed. We wanted to put it on top of them but we didn't do it.\"\nPeacock-Farrell's unwanted record - the stats\nManchester City have won their past seven meetings with Burnley by an aggregate score of 28-1.\nBurnley have lost seven of their past 10 Premier League games, after losing just one of their 15 before that.\nCity are only the second side in Football League history to win four successive home games by five or more goals against the same opponent, after Notts County did so against Port Vale between October 1893 and February 1907.\nOnly in 1888-89 have Burnley lost more of their opening nine matches of a top-flight season than the six they have this term.\nMahrez has scored seven goals in his past four Premier League appearances against Burnley - and has netted more league goals against them (eight) than he has against any other opponent.\nSince his Premier League debut (for Chelsea in August 2013), Manchester City's De Bruyne has provided 71 assists in the competition, eight more than any other player, despite making only three appearances across the first two campaigns in that time.\nMendy's first City goal came in his 60th appearance for the club.\nTorres netted his first league goal for City with his 14th shot in the competition and on his seventh appearance.\nBurnley's Peacock-Farrell became just the third goalkeeper to concede five or more goals on their Premier League debut, after John Sheffield in 1994 (five, Swindon v Aston Villa) and Matt Murray in 2003 (five, Wolves v Blackburn).\nWhat next?\nManchester City travel to Porto in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT kick-off), while Burnley host Everton in the Premier League on Saturday, 5 December (12:30).\nWatch 13 FA Cup second-round games on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app this weekend.

and keeping the league's top scorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin in check - as key in the victory and their move up to 11th in the table.\nEverton slipped to a fourth defeat in five games, making their unbeaten start to the season seem like a distant memory.\nThey carved out plenty of chances themselves, but could not beat Illan Meslier, who denied Richarlison, Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure.\nThe Toffees also showed their defensive frailties once more as Leeds picked them apart, which, but for better finishing, could have made the scoreline even more convincing for the visitors.\nThis is the first time boss Ancelotti has lost successive home fixtures since 2012 when he was manager at Paris St-Germain.\nReaction from Goodison Park and Premier League latest\nEverton's Digne out for 'two to three months'\nLeeds find their range at last\nIn a week when former Napoli boss Ancelotti and Argentine Bielsa praised the impact that Diego Maradona had on football, this game was a glowing tribute to the attacking football he played.\nDespite being promoted last season, Leeds have already established themselves as one of the most entertaining teams in the Premier League.\nIn the first half, however, it looked like their profligacy would cost them dear.\nThey had 13 shots before the break - the most in a Premier League half this season - but failed to find the net through a combination of poor finishing and good stops from Pickford in front of the watching England manager Gareth Southgate.\nHarrison should have given Leeds the lead after 10 minutes when he missed the target at the back post and he then hit the woodwork late in the half.\nOn that occasion, Pickford failed to come for a cross, but he had already saved Everton twice to deny Patrick Bamford's low shot and Raphinha's looping header.\nAided by the talented Kalvin Phillips, who almost acts like an NFL quarter-back, there were further opportunities for Mateusz Klich.\nAnd, as the visitors tired in the second half, Everton began to threaten on the counter-attack.\nBut just as the game seemed to be tipping the hosts' way, Raphinha produced his first goal of the season, and Ezjgan Alioski should have made the game safe late on.\nThe goal was a huge relief for Leeds, who shared a goalless draw with 10-man Arsenal last weekend, but was testament to the faith in Bielsa's methods which lit up a chilly night on Merseyside.\nEverton frustrated by defensive shortcomings\nAncelotti, who was moved by the pre-match applause for Maradona, has bemoaned his side's defending in recent weeks as they came crashing back down to earth after their unbeaten start to the season with three defeats before last Sunday's win at Fulham.\nHowever, a switch to a 3-4-3 in that victory still left the Italian's team open, and that formation was picked off by Leeds' fast-flowing football.\nThe hosts' backline, which featured Mason Holgate and Ben Godfrey either side of Michael Keane, showed signs of frailty, and it did not help having midfielders Alex Iwobi and Tom Davies playing as wing-backs with both Lucas Digne and Seamus Coleman out injured.\nEverton were hindered by Stuart Dallas' superb shackling of James Rodriguez, yet the Toffees still created chances, which is a feature of their season.\nThat is reflected in the fact they have failed to keep a clean sheet since the opening game, but Calvert-Lewin has still scored 10 league goals.\nThey should have led early on when Meslier stopped Doucoure's close-range effort and as the first half continued like a basketball game, Rodriguez and Richarlison both had goals ruled out for offside.\nSuch was the openness of the game, defensive midfielder Allan even tried his luck with a mazy run before his shot was saved.\nHaving had 15 shots with eight on target, Everton could argue that they did enough to earn a point at least.\nBut when Godfrey failed to adequately block Raphinha's goal, all the hard work from Ancelotti's side faded away and it will leave the Italian contemplating if he needs further reinforcements when the transfer window opens in January.\nConsecutive top-flight clean sheets for first time since 2003 - the stats\nLeeds have picked up their first away league victory against Everton since August 1990 (3-2), having failed to win on any of their previous 13 trips to Goodison Park in league competition prior to this game.\nEverton have lost back-to-back matches against Leeds in all competitions for the first time since December 1991.\nLeeds have won as many away Premier League games in 2020-21 (three) as they did in the entirety of 2003-04 (their previous top-flight campaign), whilst they have kept consecutive clean sheets in the competition for the first time since January 2003.\nThe Toffees have lost back-to-back home Premier League games for the first time since September 2019.\nRaphinha's goal was the fourth Everton have conceded from outside the box in the Premier League this season.\nIn the Premier League this season, only Aston Villa vs Leeds in October (39) has seen more shots than today's meeting between Everton and Leeds (38), while Raphinha's winner for Leeds was the 35th attempt of the game.\nWhat's next?\nEverton have a week to prepare for their next Premier League game at Burnley on Saturday, 5 December (12:30 GMT), while Leeds are at Chelsea on the same day (20:00 GMT).\nWatch 13 FA Cup second-round games on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app this weekend.

Then, when gifted two second-half opportunities, the Gabon international failed to hit the target with either.\nArsenal's goal, simple in its creation, was a powerful Gabriel header from Willian's cross, but beyond that they rarely threatened a Wolves backline that is also notoriously solid.\nArteta needs a swift solution to his side's bluntness because, on a day when north London rivals Tottenham went back to the top of the table, they seem further away than ever from the English top-flight's elite.\n'No excuses' - what they said\nArsenal manager Arteta: \"They had two shots on target and scored both times. In the second half, my team showed a resilience, togetherness and belief to try to win the game back. We generated good chances but all players go through periods where they struggle to score goals.\n\"It's my responsibility for the team to score more goals.

I thought we'd have a lot of possession. We created enough to win the game.\n\"The clean sheet factor against a side set up to counter-attack - that was excellent.

        "article_text": "Leicester City 1-2 Fulham: Lookman and Cavaleiro prevent Foxes going level on points at top\nManager Scott Parker praised forward Ivan Cavaleiro's \"courage\" as his penalty helped Fulham climb out of the Premier League relegation places.\nParker's side had missed three penalties in a row before Cavaleiro converted to help secure victory at Leicester, who missed the chance to go level on points with leaders Tottenham.\nThe Portuguese had been one of the spot-kick culprits - missing in a 3-2 home defeat by Everton eight days earlier - and Parker was impressed with the way he stepped up.\nAleksandar Mitrovic had hit the bar with a penalty at Sheffield United in October, and Ademola Lookman had been widely criticised for a failed attempt at a Panenka-style spot-kick in the defeat by West Ham on 7 November.\n\"Lookman came under a lot of stick when he did the penalty and he needed to take his medicine,\" Parker said.\n5 Live Football Daily: Marine, Mourinho and Arteta's work in progress\n\"Cavaleiro slipped last week and I'm not on Twitter or Instagram but I can only imagine what was being said, the jokes at his expense.\n\"I said to him: 'Are you ready to take one if we get it?' He looked at me dead in the eye and said: 'I'm ready.' It's the courage to step up there are the things we need.\"\nLookman scored Fulham's opener, slotting past Kasper Schmeichel following Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's driving run from inside his own half.\nCavaleiro stepped up to make it 2-0 before half-time, after referee Simon Hooper reviewed Christian Fuchs' tackle on Bobby Decordova-Reid on the pitchside monitor.\nLeicester had earlier struck the woodwork twice in quick succession as Wesley Fofana's follow-up to Youri Tielemans' volley cannoned off the crossbar.\nBut the Foxes, as they did in their 3-0 defeat by Liverpool, endured another frustrating night in attack until substitute Harvey Barnes' late reply ensured a nervy finale for Fulham.\n\"Ade earned the right to score his goal and Cav put himself up to be scrutinised,\" Parker said. \"There's no denying there's relief.\n\"We're in a world where it's win or lose for all of us and that's the big picture. I've spoken to them about not letting defeats cripple us.\"\nFulham's second win of the season takes them up two places to 17th, while Leicester remain fourth and three points behind leaders Tottenham.\nRB Leipzig loanee Lookman celebrated his goal by holding up a Senegal shirt which had been hung in the visitors' dressing room, in tribute to former midfielder Papa Bouba Diop, who died aged 42 on Sunday.\nReaction to Leicester v Fulham, plus coverage of West Ham v Aston Villa\nFulham show they are up for the fight\nA match at the King Power Stadium marked the start of a difficult run of fixtures for Parker's side, with a trip to Manchester City and the visit of Liverpool to come. They meet five of the 'big six' in their next nine games.\nFulham arrived at Leicester on the back of successive defeats, with the league's joint-worst defensive record and only one win in 25 Premier League away matches.\nBut Parker called for greater intensity after his side let in three goals in their defeat by Everton - the fourth time they had conceded three or more in nine league games - and how his call was answered here.\nThe visitors appeared focused and well-organised from the off, while the return of Anguissa brought calm in midfield.\nAnguissa's positive play and neat through-ball teed up Lookman's well-taken opener, while the mazy runs of the England youth international caused Leicester problems on the break throughout.\nCavaleiro's coolness from the spot, following his unfortunate slip in his previous miss, perhaps best typified a transformed Fulham display.\nThe visitors took a much more defensive approach in the second half in an attempt to keep Leicester at bay but, after Lookman was denied by Schmeichel at close range with 15 minutes remaining, Parker's men successfully endured a late barrage to leave with an excellent three points.\nBelow-par Leicester miss out\nBrighton's injury-time equaliser against Liverpool and Tottenham's goalless draw with Chelsea over the weekend gave Leicester the chance to keep pace at the top and put a disappointing display at Anfield behind them.\nHowever, a late flurry was not enough to undo the damage of an uninspiring first-half performance.\nRodgers' side had to wait until the 19th minute for their first attempts at goal, but Fofana lacked composure after he was fastest to react to Tielemans' sweetly hit volley from the edge of the penalty area.\nStarved of supply against Liverpool, last season's Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy struggled again against the Londoners, touching the ball only once in the first 25 minutes at the King Power Stadium.\nVardy, whose last-gasp equaliser against Braga on Thursday ensured qualification for the Europa League last 32 with two games to spare, produced a clever flick from Dennis Praet's cross to draw Alphonse Areola into action, but it was a rare opportunity for the hosts.\nAfter Vardy's header set up Barnes, substitute Kelechi Iheanacho twice had a shot blocked in a desperate final push for an equaliser - but it is now successive league defeats for the Foxes.\n'A big win' - what the managers said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It was a disappointing first half for us. We made mistakes in our defensive moments and in this league, if you give away opportunities, it can be very difficult.\n\"Fulham deserved to win - they punished us and we weren't good enough to break them down. We're a young side and we've had some very good performances. Evenings like this show the youthfulness of the team and we've still got work to do.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker, speaking to Sky Sports: \"I'm delighted with the team's efforts. With where we are, we're judged on our results. It was a battling display, some magnificent performances and some real quality as well.\n\"We're a little disappointed with the goal but in the second half, we knew we'd come under a bit of pressure but you've got to enjoy that. This is a big win for us. We need to keep pushing and we'll keep going in the right direction.\"\nFulham love Mondays - the stats\nFulham beat a side starting the day in the top four of the Premier League for the first time since March 2013, having lost 14 of their past 15.\nTheir two Premier League wins this season have both come on a Monday. In fact, the Cottagers have won five of their past seven top-flight games on a Monday.\nFulham have lost just one of their seven Premier League games against Leicester.\nLeicester have lost consecutive Premier League games against sides starting the day in the relegation zone for the first time since November 2014.\nThis was Foxes manager Brendan Rodgers' first managerial defeat against Fulham in the Premier League, after winning each of his previous seven.\nIvan Cavaleiro became the first player to score a Premier League penalty for Fulham since Aleksandar Mitrovic against Leeds in September. The Londoners had missed each of their previous three in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nFollowing their penultimate Europa League group game against Zorya Luhansk in Ukraine on Thursday (17:55 GMT), Leicester visit Sheffield United on Sunday (14:15).\nFulham have four days to regroup before they travel to Manchester City on Saturday afternoon (15:00).\nAnton Ferdinand: Football, Racism and Me: How the John Terry incident drove him to tackle the problem in the game\nRugby League's Great British Lions: Follow a behind the scenes look at their return tour down under"

We showed resilience to get the three points as Aston Villa made it really difficult for us.\n\"I don't want us to play badly, I want us to play well but the team have been excellent generally. The small things went for us tonight, we'll take that and move on.\"\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith: \"I'm disappointed with the result but I thought we were great tonight. We've had enough chances to win the game and that's why it hurts so much.\n\"They've given the decision offside for his arm but the only reason his arm is there is that he's being fouled. If it's not a goal it should have been a penalty.\n\"I won't go home thinking about VAR. It frustrates everyone but there's nothing we can do about it.\"\nConsistent team selection - the stats\nWest Ham have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since May 2019, while they have lost just one of their last eight (W5 D2) after losing the two directly before that\nAston Villa have lost four of their last five top-flight games (W1), after enjoying an unbeaten run of eight games before that (W6 D2)\nWest Ham became the first side to score in the opening two minutes of the first and second half in a single Premier League game since Man City against Fulham in September 2018\nA divisional-high five of Aston Villa's Premier League goals this season have come from outside the box (Grealish two, Barkley two and McGinn one)\nThese two sides have made fewer changes to their starting XIs than any other teams in the Premier League this season (Aston Villa four, West Ham five)\nAston Villa playmaker Jack Grealish has been directly involved in 10 goals in the Premier League this season (five goals, five assists), a haul only Spurs pair Harry Kane (16) and Son Heung-Min (11) can better\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham will welcome 2,000 fans into London Stadium for the visit of Manchester United next Saturday (17:30 GMT).

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 Everton: Calvert-Lewin goal sees points shared\nBurnley and Everton shared the points in an entertaining Premier League arm-wrestle at Turf Moor.\nThe hosts made a lightning start, Robbie Brady's strike from outside the box giving them the lead in the third minute.\nEverton were vulnerable, but improved after an injury to Fabian Delph forced them into a reshuffle midway through the first half.\nThey equalised just before the break through Dominic Calvert-Lewin, the Premier League's leading scorer this season.\nBoth sides had chances to win it, only for goalkeepers Jordan Pickford and Nick Pope, the men vying for the England number one shirt, to shine in front of the watching Gareth Southgate.\nBurnley stay in the bottom three, a point behind 17th-placed Fulham, who suffered a 2-0 defeat to Manchester City later on Saturday. The Clarets will have a game in hand on the majority of the league by the end of the weekend.\nEverton are ninth, five points behind leaders Chelsea, who moved above Tottenham with victory over Leeds United.\nNon-league to Premier League - pick your ultimate 'rags-to-riches XI'\nEverton make virtue of necessity\nCuriously, this game turned on a moment of misfortune for Delph, with the resulting Everton reshuffle actually benefiting the Toffees.\nDeployed at left wing-back for just his second league start of the season, Delph lasted only 27 minutes before being forced off with an injury to his troublesome hamstring.\nInstead of replacing like-for-like, Everton introduced Andre Gomes into their midfield and switched to a flat back four.\nWhereas before Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure were being overrun, the extra body gave the visitors a foothold in the middle. It was the previously poor Allan's intervention that set Everton on their way to the equaliser, although Burnley felt he fouled Ashley Westwood to win the ball.\n\"That for me is deemed a foul in modern football. I don't actually agree that should be a foul but the rules and the way football pans out now, virtually every week that gets given,\" said Burnley manager Sean Dyche.\n\"There was low-level contact on his shoulder, knee and foot but he still went over. I see it every week - those in the middle of the pitch are given all the time. Lo and behold when we need it: not given. It's happened too many times this season.\n\"I ask my players not to roll around the floor, I ask them not to squeal or dive. But it's actually costing us and it cost us here.\"\nFrom the equaliser onwards, Everton always looked the more likely to win it, even if Pickford was forced into excellent saves from Chris Wood and Ben Mee.\nBurnley's growing shoots of recovery\nBurnley remain in the relegation zone, but this result represents a further advance on a wretched start to the season that saw them take one point from six matches. They have now lost just one one in four, and there was no disgrace in an injury-hit team being well beaten at Manchester City last time out.\nThey flew out of the blocks, harrying to regain possession high up the field, with Westwood winning the ball for Brady to lash in his first goal in more than a year.\nEven after that, Burnley pressed, their full-backs happy to push on, only for Everton to establish themselves after the Delph injury.\nThere were periods of the second half when Burnley saw most of the ball, but it was Everton who had more time in the ascendancy.\nHowever, the hosts remained solid, were well worth their point and may have had more had Pickford not been sharp.\n\"Overall I think it's a good point,\" said Dyche. \"The performance level was what we've come to expect over a number of seasons here - the will, the command, the drive and some of the quality was good as well.\n\"We created some good chances and look like an effective unit. I thought you saw a reaction from the group to try and get a result.\"\nEverton fail to land knockout blow\nAfter a stellar start to the season, Everton arrived in Lancashire with four defeats in their previous five games.\nMore pain looked likely in a disjointed start, only for the enforced reshuffle to not only stiffen their midfield but also release the creativity of Richarlison and James Rodriguez.\nIn Calvert-Lewin, they possess a potent threat - the England striker was lively even before he slid in to meet Richarlison's cross for his 11th league goal of the season.\nEverton had spells of pressure in the second half, a goalmouth scramble, a curling effort from Rodriguez and a late strike by substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson.\nLike his opposite number, the dependable Pope was only to be beaten once.\n\"Gareth Southgate has to be really pleased to have these two goalkeepers in the national team,\" said Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti.\n\"Jordan did really well. He had two or three really good saves, now he's really better, he has more confidence, for sure, and for this reason he's showing his great quality.\n\"Pope made a great save from Gylfi, we were really close to winning the game with that opportunity. Gylfi was unlucky and Pope did really well.\"\nDyche in the 200 Club - stats\nBurnley have only won once in their last 11 Premier League games (D3 L7), scoring just six goals in the process.\nEverton have never kept a clean sheet in their seven Premier League away games against Burnley (W2 D1 L4) - against no team have they played more games in the competition without recording an away clean sheet.\nThis was the first time Burnley and Everton have drawn in the Premier League (13th meeting), while it's their first top-flight stalemate since August 1975 at Turf Moor (1-1).\nEverton have conceded in 10 consecutive Premier League games - their longest run without a clean sheet in the competition since November 2017 (12 games).\nEverton's Jordan Pickford has conceded more goals from outside the box than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League this season (5).\nRobbie Brady's goal for Burnley was the quickest Everton have conceded in a Premier League game since November 2017 versus Crystal Palace when James McArthur scored after 51 seconds.\nEverton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored more league goals from inside the box (11) than any other player in Europe's top five divisions this season. In fact, the Everton striker has scored six times from inside the six-yard box, twice as many as any other Premier League player this term.\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche took charge of his 200th Premier League game today, making him the 35th different manager to reach this milestone. Only four of the 16 English managers to reach the milestone have won their 200th match (Pardew, Hodgson, Bruce and Hoddle).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Arsenal next Sunday evening (19:15 GMT), while Everton host Chelsea the previous night (20:00).\nLouis Theroux is back: I May Destroy You star Michaela Coel joins for his new series\nHarry Kane exclusive: The England captain talks VAR, fans returning and Justin Bieber"

        "article_text": "Man City 2-0 Fulham: Title race more open this season - Guardiola\nPep Guardiola believes this season's Premier League title race will be more open than in previous campaigns, with his Manchester City side now fourth in the table after a comfortable win over Fulham.\nRaheem Sterling's close-range finish and a Kevin de Bruyne penalty made it back-to-back wins for City, who were vastly superior to their opponent but also wasteful in front of goal.\nHaving struggled for consistency so far this season, City are now three points behind the leagues joint leaders, Tottenham and reigning champions Liverpool.\nAs it stands, just four points separates the sides at the top and Wolves in ninth.\n\"In my first season, Chelsea dominated and the next three were us and Liverpool, we controlled the league.\n\"But Leicester came here and scored five goals and then this week lost against Fulham, who we've just beaten. It is like how the Premier League was, everyone can beat everyone.\n\"The important thing is to be in there.\n\"In this month, it was important to focus on qualification in the Champions League and now we focus on the Premier League. It will be a long, long season for all the clubs.\"\nCity ensured their progress to the Champions League last 16 with two group games to spare, meaning they could rest players for the 0-0 draw in Porto that preceded Saturday's win.\nGuardiola's side recorded their now annual 5-0 home win over Burnley last weekend and were similarly dominant, albeit a bit wasteful against the Cottagers.\nSterling and De Bruyne laid the platform for the win, with the latter setting up the former to slot in the opening goal.\nThe roles were then reversed with the England winger tripped in the box by Joachim Andersen to allow the Belgian midfielder to score from the penalty spot.\nThe pair could easily have had another four goals between them but Fulham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola made a string of good saves, while De Bruyne also struck the bar with a shot.\nIt is the first time this campaign that City have won back-to-back league matches and it lifts them to a spot in the table more in keeping of a side with title aspirations.\nFulham spent most of the game repelling attacks, but at least tried to ask questions of the home side, as they did to far greater effect at Leicester on Monday.\nAn eighth defeat of the season means the Cottagers remain 17th in the table, one point better off than West Brom and Burnley, both of whom have played a game less.\nNon-league to Premier League - pick your ultimate 'rags-to-riches XI'\nPep reaches 700 as City make their move\nThis was City boss Pep Guardiola's 700th game as a manager, during which he has won 29 major trophies in 11 seasons, including two Premier League titles with City.\nTheir inconsistent form in the early stages of this campaign has prompted some to question whether they are capable of reclaiming the English top-flight crown, which they relinquished to Liverpool last season.\nThe critics may not be entirely won over by successive victories over such vastly inferior opposition as Burnley and Fulham, but they cannot deny the ease with which they were dispatched.\nNor can they ignore the small signs of that confident swagger returning to City's play nor the ominous stamping of authority on both games by De Bruyne, who scored his first league goal since the opening day win over Wolves and made it 14 assists in 2020 - more than any other Premier League player.\nCity weren't perfect - this should have at least matched the scoreline against Burnley - and there are bigger challenges to come, not least of all at Manchester United in their next league fixture, but with some stars rediscovering their form and Sergio Aguero reportedly soon to return from injury, another title challenge from Guardiola's side is well under way.\n\"We struggled at the beginning of the season for many reasons. Now four games, four clean sheets. It's so important for us to maintain this solidity,\" added Guardiola.\n\"The finishing was wasteful. We know we have to improve this, but it's important to keep creating the chances. In the last 20 minutes we lost too many simple balls, which is a problem.\n\"We have to do the simple things better. That is the next step.\"\nAs for Fulham, you could forgive them for viewing this as something of a free hit, especially after having claimed a morale-boosting second win of the season earlier in the week.\nTheir season was never going to be defined by a fixture against an opponent who have now beaten them 10 times in a row by an aggregate of 29-3.\nThey failed to produce a meaningful effort at goal bar a couple of speculative Ivan Cavaleiro shots, but will be pleased at the determination and discipline they showed in not crumbling after Sterling's early opener.\nThings don't get any easier for Scott Parker's side, though. Up next: champions Liverpool.\n\"I see a team that had some fight today,\" said Fulham boss Scott Parker. \"I really liked what we were about in the second half. There's no shame in losing to a quality side. I asked for spirit and personality and I thought we had that.\n\"The performances this week will stand us in very good stead. The first few games we weren't in the contest and since then we've been right in them. Today was another big performance. We'll keep building.\"\nGuardiola with a 72% win percentage\nThis was Man City boss Pep Guardiola's 700th match in charge in his managerial career (W507 D111 L82), while it was his 250th in all competitions with the Citizens (W179 D34 L37).\nManchester City are unbeaten in their last 16 meetings with Fulham in all competitions (W13 D3), winning the last 10 in a row by an aggregate score of 29-3.\nFulham have conceded more goals than any other Premier League side this season (21), with no side conceding in more different games than the Cottagers (10).\nManchester City have scored as many goals over their last two Premier League games as they had in their previous seven in the competition (7).\nThis was the first time Manchester City didn't make a single substitute in a Premier League match since April 2005, in a 2-2 draw with Charlton Athletic.\nSince joining Manchester City in 2015, Kevin De Bruyne has both scored and assisted a goal in 16 different Premier League games - no player has done so more in that time (level with Mohamed Salah).\nMan City's Raheem Sterling has won 20 penalties in the Premier League, more than any other player in the competition's history.\nMan City's Kevin de Bruyne has been involved in more shots than any other Premier League player this season (62 - 34 shots, 28 chances created), with the Belgian involved in eight against Fulham this afternoon (6 shots, 2 chances created).\nLouis Theroux is back: I May Destroy You star Michaela Coel joins for his new series\nHarry Kane exclusive: The England captain talks VAR, fans returning and Justin Bieber"

        "article_text": "West Ham United 1-3 Manchester United: Visitors come from behind again\nManchester United responded to their midweek Champions League defeat by Paris St-Germain by staging another Premier League fightback to beat West Ham United and climb to fourth in the table.\nGoals from Paul Pogba, Mason Greenwood and substitute Marcus Rashford turned things around for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, who have fallen behind in all five away games this term but have won every match as part of a club-record nine successive away league victories.\nWith London placed in Tier 2 following the end of the national lockdown on 2 December, the Hammers became the first side to welcome back fans in the Premier League after a nine-month absence.\nDavid Moyes' side made by far the better start and were rewarded for their first-half superiority when the unmarked Tomas Soucek headed in from a corner after 38 minutes.\nThey should have added more before the interval but Pablo Fornals hit the post and Sebastien Haller slipped at the crucial moment after rounding goalkeeper Dean Henderson - who was making his first Premier League start for the visitors.\nAfter being omitted from the starting line-up with a crucial Champions League meeting with RB Leipzig looming on Tuesday, the introduction of Bruno Fernandes and Rashford coincided with a much-improved second-half display from Solskjaer's side.\nPogba's excellent finish from outside the box eventually stood following a VAR review to check whether Henderson's long clearance to Fernandes had curled out of play and then back in.\nRashford's cool finish after Greenwood had slotted in from Alex Telles' cross made it three goals in 13 minutes as United moved two points behind leaders Tottenham.\nFrom 'Ole out' to comeback kings\nNon-league to Premier League - pick your ultimate 'rags-to-riches XI'\nAnother tale of two halves for United\nPlaying poorly and going behind but again finding a way to win on the road was nothing new for Manchester United under Solskjaer.\nWith his side's Champions League fate set to be decided in the midweek trip to Leipzig - where a point is required to reach the last 16 - Solskjaer's decision to leave Fernandes and Rashford on the bench initially backfired.\nHenderson, Pogba, Donny van de Beek and Greenwood all started as the four changes to side from the 3-1 defeat by PSG, yet despite their fresh legs United made a lacklustre start.\nThey were fortunate not to find themselves more than 1-0 behind at the interval, Henderson doing well to smother Fornals' close-range shot inside the opening two minutes and Aaron Wan Bissaka recovering brilliantly to stop Jarrod Bowen on the counter attack.\nIt will all have felt so familiar to Solskjaer, whose side have now won a league-high 15 points from losing positions this season.\nRashford and Fernandes made a marked difference to United's attacking play and overall confidence after half-time, but it was the much-maligned Pogba whose wonderful first-time strike into the top corner restored parity.\nUnited dominated from that moment, Greenwood scoring for the first time in eight league games after a brilliant touch and finish while Rashford eventually got the goal his impact deserved after earlier hitting the post.\nA fourth straight league victory does not tell the full story for an inconsistent United side, but Solskjaer will just be grateful for the much-needed boost before a crucial week that also includes a Manchester derby next Saturday.\n\"You have a duty to be ready whenever you are called upon. Bruno [Fernandes] and Marcus [Rashford] came on and did well,\" Solskjaer told BBC Sport.\n\"The goals were exceptional. [Greenwood] is a great finisher. We are just waiting for his season to get started but he is getting fitter. The first goal was top quality from Paul Pogba. I am so happy for him.\n\"We got away with a poor performance. Away from home we have the character and belief. To [come from behind and win] five times on the bounce is exceptional.\"\nHammers aggrieved by VAR verdict\nMoyes was furious that Pogba's equaliser was allowed to stand, as Henderson's curled clearance down the right allowed Fernandes to pick out the France midfielder.\nThe video assistant referee reviewed whether the ball had gone out of play but replays were inconclusive and the goal stood.\n\"The decision went against us and it seemed to floor us. The ball was over my head. I had the best view because I was right on the touchline,\" said Moyes.\n\"It was definitely over the line - you only need to look at the reaction of the players - they knew it went out as well. It changed the game.\"\nThe former Manchester United manager will also surely lament the fact his side could have established a much greater advantage as they dominated the first half.\nWith three shots each, both Fornals and Bowen registered more attempts than Manchester United's players combined in that period, but only Soucek's goal from Declan Rice's glanced header separated the sides.\nBowen was the hosts' standout performer as he frequently beat his marker and the former Hull winger had a goal disallowed for offside then narrowly missed from Vladimir Coufal's low cross shortly after the restart.\nFornals hit the post while Haller lost his footing with the goal gaping after rounding Henderson as the Hammers failed to take the chances that could have made the game safe before the break.\nThat would have been well received by the returning home fans, who were back for the first time since 29 February, when a first league win in two months - preceded by protests against the club's board - hauled Moyes' struggling side out of the relegation places.\nTheir side is undoubtedly in better shape now despite this defeat, with West Ham sitting seventh in the table after an opening schedule that has included games against all but Chelsea of last season's top eight.\nOn the return of supporters, Moyes added: \"I was pleased we had 2,000 fans in but I would like it to have been many more. I hope the West Ham supporters enjoyed it. We played very well but the bit we just missed out on was maybe not managing the game well enough and getting the second goal.\"\nPremier League comeback kings - the stats\nManchester United have now won more points from losing positions than any other team in Premier League history (385).\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side have won their first five away games in a league campaign for the first time since 1985-86.\nThey are only the second side in Premier League history to score two or more goals in nine consecutive away games, after Leeds United in April 2001.\nAll three of Manchester United's substitutes - Rashford, Fernandes and Mata - were directly involved in a goal. It is just the second time that has happened for them in a Premier League game.\nWest Ham have dropped more points from winning positions in 2020 than any other team in the Premier League (19). Manchester United have won the most points (22) in this period.\nThis was the fourth time West Ham have faced Manchester United in a Premier League game while being above them in the table, but they have failed to win any of those games.\nSince his debut in February, Bruno Fernandes has been directly involved in 36 goals in 38 games in all competitions for Manchester United (22 goals, 14 assists).\nHis team-mate Mason Greenwood has scored 20 goals in all competitions since the start of last season, twice as many as any other Premier League teenager.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United travel to RB Leipzig in their final Champions League group match on Tuesday at 20:00 GMT. They then host derby rivals Manchester City on Saturday (17:30).\nWest Ham United are away to Leeds United on Friday (20:00).\nLouis Theroux is back: I May Destroy You star Michaela Coel joins for his new series\nHarry Kane exclusive: The England captain talks VAR, fans returning and Justin Bieber"

They're a threat until the end if you don't get a cushion.\n\"They are pretty unique in their style and they're well coached. We knew it was a big task. Character-wise and performance-wise, on lots of levels, I'm absolutely delighted.\"\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa: \"It was difficult for us to stop them playing out from the back with their centre-backs and [midfielder] N'Golo Kante.\n\"I never question the refereeing decisions and this game was not decided by the referee.

        "article_text": "West Brom 1-5 Crystal Palace: Wilfred Zaha and Christian Benteke punish 10-man Baggies\nWilfred Zaha again underlined his importance to Crystal Palace as they took advantage of the controversial dismissal of Matheus Pereira to claim their first points in three games with a rout at West Brom.\nForward Zaha had missed Palace's previous two matches - both of which ended in defeat - after testing positive for Covid-19 but quickly found his feet again at The Hawthorns with a typically lively attacking display that included two goals and an assist.\nIt was from his low cross that Darnell Furlong diverted the ball into his own net to give the visitors the lead and his whipped finish into the far corner that restored the advantage after Conor Gallagher's low, driven equaliser.\nBetween these two Zaha contributions, though, came the incident that completely altered the complexion of the game - Pereira's red card.\nIt seemed unclear, even after multiple replays, whether the Baggies forward intended his boot to make contact with Patrick van Aanholt's midriff while on the ground, but referee Paul Tierney had no doubt after viewing the incident on the pitch-side monitor.\nPrior to that, Albion had been the better side with momentum behind them after Gallagher's leveller, which came shortly after Furlong had gone close to making amends for his own goal with a header that came back off the bar.\nBut holding out for almost an hour with 10 men proved impossible, and Zaha sparked a Palace goal-fest.\nChristian Benteke headed the first of his two goals of the afternoon from a Van Aanholt cross just four minutes after his strike-partner's fine finish.\nZaha was on hand again to tap in from close range to make it 4-1 following a driving run into the box from Eberechi Eze before Benteke added the icing with a lovely finish on the turn.\nIt is the first time Palace have scored five away from home in a top-flight game and lifts them to 11th in the table, three points off the top four.\nWest Brom remain in the bottom three.\nLive text commentary of West Brom v Palace, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Sister Bliss from Faithless\nZaha remains Palace's main man\nRoy Hodgson claimed before the season started that this was the strongest squad he has had at his disposal during his time at Crystal Palace.\nBut Zaha remains the key man.\nYou need only look at their record without him in Premier League games - just two wins from their past 17.\nThey were limp and unthreatening in their recent defeats by Burnley and Newcastle as their talismanic forward self-isolated, but were immediately reinvigorated here by his presence.\nHe inevitably benefited from the extra space afforded him following Pereira's red card, but even before that he was an uncontainable menace to the Baggies, forcing Darnell into his costly evasive action as he tried to clear his dangerous early cross.\n\"I see it from Wilf all the time - I've seen it over the last three and a half years,\" said Hodgson. \"We know he has that ability when we can get the ball to his feet in the final third.\n\"What he has added to his game this year is goal-scoring. If Wilf can keep that up it bodes very well for us.\"\nHe has now scored or assisted 10 of Palace's 16 goals this season. No wonder Hodgson opted to take him off with 10 minutes remaining and the game won.\n\"He was a bit disappointed I took him off with 10 minutes to go because he wanted a hat-trick,\" added Hodgson. \"That's a good sign.\n\"I would have been less happy if he said 'I was quite content to come off, I don't need the third goal'.\"\nZaha's departure left Benteke to claim the limelight with a second goal, meaning in this one game alone he has matched his scoring tally for last season and doubled that of the season before.\nIt was a tough afternoon for Slaven Bilic's side, who have now conceded a league-high 23 goals this season.\nBilic can take some heart from the way his side played with 11 men, but will be worried by the manner in which they utterly capitulated with 10.\n\"I'm not happy with the way we collapsed at 2-1 - you can't do that - but for us to be competitive and be strong we need all of them on the pitch,\" said Bilic.\n\"After the second goal, especially after the third goal, it became too easy for them. We didn't mark, everybody was thinking and relying on their team-mate to do the job.\"\nOn the red card, Bilic added: \"It was a cheap one. For me, he gave [the referee] an option [to send him off].\n\"The more you watch it, the less it is a red card. Maybe there's a little contact. I would say a reaction is there but it wasn't a kick. If he gives them an option to give him a red card, you can't do it.\"\nHodgson returns to haunt another old club - the stats\nRoy Hodgson has won 11 Premier League matches against teams he's previously managed in the division - no manager has won more such matches (Harry Redknapp and Sam Allardyce also have 11 wins vs former clubs).\nSince the start of the 2012-13 season, only Olivier Giroud (31) has scored more headed Premier League goals than Christian Benteke (27).\nConor Gallagher (20 years and 304 days) became the youngest player to score in consecutive Premier League games for West Brom since Saido Berahino in January 2014 (20 years 150 days).\nMatheus Pereira's straight red card for West Brom makes it 12 of 13 red cards this season that have been straight dismissals (92%) - last season, only 57% of red cards in the Premier League were for straight red cards (25/44).\nWilfried Zaha has scored seven goals in nine Premier League games for Crystal Palace this season - Zaha's previous seven goals came over 49 appearances.\nWest Brom became the first team to score an own goal and receive a red card in the first half of a Premier League game since Spurs at West Ham in May 2014, and the first to do so in a home game since Bolton Wanderers vs Leicester in December 2001.\nDarnell Furlong became the first player to score an own goal and register an assist in a Premier League game since Denis Odoi for Fulham against Burnley in January 2019.\nAmong the 18 teams who have a had player sent off in at least 30 Premier League games, West Brom have lost the highest percentages of those games, losing 21 of the 31 games when receiving a red card (68%).\nMissed out on Saturday's Premier League action?

        "article_text": "Sheff Utd 1-2 Leicester: Chris Wilder shares concerns over losing run\nChris Wilder says he and his team share their fans' worry as Sheffield United's plight at the bottom of the Premier League table continued with defeat at home to Leicester City.\nThe Blades looked set to secure only their second point of the season when Oli McBurnie scored his first of the campaign after Ayoze Perez had given the visitors the lead.\nBut with just a few minutes of the match remaining, James Maddison fed in striker Jamie Vardy, who scampered clear of the home defence and slotted his shot past Aaron Ramsdale.\nThe 33-year-old boyhood fan of Blades' rivals Sheffield Wednesday celebrated by running to the corner flag and snapping it with his boot.\nUnited, who have made the worst start by any club to a Premier League season, now only have one point from 11 games and sit five points adrift at the bottom.\n\"If players want to stay in this division then they have to make better decisions,\" Wilder told BBC Radio 5 Live, referring to the errors made by Chris Basham and John Fleck in the build-up to Vardy's late goal.\n\"We're all worried because we care about results and performances. We're in this position for a reason.\"\nWilder, who has led the Yorkshire side to two promotions, added: \"We are a losing team at the moment and I am the manager of a losing team.\n\"Whether it is cruel or deserved, we have to make the right decisions. If we make the right decisions we get something from the game against a really decent team.\"\nEarlier, Vardy and Maddison both came close with fierce efforts that struck the Blades' right-hand upright.\nOliver Burke had United's only other chance of note when he slipped with just Kasper Schmeichel to beat.\nReaction to Sheff Utd v Leicester City, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Sister Bliss from Faithless\nBlades' situation becoming critical\nLast season must have seemed like a dream to some Blades supporters.\nChris Wilder's men were among the European places for much of their first campaign back in the top flight before falling away in the home straight. However, few would have thought those tail-end results would be the first symptoms of 'second-season syndrome'.\nUnited still remain difficult to beat, having only twice lost by more than one goal in the league this season but it is at the other end where they have suffered - it was only four goals in 10 games with a conversion rate of 4.2% before Sunday's game.\nSo when Burke fluffed his lines with just Schmeichel to beat midway through the first half, it seemed like Groundhog Day for the home side; the feeling exacerbated when Perez thrashed in the Foxes' opener.\nSpirits were lifted when McBurnie equalised soon after from a corner for his first in the competition in 15 appearances and after 20 efforts on goal. However, instead of building on that, the Blades reverted to type by focusing on soaking up pressure from their opponents.\nJust when they thought Brendan Rodgers' cavalier side had thrown everything at them, they were undone by the flashing blade that is Vardy.\nIt is now one point from a possible 33. Wilder has produced near miracles at the clubs he has managed, but surely this situation is impossible to turn around?\nFresh Vardy helps Foxes to victory\nLeicester will no doubt be glad for the respite from their Europa League-Premier League schedule that will follow their match at home to AEK Athens this Thursday.\nHowever, unlike Burnley, whose form suffered when they tried to cope with their European experience in 2018-19, the Foxes have enough depth in their squad to field two strong XIs.\nLeading hitman Vardy was one of the four senior players left out from the 4,000-mile round trip to Ukraine last week to face Zorya Luhansk, and his team benefitted from his freshness at Bramall Lane.\nThe forward was very unlucky not to score in the 10th minute as his strike thundered off the Blades' left-hand upright, but his fizz never fell flat and there was only one winner when he raced clear to clip in the winning goal.\nHis unpredictable movement had the Blades constantly guessing as did that of Perez, who was in the perfect spot to smash home the opener after Marc Albrighton's initial effort was blocked. Maddison also impressed in midfield and, like Vardy, saw his great strike rebound off the post before providing the assist for the winner.\nThe one negative for Rodgers was that his side's Achilles flared up again when for the eighth time this season they conceded from a set-piece.\nMissed out on Saturday's Premier League action? All the goals and highlights are streaming now\n'There's not too many better than Vardy' - reaction\nLeicester City manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The mark of how you're judged as a team is how you bounce back.\n\"We showed confidence and it was a case of at half-time reinforcing a few things and perseverance. We scored a good first goal, defended when needed and it was a great second goal for us and a deserved win.\n\"James [Maddison] has great vision, he sees a pass so early and he has a relationship with Jamie [Vardy] on the pitch. Jamie, once he's away in that position, there's not too many better.\"\nBurke's unlucky run continues - stats\nUnited have become just the ninth different team in English Football League history to lose 10 (or more) of their first 11 league matches of a season, and only the third in the top flight after Newcastle in 1977-78 and Manchester United in 1930-31.\nOnly Liverpool (19) and Manchester City (18) have won more Premier League away games than the Foxes since Brendan Rodgers took charge of Leicester (14).\nLeicester have conceded more Premier League goals via corners this season (six) than they did through the entire 2019-20 campaign (five).\nUnited's Oliver Burke has now appeared in 21 Premier League matches without winning any (D3 L18); from the start of a player's Premier League career, only Gareth Bale (24), Nicky Summerbee (23), Craig Fagan (23) and Giles Barnes (22) appeared in more matches before winning for the very first time in the competition.\nMaddison has provided his first Premier League assist in 363 days, since doing so against Aston Villa in December last year (56th created chance since).\nMcBurnie has scored more of Sheffield United's 44 Premier League goals since they were promoted last season than any other player, with six of his seven goals coming at Bramall Lane.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester face AEK Athens in their final Europa League group match on Thursday (20:00 GMT) before they host Brighton in the Premier League on Sunday (19:15).

We did seven [points], we didn't concede one goal against phenomenal teams.\n\"We are top of the league for one more week, which is good fun.\"\nArsenal's misery continues\nArsenal languish in 15th place in the Premier League after this north London derby defeat which exposed them as lacking in threat and currently well adrift of their fiercest adversaries.\nThe Gunners are 11 points adrift of Spurs and there was no evidence here to suggest this gap will be closing any time soon.\nArteta's side had 62% possession in the first half but were caught out on the break twice by Son and Kane, surely a danger he had warned his players about in advance.\nArteta almost sprinted along the touchline in anxiety as Son advanced for Spurs' first goal, showing more urgency than his defence as they stood off and allowed this world-class operator to deliver a superb finish.\nArsenal were slightly more of a threat after the break but Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris only needed to make two routine saves and one of Arteta's biggest concerns will be the form of his biggest names.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang was anonymous, as he has been most of the time since signing his new contract, while 32-year-old Willian, secured on a highly expensive deal from Chelsea in the summer, looked a spent force as he was easily outmuscled on many occasions.\nIt is early days for Arteta - and he has an FA Cup win as insurance - but this sixth defeat of the season demonstrated again the scale of his task and how far away Arsenal currently are from challenging at the top end of the table.\nFollow all the reaction from Tottenham v Arsenal, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Sister Bliss from Faithless\nQuiz: Name the British north London derby scorers\nMore records for Kane - the stats\nSpurs have won consecutive Premier League north London derbies for just the third time, after December 1992 and May 1993, and April 2010 and November 2010.\nMikel Arteta is just the second Arsenal manager to lose each of his first two north London derbies after Bertie Mee in 1966-67.\nSpurs boss Jose Mourinho has taken charge of more home games in all competitions without defeat against Arsenal than he has versus any other side (11 - W7 D4).\nArsenal have earned just 13 points from 11 league games this season, their lowest return at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1981-82 (12 points).\nThis was the 11th time a Mourinho side has had 35% possession or lower in a Premier League match, with the Tottenham manager winning nine of those matches (D1 L1).\nHarry Kane scored his 250th goal in his senior career for club and country - 202 for current club Spurs, 32 for England, nine for Millwall, five for Leyton Orient and two for Leicester City.\nKane has now scored 11 goals in north London derbies, the most of any player in the fixture's history, overtaking Emmanuel Adebayor and Bobby Smith.\nKane assisted his 10th Premier League goal of the season in just 11 games; no player has ever reached 10 assists in fewer appearances from the start of a campaign in the competition (level with Mesut Ozil in 2015-16).\nMissed out on Saturday's Premier League action?

        "article_text": "Liverpool 4-0 Wolves: Fans back at Anfield to see emphatic win\nPremier League champions Liverpool welcomed the return of fans to Anfield for the first time since March with an emphatic victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nMohamed Salah gave Liverpool the lead in the first half after Wolves defender Conor Coady misjudged a long ball from Jordan Henderson.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum added a second after the break when he curled a precise shot into the top-right corner from long range before Joel Matip's thumping header and Nelson Semedo's scrambled own goal completed the scoring.\nWolves were largely contained by the home side but had a glimpse of hope when referee Craig Pawson awarded them a penalty in the first half when he adjudged Sadio Mane to have fouled former Liverpool player Coady.\nHowever he overturned his decision after reviewing the incident on the video assistant referee monitor, where it was clear there had been no contact.\nThe win keeps Liverpool level on points with league leaders Tottenham, who beat Arsenal 2-0 in the north London derby earlier on Sunday.\nWolves are in 10th although only two points behind fifth-placed Manchester United, who have a game in hand.\nReaction to Liverpool's victory over Wolves\nFans back at Anfield means players no longer walk alone\nChampions win in style in front of fans\nLiverpool fans returned to Anfield for the first time in nine months and - albeit only 2,000 of them - were able to show their appreciation for a team that had been crowned Premier League champions during that period.\nThey chanted \"bring on the champions\" minutes before kick-off and raised their scarves for a quieter-than-usual chorus of 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.\nThe beaming smile on Jurgen Klopp's face as he watched supporters take their seats during the warm-up was still in place hours later after his side produced an authoritative performance that kept them in touch with Jose Mourinho's side.\nLeft-back Andy Robertson was a menace throughout for Wolves defender Semedo and he looked the most likely to engineer an opening in the first 20 minutes.\nSure enough, it was his fizzed cross that Mane headed just over as the dominant home side pressed for a breakthrough.\nHowever it was skipper Henderson's searching ball that Coady chested into the path of Salah and allowed the Egypt forward to take one touch before firing past visiting keeper Rui Patricio.\nThe goal was celebrated with predictable elation by those able to snare a ticket for the Kop and they were entertained regularly during the first half, with Roberto Firmino's nutmeg and Mane's 'Cruyff turn' two of the highlights.\nLiverpool were even more dominant after the break and secured victory when Wijnaldum's wonderful strike provided a two-goal cushion but the biggest roar came when centre-back Matip's header rippled the net in front of the fans.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold returned from injury as a substitute to set up the fourth, Wolves defender Semedo bundling the ball into his own net with Mane poised to score.\nThose supporters who were denied a victory parade when Liverpool lifted the long-awaited Premier League trophy in July were treated to a performance worthy of champions against a Wolves side who have proved an awkward opponent in recent encounters.\nThey thanked Klopp's men for a fine performance with another rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' in the final seconds of stoppage time before cheering the manager's familiar fist pumps at full time.\nCoady in limelight as Wolves miss Jimenez\nWolves travelled to Anfield without key striker Raul Jimenez, who fractured his skull in a horrific collision with Arsenal defender David Luiz last week.\nThe players warmed up with shirts showing their support for Jimenez and his absence was felt in Wolves' play.\nThe visitors lacked the penetration the Mexico forward gives them and on the one occasion the pacey Adama Traore got free - escaping the otherwise immaculate Fabinho - in the first half he could not pick out Pedro Neto at the back post.\nThe Spain winger's switch to the opposite wing in the second half failed to make a difference either as Liverpool doubled up on him successfully.\nReds goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, making his Premier League debut, did have some work to do and impressed with his handling.\nHe tipped Daniel Podence's clever chip around the post in the first half and then made a comfortable save from Leander Dendoncker's header in the second period.\nWolves rarely looked like ending their poor run against Liverpool, though, as they suffered their eighth consecutive league defeat to the Reds, conceding 19 goals and scoring just twice in that run.\n'I had goosebumps' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"The game, the atmosphere, it was so nice. I had goosebumps. [The fans] started 'You'll Never Walk Alone' - really nice. I never knew it could feel that good.\n\"This started in February and we were waiting to get normality back. Normality is good - I don't think we appreciated it as much. It was very, very touching.\n\"Wolves couldn't get into the game tonight and I think that was because of the way my boys played. It was a really, good high-level performance.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It was definitely a tough night. We could have done many, many things different - before the game, during the game.\n\"We didn't have enough of the ball. We didn't deal well with the pressing of Liverpool. We were organised until the moment of the first goal.\n\"We didn't perform well, Liverpool performed better than us. That is a reflection of the performance on the pitch. It was not a good performance. We were organised but not as organised in the second half.\"\nThe best of the stats\nLiverpool have won 31 of their last 32 home league games (drawing the other game), scoring 93 goals while conceding 25 in this time.\nSince Liverpool's first match after Virgil van Dijk's injury against Everton (Ajax in October), the Reds have conceded just six goals in 11 games in all competitions, keeping six clean sheets in the process.\nThis was Wolves' joint-heaviest margin of defeat in a Premier League game since their return to the division in 2018 (4-0 v West Ham in September).\nSalah has 52 Premier League goals at Anfield for Liverpool - only Lionel Messi at the Camp Nou (63) and Robert Lewandowski at the Allianz Arena (59) have scored more at a single venue in the big-five European leagues since the Egyptian joined the Reds in 2017.\nToday was the 17th time Mo Salah has both scored and assisted a goal in the same Premier League game for Liverpool; since 2017-18, this is five more times than any other player in the competition (Son Heung-min, 12).\nOf Liverpool midfielder Wijnaldum's 26 Premier League goals, 23 have come at home (88.5%), the highest ratio scored on home soil of any player with 20+ goals in the competition's history.\nAt 22 years and 13 days, Caoimhin Kelleher became the third-youngest Liverpool keeper to keep a Premier League clean sheet, after Scott Carson (19y 211d) and Chris Kirkland (21y 234d) - and the youngest to do so on his first start for the Reds.\nIn his 87 Premier League appearances, Wolves' former Liverpool player Conor Coady has only made three errors directly leading to a goal; two of those have come on Merseyside (v Everton at Goodison in September 2019 and this game against Liverpool at Anfield).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool play Midtjylland in the Champions League on Wednesday, 9 December (17:55 GMT kick-off), before returning to Premier League action on Sunday, 13 December at Fulham.\nWolves welcome Aston Villa in their next league match on Saturday, 12 December (12:30 GMT).\nMissed out on Saturday's Premier League action?

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-2 Southampton: Brighton victims of 'random' VAR decision\nBrighton wing-back Solly March said his side were the victims of the Premier League's latest \"random decision\" as a video assistant referee-awarded penalty consigned them to defeat against Southampton.\nThe Seagulls looked on course for a point until March was penalised for a late foul on Southampton full-back Kyle Walker-Peters.\nThe Saints player's momentum from the challenge outside the penalty area carried him forward as the players tangled and tumbled into the box. Referee David Coote initially awarded the visitors a free-kick but despite multiple camera angles appearing inconclusive his decision was overturned - allowing Danny Ings to score from the spot.\n\"It is just consistency, I don't think there is any,\" said March. \"It is just random decisions that I don't think the people who play football would give, but I don't want to say much.\"\nIn a statement the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) said the referee review area was not used in this case as it was a \"factual decision\".\nFormer Blackburn and Celtic forward Chris Sutton called it a \"disgraceful\" decision on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nHowever, Seagulls boss Graham Potter played the incident down in his post-match comments and Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said the match officials had made a \"relatively clear\" decision.\nBrighton had impressed in the early stages of an entertaining contest and deservedly went ahead when Pascal Gross converted a penalty after a handball from Saints captain James Ward-Prowse.\nWard-Prowse made amends with a pinpoint delivery from a corner that saw Jannik Vestergaard equalise with a powerful header into the top-left corner.\nIngs, returning after a month out with a knee injury and on as half-time substitute, completed Southampton's comeback to lift them up to fifth in the table. Brighton stay 16th.\nWhat do fans think of VAR?\nFollow reaction as Southampton win at Brighton\nHow Hasenhuttl came to 'revolutionise' Southampton\nIngs helps Saints to up-tempo finish\nWhile Hasenhuttl is an accomplished pianist and has reportedly performed\n, external\nin front of his players, he will have been frustrated by the off-tune showing he saw from them during the first period.\nBrighton's high pressing saw Saints cough up possession cheaply on the edge of their own penalty area on several occasions.\nAnd as they struggled to play out from the back there was a noticeable absence of rhythm to their play.\nWhen Danish defender Vestergaard levelled the scores, he did so with Southampton's first effort on target in the game.\nHowever, the half-time introduction of Ings, on for Moussa Djenepo, galvanised the visitors and added some sparkle to their attacking play.\nThe England forward's deft touch brilliantly released Stuart Armstrong, as Theo Walcott went close with a curling effort from 20 yards.\nHis ball juggling skills and quick thinking also provided fellow substitute Nathan Redmond with a superb chance and he supplied the coup de grace from 12 yards, keeping his composure following a lengthy delay.\nUnfortunate Brighton\nOne of the biggest criticisms levelled at Brighton is that they do not reap the rewards their fluent football deserves, particularly in attack.\nPrior to kick-off only strugglers Sheffield United, Burnley and sixth-placed Manchester United had scored fewer goals at home than the Seagulls this term.\nAnd that, plus another failing - their weakness defending set-pieces - ensured their winless start on their own patch continued.\nDanny Welbeck, Lewis Dunk and Gross all had good opportunities to ensure Potter's side went into the interval with a healthy lead.\nInstead they found themselves level after allowing the tallest player on the pitch a free run to connect with Ward-Prowse's corner.\nOnly Leicester (seven) have now conceded more set-piece goals (apart from penalties) in the Premier League this season than Brighton (six).\nAnd while Aaron Connolly saw his close-range effort saved with the score at 1-1, the manner of their defeat appeared to add an element of misfortune to their own shortcomings.\nMissed out on the weekend's Premier League action? All the goals and highlights are streaming now\n'It didn't seem so clear and obvious' - what they said\nBrighton boss Graham Potter, on the late penalty decision, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I think the first challenge is probably outside the box and whether there was another challenge inside the box that is what they are trying to work out.\n\"It didn't seem so clear and obvious. If they think that is what it is then we have to accept it.\n\"The sense was it was going to be outside the box. Things surprise you.\"\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Sport: \"With the ball I didn't think we played our best game. It was slippery on the pitch, every player had problems. Then it is a lot of risk when you try to build up, make the passes on the ground.\n\"The crowd was also there, for the players a little but more stress. In the end it was a brilliant penalty by Danny Ings. A win like this last season, I don't think we had a lot of. It's good to see.\n\"I didn't see the first penalty. For the second one, that is why we have VAR, especially when it is about decisions if it is in or not then you need this. I think it was clear inside the box. It is not nice to get a penalty against you but the decision from what I have seen was relatively clear.\n\"We have everybody fit now, we are going into a very tense period of the season and we need every player.\"\nSouthampton end Monday-night Blues\nBrighton have gone 10 Premier League games without a win at home (D4 L6), their longest run without a victory on home soil in the league since a run of 12 in the fourth tier, ending in February 1998.\nSouthampton won a Monday Premier League game for the first time in their past 15 attempts (D7 L7).\nOnly Chelsea (eight) have scored more Premier League goals from set-piece situations (excl. pens) than Southampton this season (seven).\nPascal Gross has been directly involved in 31 Premier League goals for Brighton, more than any other current player (14 goals, 17 assists).\nSouthampton defender Jannik Vestergaard has netted three goals in his past seven Premier League appearances, after managing just one in his previous 45.\nJames Ward-Prowse registered his 25th Premier League assist for Southampton, a haul bettered by only three players (Le Tissier 63, Tadic 27, Dodd 26).\nDanny Ings is the first Southampton player to score in four consecutive away Premier League appearances since Rickie Lambert in January 2013.\nSolly March chalked up his 100th Premier League appearance for Brighton, just the fifth player to hit that milestone for the club (also Ryan, Dunk, Gross and Propper).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to Leicester for their next Premier League match on Sunday, 13 December (19:15 GMT).\nSouthampton host struggling Sheffield United earlier on the same day (12:00 GMT) in their next Premier League match.\nGavin & Stacey Christmas Special: Get into the festive spirit with our favourite family\nPeaky Blinders Box Set: Relive the rise of the Shelbys from the very beginning"

        "article_text": "Leeds 1-2 West Ham: David Moyes angry at VAR despite Angelo Ogbonna winner\nWest Ham boss David Moyes said the video assistant referee is making \"terrible decisions\" in the Premier League, despite seeing his side fight back to beat Leeds and move up to fifth.\nLeeds had gone in front when Mateusz Klich converted a twice-taken sixth-minute penalty, with VAR ordering the retake after ruling keeper Lukasz Fabianski had stepped off his goalline.\nHowever, the visitors - who had won just once on the previous 26 occasions when they had conceded first in a Premier League game - levelled when Illan Meslier failed to stop Tomas Soucek's soft header and won it with 10 minutes to go through Angelo Ogbonna's header.\n\"There are some terrible decisions that are happening at the moment,\" Moyes said.\n\"Whoever saw it must have had [Fabianski's foot] X-rayed. The decision was rubbish.\n\"It was a definite penalty. I was angry. I am still angry. This is the way football has gone.\n\"I think his heel is on the line. You need to have a microscope to see it. Surely the benefit should go to the goalkeeper, he has made the save. The game continued for 15 seconds and carried on. I am disappointed and angry with it.\"\nListen to the Football Daily podcast\nRelive West Ham's win over Leeds\nIn an entertaining game where both sides created numerous chances, Meslier atoned for his error in the equaliser when he superbly kept out a second-half header from Fabian Balbuena an saved Sebastien Haller's overhead kick.\nAfter Ogbonna rose at the far post to power home Aaron Creswell's inviting free-kick for what proved the winner, Leeds wasted their best chance to level when Rodrigo headed straight at Lukasz Fabianski from six yards.\nWhile the Hammers - who registered their first victory at Elland Road in 20 years - have now won four games out of five and seem destined for a good season under manager David Moyes, Leeds continue to flatter to deceive, having now collected eight points from the past nine games and just one from their past four on home soil.\nAlthough their adventurous approach is admirable, they keep getting caught out by wise opposition and have conceded seven goals from set-pieces this season, the joint highest in the league with Leicester City.\n\"No mysteries to the things we have to do,\" said Bielsa.\n\"The set-pieces can be perfected by continuously training, to reproduce what happens in the game in training sessions. We will continue insisting on this until we solve the problem.\"\nVAR makes its mark again\nIt seems a long time ago now when debate raged over the introduction of video technology into football and one of the arguments against it was that there would be nothing left to talk about.\nFabianski and Hammers skipper Declan Rice had plenty to talk about with referee Michael Oliver as they railed against the decision to let Klich have a second go at beating his Poland team-mate.\nIn fairness, goalkeepers on their line at penalties is one of those matter-of-fact calls at which the video assistant referee should excel. Fabianski was - marginally - off his line when Klich stepped up the first time and never went back.\nIn that sense, VAR Jarred Gillett got it right.\nThe issue here was how long it took. From the initial spot-kick being awarded to the second one being despatched, four minutes elapsed. Yet the total stoppage-time at the end of that opening period was only two minutes.\nLittle did they know it at the time but it was to mark the high point of Leeds' night.\nWhile the table still shows a fairly sizeable gap to the group of four teams in the thick of the relegation fight, Christmas games against Burnley and West Brom need to be won if Leeds are not to end up in trouble.\nRice edges England battle\nEven though Elland Road is his local Premier League ground, England boss Gareth Southgate gave this game a miss.\nIt was a shame really because he would have seen two of his less heralded potential Euro 2020 candidates facing each other.\nDeclan Rice and Kalvin Phillips were rarely in the same area so it could not be termed a head-to-head battle but it was interesting to see how both went about the defensive screening role they were asked to fulfil.\nAs the West Ham formation was less fluid and Phillips' role in the Leeds side was clear, it was easier to watch the Yorkshireman go about his work as he tried to shut down Said Benrahma on his first start for the Hammers.\nGiven the amount of time he had the ball and the fact Phillips got tighter to him after half-time, the assumption would be that Marcelo Bielsa wasn't entirely happy with the opening period.\nHe did rob Haller in the centre of the pitch to launch one attack and embarked on a 30-yard dash to pressurise Ogbonna close to the Hammers box. But it wasn't until the midway point of the second half, when he got forward far enough to send a shot at the Hammers goal which was probably going wide before Fabianski pushed it away for a corner, that Phillips was anything like an offensive threat.\nAt one West Ham throw-in, Phillips was the deepest defender, almost like a quarterback lining up a pass - but without having the ball.\nIn contrast, Rice had more opportunity to get forward as he had the insurance of Soucek alongside him. There was also more cover in defence, which meant Rice had greater opportunity to use his excellent passing range.\nIt is clear Rice's unfussy approach is well suited to life at the top end of the Premier League but Moyes must hope his captain hangs around for a bit because the Scot has built a very effective team, very much in the mould of the one he created at Everton.\nJose Mourinho has already likened Soucek to Marouane Fellaini. If so, then Cresswell's set-piece delivery is akin to that of another stalwart of Moyes' Goodison Park era, Leighton Baines.\nHis free-kick to the far post screamed for someone to get on the end of it. Ogbonna obliged with his first Premier League goal away from London Stadium in three years.\nWhat's next?\nLeeds' next game is also at Elland Road, against Newcastle on Wednesday (18:00 GMT). West Ham entertain Crystal Palace in a London derby on the same night (20:00).\nHome discomforts for Leeds - the stats\nLeeds have lost both of their past two league games despite scoring the first goal in each; it's the first time they have lost despite opening the scoring in back-to-back Premier League games.\nWest Ham have earned 20 points from their 12 league games this season (W6 D2 L4); only in 2015-16 have they hit the 20-point mark sooner in a Premier League campaign (10 games).\nLeeds suffered their third defeat in six home Premier League games this season (W1 D2), as many as they suffered in 23 Championship matches at Elland Road in the entirety of 2019-20 (W15 D5 L3).\nNo side has scored more set-piece goals (excluding penalties) than West Ham United (eight, level with Chelsea) in this season's Premier League, while no side has conceded more from such situations than Leeds United (seven, level with Leicester City).\nWest Ham boss David Moyes has won four of his five Premier League matches against Leeds (D1); he has faced the Whites more without suffering defeat than any other opponent in the competition, while his 80% win ratio against them is his highest of all sides he has faced at least four times in the division.\nMateusz Klich has scored Leeds' past three league penalties; the Whites had only scored three of their previous eight such penalties before this.\nSince his Premier League debut in February, only Harry Kane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin (both four) have more headed goals in the competition than West Ham's Tomas Soucek (three). Four of his six goals in the division have come from corners.\nAll six of Angelo Ogbonna's Premier League goals for West Ham have been from set-plays (five corners, one free-kick).\nThe Players Podcast: Lionesses legend Kelly Smith on what is takes to reach the top\nTailenders: England's T20 series reviewed and will Burnley get a Jimmy Anderson street?"

We played good. In the first half it was an intense game and both teams were tight. [There were] too many fouls, it did not flow.\n\"In the second it was better. We controlled the game and had clear chances. We try to keep on growing on these aspects and be more clinical.\"\nOn Silva's debut: \"He worked well. He was linking with team-mates and had good chances. He worked hard. The idea to make a player grow is to help him and support him during competition.\"\nOn scoring goals without Jimenez: \"It is something we have to do as a team - find solutions. But today we had [chances] - let's work now on the final touch.\"\nVilla manager Smith: \"It's always the best way, to leave it late, because there's less chance of them coming back. We deserved a point but kept competing and got the win.\n\"I thought we started both halves the better team. Wolves had a couple of good spells where our goalkeeper's made some really good saves, but to go down to 10 men and keep playing as we did and win the penalty was excellent. To come here and get a clean sheet and a win is excellent.\n\"I am pleased with the start we've had. There was only the Leeds game [4-0 defeat] that we deserved to get beaten this season. We're 10 games in and if you deserve to get something out of nine, you are doing well.\"\nVilla like leaving it late - the stats\nEl Ghazi's goal was Aston Villa's fourth stoppage-time winner in the Premier League since the start of last season, twice as many as any other side.\nSince the start of 2019-20, Villa have seen 10 opposition players sent off in the Premier League, two more than any other team.\nThere were 38 fouls conceded in this match (23 Wolves, 15 Aston Villa), the most of any top-flight game this season.\nThis was Villa boss Smith's 500th game as a manager (Walsall 260, Brentford 143, Aston Villa 97), and his 182nd victory (168 defeats and 150 draws).\nAt 18 years 146 days old, Silva became the second-youngest player to start a Premier League game for Wolves after Anthony Forde against Arsenal in December 2011 (18 years 41ddays).\nRamsey (19 years 198 days) became the youngest player to make his first start for Villa in the top flight since Isaiah Osbourne against Liverpool in October 2006 (18 years 357 days).\nAdama Traore is without a goal or assist in 19 league matches, after racking up nine goal involvements in his previous 19.\nWhat's next?\nJimenez hopes to be watching from the stands as Wolves host Chelsea on Tuesday (18:00 GMT), before visiting Burnley the following Monday (17:30).\nVilla welcome Burnley on Thursday (18:00), then go to West Brom for another local derby next Sunday (19:15).\nThe Royle Family box set: Revisit all the laughs from Jim and Barbara's front room\nChilling Icelandic crime drama: The Valhalla Murders is streaming now"

        "article_text": "Newcastle 2-1 West Brom: Dwight Gayle heaps misery on Baggies\nDwight Gayle scored the winner on his first appearance of the season as Newcastle returned from a coronavirus-enforced absence to heap more misery on struggling West Bromwich Albion.\nGayle, who was injured during pre-season, came off the bench to find the net with a superb header eight minutes from time at St James' Park on Saturday.\nThe Magpies, playing for the first time in more than two weeks, were given the lead after just 20 seconds by Miguel Almiron.\nWest Brom's improvement after half-time was rewarded by Darnell Furlong's excellent equaliser.\nBut Gayle's strike against the club where he once spent time on loan lifted Newcastle to 11th in the Premier League table, at least for the time being, while West Brom remain 19th.\nWith his side having been beaten in five of their past six games, Baggies boss Slaven Bilic said \"I don't get those signals or that information\" when asked if his position is under threat.\n\"It's about the result of course, but today we showed again that we are there in the game to the end,\" he added.\n\"We showed the character and the mentality and the quality to some degree, and the team is very much alive.\"\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nGayle and Newcastle's successful return\nNewcastle's training ground was closed for a week after a Covid-19 outbreak which caused their game against Aston Villa to be postponed.\nThe Magpies only returned to training on Tuesday, with manager Steve Bruce saying that, as of Monday, he had huge doubts over how many players he would have available for this fixture.\nAs it turned out, Bruce was only missing two players that started in the win at Crystal Palace last time out, though the absence of both Federico Fernandez and Javier Manquillo left a defensive shortage that usual midfielder Isaac Hayden filled with aplomb.\nAfter their enforced lay-off, the hosts flew out of the blocks through Almiron's rapid strike and continued to have the better of the first half, posing a constant threat on the break.\nHowever, West Brom grew into the game at the end of the opening 45 minutes, improved further after a half-time rejig and were rewarded with Furlong's equaliser.\nPushed back, Newcastle introduced Gayle to make his return from a knee injury suffered in a pre-season friendly against Crewe.\nHe immediately saw a header cleared off the line by Matt Phillips, but another header, from a wonderful cross supplied by fellow substitute Jacob Murphy, left Sam Johnstone with no chance.\n\"I can't give enough credit to the players and the staff who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes over the last couple of weeks, and certainly the medical department whose decision to shut us down was spot on,\" said Bruce.\n\"We've got a good couple of wins and a huge month coming up and we could do with a fully fit squad, so let's brush it down and try not to get carried away yet - but I couldn't be more pleased.\"\nWest Brom empty handed again\nWest Brom arrived in the north-east of England with only one away point all season, a single win in the Premier League and on the back of a capitulation on being reduced to 10 men in the 5-1 defeat by Crystal Palace last weekend.\nIf manager Bilic was under pressure and in need of a reaction from his players, the early signs were not promising.\nFrom a West Brom kick-off, a long ball saw Branislav Ivanovic outmuscled by Callum Wilson, with Joelinton collecting the ball to square for the free Almiron, who finished from an angle.\nThe Baggies were disjointed and toothless, missing the guile of Matheus Pereira, who was beginning his suspension for last week's red card.\nAfter two goals in the past two weeks, Conor Gallagher kickstarted West Brom before Bilic's half-time intervention breathed life into his team. The experienced Charlie Austin was introduced to provide a threat up front, while Phillips was released to play further forward.\nIt was Phillips' deep cross that provided the goal, Furlong energetically nipping in ahead of the dithering Jamaal Lewis to poke a smart finish inside the post. For Furlong, it was a first Premier League goal some 24 years after father Paul last scored in the top flight.\nWest Brom were dominant, Newcastle pushed back - yet the visitors could not create another telling opening.\nAnd just as Bilic changed the game with his substitutions, so too did Bruce with the decisive introduction of Gayle.\n\"It was a game of little margins in the end,\" said Bilic. \"They scored incredibly early from a situation from which we had to do better, and after that their physicality and quality up front was better than ours.\n\"But in the second half it was more a change of bravery and mentality, and we were good - we scored the goal but we didn't create enough clear-cut chances and again we conceded a goal that we have to stop.\"\nLeaky Baggies - the stats\nNewcastle have won three of their past five Premier League home games, one more than they had in their previous 11 at St James' Park.\nWest Brom have become the first team to concede 25 goals in the Premier League this season, while the Baggies have picked up just one point from their six away games so far.\nSome 57% of Newcastle's league goals this term have come in the final 15 minutes of games (eight out of 14) - the highest ratio in the competition.\nAlmiron's opener after 20 seconds was Newcastle's second fastest Premier League goal after Alan Shearer netted 10 seconds into a game against Manchester City in January 2003.\nSince joining West Brom before the 2016-17 season, Phillips has been involved in more league goals for the Baggies than any other player (42 - 18 goals, 24 assists).\nNewcastle's Joelinton has been involved in three goals in his past two league matches (one goal, two assists) - just one fewer than he had in his previous 46 combined in the competition (two goals, two assists).\nNewcastle's Jacob Murphy has now provided one assist in each of his three Premier League campaigns, setting up Gayle's winner just 118 seconds after coming on as a substitute.\nWhat's next?\nThings do not get any easier for West Brom, with their next engagement a trip to Manchester City on Tuesday (20:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "Manchester United 0-0 Manchester City: Derby ends in stalemate at Old Trafford\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer said Manchester United displayed the \"best performance we have had\" in a derby during his tenure as his side played out a dismal stalemate behind closed doors against Manchester City at Old Trafford.\nIn a game devoid of quality and excitement, neither side were able to carve out the opportunity that could make a difference amid the eerie silence of the so-called 'Theatre Of Dreams'.\nGabriel Jesus was off target and Riyad Mahrez brought a routine save from David de Gea with City's best first-half chances while Scott McTominay was agonisingly inches away from Victor Lindelof's flick as United sought the breakthrough.\nUnited defeated City three times in four meetings last season, including a league double over their rivals.\n\"Possession on the ball, control (was better),\" said Solskjaer. \"Of course I think last year at the Etihad we could have blown them away from the 10th to the 25th minute. We could have scored four goals.\n\"Some unbelievable counter-attacking football, but we had about 30% possession and that second half we were hanging on.\n\"You felt there were fewer moments to hang on today and we had more of the ball.\n\"Maybe that's because they had more respect for us as well. I don't know, but I'd like to think we've developed that side of it.\n\"And then today we just didn't have enough to get those counter-attacks that we have.\"\nUnited thought they had a second-half penalty when Kyle Walker fouled Marcus Rashford but the decision was overturned as VAR revealed the United striker was offside.\nIt led to an unsatisfactory conclusion for both sides, leaving United seventh in the Premier League and City a place below them.\nFollow the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nUnited respond to Champions League exit\nManchester United needed some sort of response after the despair and disappointment of their Champions League exit following the loss against RB Leipzig - defeat was not an option.\nAnd that goal, at least, was achieved - but it was achieved in a real eyesore of a game and was only the flimsiest of straws that under-pressure boss Solskjaer and United could clutch at.\nPaul Pogba was restored to the starting line-up to little or no effect but it would be unfair to single out the midfielder who seems permanently unsettled at Old Trafford, at least according to agent Mino Raiola, because barely anyone had a positive impact on a shocking spectacle.\nDe Gea was under the microscope after another expensive error in Germany but he, like City counterpart Ederson, had a quiet night.\nHe completed two straightforward saves from Mahrez's first-half effort and Rodri's injury-time shot but other than that was largely unemployed.\nSolskjaer added: \"Tactically we knew they were going to give us some problems but defensively we were excellent. I'm delighted with the defensive shape.\n\"With the ball we didn't create as much as we wanted to. They probably had the bigger moments in open play, but everyone should be happy with a draw.\"\nIt was that sort of game - although once more United's \u00a340m summer signing from Ajax Donny van de Beek was left to watch on from the bench perhaps wondering what he has to do to get a start.\nStones excels as City stay solid\nManchester City kept their sixth successive clean sheet since losing at Tottenham in November and it was a good night for John Stones in front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate.\nThe 26-year-old, who played in England's run to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals in Russia, has quietly rebuilt his form and confidence in the past few weeks and was impressive once again as United were kept at bay with relative ease.\nStones was comfortable on the ball but also did what he had to do when the straightforward defensive work was required as he continued the rehabilitation after his career looked to have stalled.\nCity manager Pep Guardiola showed faith to select Stones ahead of Aymeric Laporte, a sign of how satisfied he is with his form, and the defender did not let him down.\nAnd while it is early days and Stones still has much work to do, the manner of his performance will not have gone unnoticed by Southgate, who has left Stones out of recent England squads but has an important vacancy to fill after the serious injury to Liverpool's Joe Gomez.\nThis was a game which left few satisfied - but Stones will certainly be one of them.\nGuardiola said: \"They started well after we finished the first half well.\n\"We created three or four clear chances, you cannot expect many against a team like United and it was a good point in the end - it will be a good point in the future.\n\"United is always a strong team, this is Old Trafford and they are out of the Champions League. They score when they can run but we controlled them really well.\"\nWhy John Stones can still save his Man City career - Joleon Lescott analysis\nUnited continue to stifle Sterling - the stats\nManchester United are unbeaten against Manchester City in three games in all competitions (W2 D1), their best run without defeat against their derby rivals since March 2016.\nUnited have kept three consecutive clean sheets against City for the first time since a run of four in October 1995.\nThis was just the fifth goalless draw between the Manchester sides in 47 Premier League meetings, with three of them coming in the past 11 clashes.\nUnited have failed to score in three home league games this season - one more than in the whole of last season.\nThree of the past four instances of City mustering fewer than 10 shots in a single Premier League away game have come at Old Trafford.\nRaheem Sterling extended his run of never scoring against Manchester United to 17 Premier League games, over 10 more games than he has faced any other side in the competition without a goal.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United visit Sheffield United on Thursday (20:00 GMT) before hosting Leeds on Sunday (16:30).\nManchester City are at home to West Brom on Tuesday (20:00) then travel to Southampton on Saturday (15:00).\nThe Royle Family box set: Revisit all the laughs from Jim and Barbara's front room\nChilling Icelandic crime drama: The Valhalla Murders is streaming now"

But, wearing the captain's armband, he took his opportunity to impress and teed up efforts for Richarlison and Mina, who were both wasteful.\nCalvert-Lewin, who was a menace on the counter-attack, also won a second penalty when he was caught by Ben Chilwell, but the England striker was ruled offside in the build-up.\nEverton's problem in recent games has been their defending, which has not been helped by injuries to captain Seamus Coleman and Lucas Digne. Against Chelsea, their back four was comprised solely of centre-backs.\nBut after a mixed campaign, Pickford showed the watching supporters his capabilities by producing several saves in quick succession to deny James twice and Kurt Zouma.\nThat seemed to boost the fans and the defence, who were under pressure for much of the second half and held out for a first clean sheet since the opening weekend of the season.\nIt was a welcome filip for former Chelsea manager Ancelotti, who got a measure of revenge for a crushing defeat last season.\n\"We needed this performance and the points after a difficult period,\" the Italian added. \"We lost a little of bit of our confidence, a bit of our attitude.\n\"Tonight we won for the spirit, not the quality of the play, we didn't have the ball a lot, but we defended really well.\"\nEverton majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri increases investment to \u00a3400m\nMendy error proves costly for lacklustre Chelsea\nChelsea took time to integrate their summer signings, which topped \u00a3200m, but after their recent form, it looks as though they have started to click.\nChief among them has been Mendy, who replaced the often hapless Kepa Arrizabalaga in goal and provided much-needed assurance behind a newly-formed back four.\nSo it was a genuine surprise when his reckless challenge on Calvert-Lewin led to Everton's opening goal.\nIn the Senegalese's defence, he had just recovered from a fall moments earlier when he landed heavily and collided with James as he collected a deep free-kick.\nBut after conceding two goals in seven Premier League games prior to this match, it was still an uncharacteristic error and summed up Chelsea's evening.\nLampard said it provided a dose of reality to those who say his side can win the league.\n\"It is a long season and these people talking about us winning the league with the best squad, it is ridiculous,\" he said.\n\"You have to look at the teams winning it the last three or four years, they have wingers, strikers scoring 30 or 40 goals. There are squads who have won leagues and Champions Leagues, and we are clearly not that.\"\nAfter a methodical start, going behind kicked Chelsea into gear, with James chief among those attempting to score an equaliser.\nHis free-kick was stopped by Pickford, and then he watched in disbelief as his low shot against the post skidded across goal.\nFor all Chelsea's attacking talents, that was as close as Lampard's side came to scoring, with Mount smacking the outside of the frame with a late effort.\nOlivier Giroud failed to continue his recent fine form and at times was left isolated by team-mates Kai Havertz and Timo Werner.\nIt was a game where Chelsea missed the spark of injured wingers Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech.\nYet, given only Liverpool have scored more than Chelsea's 25 league goals this season, the fact they did not register a shot on target after Zouma's effort in the 28th minute will be of disappointment to Lampard.\n\"We have players who are new to the Premier League and young, so we are in a position where nights like this may happen,\" the Chelsea boss added. \"I don't like them but that's the challenge for us, to make sure we bounce back.\"\nKai Havertz: Chelsea winger says he was hit 'very hard' by Covid-19\nWhat next?\nEverton travel to face Leicester on Wednesday (18:00 GMT) while Chelsea have an away trip at Wolves on Tuesday (18:00).\nEverton have won three consecutive Premier League games against Chelsea for just the second time (also Feb 2010-Feb 2012).\nNo possession, no problem for Everton - match stas\nChelsea suffered their first Premier League away defeat of the season (W3 D2), with their last two defeats on the road coming on Merseyside (also 3-5 v Liverpool in July).\nEverton had 28% possession in this match, their lowest on record in a single Premier League match they went on to win (since 2003-04).\nGylfi Sigurdsson's penalty was his first Premier League goal in 17 games for Everton, since netting against Leicester in July.\nThis was Chelsea boss Frank Lampard's second defeat in 12 managerial games against managers he'd previously played for in all competitions (W6 D4), with the other coming against Manuel Pellegrini's West Ham last season (0-1).\nThe Royle Family box set: Revisit all the laughs from Jim and Barbara's front room\nChilling Icelandic crime drama: The Valhalla Murders is streaming now"

        "article_text": "Southampton 3-0 Sheffield United: Saints into Premier League top four\nSouthampton moved into the Premier League's top four by sweeping aside bottom club Sheffield United.\nChe Adams pounced in the box to poke in the opener, Stuart Armstrong scored a deflected second, and Nathan Redmond came off the bench to add a delightful third.\nThe season is only 12 games old, but Sheffield United's situation is looking increasingly dire. They still have just one point and will be at least six points from safety regardless of Sunday's other results.\nNo team in the Premier League era has had so few points at this stage of the season and gone on to avoid relegation.\nLive coverage of Sunday's Premier League games\nLawro's predictions v Lonely The Brave's Mo Edgeley\nHigh-flying Saints\nIn such a lofty position with almost a third of the season completed, and now with only one defeat in their past 10 games, it is right to consider what this accomplished Southampton team could achieve this term.\nTheir defence is organised, their midfield a combination of hard-working and creative, while front two Adams and Danny Ings are among the most potent attacking forces in the league.\nBar a brief period of Blades pressure at the beginning of the second half, when imposing centre-halves Jan Bednarek and Jannik Vertergaard were made to work hard, Saints controlled this game.\nOriel Romeu patrolled in front of the defence, James Ward-Prowse constantly teased with his delivery from set-pieces and Adams was a nuisance to the visiting back line.\nGiven their superiority, particularly in the first half, Southampton perhaps could have won by more, and it is true they had a helping hand for their first two goals.\nThe first came from some weak Sheffield United defending of a Ward-Prowse free-kick. Bednarek leapt with barely a challenge and, when the ball looped off his shoulder, former Blade Adams nipped in to hook past Aaron Ramsdale.\nAfter riding the wave of United pressure, Saints swept forward for the second. Ings, making his first start since the beginning of November after a knee injury, cut in from the left to feed Armstrong, whose shot took a wicked deflection to wrong-foot Ramsdale.\nWith the lead doubled, relaxation came over the 2,000 fans returning to St Mary's, and Redmond's sweet curler after a one-two with Romeu was no more than Saints deserved.\n\"It was a job very well done,\" said Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl. \"It was not as easy as it looked, especially against a team that had nothing to lose and sits very deep.\n\"It couldn't be better to have the fans back today, to be honest. It was very emotional, you can celebrate with them when for months we haven't seen them.\n\"You could feel how much they enjoyed it, and watching us play good football. Hopefully we'll come through this very tough time and more and more people should come to see us play.\"\nBlunt Blades\nIf they were not already, Sheffield United are in severe danger of being cut adrift at the bottom of the table. Their winless run, going back to the end of last season, now stands at 15 games. Fourteen of those have been defeats.\nOn top of that, the impotency of a return of just five goals this term is matched only by Burnley.\nManager Chris Wilder shuffled his pack in search of a way to ignite his team. At 38 years 118 days, Phil Jagielka became the oldest outfield player to feature in the top flight this season. Billy Sharp started and was one of five different forwards to feature at some point in the game. Ethan Ampadu and Enda Stevens both returned from injury.\nThere was no obvious improvement in a first half during which the Blades lacked ambition and barely landed a glove on their hosts. Their timid approach was typified by the defending for Southampton's opener.\nThey at least found some thrust after the break, stretching the home defence and asking questions from a series of corners - John Egan headed over with a good connection from John Fleck's delivery.\nHowever, Saints' second goal was a mortal blow from which there was never likely to be a recovery, and the Blades must find an instant and drastic turnaround if they are not to be bottom at Christmas.\n\"They were the better side today,\" said Wilder. \"You can't afford to make that mistake for the first goal and when an opportunity comes you have to take it, and we didn't.\n\"Both those things in the first half set it up for a really difficult afternoon for us.\n\"I get on with my job. I get up in the morning, have a shower, come in bright and do my work to the best of my ability. And that's what we all do.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton look to continue their good form at Arsenal on Wednesday (18:00 GMT), while Sheffield United will once again look for a first win when they host Manchester United on Thursday (20:00).\nThe stats\nSheffield United are only the fourth side in the top four tiers of English football to have no more than one point from their opening 12 league games of a season, after Manchester United in 1930-31 (zero in the top flight), New Brighton in 1931-32 (one in the Third Division North) and Newport County in 1970-71 (one in the fourth tier).\nSouthampton have earned 23 points in this season's Premier League - only in 2014-15 have they had more after their opening 12 matches of a campaign in the competition (26).\nThe Blades are the seventh side to lose their opening six away games to a Premier League season, and the first since Crystal Palace in 2017-18.\nSheffield United attempted just 74 passes in the first half against Southampton; the fewest by a team in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game since February 2007, which was also the Blades (67 v Blackburn).\nSouthampton have won four of their six league games at St Mary's this season - it took them until their 14th home league match last season to earn their fourth home victory. Indeed, this was the Saints' biggest home league win since November 2017, when they beat Everton 4-1 under Mauricio Pellegrino.\nAdams has scored four goals in Southampton's 12 league games this season, as many as he scored in 30 Premier League appearances in 2019-20. All eight of his goals in the division have come since June when the competition resumed post-lockdown.\nArmstrong is one of three players to have scored four or more Premier League goals from outside the box in 2020. The other two are Southampton players - Ings with five and Ward-Prowse with four.\nJagielka was the oldest English outfield player to start a Premier League match since Paul Scholes for Manchester United against Swansea in May 2013 (38 years 177 days).\nMissed all the action from the Manchester derby and Saturday's goals?

The ones that win, the ones that draw and the ones that lose.\n\"At half-time, I told the players exactly the opposite that we did in the second half, but if they didn't, it was because they couldn't do it.\n\"It was because they were not able to do it. I give credit to Palace for that.\"\nPlayers not able to execute game plan today - Mourinho\nSpaniard Guaita had kept Spurs at bay with three excellent stops to deny Tanguy Ndombele, Sergio Reguilon and Kane before being caught out by the England captain's long-range swerving attempt.\nBut Palace, who hit the post through Eze, deservedly equalised through Schlupp before a dramatic ending which saw Spurs substitute Ben Davies hit the bar, while Guaita made a spectacular save to keep out a free-kick from Eric Dier.\nReaction from Selhurst Park plus Premier League latest\nNo way to keep all Spurs players happy - Mourinho\nSpurs frustrated by Guaita\nTottenham's 22nd competitive game of 2020-21 looked for so long as though it was going to be a case of job done ahead of their biggest test of the season in midweek.\nBut Jose Mourinho's side were frustrated by Guaita, whose action at the death to deny Dier was one of the finest saves on the Premier League stage this season.\nDier's set-piece appeared to be heading for the net until the Palace keeper flung himself across his line to divert it away with one hand.\nDespite stretching their unbeaten league run to 11 matches, this will feel like two points dropped for the visitors.\nIn a highly competitive London derby, they had looked every bit a team at the top of the table as Guaita got down to deny Ndombele from close range before tipping over Reguilon's rasping attempt and then stopping Kane's header all in the space of a few first-half minutes.\nKane's ninth league goal, after another assist by Son Heung-min, was a gift, Guaita misjudging his shot and failing to make what should have been a routine save.\nPalace responded well but looked set to end the game without any reward for their endeavour until Schlupp pounced after Lloris' error - the first goal Spurs have conceded in the Premier League since the start of November.\nGutsy point for battling Palace\nThis was a thoroughly deserved point for Palace who marked the return of fans to Selhurst Park with a gutsy performance full of character.\nEven before they fell behind, Wilfried Zaha forced Lloris into a good save while, shortly before half-time, the impressive Eze beat the Spurs keeper only for his attempt to hit the post.\nPalace had 16 attempts in total, five of which landed on target, while boss Roy Hodgson said his side's second-half performance \"was of top-drawer quality\".\nChristian Benteke, fresh from scoring two in the 5-1 demolition of West Brom in the previous game, had two headed chances before Schlupp raced away to celebrate with supporters after making it 1-1.\nGuaita's save at the end to deny Dier raised the roof. He will not want to see Kane's goal again but the keeper bounced back to produce a string of impressive stops when Spurs threatened.\n'The fans were great' - what they said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"We were threatening to get the equaliser; it came quite late but it gave us an awful lot of pleasure and I thought we deserved it as well.\n\"The supporters were great. I told the players it's not what they can give us, it's what we can give them.\n\"They got behind us and appreciated it and luckily we welcomed them back on a good day.\"\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho: \"We can look at it in two different perspectives. We had one more point than three hours ago but at the same time you play to win three points.\n\"If I look to the game, I would split the first half where the feeling is we have to win it, so we lost two points - but then comes 30 minutes in the second half where they deserved to get the equaliser and you accept it because it's fair.\n\"Then, in the last 15 minutes we could have won it.\"\nUnbeaten away run continues - the stats\nDespite surrendering their lead in the second half, Spurs are unbeaten in their last nine away games in the Premier League (W5 D4), their longest such run since April 2018 (also nine).\nSpurs duo Harry Kane and Son Heung-min have now combined for 12 goals in the Premier League this season - only Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton in 1994-95 have linked up for more in a single season in the competition (13).\nFollowing 1-1 draws in both of their meetings in 2020, Crystal Palace have avoided defeat in consecutive Premier League games against Spurs for the first time since the 2014-15 season.\nSpurs have only lost one of the 21 Premier League games in which they've opened the scoring under Jose Mourinho (W15 D5), with that lone defeat coming against Wolves back in March.\nSince Jose Mourinho's first game in charge of Spurs, Harry Kane has been directly involved in more goals in all competitions than any other Premier League player (43 - 29 goals, 14 assists).\nCrystal Palace midfielder Jeffrey Schlupp has scored in each of his last two Premier League appearances against Spurs.\nSpurs striker Harry Kane has scored five goals in seven Premier League away games at Selhurst Park, the joint-most of any visiting player against Crystal Palace at this venue, along with Jermain Defoe.\nWhat's next?\nThere's a full midweek programme in the Premier Leaguer and Palace make the trip across London to face West Ham on Wednesday (20:00 GMT), while Spurs are involved in a top-of-the-table showdown at Liverpool at the same time.\nMissed all the action from the Manchester derby and Saturday's goals?

        "article_text": "Fulham draw with Liverpool to deny Reds top spot\nLiverpool missed out on the chance to go top of the Premier League and were somewhat fortunate to come away with a draw from a game in which they were second best for large periods to an impressive Fulham.\nMohamed Salah earned them their point, firing a low penalty under home goalkeeper Alphonse Areola after Aboubakar Kamara leapt in the wall and blocked a Georginio Wijnaldum free-kick with his arm.\nBobby Decordova-Reid had given Fulham the lead during a first half that the home side dominated and would have scored more in, but for returning Reds goalkeeper Alisson.\nThe Brazilian, who had missed the last two games through injury, twice denied Ivan Cavaleiro with fine saves after the Cottagers forward had broken through the Liverpool defence.\nThe visitors also survived an early shout for a penalty, that required referee Andre Marriner to come to the touchline VAR monitor to assess Fabinho's challenge on Cavaleiro, which saw him make contact with both man and ball.\nThey were further hampered when Joel Matip failed to come out for the second half, joining what is already an extensive injury list that has at times this campaign included most of their first-choice back five.\nThey stuck at the task, though, and improved after the break, with Jordan Henderson drawing a superb save from Areola before Salah was given his opportunity to salvage a point with 11 minutes to go.\nWith fans allowed into Craven Cottage for the first time this season, the home side were cheered from the pitch in recognition of their sterling efforts, and they now have eight points, two clear of the bottom three.\nOn a weekend that also saw Chelsea, Tottenham and both Manchester clubs drop points, Liverpool will be disappointed that they failed to take advantage, although they remain level on points at the top with Spurs, behind the Londoners only on goal difference.\nLive text commentary of Fulham v Liverpool, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Lonely The Brave's Mo Edgeley\nImpressive Fulham rock sloppy Reds\nIt was always going to be a tough task for Liverpool to match their Herculean efforts from last season, which saw them dominate the competition to win the league at a canter.\nThey remain a potent side, as evidenced in recent demolitions of both Leicester and Wolves.\nBut there is also a frailty to the Reds this campaign, particularly in games away from home, in which they have now conceded 12 goals - a tally only surpassed by the struggling West Brom and Sheffield United - and failed to win in five.\nSome of this is down to the Reds' well-publicised injury list, which still includes first-choice centre-back pairing Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez, until today also contained Alisson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, and was added to when Joel Matip failed to emerge for the second half.\nOn top of that, they also have Thiago, James Milner, Naby Keita, Xherdan Shaqiri and Diogo Jota sidelined through injury, the latter confirmed to be out for at least six weeks by Klopp before kick-off.\nEven so, the XI named by Klopp should still have been a match for a Fulham side that had previously taken just seven points from their first 11 games.\nThat they did not is down to too many sloppy passes, too much hesitancy in defence and an inability to get the ball to their stellar front three with any accuracy or regularity.\nThey marginally improved on all counts after the break and began to find a rhythm more in keeping with their usual selves without regularly carving their opponents open.\nThe handball rule came to their aid and Salah does not miss from the spot.\nMost of the credit must go to the home side, who beat Leicester a couple of games ago, gave Manchester City more of a game than many in defeat at the Etihad last Saturday and were superior to the champions for much of the 90 minutes a week later.\nThey understandably dropped deeper as the game wore on and became less of an attacking threat and relied on Areola a couple of times to keep Klopp's side at bay.\nBut on the evidence of a first half full of energy and endeavour, their current league position belies their ability.\n'I feel a bit disappointed'\nFulham boss Scott Parker to BBC Sport: \"I feel a bit disappointed. The players do as well. It shows how far we've come.\n\"There were two different halves. The first half, we were every bit of what we needed - commitment, energy, desire, passion. We showed a real quality and caused Liverpool problems.\n\"The second half panned out like everyone expected. Overall I'm very pleased.\n\"We came out of the blocks flying today. We showed our quality. We can play. I thought we did that very well in the first half.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"In the first 30 minutes we were just not good. We could have lost the game in that period. After half an hour it was already better. The second half was good. We could have had more [goals].\n\"We are dealing with human beings and things like this happen.\n\"Yesterday all the teams that played in the Champions League had a tough one. It's crazy. Maybe this was the weekend we felt it a little bit.\n\"It doesn't help with the number of games that we have to play the same players. There was a push definitely - 100%.\n\"We move on. Tottenham is the next challenge.\"\nKlopp's Reds the kings of recovering points\nSince Jurgen Klopp's first game in charge in October 2015, Liverpool have recovered more points from losing positions (85) than any other side in the Premier League.\nLiverpool are without a win in five away league outings (D4 L1), drawing their last four in a row; it's their joint-longest winless run away from home in the Premier League under Klopp (also five in March 2017).\nHaving only earned four points from their opening nine league games this season (W1 D1 L7), Fulham have picked up four from their last three, against Leicester, Man City and Liverpool (W1 D1 L1).\nFulham are the first newly promoted club to avoid defeat in a Premier League game against Liverpool since Newcastle United in October 2017 (also a 1-1 draw), ending the Reds' 18-game winning run against such sides in the league.\nLiverpool have now scored each of their last 18 Premier League penalties, with Mohamed Salah converting 12 of those.\nSalah scored his fifth away Premier League goal of the season for Liverpool, more than he managed in the entirety of 2019-20 (4).\nSalah has been directly involved in 20 goals in 20 Premier League appearances against newly promoted clubs for Liverpool, scoring 12 and assisting a further eight.\nFulham's Bobby Decordova-Reid has scored in three consecutive home league appearances for the first time in his professional career.

When you give the red card away the game changes. I don't know what it is we have to do to score a goal.\"\nAsked if the red card was unacceptable, Arteta replied: \"Yes. In my opinion it is too much willingness to do well, to compete to do everything. We took it to the wrong side of it, when you step over the line you will get punished.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche told BBC Sport: \"Arsenal just got their feel in the game until the sending off, they responded well to that and had a couple of chances but then we calmed the game down and got ourselves the winner.\n\"In the modern game - it is so soft now, the modern game - it [the red] has to be given.\"\nWhat next?\nArsenal host high-flying Southampton on Wednesday (18:00 GMT), while Burnley travel to Aston Villa on Thursday (18:00).\nArteta's ill-disciplined Arsenal - the stats\nArsenal have equalled their worst top-flight run at home since December 1959, a sequence which also included defeat by Burnley.\nBurnley have claimed their first top-fight victory over Arsenal since September 1974, ending a 15-game winless run against the Gunners (D4 L11).\nArsenal's tally of 10 goals after 12 Premier League games is their lowest at this stage of a top-flight season since 1981-82 (8 goals).\nArsenal have received six Premier League red cards since Mikel Arteta's first game in charge in December 2019, double that of any other side in this time.\nSince Granit Xhaka's Premier League debut in August 2016, only Manchester City's Fernandinho (4) has received more red cards in the competition than the Swiss midfielder (3).\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang's own goal was the first time Arsenal have conceded via a set-piece this season, becoming the 20th and final team to do so.\nArsenal attempted 18 shots against Burnley, the most the Gunners have had in a home Premier League game without scoring since February 2016 (22 v Southampton).\nIn his 11th Premier League match against Arsenal, Burnley boss Sean Dyche recorded his very first win (W1 D1 L9), leaving Sheffield United (0/2) as the only one of the 29 teams he is yet to beat as a Premier League manager.\nMissed all the action from the Manchester derby and Saturday's goals?

        "article_text": "Leicester City 3-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: Three first-half goals send Foxes third\nJames Maddison scored twice as Leicester produced a relentless first-half display to beat Brighton and climb to third in the Premier League.\nThe 24-year-old struck twice before half-time, his second a sublime, curled finish into the top corner after he had slotted in from Jamie Vardy's blocked shot.\nVardy, making a record-equalling 222nd Premier League appearance for the Foxes, scored his side's second from James Justin's low cross.\nA breathless opening period had included great chances for both sides, as Mat Ryan denied Marc Albrighton inside the first five minutes and Kasper Schmeichel was equal to attempts by Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Danny Welbeck as Brighton threatened on the break.\nWith the points secured before the interval, Brendan Rodgers' side comfortably saw out a much quieter second period to move one point behind Tottenham and Liverpool, after both were held to draws on Sunday.\nBrighton remain 16th but are now just two points above the relegation places following Fulham's draw against the champions.\nReaction to Leicester v Brighton, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nMaddison hints at return to best in impressive win\nAware many of their expected top-four rivals had dropped points over the course of the weekend, Leicester's motivation to take full advantage at the King Power Stadium was evident in their high-octane start.\nMaddison's first ever Premier League double and Vardy's 10th goal of the campaign were deserved reward for a superb, free-flowing first-half display, in which the Foxes landed 13 shots at goal.\nVardy's first opportunity came when his first-time hit from Justin's excellent pass was saved by Ryan - and he also struck the post before making no mistake when the impressive Justin again delivered from the right.\nEqualling Muzzy Izzet's appearances tally, Vardy then teed up Maddison - whose sole England cap arrived over a year ago - for his excellent left-footed finish, which typified a performance indicative of a player nearing a return to his best.\nDespite missing a number of key players to injury, defenders Caglar Soyuncu and Timothy Castagne among those still absent, Rodgers' side continue to apply pressure at the summit in a start which has also seen them successfully juggle their Europa League commitments.\nConverting their good start - reignited by this showing and Vardy's late Bramall Lane winner last weekend that ended a four-game winless run - is a must for Leicester, after last season's collapse which began over the Christmas period.\nOn this evidence, they are in good shape to do so ahead of key meetings with Everton, Tottenham and Manchester United in the next 13 days.\nBrighton teeter above trouble\nOn the wrong end of a controversial VAR decision in defeat by Southampton at the start of the week, Graham Potter could have few complaints as his side were outclassed by superior opposition on Sunday night.\nBrighton's two wins from 12 this term represents their joint-fewest at this stage in the club's top-flight history, and defeat sees the Seagulls pulled into trouble following positive results for Burnley and Fulham.\nFormer Ostersunds and Swansea City boss Potter, contracted until 2025, continues to attempt to mould this side in his second season, after his first resulted in the club's highest ever Premier League points tally.\nAnd though there is a commitment to a long-term project under Potter, there is now an urgency for Brighton to begin converting decent performances into victories.\nThough this was not one of those occasions - the visitors threatening on the counter in the opening stages but dejected after Leicester's first - there is a sense their performances have deserved more than the table suggests.\nBut after just one win in their past 10 league games, it is now time to deliver as they face two of the four sides below them in Fulham and Sheffield United next week.\n'Maddison has immense quality' - what the managers said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers to BBC Sport on James Maddison: \"He has such quality. What makes it even better is he hardly trained at all this week. He had an issue with his knee so we took him out of our midweek game. You see his immense quality - his first goal and then to cut in [for his second]. He's a fantastic player.\n\"The second half was about controlling the space and playing a bit more on the counter. We controlled the game well and showed our maturity. Our focus was very good and it's a professional job.\"\nBrighton manager Graham Potter: \"We have no complaints with the result. There were some big moments for us before they scored and we were playing quite well but the goal affected us.\n\"Pretty quickly you go from being fine to suffering. The response in the second half was very good but overall it wasn't good enough to get the three points. The score is painful for us - there's not many times that's happened to us this season. We have to recover and go again.\"\nLeicester's favourite fixture? - the stats\nLeicester are unbeaten in all seven Premier League meetings with Brighton - the most they have faced an opponent without losing in the competition.\nThe Foxes scored three times in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time since scoring five against Southampton in October 2019.\nLeicester's eight Premier League wins this season is the most in the division and represents their joint-highest number of victories after 12 games of a top-flight campaign, level with 2019-20.\nSince the start of the 2015-16 season, only Harry Kane (128) has scored more Premier League goals than Jamie Vardy (108).\nVardy has been directly involved in 14 goals in 11 Premier League appearances for Leicester this season.\nTeam-mate James Maddison scored his first ever Premier League double in his 78th appearance in the competition.\nBrighton's two wins from their opening 12 Premier League games this season is their joint-fewest at this stage of a top-flight campaign. They also won two in 1979-80 and 1980-81.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester, who learn their Europa League last-32 opponents in Monday's draw, host Everton on Wednesday evening at 18:00 GMT.\nBrighton are away to Fulham later that day (20:00).\nMissed all the action from the Manchester derby and Saturday's goals?

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 Chelsea: Pedro Neto scores late winner for Wolves\nFrank Lampard says his Chelsea players may be suffering from fatigue after Wolves came from behind to beat the Blues with an added-time winner.\nPedro Neto's 95th-minute strike gave the hosts a dramatic victory at Molineux and stopped Lampard's side going top of the Premier League.\nDaniel Podence had equalised in the second half after Olivier Giroud put the Blues ahead.\nThe Portugal forward tiptoed through the Chelsea defence before wrong-footing goalkeeper Edouard Mendy with a shot that deflected in off Reece James.\nIt came after a fierce Giroud volley from Ben Chilwell's cross crept through Rui Patricio's gloves to open the scoring for the visitors.\nNeto was denied a late penalty for the hosts after referee Stuart Attwell reviewed his original decision on the pitch-side monitor and judged the Wolves forward was not fouled by James.\nBut the 20-year-old broke away in the 95th minute and fired a low strike into the far corner beyond Mendy to earn Wolves only their second win in six games.\nReaction to Tuesday's Premier League games\nIt is a second successive defeat for Chelsea after they were beaten at Everton on Saturday, another game in which they could have gone top of the table.\n\"There could be some fatigue,\" said Lampard, whose side have already played five games in December.\n\"I hate to say it after a defeat because it feels like an excuse but even in the first 60 minutes when we were the better team, we didn't have a zip about us.\n\"We've travelled up to Everton, came back and then travelled to Wolves but everyone is in the same boat.\n\"We have a couple of injuries in areas which means I can't make too many changes so I understand that side of it.\"\nBlues' title charge stuttering?\nLampard said his side did not \"have enough answers\" in that 1-0 defeat against the Toffees, with Tottenham also frustrating his side in a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge last month.\nIt was a similar story at Molineux as the Blues failed to have a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes, Kurt Zouma hitting the crossbar and Giroud heading over from a corner.\nThe visitors made amends immediately after the break as Giroud beat Willy Boly to Chilwell's low ball to fizz a left-footed volley underneath Patricio.\nIt was the in-form Frenchman's seventh goal in as many games in all competitions, but it was not enough to stop the Blues losing consecutive top-flight matches for the first time since December last year.\nLampard may have had reason to feel aggrieved at Wolves' leveller, which followed a corner awarded to the hosts despite the ball having appeared to go out off Boly.\nBut Chelsea failed to create any serious chances after Giroud's goal and were picked off on the break by the hosts' pace and trickery in attack.\nWith Tottenham visiting Liverpool on Wednesday, this was a chance for Chelsea to move briefly into top spot and apply pressure.\nInstead, the Blues remain fifth and could lose ground on the top four with all the teams in the Champions League places still to play this week.\n\"We had a couple of moments where the players are switching off and that cant happen,\" Lampard told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"You can get your message on the pitch and do your messaging before the game, letting them know these are one of the biggest counter-attacking teams in the Premier League, and have pace and a threat against you, and the players have to deal with that.\n\"We have some younger players, we have some new players to the league, they do need to understand that these games come and if we want to get where we want to get to, we have to see them through.\"\nWolves find goalscoring solution\nWolves had failed to score in their previous two games after losing talismanic striker Raul Jimenez, who suffered a fractured skull against Arsenal.\nThe Mexican played in every Premier League match for Nuno Espirito Santo's side last season, scoring 17 goals.\nAgainst Chelsea the manager turned to 18-year-old club-record signing Fabio Silva in his search for goals.\nSilva, who joined for \u00a335m from Porto, did have the ball in the net but only after straying offside and generally found it a tough evening up against an experienced defender twice his age in Chelsea's Thiago Silva.\nPortuguese duo Podence and Neto produced the main goal threat for the hosts, who also sold Diogo Jota to Liverpool in the summer, and looked capable of shouldering the attacking burden in Jimenez's absence.\nWolves also looked solid at the back, with Nuno reverting to three central defenders after playing with a back four in their past four games.\nThe results lifts his side to 10th in the table.\n'The boys believed the game was there'\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to Amazon: \"We were always in the game. We were well organised. In the second half we played really good football.\n\"In the first half the game was tight, Chelsea had the ball. Second half, the boys believed the game was there to be competitive.\n\"We were disappointed three days ago [at losing late on to Aston Villa]. Football is until the last minute. It can happen to any team.\n\"It's a strange season. We miss our fans today. There are too many voices around the referee and technical staff. Too bad the fans are not here to celebrate with us.\"\nGiroud continues prolific form - the stats\nWolves have lost just one of their past six Premier League home games and have now avoided losing consecutive home top-flight games since January 2019.\nEach of Wolves' last 83 goals in the Premier League have been scored by non-British players - only Arsenal have had a longer such run in the competition (171 between October 2005-February 2008).\nNo player has scored more goals for Chelsea in all competitions this season than Olivier Giroud (eight, level with Timo Werner).\nGiroud has scored six goals in his past four away games in all competitions, as many as he managed for the Blues in his previous 20.\nAll four of Daniel Podence's Premier League goals for Wolves have come against London clubs (two v Crystal Palace, one v Arsenal and one v Chelsea).\nWhat's next?\nWolves visit Burnley on Monday in the 17:30 GMT kick-off, while Chelsea host West Ham later that evening (20:00).\nWant all the goals and talking points from Sunday's Premier League games?

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-1 West Brom: Pep Guardiola's side held to frustrating draw\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola said \"you have to win this kind of game\" after his side were held to a frustrating draw by struggling West Brom.\nBaggies goalkeeper Sam Johnstone made two point-blank stoppage-time saves to deny City victory and leave Guardiola's side sixth in the Premier League table, five points off the top.\n\"It will be a long season but if you want to be up there we have to win here and we could not do it,\" he said.\n\"We created chances, we controlled it but you have to win. This game works on results.\"\nCity seemed on course for a customary home win against West Brom when Ilkay Gundogan applied a first-time finish to Raheem Sterling's cutback after half an hour.\nBut the midfielder's first goal in 22 games was cancelled out before half-time when a volley on the turn from Semi Ajayi, which appeared to be going wide, deflected off Ruben Dias and wrong-footed City keeper Ederson.\nIt was the first goal City had conceded in 608 minutes in all competitions and was followed by a valiant backs-to-the-wall effort from Slaven Bilic's visitors, who defended heroically.\nIt seems that the point may still not be enough to keep Bilic in the job, with the 52-year-old's exit potentially coming as early as Wednesday.\nUncertainty over Bilic's future has been fuelled by his admission there have been no talks over a new contract, with his current one due to expire in the summer.\nFollow reaction from Tuesday's games here\nBattling Baggies scrap for point\nThe visitors had lost each of their past nine visits to Etihad Stadium and hopes could not have been especially high on their latest trip, given they had won once all season and that success - at home to bottom club Sheffield United - was the only time they avoided defeat in a run of six matches.\nLittle wonder Bilic's future is the topic of major debate - or that the Baggies boss looked edgy as he tried to urge his team on during an opening period that could hardly have been more one-sided.\nCity enjoyed 77% possession, yet at the start of the half came a golden chance that West Brom should have taken - and at the end of the first period, a scruffy one that they did.\nWith a restricted budget, Bilic pushed the Baggies board to pay Huddersfield \u00a315m for striker Karlan Grant on deadline day.\nA return of one goal from nine games before this one is not good enough - and he will not have many better chances than the one he had after seven minutes - straight in front of goal, 10 yards out, with only Ederson to beat.\nGrant's shot lacked conviction, was not close enough to the corner and allowed the keeper to save.\nAjayi's deflected equaliser was unexpected, but it gave West Brom something to cling to. In partnership with Dara O'Shea, Ajayi was outstanding in the second half.\nDespite offering no threat at the other end, the visitors' collective effort was far better than anything previously produced in a season where they had conceded 25 goals in their first 12 games, more than any other side.\nAnd Johnstone's heroics at the end ensured the defenders' efforts gained a tangible reward.\n\"We defended brilliantly, it's a great point but more than that it shows we know what we have to do in every game,\" Bilic said.\n\"We are defending for our lives, ready to die for each other on the pitch and that's all I can ask.\"\nOffensive struggles for Guardiola's City\nCity still have some truly great players but the losses of midfielder David Silva to Real Sociedad in the close season, and Sergio Aguero to injury for much of the campaign, have robbed them of key attacking threats.\nFor all their possession, clear chances were at a premium. Benjamin Mendy and Rodri were both off-target with efforts that could be classed as more hopeful than threatening.\nSterling's inventiveness created Gundogan's goal as he delayed his cutback just long enough to tee up the Germany midfielder in the perfect spot, but too often City chose the wrong option and ended up running into a red and yellow-shirted wall.\nJohnstone denied Sterling after the interval with a smart reaction save but as desperate clearance followed desperate clearance and block followed block, City boss Pep Guardiola became more and more agitated.\nAt one point he almost resorted to chasing after the ball when it went out of play to try and maintain his side's attacking momentum, and when fourth official Anthony Taylor was about to signal the minimum amount of additional time to be played, Guardiola amusingly stuck his head over the board, as if to say the number was wrong.\nBack on the bench after a bout of gastroenteritis, the introduction of Aguero midway through the second period signalled fresh hope for City. But the Argentine missed his best chance three minutes from time - and former Manchester United keeper Johnstone did the rest.\n\"You don't have to be so clever to see the gap between this year and previous years [in our results],\" Guardiola said.\n\"It is not confidence, Sergio Aguero is injured for four months, but we create chances, we are there we just can't score.\"\nPortuguese own goals on the rise - the stats\nThis result ended a run of eight Premier League home wins against promoted sides for Manchester City, since a goalless draw against Huddersfield in May 2018.\nWest Brom ended a 13-game losing streak against City in the Premier League, picking up their first point against them since a 0-0 draw in December 2011.\nAlbion also picked up their first away point against City since August 2005, ending a run of nine straight league defeats at Etihad Stadium.\nCity's haul of 26 shots was the most they have had in a home league game without winning since August 2019 against Spurs (30).\nR\u00faben Dias' own goal was the first goal City had conceded in 10 hours and eight minutes in all competitions, since Giovani lo Celso's strike for Spurs last month.\nDias is the third different Portuguese player to score a Premier League own goal this season, after Helder Costa and N\u00e9lson Semedo. Only three different Portuguese players had scored own goals in the previous 27 seasons in the league combined (Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa twice, Abel Xavier and Ricardo Rocha).\nRaheem Sterling has been involved in 148 goals in all competitions for Man City under Pep Guardiola (95 goals, 53 assists), more than any other player since the Spaniard joined in 2016.\nIlkay Gundogan's opener was his first Premier League goal in 22 games, since netting against Leicester last December.\nWant all the goals and talking points from Sunday's Premier League games?

The boys came out like we did three days ago [against Burnley], we scored a really good goal, on top in the game, and again we shoot ourselves in the foot.\n\"Aubameyang needed that confidence boost, he is very critical with himself; hopefully he can move and be more optimistic in the future.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"We have shown what we have learned in the past and that is to play our game, it was a good performance, not all the time, but we get more and more confident playing in possession.\n\"They tried more risks after half-time, pressed a little bit earlier and automatically you get a little bit under pressure. This is a team that is normally above us in the table.\n\"It was good to see we can still be competitive. Teams have respect for what we are doing and how we are playing. I am OK with a point.\"\nSaints continue impressive form - the stats\nArsenal have just 14 points from 13 Premier League games this season, their lowest tally at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1974-75 (9pts - adjusting for 3pts for a win).\nThe Gunners have picked up just one win in their last nine Premier League games (W1 D2 L6).\nSouthampton have only lost one of their last 11 matches in the Premier League (W7 D3 L1), going unbeaten in each of their last six on the road.\nArsenal have conceded in 10+ consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since February 2002 (11 games).\nSince Mike Arteta's first Premier League game in charge (26 December, 2019), Arsenal have been shown seven red cards, four more than any other team in the competition in this period.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to Goodison Park to face Everton on Saturday (17:30 GMT), while Southampton host Manchester City earlier that day (15:00).\nSounds of the 90s: A mega mixtape of the very best indie floorfillers\nFreddie Flintoff: Former England cricketer on his desire to coach at the highest level"

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-2 Everton: Richarlison and Holgate give Toffees the win\nEverton scored in each half to beat fellow Champions League hopefuls Leicester and move back into the top five of the Premier League.\nThe visitors took the lead as Richarlison cut in from the left before beating Kasper Schmeichel with a low strike for his second Premier League goal of the season.\nMoments later Jamie Vardy headed straight at Robin Olsen, making his second appearance of the season after Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti again rotated his goalkeepers, dropping England keeper Jordan Pickford to the bench.\nThe Toffees lost impressive midfielder Allan to what looked a hamstring injury just before the interval and Leicester pressed for an equaliser early in the second half.\nBut the early season leaders doubled their advantage from a corner, with Schmeichel making a fine double save only for defender Mason Holgate to stab in the rebound for his first Everton goal.\nLeicester were then awarded a penalty for an Andre Gomes foul on fellow substitute Ayoze Perez but referee Lee Mason reversed his decision after viewing the pitchside monitor.\nPerez also had a goal disallowed for offside as Leicester missed the chance to go top of the table.\nEverton are now a point behind fourth-placed Leicester after winning their past two - both games missed by their star summer signing James Rodriguez because of a calf injury.\nReaction to Wednesday's Premier League action\nListen to the latest BBC Radio 5 Live Football Daily podcast\nAre the Foxes genuine title contenders?\nApproaching two years in charge, boss Brendan Rodgers has already turned Leicester from a mid-table side into Champions League hopefuls.\nThis time last year they were second in the Premier League and looked the only side capable of reeling in runaway leaders Liverpool.\nBut their collapse over the second half of last season started over the festive period, culminating in missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day.\nThis game, and the next two against Tottenham and Manchester United, offered an opportunity for Rodgers' young side to show they are now capable of staying the distance and challenging for the title.\nThey made a bright start, with Youri Tielemans firing just wide from Vardy's lay-off, but Everton gradually took control and Schmeichel should have done better when he pushed Richarlison's 20-yard strike into the bottom corner.\nVardy wasted a great chance to hit straight back as he headed James Justin's cross straight at Olsen, but Leicester only had one more shot on target.\nTielemans and James Maddison fired off target early in the second half before Leicester were again undone at a set-piece. This season they have conceded more goals from corners than any other Premier League side (seven).\nThat must be addressed if they are to establish themselves as genuine title contenders - or will they be content to continue their progress this year by ensuring they do clinch a top-four finish?\nAnother clean sheet despite resting Pickford\nMany had called for Pickford to be taken out of the line of fire when he was dropped to the bench after a tough spell in October.\nAncelotti made it clear that it was not a permanent demotion, saying he still trusted Pickford and was \"used to rotating the goalkeepers\".\nAnd the Italian proved that by switching them again after Saturday's win over Chelsea, when Pickford continued his return to form by helping Everton keep their first clean sheet in the Premier League since the opening weekend of the season.\nAfter his side struggled to adjust to the loss of influential full-backs Seamus Coleman and Lucas Digne to injury, Ancelotti experimented with a back three but has now shored up his defence after switching to a flat back four.\nOlsen had to kick the ball clear early on as Everton almost played themselves into trouble, but otherwise the Sweden international was well protected.\nThat steady back four also provided the platform for the Toffees to threaten going forward, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin twice going close in the first half.\nHolgate then pounced for the second goal immediately after Michael Keane and Calvert-Lewin were denied, before Gylfi Sigurdsson fired over as the Toffees secured a second straight victory and clean sheet.\nEverton have ensured the momentum from their fine start has not been lost and, just shy of his first anniversary at Goodison Park, Ancelotti aims to follow Rodgers' lead by turning his side into Champions League contenders.\n'We're where we want to be' - what they said\nEverton boss Ancelotti: \"It's been a good week. We've found consistency defensively and that was the reason for these two results.\n\"It keeps us with a lot of confidence, a lot of ambition and a lot of motivation. The season is long but at the moment it's good.\n\"We are now where we want to be, to fight for a position in Europe. If the season finished today we'd be in European competition. We still have to fight but the spirit in the team is good.\"\nOn Richarlison scoring: \"He was a bit worried when he didn't score in the past games but the work that he's done, even though he didn't score, was really important for us.\"\nOn Olsen starting: \"It's good to keep him involved because he's a serious professional. He's a good goalkeeper with experience, but Saturday will be Jordan [Pickford] in goal.\"\nLeicester boss Rodgers: \"It's a frustrating result for us. I think we put a lot of effort and ambition into the game but we conceded two disappointing goals, from our perspective.\n\"The first one it was too easy for him to get the shot off and then the set-piece is unfortunate because he slips when he's marking Holgate, after Kasper makes a great save.\n\"We made some chances but didn't show enough quality in the final third. I think we should have had a penalty. The referee made the right decision yet somehow overturns it.\n\"The players have been very good up to this point [this season] but there's going to be games where we need to show that bit more.\"\nFew home comforts for Foxes and corner concerns - the stats\nNone of the past 11 Premier League meetings between Leicester and Everton has ended level, with Everton winning six.\nLeicester have lost four of their seven home league games this season, as many as they did last season (four).\nLeicester have conceded seven goals from corners this season in league action, two more than in the whole of last season.\nEach of Everton's previous eight away wins in the Premier League came by a one-goal margin, with this the first win by a larger margin since a 2-0 victory at West Ham in March 2019.\nRicharlison has scored four Premier League goals against Leicester, his joint-most against any opponent in the competition (also four against Wolves).\nMason Holgate scored his first Premier League goal in his 69th appearance, with his 25th shot in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nEverton host Arsenal on Saturday (17:30 GMT) before facing Manchester United in the EFL Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday (20:00).\nLeicester visit Tottenham on Sunday (14:15), followed by a home game with Manchester United on 26 December (12:30).\nSounds of the 90s: A mega mixtape of the very best indie floorfillers\nFreddie Flintoff: Former England cricketer on his desire to coach at the highest level"

        "article_text": "Leeds 5-2 Newcastle: 'It was Sunday park football defending' - Bruce\nManager Steve Bruce likened Newcastle's defending to \"something you see on a park on a Sunday\" after they conceded three times in the last 13 minutes at Leeds.\nThe Magpies were in the game at 2-2 until the 77th minute when right-back Stuart Dallas stole in at the far post to convert Mateusz Klich's ball from the left.\nIn searching for an equaliser, the visitors ditched their counter-attacking tactic only to be twice given a taste of their own medicine when Ezgjan Alioski fired in from substitute Pablo Hernandez's pass after a swift break before Jack Harrison thumped home a brilliant fifth on the run from 25 yards.\n\"I thought we looked a threat when we equalised,\" said Bruce, referring to Ciaran Clark's 65th-minute header.\n\"Of course Leeds are always going to ask you questions the way they play, they do it very well, but we've gifted them the two or three goals at the end. Unfortunately they're something which you see on a park on a Sunday.\n\"We can't make those mistakes we've made here. At the wrong time we've given away poor goals, not defended well enough and got punished. It's unacceptable.\"\nAs for dominant Leeds, it was only their second Premier League win in seven games.\nThe home side had 25 shots on goal - 14 of which came in the first 45 minutes, the most by a team in the opening half of a Premier League game this season.\nThey went behind when Jeff Hendrick converted from close range before Patrick Bamford's header levelled matters. Rodrigo's brilliant stooping header gave the advantage to the home side, but Newcastle hit back through defender Clark.\nHowever, unlike many recent matches, the valiant exertions of Marcelo Bielsa's side were rewarded with the late flurry of goals, and the win moves them up to 13th, level on 17 points with Newcastle in 14th.\nReaction from Leeds v Newcastle, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nLeeds rewarded for domination\nDespite only one win in six and knowing his attack faced a hardy defence, Bielsa said before the contest that he had no reason to change the XI that lost 2-1 to West Ham at the weekend.\nAnd why would he? When it comes to energy expenditure and endeavour the promoted side have yet to let down their commander-in-chief - the main negatives have been converting their domination into goals and conceding from set-pieces.\nFor much of the game, it seemed like history would be repeating. Having given the Magpies' defence a thorough workout they were level with time running out. Fortunately for them, their fitness levels are up there with the best in the league as well as their concentration levels, unlike Sean Longstaff, who was pickpocketed in the area seconds before Dallas headed the home side back into the lead.\nThat changed Newcastle's approach, and Leeds ruthlessly took advantage. Harrison, whose magnificent control and peach of a cross led to Rodrigo's goal, provided the icing on a very palatable cake when he let fly from 25 yards to seal a deserved victory.\n\"In both halves we attacked a lot and created plenty of chances but in the second half we were more efficient,\" said Bielsa.\n\"The team carried on playing in a calm and organised manner after they levelled the game and eventually we were able to get on top of them again and get on top of them when we needed to.\"\nPenalty decision does Newcastle no favours\nNewcastle have this uncanny knack of looking beaten but still managing to eke out results - ask Wolves, Everton and Tottenham.\nDespite conceding 71% of possession, they were in the contest with 14 minutes to go at 2-2. And perhaps Bruce's side might have been defending three points rather than one had referee Simon Hooper and his VAR team judged Liam Cooper's foul on Callum Wilson in the area to be illegal earlier in the second half, with the score at 1-1.\nBut alas, there was no penalty and despite equalising through Clark, a succession of errors and Leeds' greater will resulted in this late capitulation.\nBruce's rope-a-dope tactics have worked successfully this season, but this was not one of those occasions.\nWith reference to the failed penalty appeal, the Magpies boss added: \"I honestly was all for VAR when they brought it in to make sure the clear and obvious mistakes that the referee misses, that's what the VAR is there for.\n\"If anybody looks at the challenge you understand that it's a clear penalty. We might not have gone on to win the match but certainly when you take the lead in the Premier League then the outcome could be very, very different.\"\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle host Fulham on Saturday (20:00 GMT) and Leeds are at Manchester United on Sunday (16:30) for the eagerly awaited clash between the fierce rivals.\nBamford is Bielsa's best - stats\nLeeds scored five goals in a home Premier League game for the first time since May 2001, when they beat Bradford 6-1.\nNewcastle conceded five goals in a top-flight league match against a newly promoted side for the first time since August 1958, against Blackburn (1-5).\nLeeds became the first newly promoted team to score five goals in a home Premier League game since Leicester won 5-1 vs QPR in May 2015, going on to win the Premier League the following season.\nBamford became the all-time top-scoring player in Bielsa's entire managerial career, netting his 35th goal and overtaking Fernando Llorente, who scored 34 under Bielsa between 2011 and 2013 for Athletic Bilbao.\nHernandez became the oldest player (35y 249d) to assist twice in a Premier League game for Leeds since Gordon Strachan (age 36) in November 1993 v Swindon.\nWilson has been directly involved in 10 goals in 11 Premier League appearances this season (seven goals, three assists), more than in 35 games for Bournemouth in the last campaign (nine).\nSince the start of last season, Harrison has more league assists for Leeds than any other player (12).\nSounds of the 90s: A mega mixtape of the very best indie floorfillers\nFreddie Flintoff: Former England cricketer on his desire to coach at the highest level"

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: Hosts out of bottom three with point\nFulham moved out of the Premier League's bottom three on goal difference after earning a point in a goalless draw with Brighton at Craven Cottage.\nBoth sides had chances to take all three points in a much livelier second half, as Adam Webster's header struck the crossbar and Seagulls goalkeeper Robert Sanchez denied both Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ademola Lookman.\nAdam Lallana was denied his first Brighton goal four minutes after the restart, a VAR review disallowing his low finish for a handball by Danny Welbeck in the build up.\nAttempts in excess of 30 yards by Brighton pair Yves Bissouma and Lewis Dunk were the only shots on target in a cagey opening period, which also saw Welbeck narrowly fail to reach Tariq Lamptey's inviting low cross for the visitors.\nIvan Caveleiro's powerful drive forced Sanchez to tip over as Fulham - back to playing without fans after London was moved into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday - came alive before half-time.\nBut neither side could force a winner, as Brighton missed the chance to distance themselves from trouble and remain two points above the relegation places.\nReaction to Fulham v Brighton, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nListen to the latest BBC Radio 5 Live Football Daily podcast\nFulham continue steady progress\nFulham's hard-earned haul of four points from three difficult fixtures against Leicester, Manchester City and Liverpool had seen Scott Parker's steadily improving side double their points tally for the season.\nIndeed, there can be no greater indication of Fulham's progress over recent weeks than Parker's disappointment at only taking a point against the defending champions on Sunday.\nBut Wednesday's meeting with Brighton posed a very different challenge, with arguably Fulham's most important match of the season to date offering the opportunity to not only exit the bottom three but also pull Brighton into trouble.\nOnce again deploying three at the back, Fulham retained the new-found solidity that was sorely lacking at the beginning of the campaign to record only their second clean sheet in 13 games.\nThe main moments of concern for Parker's side arrived from set-pieces, as Dunk and Webster got the better of the hosts on several occasions.\nHaving withstood pressure immediately after half-time, Ruben Loftus-Cheek was denied by the feet of Sanchez and the introduction of Aleksandar Mitrovic allowed Fulham to pose an aerial threat of their own, but Lookman could not convert from the Serbia international's knock down.\nFulham's place outside the bottom three may be short-lived, with 18th-placed Burnley in action against Aston Villa on Thursday, but this was another result that takes Parker's side in the right direction after just one defeat in their last four.\nMissed opportunity for Brighton\nBrighton's defeat by Leicester three days ago was a rare occasion in which Potter's side have failed to be competitive in a Premier League game this season. However, back-to-back defeats and one win in their past 10 games made this trip to London an important fixture.\nThe first of two games against sides below them in the standings, with bottom side Sheffield United up next, was first and foremost a must-not-lose for the Seagulls against a Fulham able to leapfrog them in the standings.\nPotter welcomed back Lamptey, Lallana and Webster from injury among six changes, which also saw the impressive 23-year-old Sanchez replace the absent Mat Ryan in goal and make a couple of key saves late on.\nThe speed and delivery of the returning Lamptey offered Brighton's main attacking outlet in a largely uneventful first half, before the visitors emerged from the interval looking much more likely to break the deadlock.\nDunk dominated in the air and twice went close as he followed up his saved header, while Lallana's effort was disallowed due to the ball bouncing up onto Welbeck's arm before rolling into the path of the former Liverpool player.\nHaving finished in the bottom six for the past three seasons and an underperforming Arsenal the only side within five points above them, this was the first of two golden opportunities for Brighton to distance themselves from trouble. Victory against the Blades on Sunday now appears a must.\n'A clean sheet is massive for us' - what the managers said\nFulham boss Scott Parker, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I thought we looked a little jaded today and that was probably from the effort the players put in against Liverpool. We did have some massive chances but overall a point felt a fair result.\n\"In large parts this season we have not given ourselves a platform and have been chasing games down. A clean sheet is massive for us. Overall [there are] a lot of positives but some negatives as well. I felt we lacked a bit of control today.\n\"This is a team that is moving in the right direction and I am seeing improvements in. We are taking small steps and that is very pleasing.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter: \"I felt we could have got all three [points]. The second half performance was a strong one. In the end it's a hard-fought match against a team in a good moment.\"\nOn goalkeeper Robert Sanchez: \"Really good [performance]. He brought his quality, used his feet well and mixed it up. He has huge potential and it's our job to help him fulfil that. Attributes wise, he has everything you need to be a top goalkeeper.\"\nA first Craven Cottage game without a goal in nine years - the stats\nThis was Fulham's first goalless draw at home in league competition since August 2011, ending a run of 196 consecutive games with at least one goal scored.\nBrighton have won just two of their last 17 away Premier League matches in London.\nOnly Sheffield United (seven) have failed to score in more Premier League games than Fulham (six) this season.\nFulham have won just four of their last 25 Premier League matches in December.\nBrighton defender Lewis Dunk had five attempts at goal in this match - the most by a defender in a Premier League game this season.\nBrighton have won just one of their last 11 Premier League matches.\nWhat's next?\nFulham are away to Newcastle on Saturday at 20:00 GMT, while Brighton host Sheffield United on Sunday at 12:00.\nSounds of the 90s: A mega mixtape of the very best indie floorfillers\nFreddie Flintoff: Former England cricketer on his desire to coach at the highest level"

Here at Spurs, he is in charge of a developing side that will certainly contest places at the top end of the table this season.\n'Jose told me that the better team lost' - what they said\nLiverpool boss Klopp: \"It was just a really good game against a counter-attacking monster, the possession we had we did incredibly well. The best way to defend Tottenham is to keep the ball all the time.\n\"Yes, they have scored a goal and had two chances. Apart from that, we controlled the game and it is a massively deserved three points. I am happy. For me, it [the Spurs goal] is offside. They watch it 20 times, but when I saw it, it is offside.\n\"I am so happy we scored that goal because it felt like 70% of the ball against a top side. Bobby [Firmino], what a header. I am over the moon for him. What a game he played, those movements, he opens up all the other gaps.\"\nOn exchange with Mourinho after the final whistle: \"Jose told me 'the better team lost'. I thought he was joking, but he wasn't.\"\nSpurs boss Mourinho: \"We were playing to win, we were not playing to get a point. A point would have been quite a fair result but we played to win and had the biggest chances to win it. The moment of the occasions and the reaction they had, they were in trouble.\n\"I feel it was a very undeserved result, but that's football. At half-time we move the pieces a little bit, but overall the game was always under control and I am very pleased with the performance.\n\"The changes were to find counter-attack situations which we did immediately, but with Gio's [Lo Celso] yellow card and the incredible pressure these guys on the touchline put on the officials, I was afraid of the yellow card and I had to take him off. I am not the one to speak to my colleagues about their behaviour on the touchline.\"\nReds continue to frustrate Spurs - the stats\nTottenham have won just one of their past 27 Premier League away games against Liverpool (D8 L18), last winning there in May 2011.\nTottenham have only conceded more Premier League goals against Chelsea (102) than they have against Liverpool (97).\nThis was Tottenham's first Premier League defeat in 12 Premier League games (W7 D4), since a 0-1 loss to Everton in September.\nMourinho has never won away against Klopp in six attempts in all competitions (D2 L4), with Klopp being the manager he's faced the most away from home without ever tasting victory.\nSon has scored 11 goals in 13 Premier League appearances this season, equalling his goal tally from the entire 2019-20 campaign (11 in 30).\nTwenty of Tottenham's 25 Premier League goals this season have been scored by either Son (11) or Kane (9).\nSalah now has eight goals against Tottenham in all competitions - against no other side has he scored more in his club career in European football (level with Bournemouth and Watford).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool visit Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday (12:30 GMT) while Tottenham host Leicester City on Sunday (14:15).\nSounds of the 90s: A mega mixtape of the very best indie floorfillers\nFreddie Flintoff: Former England cricketer on his desire to coach at the highest level"

It's the tap-ins I want him to score as well.\n\"We need somebody to come up with the goods. We got a wondergoal from him, we really did.\"\nBenteke, who had earlier caught Angelo Ogbonna with his elbow, was dismissed 20 minutes from time for a second yellow card for a similar offence on Tomas Soucek.\n\"It was a ludicrous decision,\" said Palace boss Roy Hodgson. \"He only tried to use his arm for leverage and honestly win the ball.\n\"It's odd to sit here and say these things as if you're some monster who wants everything to go his way.\n\"Decisions like that are ruining the game.\"\nListen to BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily\nLondon events affected by tier move\nHammers defender Masuaku has knee surgery\nBenteke's mixed fortunes\nThere were few clear-cut chances in a tightly fought London derby but Benteke showed he might be returning to his form of old - before he was dismissed by referee David Coote.\nHaving scored two in Palace's last away game at West Brom, he now has as many Premier League goals as he managed in the previous two seasons.\nBenteke stood out in an energetic first-half display, scoring, creating another chance and having five attempts at goal.\nHe timed his run to perfection to meet Ward's delivery and send Palace into the lead.\nBut after Haller's equaliser Benteke's night took a turn for the worse when he was given his marching orders after catching Soucek, having already been booked for making contact with Ogbonna with his right elbow in the first half.\nIt means Benteke will miss the visit of his former club Liverpool to Selhurst Park on Saturday.\nMoyes agreed with his opposite number Hodgson that the red card was harsh.\n\"I didn't think it was sending-off. If you jump then there's the fear of clashing of heads or flailing arms,\" said the Hammers boss.\nHammers prove a point\nDespite dropping two points and missing a chance to move into the top five, West Ham are approaching Moyes' first anniversary in good health.\nThe Hammers were 17th in the table, one point above relegation, when he returned to take charge for a second time on 30 December 2019.\nTwelve months on and Moyes has put together a side that is hard to beat and boasts creative flare and a hard-working mentality.\nThey now have 21 points from 13 games, just 18 short of the total they managed for the whole of 2019-20.\nAgainst a determined Palace side, West Ham struggled to hit the heights of last Friday's performance when they came from behind to win at Leeds, but once again they showed character to claw themselves back after falling behind.\nHaller's goal was the highlight of the match, an exquisite finish which Vicente Guaita, Palace's hero against leaders Tottenham last Sunday, had no chance of keeping out.\nPalace dig deep after Benteke setback\nPalace are in decent form as they get ready to host reigning champions Liverpool in the early kick-off on Saturday.\nThe worry for Roy Hodgson, who made three changes to freshen up his side, will be that his team have won only once in five games.\nBut just as they did against Spurs, they gave a good account of themselves against one of the Premier League's form teams.\nPalace created the better chances in the first half and, after they took the lead, Andros Townsend set up a great chance for Benteke who was unable to finish.\nAfter Benteke's dismissal, the visitors regrouped to frustrate West Ham, with Scott Dann and Cheikhou Kouyate particularly commanding at the back.\n\"The last three games, our attacking play has been particularly potent,\" added Hodgson. \"We're getting some joy from it.\"\nGoal and red card in the same game - the stats\nTwo of the past three occasions that a player has both scored and been sent off in a Premier League game have been Crystal Palace players - Christian Benteke today and Wilfried Zaha against Southampton in January 2019.\nWest Ham boss David Moyes has only been beaten once in eight Premier League meetings with Crystal Palace (W5 D2).\nThe Hammers have avoided defeat on each of the past three occasions they have conceded the first goal in a Premier League game.\nCrystal Palace have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their past 12 Premier League matches.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham are involved in another London derby next Monday when they face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League (20:00 GMT), while Crystal Palace host Liverpool at 12:30 GMT on Saturday.\nSounds of the 90s: A mega mixtape of the very best indie floorfillers\nFreddie Flintoff: Former England cricketer on his desire to coach at the highest level"

This could easily have been a similar outcome but the hosts were not clinical enough.\nPope made six saves in total with his fingertip stop to deny El Ghazi the best of the lot.\nEven at the end Jack Grealish and Tyrone Mings went close but Villa, who were averaging more than two goals per game before this, failed to score for just the second time this season.\nGrealish was outstanding in midfield but even he was left frustrated as Burnley dug deep to stop their opponents, who remain 11th in the table after a first draw of the season, from scoring.\nClarets show resilience\nThe Clarets had dropped back into the relegation zone after Fulham's draw with Brighton on Wednesday but a third unbeaten game lifts them back above the Cottagers.\nSince being hammered 5-0 at Manchester City on 28 November, Sean Dyche's side have held Everton, won at Arsenal and frustrated Villa.\nThey played their part in an end-to-end thriller at Villa Park, Martinez made to work hard for his latest clean sheet.\nAshley Westwood had already gone close with a first-time shot when Wood got on the end of Josh Brownhill's cross to force the Villa keeper into a diving save.\nRobbie Brady and Ben Mee also forced saves while Dwight McNeil's driving runs caused Villa problems all game, but the Clarets' meagre return of six goals in 18 hours of Premier League action this season needs addressing.\nProspective Burnley owner ALK Capital is hoping to conclude its takeover of the club in time to give Dyche a chance to bolster his squad in the January transfer window.\nAfter a tough start to the season, at least his side is beginning to move in the right direction.\n\"It wasn't a great result, just a good result,\" said Dyche. \"We had to get back to being strong defensively and we have done that.\n\"We had a big result at Arsenal but doing the basics well has been important to us since we've been in the Premier League.\n\"Now we have to find the balance of opening the team up enough to make sure we score more goals.\"\nAnother clean sheet for Pope - the stats\nSince his debut in September 2017, Burnley's Nick Pope has kept 31 Premier League clean sheets - the second most by an English goalkeeper, after Jordon Pickford (34).\nAnwar El Ghazi attempted eight shots against Burnley without scoring - the most by an Aston Villa player in a Premier League game since John Carew vs Reading in February 2008 (8 shots, 0 goals).\nOf the six occasions that a player has been fouled as many as seven times in a Premier League game this season, half have been against Jack Grealish - including this game tonight (7).\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa's next match is a West Midlands derby at West Brom on Sunday (19:15 GMT), while Burnley have an extra day to prepare for the visit of Wolves on Monday (17:30 GMT).\nHighlights and goals from eight midweek Premier League games including Liverpool v Spurs.

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 2-3 Manchester United: Marcus Rashford scores twice for visitors\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was frustrated by his side's \"sloppy start\" but praised their \"brilliant football\" as they moved to sixth in the Premier League with a comeback victory over bottom club Sheffield United.\nMarcus Rashford's double ensured the visitors maintained their perfect away record in the Premier League this season but it came after a horror start and a late scare.\nGoalkeeper Dean Henderson, playing against his former club, gifted the Blades an opener after five minutes when forward Oliver Burke blocked his clearance, allowing David McGoldrick to tap in.\nJohn Fleck missed a glorious chance to make it 2-0, which proved costly as Solskjaer's side dominated for much of the match against the winless Blades.\nRashford equalised after 26 minutes, his powerful strike from Victor Lindelof's through ball giving Aaron Ramsdale no chance.\nAnthony Martial ended his 491-minute goal drought by collecting Paul Pogba's pass and beating Ramsdale at the second attempt.\nAnd Rashford appeared to have made things comfortable nine minutes after the break by shooting under the diving Ramsdale following a swift counter attack.\nBut there was late concern when McGoldrick headed in from a corner for the hosts with three minutes left, and Henderson then saved Lys Mousset's shot.\n\"We played some brilliant football between their first goal and their second goal - the end was a bit too uncomfortable for my liking,\" Solskjaer said.\n\"We never make it easy for ourselves. The start was sloppy and slow, and I'm surprised by this because we showed them videos and it happened again.\n\"It was a test for Dean after making a mistake like this, but he passed with flying colours.\"\nVictory moves Manchester United to within a point of fourth-placed Leicester City, while Chris Wilder's Blades have made the worst start to a season in top-flight history after 13 games, and remain nine points from safety.\nReaction to Thursday's Premier League games\nAway days continue to suit Solskjaer's side\nManchester United boss Solskjaer appears to have come through the sticky patch which saw his position come under pressure last month following defeats by Arsenal and Istanbul Basaksehir.\nThey have since exited the Champions League, but after a slow start to their domestic campaign, their away form in the league has been a saving grace.\nThe baffling aspect is that despite picking up a sixth successive league win this season away from Old Trafford, in each game Solskjaer's team have gone behind. It is almost as if they need the extra challenge to inspire them.\nIn this case, it was a woeful piece of play between former Sheffield United players Henderson and Harry Maguire after five minutes, with the goalkeeper hesitating before Burke closed him down, allowing McGoldrick to score his third goal of the season.\nFor Henderson, who is trying to challenge David de Gea to be first choice in goal, it was a poor reflection of the player who had excelled on loan at the Blades for the previous two seasons.\nBut it appeared to galvanise the visitors, who could have scored four or five goals before the break. Rashford was their chief tormentor, ably supported by Bruno Fernandes and Pogba in midfield.\nOnce Martial had finally got on the scoresheet, he then helped set up Rashford for his 12th of the season to become United's top scorer.\nIt crowned a perfect evening for the 23-year-old, who earlier earned a Fifa Foundation award in recognition of his inspirational charity work to combat child poverty.\nThere were further chances for Martial and substitute Juan Mata to make the game safe, and in the end United were reliant on their defence to keep them ahead as the hosts mounted their late revival.\nBlades still showing fight despite poor form\nDespite another defeat for the Blades - their 15th in 16 games stretching back to last season - the noises coming out of the club this week have been positive.\nBefore their 3-0 loss at Southampton on Sunday, Saudi owner Prince Abdullah said he would \"stick with Wilder\" whatever happens this season, while right-back George Baldock said the players had \"100% faith\" in their manager.\nIn this match, Wilder lost none of his effervescence on the touchline, cajoling his players to respond as the visitors took control and prompting their late fightback.\nThere was also a finger-pointing episode with Solskjaer as the two managers disagreed about Ethan Ampadu's late challenge on Rashford.\nBut after the Blades had taken a fortunate lead and then missed a chance to double it, the visitors found it easy to cut through the home defence, and the hosts' plight was not helped by an early injury to midfielder Sander Berge.\nThey will rue the Red Devils' third goal, which Ramsdale should have saved, especially as the tireless McGoldrick later got his fourth of the season direct from a corner before Henderson made up for his earlier error by saving well from Mousset at the death.\nDespite chalking up an unwanted record of eight successive league defeats, and having been outclassed for much of the match by the Red Devils' swift attacking play, the last 10 minutes showed Wilder's team have not lost their appetite to compete even if their chances of staying up already seem remote.\n'I don't worry about my job'\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm happy with the manner of the performance. Tonight was about a performance if I'm being honest, we needed one from the players and we asked some questions from some world-class players.\n\"I am a free manager anyway, I don't worry about what I can't control. I don't worry about my job. I keep coming into work and doing it to the best of my ability. There is a huge gulf, people don't understand what Sheffield United are about when they talk about people's futures.\n\"I have been in the game long enough to know that that question will be asked. There is a story to every club and we accept that.\"\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"We have got good players and today we found the spaces behind them really well.\n\"He [Dean Henderson] dillied and dallied on the ball for the first goal. We saw the good and bad from him today because he made a great save towards the end.\"\nMan Utd flying on the road - the stats\nSheffield United have won fewer points after their first 13 games of a league season than any other team in English top-flight history (one)\nManchester United are the fourth side in English top-flight history to record 10 consecutive away league wins, after Spurs (10 in 1960), Chelsea (11 in 2008) and Manchester City (11 in 2017).\nThey have now scored at least twice in 10 consecutive away league games - the longest such run by a team in the top flight since Spurs in October 1960 (also 10).\nManchester United become only the third team in Premier League history to win their opening six away games of a season, following Chelsea in 2008-09 and Manchester City in 2017-18.\nIn 26 home games in the Premier League since the start of last season, Sheffield United have only conceded three or more goals on two occasions - both have been against Manchester United.\nHaving only made one error directly leading to a goal in 36 Premier League appearances for Sheffield United last season, Dean Henderson made his first after just three appearances for Manchester United.\nMarcus Rashford has five goals in six away games in the Premier League this season, as many as he did in 16 away appearances in the competition last term.\nRashford has scored 43 goals under Ole Gunnar Solskaer in all competitions - the most by any Manchester United player under a single manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\nDavid McGoldrick's opener for Sheffield United was their first open play goal in the Premier League since 4 October against Arsenal.\nWhat next?\nSheffield United visit Brighton on Sunday (12:00 GMT), while Manchester United host Leeds United later that day (16:30).\nHighlights and goals from eight midweek Premier League games including Liverpool v Spurs.

And Salah then got among the goals late on, with an opportunistic header and a late curling effort.\nThere was also a cameo for substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who made his first appearance since picking up a knee injury against Newcastle last July.It marked a perfect afternoon for the champions, who are now six points clear at the top of the table, with Tottenham hosting Leicester on Sunday.\nSorry Palace stale and uninspiring\nPalace have managed some famous results against Liverpool in the past - they were the last visiting team to win a league game at Anfield, back in April 2017 - but have now lost their past eight matches against the Reds.\nThe south London side were always going to be underdogs, but their performance was uninspiring - and defensively, they failed to deal with the pace of the visitors' attacking options.\nAt 1-0, Jordan Ayew had a header well saved by Alisson, while the forward failed to find Wilfried Zaha midway through the first period, when a simple pass would have put the Ivory Coast winger through on goal.\nPalace boss Roy Hodgson must be wondering how the game would have played out had former Liverpool striker Christian Benteke not been suspended for the fixture.\nAs it was, the Eagles were unable to hold the ball upfield to break Liverpool's waves of attacks. The Belgium international will return for Palace's game against Aston Villa.\nSeventh heaven for Liverpool - the stats\nLiverpool registered an away top-flight win by a margin of seven goals for the first time in their history. It was their first league victory by a margin of that size or greater since a 9-0 win over Crystal Palace in September 1989.\nCrystal Palace conceded seven goals in a home match for the first time in their entire history.\nThis was Jurgen Klopp's 127th victory as Liverpool manager in the Premier League, overtaking Rafael Benitez (126) as the Reds boss with the most wins in Premier League history.\nCrystal Palace have conceded 33 goals in 12 home Premier League games against Liverpool, 13 more than against any other club at Selhurst Park in the competition.\nLiverpool's Sadio Mane became only the fourth player in Premier League history to score in seven consecutive appearances against an opponent, after Robin van Persie (eight against Stoke), Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (seven against West Ham) and Romelu Lukaku (seven against West Ham).\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson lost his seventh Premier League game against Liverpool since leaving the club in 2011 - only Mark Hughes against Manchester City (10) has lost more games against a team he's formerly managed in Premier League history.\nAll seven of Liverpool's goals were assisted by different players (Mane, Firmino, Robertson, Alexander-Arnold, Salah, Matip and Oxlade-Chamberlain), the first time in Premier League history seven different players have assisted a goal for a team in a match.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Aston Villa next Saturday (15:00 GMT) in the Premier League, while Liverpool take on West Bromwich Albion on Sunday (16:30).\nDocumentaries Like Nowhere Else: From inspiration to infamous, the story of Lance Armstrong\nComedy Like Nowhere Else: Give Kurupt FM a go with the People Just Do Nothing box set"

Though beaten on Saturday, Hasenhuttl's well-drilled side will still feel they can threaten the established order.\nSaints played with the energy and confidence expected of a team which had lost just once in 11 Premier League games, and were once again unrecognisable from the side which endured a torrid start to the previous campaign.\nCity's opener only served to increase Southampton's early intensity in front of a limited number of home fans, but Ederson was equal to both Theo Walcott's shot and Jannik Vestergaard's header.\nThe loss of Ings - whose wait for a 50th Premier League goal continues - to a hamstring problem before half-time was a huge blow, after the 28-year-old had led his side's admirable high press from the front.\nThe striker was convinced he should have been awarded a penalty following a high challenge by Ruben Dias, while VAR also decided against awarding a spot-kick when the ball hit Sterling on the arm in the second half, but Southampton were ultimately unable to break City down.\nIngs' injury and a 10th booking for the now-suspended Oriol Romeu were two notable disappointments in defeat for Hasenhuttl, who should otherwise take pride in another promising showing.\n'We saw a top game today' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport: \"We played against Man City. They're not so bad. To be honest we played a much better game than last season when we won 1-0. We have made such progress since then.\n\"They had to put their best game on the pitch to win here, and that's the best praise you can give our players. We saw a top game on the pitch today. [Manchester City] have never been pressed so much. We had some good chances and some misses, so I'm really proud of my team. We never lose, we either win or we learn.\"\nOn Ings' injury, he added: \"He's hurt his hamstring. We had one day less to recover. It was a risk to play him. Hopefully he's not so bad. We'll have a look.\"\nManchester City boss Guardiola said: \"We had the momentum in the second half, but we couldn't score and we nearly suffered. They put a lot of players inside, they provoke you to be narrow. It's difficult. They don't allow you to be compact, that's why they are so good. That's why they're creating problems.\n\"They have the best free-kick taker I have seen in my life in [James] Ward-Prowse. Their position in the table, Ralph [Hasenhuttl] is doing an excellent job. It's a good result for us.\"\nCity's impressive defensive record - the stats\nNo side has conceded fewer goals (12) or kept more clean sheets (6) in the Premier League this season than Manchester City.\nCity manager Guardiola has won six of his seven meetings with Hasenhuttl in all competitions.\nSouthampton failed to score in a Premier League game for the first time since their season opener in September.\nSaints have only kept one clean sheet in their past 18 games against Manchester City in the Premier League, conceding 40 goals in those games.\nSterling has been directly involved in 11 goals in 16 Premier League games against Southampton - only against West Ham (14) has he had a hand in more.\nKevin de Bruyne has registered 15 Premier League assists in 2020. That's three more than anyone else and only in 2017 has he assisted more (18).\nSince the start of last season, only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (45) has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than De Bruyne (42).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City are away to Arsenal in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday (20:00 GMT), before hosting Newcastle on Saturday night in the Premier League(20:00).\nSouthampton travel to Fulham on Saturday (15:00).\nDocumentaries Like Nowhere Else: From inspiration to infamous, the story of Lance Armstrong\nComedy Like Nowhere Else: Give Kurupt FM a go with the People Just Do Nothing box set"

The boys are absolutely still fighting.\n\"The way the boys reacted in the dressing room tells me they have the belief. When you lose lots of games for different reasons it hurts a lot.\n\"We have to be better, it wasn't about Everton it was about us.\"\nMOTD's Shearer unsure 'awful' Arsenal will survive\nAncelotti's side have now beaten Chelsea, Leicester City and Arsenal in the space of seven days and while there were some anxious moments in the second half, this was a deserved win.\nThey took the lead after 22 minutes when Rob Holding deflected Dominic Calvert-Lewin's flick past Bernd Leno, but Arsenal were level 10 minutes before the break when Nicolas Pepe scored from the spot after Tom Davies fouled Ainsley Maitland-Niles.\nThe Gunners barely deserved to be level and Everton were ahead again on the stroke of half-time when Yerry Mina headed in at the near post from a corner.\nArsenal improved after the break, David Luiz seeing a shot deflected on to the post, but Everton also had opportunities and this loss leaves Arteta's struggling side 15th as he has no cause to celebrate his own first anniversary in a few days' time.\nAncelotti takes the acclaim\nIt was almost a year ago to the day since Ancelotti few into Merseyside from Italy to confirm his appointment at Everton before sitting and watching a thoroughly shocking goalless draw with Arsenal at Goodison Park.\nArteta, the newly appointed manager of Arsenal, sat a few seats away to watch his own new team and supposedly usher in a new era of optimism.\nAncelotti can survey the Premier League table with greater satisfaction than Arteta after a superb week in what was earmarked as a crucial month and Everton's manager took huge acclaim from supporters gathered in the Gwladys Street after the final whistle.\nEverton had to dig deep here but they did and merited their win despite surviving some close shaves near the end.\nCalvert-Lewin delivered another magnificent display but it was two of Ancelotti's signings that really caught the eye, namely Abdoulaye Doucoure and Ben Godfrey.\nDoucoure was outstanding but it was 22-year-old Godfrey, the England under-21 defender signed for \u00a325m from Norwich City, who was arguably the game's outstanding player.\nGodfrey is playing in an unfamiliar left-back role but gave a superb performance, thunderous in the tackle and showing an astonishing turn of speed to lead a second half counter-attack.\nEverton have now had an outstanding week with three wins after a sticky spell following their bright start.\nArsenal slip deeper into trouble\nArsenal looked exactly what they are for most of this match - a team struggling desperately near the bottom of the Premier League table.\nThe Gunners, admittedly without main striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, should have been beaten by half-time as Everton dominated and Arteta's side showed an alarming lack of urgency, exemplified by another poor display from Willian.\nThere was also the lack of discipline that has been a problem this season with Dani Ceballos fortunate to escape a red card for raking his studs down Mina's leg in the opening period.\nArsenal picked up after the break but they could hardly get any worse and their tally of 14 points represents their worst start to the season since 1974/75, when they won just three of their first 14 games.\nThere is no threat to Arteta's position - he won the FA Cup last season after all - but there is a sense of dangerous drift about Arsenal, who have now gone seven league games without a win.\nArsenal's tepid, negative first half handed the initiative to Everton and while it is a stretch to imagine the Gunners in a relegation fight, there must be serious concerns about the lack of results and that poor league position.\n'We need to win matches' - what they said\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti to the BBC: \"This season we started well, then we had a difficult moment, but right now I'm really pleased.\n\"We have fantastic players on set-pieces and we score lots of goals. We work on this because we are very dangerous. We are pleased; the position in the table is really good.\"\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta, also to the BBC: \"It's very similar to the last few weeks. We are trying, dominating the game but in the small moments we are losing the game. We lost, conceding an own goal and a set-piece.\n\"We had chances but the last shot, the last pass is not going our way. It's not an excuse, we keep believing in what we are doing. We need to win matches and that's not happening.\"\nThe best of the stats\nArsenal's 14 points from 14 games this season is their worst record at this stage of a season since the 1974-75 campaign (12 points, converted to 3pts/win).\nEverton have won two of their last three home league games against Arsenal, as many as in their previous 11 against them at Goodison Park.\nAfter a run of just one win in seven Premier League games, Everton have won each of their last three, guaranteeing them a spot in the top four at Christmas for the first time since 2004-05 (3rd).\nArsenal haven't scored from open play in any of their last five Premier League away games, with their two goals on the road since Alexandre Lacazette's strike against Liverpool coming from the penalty spot.\nRob Holding's own goal was the third by an Arsenal player in the Premier League this season (also Saka v Aston Villa and Aubameyang v Burnley). The Gunners had netted just two own goals in their previous four league campaigns combined.\nEach of Yerry Mina's last four Premier League goals for Everton have come in the 45th minute of matches. In Premier League history, only Chris Eagles has scored as many consecutive goals in the same minute before (4 in the 90th between 2007-2011).\nGylfi Sigurdsson has registered a goal involvement in his last two Premier League home games (1 goal, 1 assist), as many as he had in his previous 17 at Goodison Park.\nNicolas Pepe has more goal involvements in all competitions than any other Arsenal player this season, with the Ivorian the Gunners' joint-top goalscorer (5) and assister (3) this term.\nWhat's next?\nEverton host Manchester United in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, 23 December (20:00 GMT kick-off), before travelling to Sheffield United in the Premier League on Saturday, 26 December (20:00).\nArsenal host Manchester City in their Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday (20:00) and welcome Chelsea to Emirates Stadium in the league on Saturday (17:30).\nDocumentaries Like Nowhere Else: From inspiration to infamous, the story of Lance Armstrong\nComedy Like Nowhere Else: Give Kurupt FM a go with the People Just Do Nothing box set"

The referee checked the replays of the incident on the pitchside monitor and, after careful deliberation, stuck to his original verdict, while sending Andersen off having initially shown no card.\n\"For what I have just seen the contact was made outside of the box and he then goes into the box and dives,\" the former Newcastle midfielder told Sky Sports.\n\"I don't know whether he [the referee] is looking at the same angles I am. I just don't understand. The game has changed drastically and not for the better, in my opinion. It's a bit of a mess to be honest.\"\nHe added: \"Referees make mistakes, I totally get that. But we have this VAR and everything there and we are still making incorrect decisions and that's puzzling.\"\nBoth BBC Match of the Day pundits Alan Shearer and Jermaine Jenas also thought Wilson had dived in the area.\nFormer Newcastle striker Shearer said: \"Yes there's a tiny touch, but it should have been a foul outside the box.\"\nEx-Magpies midfielder Jenas added: \"Parker has got it right. This is a dive. I don't think it's a foul. There's an important point here as well - we're watching this and we get all the angles, but the referee just got this one far-away angle.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce, on the other hand, backed Scott's decision.\n\"I think the referee has made the right call,\" he said. \"When I see the video back it looks like he clipped his heel.\"\nThe equaliser and red card were tough on Fulham, who had looked the more composed with their methodical build-up play, while in spells the Magpies XI played like they had just met for the first time.\nFulham had been particularly effective with deliveries from the left, so it came as no surprise when Ademola Lookman's corner caused confusion in the home area in the lead-up to the opener. Young centre-back Tosin Adarabioyo sent his header back into the six-yard area where Bobby Decordova-Reid produced a flick which went in off the face of Matt Ritchie.\nLookman had also gone close with a downward header while Decordova-Reid should have done better with a side-foot effort.\nDespite playing more than 28 minutes with a man advantage, Newcastle looked little more threatening.\nThe point lifts Bruce's men up to 12th on 18 points, while Fulham are in 17th with 10 points.\nReaction from Newcastle v Fulham, and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nTough luck for valiant Fulham\nAfter a start to the season which saw their relegation odds further shorten following five defeats in their first six Premier League matches, Fulham appear to be finally getting their just rewards for their approach to the game at this higher level.\nOn Saturday, they did not have to be at their best against a disjointed home side, although there were a handful of impressive performances.\nLookman, on loan from RB Leipzig, has perhaps found his home at Craven Cottage. He was brilliant on the left and almost as a second striker, creating three efforts on goal including two on target.\nGabonese midfielder Mario Lemina was back in the line-up and was diligent in both attack and defence. His ball into the area for Decordova-Reid, called up as a late replacement for Ivan Cavaleiro, should have been put away.\nFulham remained spirited even after going down to 10 men, and despite missing out on a possible three points, this performance will have again delighted their fans.\nWilson saves the day for Magpies again\nPrior to the match, Bruce highlighted - as he has repeatedly recently - how much his side had been affected by the coronavirus, which initially resulted in the postponement of their match against Aston Villa at the start of December.\nHowever, victory over West Brom and a competent 77-minute display against an effervescent Leeds suggested that his side could continue producing displays that have so far seen them keep clear of the relegation battle.\nIt was not a lack of fitness but a lack of cohesion that affected Newcastle in the first half on Saturday.\nThey marginally improved after the break, but with Miguel Almiron and \u00a340m signing Joelinton once again misfiring it was left to Wilson to save the day.\nThe former Bournemouth striker has arguably been the Magpies' best signing in recent seasons. Whether he was fouled outside the area or not is debatable, but his pace and nous got him into the position that forced a mistake from Andersen before he coolly dispatched from the spot.\nBruce cannot afford to rest him over this festive period and will be praying he stays fit.\n\"I think if we're brutally honest we weren't that great,\" added the Magpies manager.\n\"Against 10 men we struggled to create anything, but we've had a difficult week and we'll dust ourselves down and get ready for Tuesday [EFL Cup quarter-final against Brentford].\"\nFulham pay the penalty - stats\nNewcastle are unbeaten in their last six Premier League home games against Fulham (W3 D3), last tasting defeat in May 2009.\nNewcastle have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 11 Premier League games at St James' Park, their longest run without a shutout in the competition since February 2005, when Graeme Souness was in charge (also 11 games).\nFulham have picked up points when finishing a Premier League game with 10 men for the first time since April 2013 when beating QPR 3-2. They had lost the previous five instances.\nNo side have conceded more penalties in the Premier League this season than Fulham (five), with the Cottagers doing so in three of their last four matches.\nAndersen is the third Danish player to see red for Fulham in the Premier League after Leon Andreasen in February 2008 v West Ham and Claus Jensen in April 2005 v Bolton.\nNewcastle have won a penalty in three of their past six Premier League home games, as many as their previous 58 in the top-flight at St James' Park.\nAfter missing two of his first four penalties in the top four tiers of English league football, Wilson has scored 10 of his following 11 from the spot.\nWilson has scored eight goals in 12 Premier League appearances this season, as many as his he did in 35 games in the last campaign for Bournemouth.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle are at Brentford in the EFL Cup on Tuesday (17:30 GMT) before they go to Manchester City next Saturday (20:00). Fulham are at home to Southampton next Saturday (15:00).\nDocumentaries Like Nowhere Else: From inspiration to infamous, the story of Lance Armstrong\nComedy Like Nowhere Else: Give Kurupt FM a go with the People Just Do Nothing box set"

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Sheffield United: Danny Welbeck saves late point against 10 men\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder says football is in danger of becoming \"a non-contact sport\" after midfielder John Lundstram was dismissed in Sunday's Premier League draw at Brighton.\nLundstram was initially cautioned for his studs-up tackle on Joel Veltman late in the first half, but referee Peter Bankes upgraded the yellow card to a straight red after consulting his pitchside monitor.\n\"The game has moved on and changed,\" Wilder told BBC Match of the Day. \"I have to change with it, I suppose. Players and fans still want to see contact. I've got to accept that the referee thought it was a red.\"\nThe hosts had Wilder's side pinned back inside their own half for the majority of the contest but needed Danny Welbeck's late strike to deny the 10-man Blades a first league win of the season.\nJayden Bogle had given the visitors the lead against the run of play after Aaron Connolly, Neal Maupay and Leandro Trossard had spurned promising first-half opportunities for Brighton.\nWelbeck had a header cleared off the line deep into second-half stoppage, before Alireza Jahanbakhsh headed against the crossbar as United held on for a precious point.\n\"It took an enormous amount of energy and organisation with 10 men against a side that moves the ball around like Brighton,\" added Wilder. \"It was a pleasure to watch my side at the end of the game.\n\"At times it is a simplistic game - obviously you want to score goals and we've struggled with that, but it's about keeping the ball out of your net and we showed we wanted to do that.\"\nBrighton, meanwhile, remain without a league win at Amex Stadium this season and sit just two points above the relegation zone.\nBlades hold on for morale-boosting point\nDespite seeing United slip to an eighth consecutive league defeat as they lost 3-2 at home to Manchester United on Thursday, Wilder said he was pleased with the manner of their performance.\nHowever, if he was hoping for his players to pick up where they left off in the final 10 minutes against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, it was not to be as Brighton dominated the opening exchanges.\nDavid Sanchez's one-handed save from David McGoldrick's free-kick was the closest the visitors came to a breakthrough prior to Lundstram's reckless and needless challenge on Veltman.\nUnited were camped inside their own half for much of the second period but deserve tremendous credit for their response to Lundstram's dismissal.\nThe visitors defended stoutly while causing Brighton numerous problems on the counter-attack, with Enda Stevens firing narrowly wide of Sanchez's goal 12 minutes into the second half.\nBogle's opener came from a carbon-copy attack down the left, as McGoldrick picked out the former Derby County man, who fired home via a deflection off Adam Webster.\nOliver Burke could have doubled United's lead late on but blazed over from close range after latching on to Ben Osborn's square pass.\nThe Blades remain rooted to the foot of the table and six points adrift of safety, but Wilder can take plenty of positives from his team's gutsy display.\nFrustration for dominant Brighton\nBrighton have now won only one of their past 12 Premier League matches, with their most recent home league triumph coming against Arsenal on 20 July.\nHaving failed to beat fellow strugglers Fulham at Craven Cottage in midweek, this was an opportunity for Graham Potter's side to give themselves breathing space above the bottom three before a difficult run of fixtures over the festive period.\nIn front of 2,000 spectators, Brighton dominated possession from the outset and went close to taking an early lead when Lewis Dunk rose highest to head Trossard's corner on to the roof of the net.\nConnolly also tested Blades goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale with a low shot, before Chris Basham and Ethan Ampadu thwarted Maupay twice in quick succession.\nThere was little change to the pattern of play after the restart as Trossard scuffed a low shot wide of the far post and George Baldock produced a fine block to deny Solly March.\nConnolly should have cancelled out Bogle's opener when he headed Jahanbakhsh's delivery over the bar from point-blank range, but Welbeck lashed home a deserved equaliser after controlling Basham's attempted clearance with his chest.\nWelbeck and Jahanbakhsh both spurned glorious opportunities to earn Potter's charges a crucial victory in added time, but the Seagulls had to settle for a draw.\nNo home comforts for Seagulls - the stats\nBrighton are winless in their past 11 Premier League home games (D5 L6). Only once in their league history have they gone longer without a win at home (12 games between October 1997 and February 1998).\nSheffield United have never won a Premier League game in which they have been shown a red card (D5 L7).\nUnited have won just two points from 14 Premier League games this season - the lowest total by an English top-flight side at this stage of a campaign (assuming three points for a win).\nBogle became the fifth player to score on his Premier League debut for Sheffield United, after Brian Deane (1992), Willie Falconer (1993), Rob Hulse (2006) and Billy Sharp (2019).\nWelbeck has scored his eighth Premier League goal as a substitute and first since scoring for Arsenal against West Ham in August 2018.\nLundstram was sent off in a league game for the first time since March 2016 for Oxford against Stevenage in League Two.\n'It was a pleasure to watch my side' - what the managers said\nBrighton manager Graham Potter, talking to Match of the Day: \"We didn't make the advantage count enough. We started the game well and forced a tactical change because we dominated, but the red card changes the game and we've got to make sure we don't get caught. We did, which we're disappointed with. We're disappointed with a point but we've got to move forward with it.\n\"Sheffield United defend the box and goal really well, they don't concede many chances, they have physicality on the break, and it's still complicated with 10 men but we're disappointed because we had that advantage for a while and we have to make it count.\n\"It's a good finish from Danny and it's been a big win for him playing three games in a week - I'm delighted for him.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder, talking to Match of the Day: \"There were some big moments in the game - [including] the red card.\n\"We showed an ambition to score - the turning point was at 85 minutes when we didn't take the chance to go 2-0 up.\"\nOn Jayden Bogle: \"It's one to remember for the young man - he's come into the club and had to battle it out with George Baldock. He did a job defensively and he wanted to get himself up the pitch and support, which we did.\"\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to London Stadium in their next league fixture against West Ham on Sunday, 27 December (14:15 GMT), a day after Sheffield United welcome Everton to Bramall Lane (20:00 GMT).\nMissed Match of the Day?

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 0-2 Leicester City: Jamie Vardy strikes as Foxes go second\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers insists his side \"won't get carried away\" after they overcame top-four rivals Tottenham to climb to second in the Premier League.\nIn a hard-fought battle between the sides starting the day third and fourth in the table, Spurs one point above the visitors, it was the latter who established themselves as champions Liverpool's closest challengers courtesy of Jamie Vardy's penalty and a Toby Alderweireld own goal.\nWhile Leicester sit four points behind the league leaders, former pacesetters Tottenham - removed from top spot in defeat by Liverpool on Wednesday - find themselves fifth after Sunday's matches, six points adrift of the lead.\n\"The players have done great. A European campaign, lots of injuries, but they have kept the enthusiasm, spirit and quality, so it is a very pleasing opening third of the season,\" said Rodgers.\nOn his side's position, he added: \"The ambition is to continue improving. We won't get carried away, there is a lot of development to take place in our young players.\n\"We will see. It has been a really good start, I am satisfied with where we are at, knowing there are improvements to make.\"\nReaction to Tottenham v Leicester, plus live coverage of the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nVardy confidently dispatched his spot-kick in the fourth minute of first-half injury time, after referee Craig Pawson was advised to review Serge Aurier's needless shove on Wesley Fofana via the pitchside monitor.\nA VAR review for offside disallowed James Maddison's well-taken finish three minutes after the restart, but Vardy's header from Marc Albrighton's excellent cross deflected in off Alderweireld to double Leicester's advantage after 59 minutes.\nVardy's opener arrived at the end of a closely contested opening 45 minutes, during which Spurs captain Harry Kane's saved free-kick in the 34th minute and Foxes midfielder Maddison's deflected shot from distance were the only other attempts on target.\nSon Heung-min was denied at close range by Kasper Schmeichel as Jose Mourinho's disappointing hosts were left frustrated in search of a response, while Leicester went close to a late third through Youri Tielemans.\nAnother Christmas in second for Leicester\nThe true importance of this result to Leicester's season may only be revealed when the season concludes, but it is one which should serve to convince Rodgers' side of their place among the Premier League's current elite.\nSecuring a top-four spot after agonisingly falling short last season is the challenge for Rodgers, and this was the perfect response to Wednesday's below-par defeat by Everton which prevented the Foxes widening the gap to the chasing pack.\nAs demonstrated in the past week, the need to deliver consistency is paramount going forward for Leicester, whose midweek defeat arrived between a devastating attacking display against Brighton and this impressive victory over a side threatening a title challenge.\nDespite troubles with their home form, the Foxes have been ruthless on the road, this their sixth win in seven league away games despite facing a Tottenham defence with the joint-best record in the competition.\nVardy had a shot blocked at close range and Maddison fired over as Leicester were invited to ask the early questions of the Spurs backline, and they eventually got the breakthrough their positive play deserved as Vardy sent his penalty down the middle for his 11th goal of the campaign.\nThe returning Jonny Evans delivered an assured performance alongside Fofana in defence as the Foxes never appeared in danger of relinquishing their lead after Alderweireld's own goal, earning Rodgers a first Premier League win over Mourinho in eight attempts.\nIt is the first time in the club's history that Leicester have sat in the top two of the top flight at Christmas in consecutive seasons, and their Champions League credentials will be tested once more against Manchester United next.\nTottenham's title challenge falters\nRoberto Firmino's last-minute winner for Liverpool was a painful way for Spurs to concede top spot in midweek, as Mourinho's side spurned several good second-half chances to claim a statement win at the home of the champions.\nLiverpool's subsequent 7-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace on Saturday added even greater significance to Tottenham's response to a first league defeat since the opening day, with anything other than victory set to hand the Reds an ominous first glimpse of daylight in the title race.\nMourinho's tactics almost paid off at Anfield - despite just 24% of possession - but his subdued side were second best on Sunday.\nIn a rare off day for the Spurs forwards, Son unsuccessfully chose to square for Tanguy Ndombele instead of shooting in their first opening, while Kane went close with a header from a corner as the hosts increased their urgency before their costly setback before the interval.\nMourinho will have been left scratching his head at defender Aurier's careless barge on Fofana to concede the penalty and responded with the introduction of Gareth Bale at half-time.\nHe was soon forced to replace the injured Giovani lo Celso with Lucas Moura, yet despite an array of offensive players Spurs failed to get going in attack to leave any title aspirations in a precarious state.\nIt is now one win in five Premier League games for Spurs after a tough run of fixtures including Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Leicester in their past six.\nFor now, the immediate focus on ending a long wait for silverware rests on reaching the Carabao Cup semi-finals, when they face Championship side Stoke City on Wednesday.\n\"It's frustrating but I think it's a strange game to describe. It's a game that we lose with the penalty and the own goal. It's a game where your goalkeeper doesn't make a single save, but it's a game that we didn't play very well,\" said Mourinho.\n\"I didn't think either team played very, very well. We deserved to win the game at Liverpool and that would have made it an amazing week because nobody has done that for a long time. The team was phenomenal at Liverpool. Now, if you look at the table, everybody is there.\"\nFoxes' first victory at Spurs since title - the stats\nLeicester won their first Premier League away game against Spurs since a 1-0 victory in 2015-16, the season they won the title.\nThe Foxes have won 18 points in their past seven games on the road, the most in their first seven away games of a season in their history.\nJamie Vardy has been directly involved in seven goals in seven Premier League away games against Spurs, more than against any other opponent.\nVardy has scored 19 goals in his past 19 Premier League away games. He also became the first player to score an away goal against an opponent at three different venues in the competition - White Hart Lane, Wembley and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers defeated a side managed by Jose Mourinho for the first time, at his eighth attempt.\nTottenham have lost two of their past three Premier League games against Leicester - as many defeats as in their previous 12 against the Foxes.\nNo player has scored more own goals for Spurs in the Premier League than Toby Alderweireld. His tally of three is level with Harry Kane.\nSince joining Spurs in August 2017, Serge Aurier has given away four penalties in the Premier League - second only to Arsenal's David Luiz (five).\nWhat's next?\nTottenham face Stoke City in the League Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday (17:30 GMT), before travelling to face Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday (19:15).\nLeicester host Manchester United on Saturday afternoon (12:30).\nMissed Match of the Day 2?

        "article_text": "Man Utd 6-2 Leeds: Confidence, momentum, quality - why Man Utd are title contenders again - Micah Richards\nI've heard people say all season that Manchester United are miles away from being a title-winning side but the league table tells a different story at the moment.\nIf United win their game in hand, they are in second place and only two points behind what is a brilliant Liverpool team.\nThey are in the race, for sure, even if some of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's critics won't want to admit it. He deserves a lot of credit for the run they are on, but he probably won't get it.\nI do kind of understand why - as pundits, we go week to week sometimes just looking in detail at one particular game or performance by a team, good or bad, and you can miss the bigger picture, or the direction they are heading in.\nYou forget that, when you get a bit of momentum as a club, the outside noise doesn't matter.\nUnited haven't come from nowhere. A couple of poor results in the Champions League meant they are out of that competition and that led to more criticism of Solskjaer, but in the Premier League they have been building momentum for a while now and they have climbed to third on the back of six wins and a draw in their past seven games.\nThey have been playing well too, and scoring lots of goals, but no-one really seems to consider Ole's part in that, or those good results.\nIt's put down to his players rescuing games for him, and it's only Solskjaer's fault when things go wrong and he gets the blame for being \"poor\" tactically.\nI don't think that's fair, or reflects what has actually been happening. Solskjaer has got things absolutely spot on in plenty of big games in his time as United boss, including on Sunday against a Leeds team that have frightened a lot of opponents so far this season.\nHow Red Devils tore Leeds apart\nI'm sure Solskjaer's selection raised a few eyebrows, with Paul Pogba on the bench, Fred and Scott McTominay in midfield and Daniel James part of the attack.\nBut McTominay was superb, giving them the energy and dynamism they needed in midfield, and I thought James was brilliant too. He helped provide that extra bit of pace to their attack that let them really tear Leeds apart.\nLeeds are a high-energy team, who work hard and play expansive football high up the pitch. A lot of teams see those qualities and think they will just sit back and wait to hit them on the counter.\nManchester United, though, were different. They left three players up the pitch, which meant every time they got the ball they caused them lots of problems.\nLeeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips is one of my favourite players but he was left completely exposed and totally over-run in the middle of the pitch.\nThe final score was 6-2 but, really, the home side could have reached double figures with the chances they had. It was a brilliant attacking performance to run away with what was a thrilling game.\nThey will believe anything is possible\nSolskjaer has been taking a lot of stick recently, and every time he loses a game it seems like it is the worst thing ever, and it is time for him to go.\nBut now is the time to give him some credit. Manchester United have not truly been in touch at the top of the table at Christmas since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, but they are this year.\nThat's one sign of their progress, and proof of how they are heading in the right direction after two years with Solskjaer as manager. Another is the table which shows only Liverpool and City have picked up more points since he took charge.\nI still don't believe they will win the title, but they won't care what anyone else thinks. They have got momentum and confidence and they will feel like anything is possible. We saw in the second half of last season that they are capable of going on a long run of good results, so they will believe in themselves.\nWhat next? Find some consistency\nThere is still work to do of course, at both ends of the pitch.\nI still feel defensively there is room for improvement because they keep giving away stupid goals, and there are times they need to think more like they did against Manchester City earlier this month, and settle for a draw rather than pouring forward looking for a win and ending up empty-handed.\nThat City game was widely viewed as a negative performance because they only picked up a point, but you have to remember the pressure that was on Solskjaer going into that game. They had just been knocked out of the Champions League and if he had lost to City too, there would have been more calls for him to be fired.\nAnother step has to be to find a way through teams who come to Old Trafford and put 11 men behind the ball, because they haven't managed it so far this season.\nNo other away team will play like Leeds did and, too many times before, they have been on a good run like this one then slipped up at home against opposition they should really put away.\nThey have the quality to do that, and to stay in the title race too, but their problem in the past is that they have not been consistent enough. That also needs to change.\nLeicester will be a true test of title credentials\nOn the plus side, Manchester United are certainly exciting to watch and they are also a young team that might just be maturing and coming into their prime.\nWe might get a better idea of where they are at when they face Leicester on 26 December. That is a far bigger test of their title credentials than Leeds were.\nLeicester are seen as a counter-attacking side, which is how they beat Manchester City at the start of the season, but in their win over Tottenham they were excellent in possession and dominated the game.\nThe Foxes can hurt you in lots of ways but they are most dangerous when Jamie Vardy gets behind your defence.\nHe is bound to cause problems and United will have to deal with his pace and quality in front of goal before they get too carried away with the thought of mounting a title challenge, even if it is long overdue.\nMicah Richards was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nMissed Match of the Day 2?

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 0-3 Aston Villa: Sam Allardyce's reign starts with defeat\nSam Allardyce's reign as West Bromwich Albion manager got off to a miserable start as Aston Villa brushed aside the 10-man Baggies.\nAnwar El Ghazi's improvised close-range finish gave Villa an early advantage in a West Midlands derby that was one-sided even before Baggies captain Jake Livermore's red card.\nThe visitors were utterly dominant once Martin Atkinson consulted his pitchside monitor and decided to dismiss Livermore for a studs-up lunge on Jack Grealish before half-time.\nThey sealed the points with two goals in the closing stages as Grealish set up Bertrand Traore's cool side-footer and then won the penalty converted by El Ghazi for the Dutchman's second.\nAlbion might be aggrieved that the VAR did not request Atkinson take a second look when Kortney Hause trod on the ankle of Baggies midfielder Grady Diangana shortly after Livermore's sending-off.\nBut it was still a night to forget for Allardyce, whose side remain three points from safety in 19th, as he returned to a Premier League dugout for the first time since May 2018.\nReaction to West Brom v Aston Villa, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nBig Sam's biggest challenge yet?\nMuch has been made of Allardyce's record of never suffering relegation from the Premier League as a manager but he will already be aware he has an uphill task to maintain that proud statistic.\nWhile his new charges showed the sort of resilience that earned them a point at Manchester City in midweek in Slaven Bilic's final game in charge, they lacked the quality and potency to trouble Villa even before going down to 10 men.\nAlbion did not collapse after Livermore's ejection like they did following Matheus Pereira's red card in their last home game when Crystal Palace cruised to a 5-1 victory but, in truth, the scoreline could have been even more embarrassing than that.\nJohn McGinn headed a Grealish cross wide, Ollie Watkins saw a sliding finish scrubbed off for offside by VAR and Albion goalkeeper Sam Johnstone twice superbly denied El Ghazi before the incessant pressure told late on.\nWith the January transfer window looming, Allardyce will need to bolster a defence that has conceded 29 goals - a tally only surpassed by Leeds - while reinvigorating an attack that has netted just five times in their past 11 games.\nThey failed to force Emiliano Martinez into a save of note as Allardyce suffered only a second opening-game defeat in a 20-year Premier League managerial career now spanning eight clubs.\nThe fixture list will not make pleasing reading for the former England manager, whose side face Liverpool, Wolves and Manchester City among their next six as they seek to add to their solitary win this term.\nVibrant Villa terrific on travels again\nWhile it will be their shortest trip of the season - just four miles down the road from Villa Park - the impressive victory was still another away win for Dean Smith's men, their fifth in just six attempts.\nIt's a far cry from their form on their travels last season when they collected just 11 points, a total Villa - who have now kept seven clean sheets in 12 games - have already comfortably surpassed.\nSmith's team look transformed from the one that narrowly stayed up on the final day in July and once El Ghazi used the outside of his boot to flick Traore's teasing cross past Johnstone five minutes in, the outcome was rarely in doubt.\nThe goals had dried up in recent weeks - three in the past four games after netting 18 in their opening seven - but if Traore and Grealish, in particular, continue the type of irresistible display each produced at The Hawthorns, that will be just a blip.\nTraore's composed finish, almost passing the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the box after a surging run, made him Villa's ninth different scorer of the campaign, while the excellent Grealish was again a target for defenders as Semi Ajayi barged into him to give away the spot-kick.\nEl Ghazi, making only a second start of the season, was equally influential and has clearly developed a liking for Midlands derbies - he also netted twice against the Baggies in the Championship in 2018 and scored the winner at Wolves recently.\nVictory lifted Villa back up to ninth, with games in hand on the sides above them, as they seek a first top-half finish since 2010-11 in Gerard Houllier's sole season in charge.\n'I don't want to talk about VAR, I have enough problems' - what they said\nWest Brom boss Allardyce told BBC Sport: \"I can praise the players on the pitch for staying in the game, keeping their shape and trying to get one back. We slipped up with a couple of goals. The performance was not very good but at least the 10 men battled away. I'm very disappointed in the sending-off and the first goal.\n\"Jake Livermore, I have no problems with that [red card] but why did they not look at the Kortney Hause one on Grady Diangana? At least Martin Atkinson should be asked to look at it by VAR. That is wrong. I don't want to talk about VAR, I have enough problems with my own team.\n\"An easy one next [Liverpool]. We will give it our best shot, no-one expected us to battle against Manchester City and I did not see that tonight, we need to find that.\"\nAston Villa head coach Dean Smith: \"To win three games away from home 3-0 shows we are in a good place. We started really well and our energy levels were there to see - we controlled it from start to finish.\n\"There were times last season when the opposition went down to 10 men and we tried to force it but we were patient.\n\"We missed a number of chances to make it 2-0 and the offside call for Ollie Watkins was very marginal. I don't think they had a shot on goal against us all game.\"\nVilla's victories on road go on - the stats\nAston Villa's return of 22 points after 12 games is their best in the Premier League since the 2001-02 season, when they finished eighth (also 22 points).\nWest Brom have only one win or fewer 14 games into a league season for just the third time, after 1985-86 and 2004-05.\nAston Villa defeated West Brom at The Hawthorns for the first time since September 2008, having drawn five and lost three in all competitions at the venue since then.\nAston Villa have won five of their last six away matches in the Premier League, as many wins as they had picked up from their previous 49 such matches in the competition.\nIn England's top four tiers, only Southend United (-20) have a poorer goal difference than West Brom this season (-19).\nAston Villa have kept seven clean sheets in the Premier League this season, the most of any side - as many as they kept in the entirety of 2019-20 in the league.\nSince the start of last season, Jake Livermore is the fourth player to receive a Premier League red card for a foul on Jack Grealish (including second yellows).\nWhat's next?\nWest Bromwich Albion are away to Premier League leaders and holders Liverpool next Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nAston Villa are back in action a day earlier as they host Crystal Palace at Villa Park on Saturday (15:00) in a game being televised live on the BBC.\nMissed Match of the Day?

        "article_text": "Burnley 2-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood on target\nAshley Barnes scored his first goal in more than a year as Burnley beat Wolves at Turf Moor to move three points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.\nIt was a convincing performance from Sean Dyche's outfit, who have now lost only once in their past seven games and are unbeaten in four matches.\nBarnes nodded in at the back post to put the hosts ahead from Charlie Taylor's cross following a swift counter-attack in the first half.\nChris Wood then reacted quickest to thump in from close range and double Burnley's lead as Wolves failed to clear a free-kick after the break.\nTeenager Fabio Silva fired in from the penalty spot for his first Wolves goal late on but the hosts were able to see out their victory.\nIt is only the second time Burnley have scored more than once in a top-flight game this season, and they could have had more.\nJosh Brownhill whipped an effort on to the crossbar and Rui Patricio saved well to deny Wood after neat footwork from the New Zealand forward.\nIn contrast, Wolves struggled to seriously trouble a resilient Clarets back four before their late spot-kick and Nuno Espirito Santo's side remain 11th in the table.\nBurnley climb to 16th, with a game in hand on those around them.\nFollow live text and radio commentary of Chelsea v West Ham\nLawro's predictions v singer Becky Hill\nClarets hitting form at Christmas\nBurnley boss Dyche continues to eke the best out of his squad and both he and the club's potential new owners will be delighted by their recent revival after a slow start to the season.\nDyche will hope whoever buys the club will do so in time for some January squad investment, but in the meantime his team are hitting form.\nBurnley were the division's lowest scorers and had managed just six goals in 12 games before this fixture, but Dyche promised the \"stats will start paying us back\".\nHe was proved right as both his strikers found the net, with Barnes heading in for his first goal since a 3-0 win at Watford in November last year and Wood on target for his third goal of the season.\nIt was the first time the hosts have scored twice in a Premier League game at Turf Moor since February, but no less than they deserved.\nSubstitute Josh Benson's foul on Silva in the penalty box made it an unnecessarily nervy last few minutes.\nBut before that Ben Mee and James Tarkowski once again looked almost unbeatable in the heart of the Clarets' defence as they limited the visitors to very few opportunities.\nSilva steps up but too late for Wolves\nWolves arrived at Turf Moor amid their best start to a top-flight season in 41 years, but they have at times struggled to build momentum this term.\nThe visitors will once again be frustrated they could not back up an impressive win over Chelsea with something against Burnley.\nThe absence of Raul Jimenez remains a problem for boss Nuno and the Portuguese opted to leave club-record signing Silva on the bench against a rugged Burnley back four.\nInstead, he handed American Owen Otasowie, who came on for his debut against Chelsea in midfield, a first Premier League start and used the 19-year-old as the focal point of the visitors' attack.\nBut Wolves struggled to break down Burnley and \u00a335m striker Silva and winger Adama Traore were brought on at the hour-mark.\nThe visitors had 71% of the possession in the second half but only a long-range Ruben Neves volley troubled Nick Pope, while Daniel Podence had an effort deflected over.\nThat was until the 89th minute, when Portugal youth international Silva won a penalty for his side and converted from the spot to become Wolves' youngest score in the Premier League at 18 years and 155 days old.\n'The referee is not good enough to whistle'\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to BBC Sport: \"I thought it was deserved. Generally over the last five or six games performances have been good, including tonight.\n\"We created some great chances and, hyper-critically, we could have had the game sealed earlier on. It is a very important result, the players have worked hard.\n\"Sometimes you have to change things and Ashley (Barnes) has been sharp in training. I believe stats start coming your way and they have. We have been creating chances.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to BBC Sport: \"Football is a physical game, a game of contact and referees taking the decisions and being fair, but the referee is not good enough to whistle, Lee Mason is not good enough.\n\"The way he handles the game, it isn't about the major, crucial decisions, it is about how he handles the players, both teams are always arguing the decision. He must improve because the game requires good refereeing and good handling of the game so the players can perform.\n\"It is his job, he has to improve, he has to get better. When we saw the nomination, we did not understand it because he is a point of distraction. He worsens the flow of the game.\"\nClarets finally among the goals - the stats\nBurnley have won two of their last three games in the Premier League (drawing the other), one more than they managed in their previous 11.\nSince the start of 2018-19, Wolves have failed to win any of their three Premier League away games against Burnley.\nBurnley scored as many in this game as in their first five home games this season combined.\nChris Wood has netted 17 goals in the Premier League since the start of last season, more than twice as many as any other Burnley player in this period (Jay Rodriguez, eight).\nOwen Otasowie is the third different teenage player to start for Wolves in the Premier League this season (after Silva and Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri).\nDwight McNeil has appeared in each of Burnley's last 71 games in the Premier League - no outfield player is on a longer current run of consecutive appearances in the competition (joint-most, along with James Ward-Prowse).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley visit Leeds United on Sunday (12:00 GMT), while Wolves host Tottenham later that day (19:15).\nMissed Match of the Day 2?

        "article_text": "Chelsea 3-0 West Ham: Tammy Abraham scores twice in Blues win\nTammy Abraham scored twice as Chelsea ended their recent mini-slump by beating West Ham United at Stamford Bridge to move up to fifth in the Premier League.\nBack-to-back defeats had seen the Blues slip down the table but they made the ideal start on Monday as Thiago Silva powered home a header in the 10th minute.\nTimo Werner spurned a couple of good chances to add to the hosts' lead but he played his part in his side's second 12 minutes from time as his scuffed shot was turned in by Abraham.\nThe Chelsea striker, back in the side in place of Olivier Giroud, then netted another barely two minutes later when he was in the right place to pick up the loose ball and curl home after Christian Pulisic had missed a simple header from a cross.\nThe scoreline somewhat flattered Chelsea with West Ham having been the better side for large periods, but the visitors paid the price for a lack of a cutting edge as they finished the game without a shot on target.\nVictory means Chelsea have 25 points - one behind fourth-placed Everton - while West Ham remain 10th on 21 points.\n\"We'd dropped off slightly and it was important in this game we came back,\" said Chelsea boss Frank Lampard. \"There were loads of things for the team to show their character - we want more.\"\nAn ankle injury to left-back Ben Chilwell, which saw him come off early in the game, was a minor blemish on the evening for Lampard, who also has right-back Reece James out with a knee problem.\n\"We hope both their injuries are not that bad and they will be in and around it for those Christmas fixtures,\" he said.\nFollow reaction to Chelsea v West Ham, plus Monday's other Premier League match\nLawro's predictions v singer Becky Hill\nChelsea nervy but back to winning ways\nChelsea started this month being talked about as potential title contenders. They had topped the table after a win over Leeds, but losses to Everton and Wolves had left them in eighth and desperate to rediscover their early season form.\nSilva's early goal helped settle the nerves a little but their play soon became scrappy and West Ham took control instead.\nHowever, Chelsea found the Hammers enduring a rare off day in front of goal - this was only the second time this season that David Moyes' side had failed to score in the Premier League - and when Abraham slid in their second late on the Blues were able to breathe a sigh of relief.\nIt was a much-needed win for Lampard's team, with the only real frustration the continued disappointing form of Werner in front of goal.\nThis was the eighth game in a row that the Germany international has failed to find the back of the net, with misses at the end of both halves very much those of a striker low on confidence, first hitting a tame effort from a good position at Lukasz Fabianski, then heading on to the crossbar when it looked easier to score.\n\"That's the period Timo is in,\" added Lampard.\n\"It's unfortunate but he's getting in the positions - when one goes in it will be a run for him. Tammy and Oli [Giroud] both bring different things. Tammy did his thing today and that's what we needed.\"\nAn off day for the Hammers\nWest Ham have developed into a disciplined and difficult side to beat under Moyes this season and quite rightly have their eye on finishing towards the upper end of the Premier League.\nA win at Chelsea would have seen them leapfrog their opponents in the table, but that rarely looked likely as they struggled to create in the final third.\nThe presence of Michail Antonio in attack was missed as Sebastian Haller - who scored one of the best goals of the season so far in the 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace last time out - was largely ineffective against the hosts' defence.\nSilva's early goal was also the first time that West Ham's normally well-drilled defence had conceded from a set-piece in 2020-21, underlining that this was a bad day at the office for them.\n\"It was a harsh scoreline but we were not good enough in our box and we weren't good enough in their box when we had the opportunities,\" Moyes said.\n\"Any small decisions did not go for us; the flow always went in Chelsea's favour tonight.\n\"The players played really well. This was our biggest test so far this season. For the majority of it we played very well, but we didn't do enough where it matters: the boxes.\"\nAbraham out in front - the stats\nChelsea have lost just one of their past 13 home Premier League games, winning 10 and drawing two.\nWest Ham failed to score for the first time in their past 10 away league matches, losing for just the third time on the road in that period.\nChelsea have scored more goals from corners than any other team in the Premier League this season (eight).\nWest Ham are the last Premier League team to concede from a set-piece this season. They last did so on 1 July, also against Chelsea, when Willian scored direct from a free-kick.\nMoyes is without a win in any of his 16 Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge, the joint-highest tally of any manager never to win at a stadium in the competition - level with his own record at Liverpool's Anfield.\nMason Mount made his 50th Premier League appearance for Chelsea on Monday, becoming the youngest English player (21 years 346 days) to reach this milestone for the club since John Terry in January 2002 (21 years 36 days).\nAbraham has scored 25 goals for Chelsea since the start of last season, seven more than any other Blues player.\nWerner has failed to score in his past seven starts for Chelsea, his longest such run in club competition since September 2016, between spells at Stuttgart and RB Leipzig (nine).\nWhat next?\nChelsea travel to Arsenal in the league on Saturday, 26 December (17:30 GMT), while West Ham host Brighton on Sunday, 27 December (14:15).\nMissed Match of the Day 2?

We showed real quality and showed we can compete at the level against a team who had won every game away from home.\"\nBoth sides retained their pre-match position in the table before Saturday's other fixtures, with Leicester three points behind leaders Liverpool and one ahead of third-placed United.\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nBoxing Day honours even\nThe day after Christmas is renowned for turkey sandwiches and Premier League football, and the opening match of the festive schedule served up a treat.\nBoth managers acknowledged their opponents' counter-attacking threat pre-match, and it did not take long for the first chance to come.\nRashford should have given Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United side the lead in the second minute when Fernandes clipped the ball towards the back post, but the unmarked England forward headed wastefully over the bar.\nJust a minute later, the Foxes surged down the other end and the impressive James Justin fired in a fierce cross for Vardy, but Victor Lindelof was able to clear the danger.\nThat theme continued for the rest of the contest as the teams who started the day second and third in the table ultimately cancelled each other out.\nRodgers' hosts had slightly more possession but United, who have the best away record in the division, managed to produce one more shot.\nHalf-century up for Rashford\nRashford has led by example off the pitch this year, having successfully campaigned for the government to extend free school meals during the coronavirus pandemic and winning a special BBC Sports Personality award.\nThe 23-year-old has also been exceptional on the pitch and became the third-youngest United player to reach 50 Premier League goals, behind Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. However, he will surely be disappointed to have left Leicester without the match ball.\nHe recovered well from his bad early miss to collect Fernandes' pass and slide the opener past Schmeichel.\nBut the Foxes keeper came out on top in their next duel, saving superbly when Rashford was clean through.\nOnly Fernandes has scored more goals for the club than Rashford's six this season, but the United academy graduate has to be more clinical to deliver the biggest prizes to Old Trafford and enjoy the successes of Rooney and Ronaldo.\n'Close, but not close enough' - what they said\nLeicester City manager Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We showed the mentality to come back. I thought some of our attacking play was very good. You are playing against a team that is so quick on the counter-attack but I felt we counter-pressed very well.\n\"Today was another sign for us of improvement where if you can't win it you make sure you don't lose it, so I am pleased with the mentality.\"\nOn Vardy: \"I thought he was outstanding today. The space he creates with his movement and running. I am delighted for the team, delighted for Jamie and it was a good game of football.\"\nManchester United boss Solskjaer, speaking to BBC Sport: \"When there is 10 minutes to go and we scored a goal you think: 'Get on the ball and see the game out.' But it wasn't to be. We have come back so many times from losing positions to win, so we know the feeling from the other side.\n\"Marcus Rashford is always lively. He is always there or thereabouts with scoring goals. Good finish and he knows he had a couple of other chances, but that is football for you.\n\"Victor Lindelof has a back problem and it seems like he has aggravated it today. We had an early kick-off today and that gives us a few more hours to prepare for the next game.\n\"We knew today was going to be a difficult one.

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 3-0 Crystal Palace: Tyrone Mings sent off in home win\nAston Villa's impressive progress from relegation strugglers to the top six is down to the \"maturity\" of the players, says boss Dean Smith.\nVilla overcame Tyrone Mings' first-half dismissal to see off disappointing Crystal Palace comfortably and move to within three points of second-placed Leicester City.\nSmith's side were leading 1-0 when Mings was dismissed by referee Anthony Taylor for a foul on Wilfried Zaha - six minutes after both players had been booked for clashing.\nBut Mings' loss galvanised Villa, who went on to score two further goals to make it three wins in four games.\n\"It was a tremendous performance,\" said Smith, who side only secured their Premier League future on the final day of the 2019-20 season.\n\"After going down to 10 men, I thought our counter-attacking looked scary at times.\n\"It's important to get the balance right, in terms of when to attack and when to press, especially after going down to 10 men. I thought we did that really well. There's a maturity to the players now and we have come a long way in a short space of time.\"\nIn an incident-packed game, Villa claimed an eighth clean sheet of 2020-21.\nBurkina Faso winger Bertrand Traore, who also hit the post, put his side ahead after Vicente Guaita had beaten away an attempt by the impressive Ollie Watkins.\nPalace looked to take advantage of Mings' dismissal but instead conceded two further goals.\nDefender Kortney Hause nodded the second after Watkins' header had rebounded off the bar before Dutch winger Anwar El Ghazi lashed home the third with a quality finish.\nReaction from Villa Park plus Premier League latest\nIs it now or never for Barkley at Villa?\nEze's route from the 'cage' to the Premier League\nHard-working Villa look the business\nVilla managed 35 points in their first season back in the top flight but their latest victory, built on grit and a steely determination not to let Mings' red card disrupt them, leaves them on 25 points after just 13 games.\nTheir latest win came despite England defender Mings being given his marching orders after sticking out an arm to block Zaha's attempt to get away from him, not long after the pair had clashed following a challenge.\n\"I thought the first yellow card was pathetic,\" added Smith. \"Tyrone is stopping himself from getting attacked and gets a yellow card for it. With the second one, it looks like there is a foul just before Tyrone commits the foul - so they are two very soft yellow cards.\"\nNot that losing a player appears to throw Smith's team very much. Villa have now won the past two Premier League games in which they have finished with 10 men, having earned a 1-0 victory at Wolves on 12 December after the dismissal of midfielder Douglas Luiz.\nFormer Chelsea player Traore was excellent before he was substituted earlier than planned following Mings' dismissal, while the hard-working Watkins twice hit the woodwork and El Ghazi produced a moment of pure class with his goal.\nVilla's recruitment has been impressive. Traore has looked an excellent piece of business, having joined for \u00a317m from Lyon in September, while keeper Emiliano Martinez - who also cost \u00a317m, from Arsenal - continues to impress in each game.\nWith his side down to 10 men, Martinez produced a big save to keep out Luka Milivojevic's deflected attempt as Villa claimed a fourth clean sheet in a row, their best run in the top flight since February 2010.\nBruising week for Palace\nRoy Hodgson's side had been hammered 7-0 by Liverpool at Selhurst Park seven days earlier, so this result and performance capped a bruising week.\nHodgson has now moved into the top 10 on the list of those to have faced the most Premier League games as a manager - this was his 341st match. But the former England boss had little to celebrate, and looked miserable by the end.\nPalace started well after Zaha embarrassed Mings with his pace only for Martinez to produce an excellent stop.\nBut their defensive frailties were once again exposed while they were unable to take advantage of the Villa defender's dismissal.\nWithout a top-flight clean sheet since the opening weekend of the season, Palace have now lost four of their past seven matches and face high-flying Leicester in two days.\n\"We do have to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask what have we done wrong, what clear mistakes have been made, and try to find a way around that in two days' time,\" said Hodgson.\n'Perfect Christmas present'\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"I wanted the Christmas present of a good performance and I certainly got that and a good result as well.\n\"Our counter-attacking threat was there for all to see.

We have been unlucky and frustrated with our results in the last eight weeks so this was a big day for us.\n\"From the first whistle you could see the team had the energy and willingness to come out and win the game.\n\"The spirit before the game was really positive, they really wanted it. I am pleased for the players and for the supporters, We have let them down for many weeks so it was a good day to give them something to cheer about.\"\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard told BBC Sport: \"In the second half we showed some urgency but it was too late. The first half we gave ourselves too much to do, we were very poor. You can't lack energy and desire in the Premier League and we did.\n\"You can prepare as well as you want but if you turn up like that that's another thing. It's in the mind.\n\"If you perform below par things go against you like the Saka goal. That's life. On another day we could have scored the penalty and come back but it's not a day for us.\n\"The teams that win, win, win relentlessly weren't winning two or three years ago. We are not there yet, that's clear. I felt it when we are on our long unbeaten run and I feel it now. We got a lot wrong today.\"\nLacazette leads the way - the stats\nArsenal have won their past 10 home Premier League matches on 26 December, the second-best run in the competition after Manchester United won 12 in a row between 1997 and 2016.\nArsenal recorded their first win in eight Premier League matches, and their first at the Emirates since a 2-1 win over Sheffield United in October.\nChelsea have lost their past three away games in the Premier League, their worst run since February 2019.\nArsenal netted more than once during the first half of a Premier League game for the first time this season, leading by at least two goals at the interval for the first time since a 3-2 victory over Watford in July.\nSince the start of last season, Tammy Abraham (21) has scored more than twice as many Premier League goals for Chelsea than any of his team-mates.\nNo Premier League player has scored the opening goal of the game on more occasions this season than Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette, who has netted four of the Gunners' six such goals.\nAfter netting each of his first eight penalties for Chelsea in all competitions, Jorginho has since missed three of his past six for the club, also failing to do so against Liverpool in September and Krasnodar in October.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Aston Villa in the Premier League on Monday (17:30 GMT), before Arsenal visit Brighton on Tuesday (18:00).\nMarcus Rashford Feeding Britain's Children: Follow the footballer's campaign for free school meals\nHis Dark Materials: Need a new box set for the festive period?

Federico Fernandez slid in to block Joao Cancelo's low cross but succeeded only in providing Torres with a clear sight of goal from eight yards.\nThat goal doubled the advantage given to City by Gundogan, who capitalised on Raheem Sterling's 14th-minute cut-back.\nRemarkably, the goal allowed City to equal the Premier League record of a side scoring in 24 consecutive games against the same club.\nBut it may well be of concern to Guardiola that his side failed to increase their tally.\nThey have still only scored more than twice in a single home game in the Premier League this season, although this was their fourth clean sheet in that run.\nGood night for Gundogan\nIt is coming up for four-and-a-half seasons since City paid Borussia Dortmund \u00a320m for Gundogan.\nSo keen was Guardiola to have the midfielder in his squad, he pushed the transfer through even though Gundogan had a patchy injury record and would not be fit for the start of his debut campaign.\nIt would be unfair to say the 30-year-old has failed to deliver.\nHe was given a new four-year contract in 2019 so Guardiola must be happy with him.\nHowever, the feeling remains he has not quite hit the heights anticipated and, as City come to terms with life without David Silva, the onus is on Gundogan to step up.\nGundogan has never scored more than six goals in a season. Friday night's effort takes him to four for the current campaign and the intelligent way he found space for Sterling to pick him out in a packed penalty area, then found the net through the narrowest of gaps, hints at someone who can do more.\nIt also means he has scored in consecutive home games and, in producing a tidy performance in an advanced role alongside De Bruyne - who is yet to score from open play - showed the capability to at least partially fill the void Silva's departure for Real Sociedad has left.\nForthcoming trips to Everton and Chelsea will offer an indication as to how close to Liverpool, City will get.\nFor Newcastle fans, the four days to wait for Liverpool's visit to St James' Park are unlikely to be filled with much optimism.\n'This season you have to be calm'\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"That is the tempo we need to play. Today our positional game was perfect, unfortunately we could not score more goals but it is a good result and three more points.\n\"We cannot think much, the schedule is a game every three days. The players are committed and focused.\n\"Last week we were 10th in the table, all the season is up and down. There are weird results for everyone, this season you have to be calm in the good and the bad moments.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce: \"The attitude was pleasing after a difficult week or so, you always know you will come here against a world-class team and we were beaten by the better side.\n\"It was a decent performance. The game in midweek has gone, we needed to respond to the criticism and they have done as much as they could. They rolled their sleeves up and had a go.\n\"You accept mistakes, the one thing I wanted to see was a response from a poor display in midweek and they did that.\"\nSterling thriving under Guardiola - the stats\nManchester City have won their last 12 Premier League home games against Newcastle, scoring 41 goals and conceding just seven.\nNewcastle have lost three of their past four away games in the Premier League (W1), more than they had in their previous eight on the road (W3 D3 L2).\nManchester City have kept 13 clean sheets in all competitions this season, more than any other team in the top five European leagues.\nNewcastle have lost more Boxing Day games than any other side in Premier League history (15), and have now lost each of their last six league games in a row on this date.\nRaheem Sterling's assist for City's opener was his 150th goal involvement in all competitions since Pep Guardiola joined in 2016 - he has scored 96 goals and made 54 assists, more than any other player at the club in that time.\nManchester City have won all seven games in all competitions in which Ferran Torres has scored for them, with five of his seven strikes coming at the Etihad.\nWhat next?\nCity's next Premier League game is against second-placed Everton at Goodison Park on Monday, 28 December (20:00GMT). Newcastle's next game is at home to leaders Liverpool at St James' Park on Wednesday, 30 December (20:00GMT).\nMarcus Rashford Feeding Britain's Children: Follow the footballer's campaign for free school meals\nHis Dark Materials: Need a new box set for the festive period?

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 0-1 Everton: Gylfi Sigurdsson's late winner sends Blues second\nEverton moved up to second in the Premier League after edging a tight contest against Sheffield United at rain-lashed Bramall Lane.\nGylfi Sigurdsson's late effort, which found the bottom-left corner, saw Carlo Ancelotti's side extend their winning run to four matches as they leapfrogged Leicester and Manchester United in the process.\nIt also inflicted more heartbreak on the Blades, who remain without a win and rooted to the bottom of the table.\nIn a game of few openings, Oliver Burke's flashing drive represented the hosts' best effort while Oli McBurnie steered a stoppage-time chance to rescue a point just wide.\n'Embarrassed' Sheffield United set unwanted records\nDominic Calvert-Lewin and Sigurdsson both threatened to break the deadlock for the visitors before the Iceland midfielder sealed all three points.\nThe victory marked Everton's first league game since Ancelotti's one-year anniversary at the helm and was the perfect response to the disappointment of their Carabao Cup quarter-final exit.\n\"These three points are very important for us,\" Ancelotti said.\n\"When I put on Andre Gomes I put Gylfi Sigurdsson a little bit back but he found the solution.\n\"We feel good also because we have problems at this moment with a lot of players out but this team has a lot of spirit and this is good. I am really pleased to manage these players.\n\"I am really pleased because I found the right club, a nice club, a family club. I live in a nice area so after one year I can say I was lucky.\"\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v singer Rick Astley\nPremier League Christmas fixtures: How to follow on TV\nAncelotti's side get the job done\nWhile Everton looked resolute in defence and competent in midfield there was a noticeable absence of invention to their play for large periods of this encounter.\nBut even without James Rodriguez, who is still nursing a calf injury and Richarlison who is adhering to concussion protocols, Ancelotti's side eventually got the job done.\nAfter a relatively uneventful opening, which the Blades appeared to shade, Alex Iwobi's speculative drive prompted more urgency from the Blues.\nEngland forward Calvert-Lewin almost scored a contender for goal of the season, expertly running on to and chesting Michael Keane's raking pass beyond Jack Robinson but then volleying just wide of the far-left corner from the edge of the penalty area.\nSigurdsson was next to go close, unloading a curling strike that just missed the top-right corner from 20 yards.\nHowever, after the interval they displayed few signs they were capable of a winner until Sigurdsson brilliantly latched on to Abdoulaye Doucoure's touch and dispatched a low drive past Aaron Ramsdale.\nEverton have now enjoyed four consecutive wins twice in a season for the first time since the 1986-87 campaign, when they were last champions of England.\nBlunt Blades lose again\nPrior to Sigurdsson's late intervention Sheffield United looked like they were going to collect only their third point of a dismal campaign.\nHowever, like so many of their other matches this season the result did not match the level of endeavour they showed.\nCollectively, Chris Wilder's side covered over five kilometres more than their high-flying opponents but found no reward for their hard running.\nThey have now lost 13 of their 15 Premier League fixtures, with 10 of those defeats by a solitary goal.\nBut until they add goals to their game the league table is going to continue to make for uncomfortable reading for Sheffield United supporters.\nOnly Burnley - also with eight goals - have been as unproductive in attack as the Blades, and while they managed more shots than Everton (10-7) just two, from Oliver Burke and David McGoldrick, found the target.\nWhile he was flagged offside McGoldrick's scampering run past Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, appeared symbolic of their season, when his tame effort was hacked off the line by Ben Godfrey.\n'We found the right opportunity' - what they said\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was the same as possibly a good dozen of the games we have played this season. It was a game of not many chances, we were playing a side bang in form but our lack of quality shone through.\n\"The same players that played with that momentum and belief from last year are not doing it this year. Nothing has really changed, the league hasn't changed, Everton haven't really changed but our team has in terms of the lack of quality we are showing this year.\n\"I can't go and play the game for them. One system against the other, we changed it a little bit but for me it is the same again, it is our lack of quality that let us down.\n\"There will not be the possibility of bringing many players in. We are looking to add one or two bits of quality. The players who are here are good enough to step up because they did it last year but they have to find that in themselves.\n\"Good, experienced players who have played at this level for a season are not sticking their hand up and making my job easier.\n\"I'll pack it in if I ever feel I have to motivate a side in the Premier League. That shouldn't be my job but the players need to go and express themselves and play with a bit of belief.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We defended well but also we didn't play so well with the ball but defensively we were strong and concentrated.\n\"We were patient. We were in the game and stayed in the game most times, we defended pretty well and we found the right opportunity to score a goal.\n\"Every game is really difficult, complicated. Sheffield United are a good team, we are really pleased to be second. We didn't expect that at the start of the season but we are there and we want to stay there.\nSuperb Sigurdsson - the stats\nEverton have won back-to-back away league games against Sheffield United for the first time since 1897.\nSheffield United are now winless in 18 consecutive Premier League games (D2 L16), conceding in every match - the longest run without a victory or a clean sheet among current teams in the competition.\nEverton have won four consecutive Premier League games for the second time this season. They last had two runs of four-plus wins in a single league season in 1986-87.\nSheffield United are the first side to end Boxing Day without a single Premier League win (D2 L13), while only QPR have gone longer without victory from the start of a season in the competition (16 games in 2012-13).\nEverton are unbeaten in their past eight away Premier League matches played on Boxing Day (W5 D3), since a 4-0 defeat at Aston Villa in 2005.\nIn all competitions, Gylfi Sigurdsson has been directly involved in seven goals (three goals, four assists) in 18 appearances for Everton this season, one more than he recorded in the whole of 2019-20 (six in 38 games).\nSheffield United have scored just four goals from 71 shots at home in the Premier League this season, the worst shot conversion rate in the competition (5.6%), while no side have scored fewer home goals.\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United travel to Burnley for their next Premier League fixture on Tuesday, 29 December (18:00 GMT).\nEverton return to top-flight action when they welcome Manchester City to Goodison Park on Monday, 28 December (20:00).\nMarcus Rashford Feeding Britain's Children: Follow the footballer's campaign for free school meals\nHis Dark Materials: Need a new box set for the festive period?

        "article_text": "Leeds United 1-0 Burnley: Patrick Bamford hits an early winner from the spot\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said the referee had a \"massive impact\" as his side narrowly lost to Leeds at Elland Road.\nPatrick Bamford converted an early penalty, after being brought down by Clarets keeper Nick Pope, to earn Leeds their third home win of the season.\nBurnley were unfortunate not to be level 13 minutes later when Ashley Barnes appeared to capitalise on Illan Meslier's mistake to spin inside the area and fire the loose ball into an empty net.\nThe 20-year-old Leeds goalkeeper was awarded a free-kick by referee Rob Jones, despite spilling the ball forward in what seemed like a fair aerial challenge with Ben Mee.\nDyche said Leeds would not have been awarded a penalty if the incident took place \"in the middle of the pitch\" and that it was \"impossible\" that there had been a foul in the build-up to Barnes' disallowed goal.\n\"You can't say it's decisive because there's more to the game than refereeing decisions but it's a shame I have to stand here and try and stay calm about it,\" Dyche told BBC Sport.\n\"Nick Pope got clear contact on the ball. VAR has been taking hours to make a decision but they don't give it a few seconds to even look at it.\"\nOn Burnley's disallowed goal, Dyche added: \"At the other end, the keeper goes through with his knee in Ben Mee's back. Ben has got nothing other than eyes for the ball, that is all he is concentrating on.\n\"The ball drops and the referee doesn't even give it a chance to see what happens, because it is not a foul, it's impossible it can be a foul when he's just tried to head the ball.\n\"Even in my day, if you put your knee in someone's back like that when they are trying to head the ball, you're not only giving a foul away, you're going to get booked, and nowadays you're probably in trouble.\n\"So I have no clue where the game is at physically at the moment.\"\nLeeds were the better side in the first half as they played with confidence despite their 6-2 defeat at Manchester United last Sunday, but the visitors improved after the interval as they went in search of an equaliser.\nTheir best opportunity fell to Barnes but the forward could only smash his volley straight at Meslier.\nVictory for the hosts lifts them into 11th place in the Premier League, while Burnley remain 16th.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nBielsa out to prove a point\nLeeds have been winning plaudits for their attacking play all season, but they were hit with some criticism for sticking to their style in the defeat by Manchester United.\nSpeaking before the game, their manager Marcelo Bielsa said: \"Normally, when there is adversity, what the press do is try to weaken the one who is facing adversity or to ridicule the style of play of a team.\"\nThe 'us against them' stance from the Leeds boss appeared to pay off as his players started the game on the front foot.\nThe hosts were able to transition from defence to attack quickly and their intent paid dividends when defender Luke Ayling's excellent pass beat the Burnley defence to find Bamford.\nThe forward, who follows Jamie Vardy and Dominic Calvert-Lewin in becoming the third English player to reach 10 Premier League goals this season, managed to nudge the ball past compatriot Pope to win the decisive spot-kick.\nThat theme continued for much of the first half as Leeds were quick to try to play into their lone striker, so much so that when Jack Harrison had the goal at his mercy, he could only fire his effort at the legs of Bamford.\nLeeds have conceded more goals (30) than any other team in the top flight this season, but with their slick style of transition, and Bamford in attack, they may just cause a few more upsets yet.\nDyche will feel hard done by\nBurnley crossed the Pennines in good form, having won two and drawn two of their previous four games, but they were missing a bit of luck in Leeds.\nBamford's early penalty was met by protests on and off the field as Pope may have had the faintest of touches on the ball, but the real disappointment will be Barnes' disallowed goal.\nMee only had eyes on the ball as he competed for possession with Meslier, but the Leeds keeper was given the benefit of the doubt by referee Robert Jones.\nThe Clarets are the joint lowest scorers in the league, with only eight goals so far this season, and that lack of clinical edge was evident after the break.\nFrom 10 second-half attempts, only four were on target, as Barnes produced two good Meslier saves from their best opportunities.\nSean Dyche's side were without the injured Dwight McNeil for the first time in 72 top-flight matches and the talented creative midfielder should be instrumental in changing Burnley's attacking fortunes when he returns.\n'They don't create many chances, when they do they are dangerous' - what they said\nMarcelo Bielsa, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I clearly have to signal in the first half we could have been leading by a bigger margin. In the second, we could have received a goal that would have meant a draw.\n\"It surprised me. Normally when a team is dominated in the first half, there is usually a reaction in the second half. We came out with the idea of looking for the second goal. But the way they played the game, prevented us from playing how I wanted to play.\n\"They are a team, although they don't create many chances, when they do they are dangerous.\"\nOn the Burnley goal being ruled out: \"Sincerely, I don't know whether the calls were correct or not. I just accept the decisions of the referees. As you ask the question, it seems we have benefitted from the decision.\"\nBack-to-back home wins for Leeds - the stats\nLeeds picked up their first league victory against Burnley since April 2013 when they also won 1-0, drawing once and losing three of the four previous meetings before Sunday.\nLeeds have won successive Premier League games at Elland Road for the first time since April 2004, with this their first win to nil at home in the competition since April 2003 against Fulham.\nBurnley have won just one of their last eight Premier League away games (drawn three, lost four), with the Clarets scoring just one goal in their last six on the road.\nBurnley have conceded seven penalties in the Premier League in 2020; only Tottenham have conceded more in this calendar year (eight).\nPatrick Bamford has scored 10 goals in 15 games for Leeds in the Premier League this season; the third-fewest appearances to reach 10 in the competition for the Whites, after Mark Viduka (nine) and Tony Yeboah (14).\nWhat's next?\nLeeds travel to West Brom on Tuesday, 29 December (18:00 GMT), while Burnley host Sheffield United at the same time.\nMarcus Rashford Feeding Britain's Children: Follow the footballer's campaign for free school meals\nHis Dark Materials: Need a new box set for the festive period?

They have been rewarded for their enterprising play with some impressive results, notably big wins against Wolves and Leicester and draws at Manchester City and Tottenham.\nIt was therefore perplexing that Moyes appeared to abandon that approach with a very negative team selection and set-up against Brighton.\nThe Hammers were dreadful in the first half as they failed to register a shot on target and deservedly found themselves behind.\nAfter the break, they were a different side. The introduction of Andriy Yarmolenko and Manuel Lanzini added the creative spark that had been missing and they took advantage of a Brighton side that struggled for composure after losing Adam Lallana to injury.\nHad Moyes shown more faith in his side's attacking capabilities from the start, they may have got more reward than the single point. The second-half performance will likely give him plenty to think about when setting up his side for similar games in the future.\nSeagulls' winless run continues\nThis has been a frustrating season for Brighton, who have often failed to get the reward their good play and possessional dominance has merited.\nIt was a similar story against West Ham, particularly in the first half when they were comfortably the better side and arguably should have had more than Maupay's goal to show for it.\nIt was always likely to be tougher in the second half, and credit should be given to the Seagulls for twice getting in front, but their defending for both the goals they conceded was disappointing. They failed to make the most of numerous opportunities to clear for West Ham's first and then left the obvious threat of Soucek unchecked for the second.\nIt is now just one victory in their past 14 games for Brighton and while a point at a solid West Ham side is a good result, the Seagulls need to find a way to get wins on the board again soon to avoid getting properly dragged into a battle for Premier League survival.\n'Frustration is the emotion' - what they said\nWest Ham manager David Moyes told BBC Sport: \"We saw a poor West Ham in the first half but we also saw a good Brighton team in the first half. They made it difficult for us but the resilience of the players kept us going and a few changes helped us.\n\"We thought it was the right time to have a look at a back five again but I felt we didn't press them well enough. Lanzini has been an important player for us in recent years and I'm hoping to get him back to the levels he has been because he is a talented player and we needed that.\"\nBrighton manager Graham Potter told BBC Sport: \"Frustration is the emotion at the moment. We felt we did enough for three points but the second goal is the one that has punished us, and if you don't defend that situation better, you come away with just one point.\n\"Over the course of the game, I felt we did a lot well, particularity in the first half. It is hard to control 90 minutes of a Premier League game. You have to accept the opposition will step forward and show some momentum. After the goal, we felt more in control and to see it out better is the thing we have to improve on.\"\nJohnson the youngest since Januzaj - the stats\nBrighton remain unbeaten against West Ham in the Premier League, although each of the past four meetings in the competition have ended level.\nWest Ham are winless in their past three Premier Leagues games at London Stadium, equalling their longest run without a win there since David Moyes returned to the club (three games between January and February).\nSince his Premier League debut in February, no player has scored more headed goals in the competition than West Ham's Tomas Soucek (four, level with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Harry Kane).\nWest Ham's Ben Johnson was the youngest player to score in the Premier League for a David Moyes side since April 2014, when Adnan Januzaj netted for Manchester United against Newcastle (aged 19 years and 59 days).\nNeal Maupay's opener for Brighton saw him end a run of 649 minutes without a goal in the Premier League - the Frenchman now has 15 goals for the Seagulls in the competition, with only Glenn Murray netting more (26).\nFive of Lewis Dunk's seven goals in the Premier League for Brighton have been scored from corners, while all seven have been from a set-piece situation.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham travel to Southampton on Tuesday, 29 December (18:00 GMT), while Brighton host Arsenal at the same time.\nMarcus Rashford Feeding Britain's Children: Follow the footballer's campaign for free school meals\nHis Dark Materials: Need a new box set for the festive period?

West Brom earn point at Liverpool\nKlopp's side dominated the first half, enjoying 84% possession, but were unable to add to a sumptuous finish by Senegal forward Mane.\nTheir dominance was highlighted by captain Jordan Henderson, who completed 39 more passes (85) than West Brom as a team (46) before half-time.\nBut the visitors were livelier after the break and, after Liverpool lost defender Joel Matip to injury, the hosts allowed West Brom a way back.\nAlisson did well to keep out Karlan Grant after the forward had got the better of Rhys Williams before Ajayi's equaliser.\nJohnstone's save to keep out Firmino at the end only added to Liverpool's frustration, their lead at the top now three points.\nBattling West Brom show fight\nIt looked like it was going to be a long afternoon for West Brom when Mane struck early but the Baggies dug deep to return to the Black Country with a crucial point.\nThis result will give Allardyce, the last opposition manager to win a Premier League game at Anfield, with Crystal Palace in April 2017, huge encouragement as he looks to keep his new team in the Premier League.\nA week after being beaten 3-0 at home by Aston Villa in his first game in charge, West Brom refused to go under against the leaders and showed the spirit and character needed in a relegation battle.\nHaving drawn 1-1 at Manchester City in Slaven Bilic's final game in charge, the Baggies have now taken points off last season's top two clubs.\nAllardyce, whose side are still five points from safety, will need help when the transfer market opens next month.\nBut this result against a Liverpool side which had won the previous eight home league games will lift morale ahead of Tuesday's home game with Leeds.\n'It feels like a defeat' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It does feel like a defeat, but we have a point more than before so it is completely fine.\n\"It's our fault but they deserved the point. In the first half it looked like 90:10 possession - it's a massive challenge to stay on track and do it again but we should have done it.\"\nWest Brom boss Sam Allardyce: \"We've got a point against Liverpool, which no-one outside of us in the dressing room thought we'd get.\n\"When the first goal went in I think a lot of people thought how many was it going to be today, particularly after they knocked seven past Palace (last weekend).\n\"The players were so good today in their discipline, defending as a team, and finding a way in the second half to attack Liverpool when they got the opportunity.\"\nLiverpool fail to win for a sixth time - the stats\nLiverpool have failed to win six of their 15 Premier League games this season, as many as they did in the entire 2019-20 season.\nHaving picked up just one point from their opening six away league games this season, West Brom have since earned two from their last two on the road away to Manchester City and Liverpool.\nThis was the first time Liverpool failed to win a Premier League home game against a side starting the day in the relegation zone - despite taking the lead - since a 2-2 draw with Slaven Bilic's West Ham in December 2016.\nAmong defenders since the start of the 2018-19 season, only Virgil van Dijk and Aaron Pierre (both nine) have scored more headed league goals in England's top four tiers than West Brom's Semi Ajayi (eight).\nSadio Mane scored his 69th Premier League goal for Liverpool, moving him level with Luis Su\u00e1rez and behind only Robbie Fowler (128), Steven Gerrard (120), Michael Owen (118) and Mohamed Salah (86) for most goals in the competition for the Reds.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool's festive programme continues at Newcastle on Wednesday (20:00 GMT), while West Brom host Leeds United on Tuesday (18:00 GMT).\nMarcus Rashford Feeding Britain's Children: Follow the footballer's campaign for free school meals\nHis Dark Materials: Need a new box set for the festive period?

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Romain Saiss scores late equaliser to deny Spurs\nRomain Saiss produced a header that watching Wolves team-mate Raul Jimenez would have been proud of to deny Tottenham victory at Molineux, and a place in the top-four.\nJose Mourinho's men led for 85 minutes after Tanguy Ndombele had driven home a low 20-yard shot from Ben Davies' lay-off after just 57 seconds.\nBut, just as it appeared their dominance would earn no reward in the continued absence of Jimenez - attending a game for the first time since fracturing his skull at Arsenal at the end of November - Wolves struck an equaliser.\nMorocco defender Saiss met Pedro Neto's corner at the near post with a superb glancing header to steer the ball past Hugo Lloris.\nIt was the least Wolves deserved after their efforts at shackling Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\nSpurs' star duo rarely got a clean sight of goal and, although Sergio Reguilon might have made the game safe for Tottenham, they paid the price for retreating too far into their shell.\nAfter the game, Mourinho said it was never his intention to defend the slender lead and instead questioned his players for not showing more ambition to go for more goals.\nHe told BBC Sport: \"Defending deep, that's not the intention. They know what I asked them at half-time, if they couldn't do better it's because they couldn't do better.\"\nMourinho added: \"We are frustrated with the result. We had control of the game, but we had 89 minutes to score more goals and we didn't.\n\"It was not just about not scoring goals, it was also about not being dangerous and not being ambitious. For me, that's the problem.\"\nTottenham, who would have gone third with the win, move to fifth, splitting the two Manchester clubs, who both have a match in hand.\nWolves are 11th and might have won it in the final minute of injury-time when Fabio Silva headed straight at Lloris.\nReaction to Wolves v Tottenham, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nPremier League Christmas fixtures: How to follow on TV\nWolves in transition\nWhile Jimenez's presence was poignant for the hosts, that defenders Jonny Otto and Willy Boly were with him in the same executive box as they recover from injury was significant.\nWith Matt Doherty playing against his old club for Spurs and Diogo Jota now at Liverpool, half of what would be considered as Nuno Espirito Santo's preferred team from the past two seasons was not available to him.\nAs Nuno has implemented a new style of play as well, there was an element of transition about this season even without the injury to Jimenez.\nSince the Mexican striker's injury, Wolves have won one of five matches.\nWolves were excellent in possession but their attacks petered out in the final third. Daniel Podence brought a decent save out of Lloris before the break and both Silva and Neto threatened the Tottenham goal.\nWolves are looking for a striker but a loan inquiry for Real Madrid's Luka Jovic looks destined to fail.\nIn the meantime, they are living off scraps, such as the second-half penalty claim for a foul on Silva by Eric Dier that was rejected by VAR.\nSome Wolves fans are getting impatient, which is harsh in the extreme, especially when they retain the character and determination that Nuno has spent so long building and which earned them a point when all appeared lost.\n\"I think we performed really well, I think we played a very good game. The result is the consequence,\" Nuno said.\n\"We conceded very early in the game, but the team reacted and we played well, very intense, very aggressive against a very dangerous side, very good, very talented. But we played well. I'm happy.\"\nOutstanding Ndombele\nWhen Tottenham played Burnley last March in the game immediately before lockdown, Ndombele was hauled off at half-time, with Mourinho complaining afterwards the midfielder had failed to follow instructions.\nThe halt to the season created a three-month void which was filled by endless chatter about the France midfielder's future.\nSpeculation grew so intense, Spurs eventually responded, letting it be known their \u00a353.8m record signing was going nowhere.\nThat faith has been rewarded this term. For, while Kane and Son have attracted all the attention, Ndombele has started delivering the performances his price-tag demands.\nRui Patricio did not cover himself in glory for Ndombele's goal - but the strike means the former Lyon man has already matched the total from his debut campaign. Amazingly, it was only the fourth Spurs goal this season that has not involved Kane or Son.\nThe charge out of defence that followed not long afterwards was majestic, taking him from one penalty area to the other, the only disappointment coming through Reguilon's failure to finish as he drove his shot straight at Patricio in the Wolves goal.\nSpanish full-back Reguilon had already glanced a header wider by that point but after that, Ndombele's best work was through holding his position and not allowing the Wolves attack to come through.\nMind you, when he brought the midfielder's evening to an end 20 minutes from time, Mourinho jumped out of the dugout to deliver instructions and completely ignored the man he had brought off, providing the era of tough love is not at an end.\nAs it turned out, the job was not complete.\nSpurs' late woes - the stats\nSpurs have dropped nine points in 2020/21 with goals conceded in the last 10 minutes of matches, the most of any side in the Premier League.\nSince the start of the 2018-19 season, only Liverpool (45) and Manchester United (44) have won more points from losing positions in the Premier League than Wolves (40).\nSpurs are now winless in four Premier League matches, their worst run since a four-game run between February and June earlier this year.\nSince having 18 shots in the second half of their game against West Brom, Spurs have just 22 shots in the second half of their last seven Premier League matches, mustering just one attempt in the second half of this match.\nFour of Saiss' last five Premier League goals for Wolves have been headers scored via a corner.\nWolves conceded after only 57 seconds, the earliest goal they had conceded in the Premier League since April 2012 against Swansea City (Andrea Orlandi, 22 seconds).\nTottenham scored their 11th Premier League goal in the opening minute of a match - only Chelsea (12) have scored more first-minute Premier League goals.\nWolves' starting XI for this match featured seven Portuguese players (Patricio, Nelson Semedo, Neto, Joao Moutinho, Silva, Podence and Ruben Neves), the joint-most non-English players from the same country in a team's starting XI in Premier League history: Fulham had seven French players in their XI vs Middlesbrough in 2003, and Newcastle had seven Frenchmen vs Liverpool in 2013.\nWhat next?\nWolves have a quick turnaround to their next game and visit Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Tuesday, 29 December (20:00 GMT). Tottenham have a bit longer to prepare for their home London derby with Fulham on Wednesday, 30 December (18:00 GMT).\nMarcus Rashford Feeding Britain's Children: Follow the footballer's campaign for free school meals\nHis Dark Materials: Need a new box set for the festive period?

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-1 Leicester City: Harvey Barnes rescues point for visitors\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson said it took an \"apoplectic\" half-time team talk from assistant boss Ray Lewington to spark them into life in Monday's draw with Leicester.\nComing after a 7-0 thrashing by Liverpool and a 3-0 loss to 10-man Aston Villa, Palace were second best throughout the first 45 minutes and only got to half-time goalless after Vicente Guaita saved Kelechi Iheanachi's 19th-minute penalty.\n\"We were dumbfounded that we were as passive as we were,\" Hodgson told Match of the Day.\n\"We were not at all happy with our first half. They were more aggressive than us and we were being pressured into mistakes.\"\nThe hosts were much more combative after half-time, however, and took the lead when Wilfried Zaha finished superbly from Andros Townsend's cross, only for Harvey Barnes' second goal in as many games to rescue a point for the Foxes.\n\"It almost cost [Lewington] a heart attack to produce that energy,\" Hodgson said in a separate interview with Amazon Prime. \"That is what Crystal Palace want to be and we pressurised the ball so much better.\n\"We looked dangerous going forward but unfortunately we did not get the full three points because Barnes scored with a wonderful strike.\"\nLeicester, who made seven alterations to the team that drew with Manchester United on Saturday, registered 17 attempts but failed to test Guaita from open play until Barnes' late goal.\nThe visitors' only other effort on target was from Ayoze Perez, whose first-half free-kick was easily held by the Spanish goalkeeper.\nThe point lifts the visitors up to second in the Premier League table, while Palace move eight points clear of the bottom three.\nA step in the right direction for Palace\nHaving watched his side lose to Aston Villa 48 hours previously, Hodgson may have welcomed the quick turnaround as an opportunity to make amends for that painful defeat.\nAfter Guaita's penalty save, former Foxes player Jeffrey Schlupp - making his 100th Premier League appearance for Palace - teed up Townsend on the edge of the six-yard box but the winger could only scuff his effort wide.\nAs has so often been the case this season, it was Zaha who provided the Eagles' inspiration.\nThe 28-year-old connected superbly with Townsend's in-swinging cross to power an unstoppable volley past Kasper Schmeichel for his eighth league goal of the season.\nHodgson will be frustrated at his team's inability to hold on to their slender lead, but following those heavy defeats against Liverpool and Villa, this was certainly a step in the right direction.\nFrustration for wasteful Foxes\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers said his team showed the personality of a \"huge club\" against Manchester United, but he will be disappointed with his team's profligacy in south-east London.\nJamie Vardy, James Maddison and Youri Tielemans were only named as substitutes, but the visitors created enough opportunities in the first half to establish a comfortable lead.\nIheanacho's penalty was too close to Guaita, allowing the Spaniard to claw the ball to safety.\nDennis Praet blazed over from a tight angle after Perez's deflected cross had struck the top of the crossbar, before Iheanacho sent a close-range header off target from the Belgian's delivery.\nThe Foxes struggled to carve out meaningful opportunities in the second half until Barnes sidestepped several Palace defenders and drilled low past Guaita for his eighth goal of the season in all competitions.\nLeicester could have claimed all three points deep into second-half stoppage time, but Perez's wayward shot from James Justin's pass encapsulated a frustrating afternoon for Rodgers and his players.\n'Much happier with the second half' - what the managers said\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers, speaking to Match of the Day: \"If you get the goal from the penalty, it gives you a foothold in the game but we had good control and then we didn't start the second half at all well.\n\"Palace were aggressive and we give away a bad goal from our point of view. But the reaction is what really pleases, some of our play and the speed of our game was really good. We end up frustrated not to win the game.\n\"You can't play Jamie Vardy and some of these guys every single minute. Harvey Barnes is developing really well, it's a great finish, the strike was fantastic. He's been a real threat for us this season.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We were much happier with the second half and we got our reward with the goal. Barnes' strike was a good goal and then the last 10 minutes were tough for us but we saw it through.\"\nEagles' wait for clean sheet goes on - the stats\nCrystal Palace haven't won their final league game in any of the last nine calendar years (D7 L2), last doing so against Millwall in the Championship in 2011 (1-0).\nLeicester City have lost just one of their eight away Premier League games in 2020-21 (W6 D1), after losing five and drawing three of their final eight games on the road last season.\nCrystal Palace have kept just one clean sheet in their last 24 Premier League games, conceding in each of their last 15 in the competition since beating Southampton 1-0 on the opening day.\nLeicester City won their 10th penalty in just their 16th Premier League game this season, the quickest side ever to reach spot-kick double-figures in a season in the competition.\nVicente Guaita became the first Crystal Palace goalkeeper to save a penalty in the Premier League since Wayne Hennessey vs Southampton in September 2018, with that save just the eighth made by a Palace glovesman in the competition (out of 43 faced).\nCrystal Palace attacker Wilfried Zaha made his 200th Premier League start for the Eagles, the joint-most for the club along with Joel Ward, and netted his fifth top-flight goal against Leicester, more than against any other side.\nLeicester's Harvey Barnes has scored eight goals in 21 games in all competitions this season - one more than he netted in 42 appearances for the Foxes last term.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace welcome Sheffield United to Selhurst Park in their next league game on 2 January (kick-off 15:00 GMT), while Leicester travel to Newcastle a day later (14:15 GMT).\nFestive food: Think you've eaten enough to master this quiz?\nDunkirk (2017) is streaming now: Christopher Nolan's wartime epic on the legendary evacuation"

When you're having a tough moment like we are, sometimes that goes against you. That last bit wasn't quite there today because we haven't got the rub of the green at the minute.\n\"The response was exactly right other than the win. We had a couple of little chances. It felt like the pressure was coming from us. This is our tough period at the moment. We have to fight for it and we'll be stronger for it.\n\"You want to get results at this point of the year. I could feel the players' disappointment at the end because they want to win.\n\"A few weeks ago people were talking about us as title challengers, now it's a difficult period. The new players are going to get better as they come along.\"\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith, speaking to MOTD: \"It's a battling point for us. They got beat in the last game so I certainly understand that. In my head, I was thinking whether to go with fresh legs or with momentum and confidence.\n\"I looked the players in the eye and they looked ready to start the game. You've got to find a balance between defending and attacking and I thought we did that really well.\n\"It's only our second season back in the Premier League. You have to build gradually. We had 13 new players last season but only five this year. They've settled in quickly.\n\"We've got some tough games coming up. Every game is tough, but momentum and confidence is a big thing.\"\nOn Anwar El Ghazi: \"He had an up-and-down season last season. We started this season really well with Jack on one side and Trezeguet on the other. Him and Bertrand (Traore) have seized their chance. Anwar's come in and scored five goals in five games, you can't argue with that.\"\nStamford Bridge the fortress - the stats\nChelsea have lost just one of their last 14 Premier League home games (W10 D3), with that lone defeat coming against Liverpool earlier this season.\nSince losing at Liverpool in July, Aston Villa have only suffered one defeat in their last nine away games in the Premier League (W5 D3).\nAston Villa have conceded 51 Premier League goals away at Chelsea - only against Man City and Man Utd (both 53) have they conceded more on the road in the competition.\nAston Villa haven't kept a clean sheet in any of their last 20 Premier League away games against Chelsea since a 1-0 win in March 1998.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2012, Giroud has scored more headed goals than any other player in the competition (32).\nEl Ghazi is the first Aston Villa player to score in three successive Premier League appearances since Tom Cleverley in May 2015.\nChilwell equalled his Premier League season-best tally of four assists, with the Chelsea left-back having as many goal involvements in this campaign as 2019/20 (six - two goals, four assists).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Manchester City on Sunday, 3 January (16:30 GMT), while Aston Villa travel to Manchester United on New Year's Day (20:00).\nFestive food: Think you've eaten enough to master this quiz?\nDunkirk (2017) is streaming now: Christopher Nolan's wartime epic on the legendary evacuation"

But I'm happy that it worked quite well, I think.\"\nTop scorer Danny Ings returned for the hosts, having missed Saturday's 0-0 draw with Fulham through injury, and was denied what would have been a well-taken early opener after Che Adams strayed offside in the build-up.\nRyan Fredericks' header, collected by Alex McCarthy, was West Ham's first shot on target after 41 minutes.\nTomas Soucek went close to heading his fifth goal of the season as the Hammers upped their intensity in the second half, before substitute Said Benrahma was denied a late winner at close range by McCarthy.\nThe result leaves both sides winless in four league games, with Southampton three points above West Ham in 10th.\nReaction to Tuesday's Premier League action\nPlenty to ponder for absent Hasenhuttl\nThe usually animated Hasenhuttl was a noticeable absentee from the sidelines for Southampton, self-isolating while the club \"assess the situation further\" following the announcement a little more than three hours before kick-off that he would be unable to attend.\nThough his side were unable to find a winner, Tuesday's draw means only Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea have won more points in the Premier League than Southampton in 2020.\nThat statistic serves as further testament to Saints' remarkable turnaround from their struggles at the start of the 2019-20 campaign. However, Hasenhuttl will now be wary of his side fading away following their excellent start to this campaign.\nDespite Ings' recovery from a hamstring problem, Southampton have scored just once in their four-game winless run and drew a blank for a third successive league game.\nIngs looked sharp as he beat two defenders with a clever chip before firing past goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, only to see his effort correctly disallowed by the linesman as his wait for a 50th Premier League goal continued.\nBoosted by Oriol Romeu's return following his suspension after amassing 10 bookings, Southampton were frustrated by a stubborn West Ham defence; Theo Walcott's low shot from outside the box was the closest they went to a breakthrough after half-time.\nThings do not get any easier for Hasenhuttl's side as they look to rediscover their form, with Liverpool and Leicester to come next.\nSteady improvement for Hammers\nDavid Moyes received some criticism for taking a cautious approach in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Brighton, but it was one which was justified here as his side took a point back to London.\nThe Hammers had conceded five goals in two games prior to their trip to St Mary's, but they effectively nullified the Saints threat as both Adams and Ings were caught offside in the hosts' best early openings.\nWatford loanee Craig Dawson partnered Angelo Ogbonna in defence for his first Hammers league start - one of five changes made by Moyes, who deployed Manuel Lanzini and Andriy Yarmolenko either side of Sebastien Haller in attack.\nThe visitors initially struggled to create opportunities of their own, fashioning two rare first-half openings with Fredericks' saved header and Lanzini's strike over the bar.\nBut they produced a much improved second-half display, which saw the return of forward Michail Antonio from injury and almost ended with Benrahma sealing all three points.\nThis was an important point for Moyes' side to ensure they remain in touch with Southampton and the rest of the Premier League's top half. That is a sign of encouraging progress for West Ham, who were hovering above the relegation places at this same stage last season.\n'It was a little surprising for me' - what the managers said\nSouthampton assistant boss Richard Kitzbichler, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was a little surprising for me to be on the sideline today. It can always happen in times like this and I think we coped with the situation.\n\"We always like to score goals and we are used to scoring goals. Now it is a little bit harder and we have to work on that. I am also very happy we have kept this clean sheet. We have to get back in shape now for an important first game of the new year [against Liverpool].\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes: \"I'd have to say yes [I'm happy with a point]. We barely had a kick for 15 minutes, Southampton were very good. I thought we grew into the game in the second half and arguably had the best chance of the game.\n\"It was good to get Michail [Antonio] back. We have perhaps not played as well as we would like to in recent games but the players who have come in have done great. I want competition for places.\"\nEver-present Ward-Prowse - the stats\nSouthampton have recorded back-to-back goalless draws in the Premier League for the first time since October 2018 under Mark Hughes.\nWest Ham manager David Moyes has lost just one of his past 13 Premier League games against Southampton.\nSouthampton are winless in their past four league games, their longest run since going eight without a win from September to November 2019.\nSaints midfielder James Ward-Prowse made his 73rd consecutive Premier League appearance - the longest ongoing run of any outfield player in the competition.\nAged 30 years and 237 days, Craig Dawson became the oldest English outfield player to make his Premier League debut for West Ham since Roger Johnson, in January 2014.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham are away to Everton on Friday at 17:30 GMT. Southampton host leaders Liverpool on Monday at 20:00."

Smith\nBurnley's main man Mee\nWhile there was little to separate the sides, centre-back Mee underlined his importance to Burnley with another impressive display alongside James Tarkowski.\nWithout Mee, Burnley are a different side, shipping 12 goals in their first six games his season.\nSince his return from a thigh injury the Clarets' back four has returned to its obdurate and organised best, resulting in a gradual climb away from the bottom three.\nApart from their now annual drubbing at Manchester City, Burnley's goal's against column has looked significantly healthier, with Mee overseeing the concession of just three goals in the other eight matches.\nAgainst a Sheffield United side struggling in front of goal, he looked confident and composed, having more touches than any other Burnley player.\nHe also snuffed out danger well, with one particularly timely block after McGoldrick had escaped down the left, before providing the match-winning contribution.\nBlades fail to combat Burnley aerial threat\nWhile Burnley have noticeably improved since being able to reintroduce Mee, Jack O'Connell's injury has clearly had a negative impact on Sheffield United.\nThe central defender, who is unlikely to return before spring and could yet be out for the entire season, was a key component last term when they kept 13 clean sheets.\nWith his absence keenly felt, the Blades are now the only side in the Premier League yet to keep a clean sheet this term, having conceded 11 more goals than at the same stage of the 2019-20 campaign.\nTheir inability to combat Burnley's aerial threat led to both Barnes and Wood going close but worse was to follow.\nEthan Ampadu and Jack Robinson were both caught under the flight of Robbie Brady's corner, which allowed Mee to score from an improbable position, surrounded by Sheffield United defenders.\nIn the build-up to the game Blades boss Chris Wilder had called his players \"streetfighters\" but those qualities did not come to the fore until they had gone a goal behind.\nAnd despite dominating the second period, they were guilty of overplaying at times, with McGoldrick's effort forcing Pope into his only real save of note.\n'It has always been an incredible fight ' - what they said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"Working hard without the ball has seen us through a tough game. We were playing against a Sheffield United side who I think are a good side - talk about a team that is fighting, they are fighting and put us under pressure in the second half.\n\"We thought it would be a tight game because you look at their scorelines and they are tight. There were not many chances overall but it was the quality of chances, that is important for us.\n\"We didn't take them but we scored from the set-piece and the way we saw the game out, I thought we were outstanding.\n\"We believe in the set-piece work we do here. We simplify it for the players and put the onus on them to attack the ball.\"\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder: \"I think we were a little bit naive at times in certain aspects of the game. They got their noses in front and did what they needed to do to see the game out. A big three points for them and another defeat for us.\n\"Late on they just sat in and worked their socks off which they do as a team and we struggled to find that space and that pass that would get us back in the game.\n\"I am saying the same thing again. It was a good start by them but we got a foothold in the game and started to dictate and had a couple of opportunities. Yet again [we were] not showing that quality that decides the game.\n\"The year we had last year was a perfect storm for us, we took big moments and found that bit of quality. This time we don't find that bit of quality and it marries up with the results. It is a big arm wrestle and a big struggle for us.\"\nBurnley's home comforts - the stats\nBurnley secured consecutive home Premier League victories for the first time since October 2019.\nBurnley have won three of their last four home Premier League games (D1), as many as in their previous 13 combined (W3 D4 L6).\nSheffield United have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 19 Premier League games since a 3-0 victory against Chelsea in July.\nSheffield United's Oliver Burke has not ended on the winning side in any of his first 25 appearances in the Premier League - the longest winless start to a player's career in the competition (overtaking Gareth Bale's 24 appearances).\nBurnley's Ben Mee scored his first Premier League goal at Turf Moor in 76 games since scoring against Crystal Palace in January 2015. Four of Mee's five Premier League goals have been headers.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley are scheduled to host Fulham in their next Premier League game on Sunday, 3 January (12:00 GMT).\nSheffield United visit Crystal Palace for their next top-flight game on Saturday, 2 January (15:00 GMT).\nFestive food: Think you've eaten enough to master this quiz?\nDunkirk (2017) is streaming now: Christopher Nolan's wartime epic on the legendary evacuation"

        "article_text": "Brighton 0-1 Arsenal: 'It's a different world,' says Mikel Arteta after back-to-back wins\nArsenal are now in a \"different world\", according to manager Mikel Arteta, after they recorded back-to-back league wins for the first time since September by beating Brighton.\nBefore Christmas, Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer was among those to question whether the Gunners had what it took to retain the place in the top flight they have held since 1919.\nDefeat at Everton on 19 December left them only four points above the relegation zone after 14 games - their worst start to the season since 1974-75.\nBut fortunes changed with a surprise 3-1 victory over Chelsea last weekend, which has now been followed up by this latest success.\n\"In this period, we know how much we needed the wins,\" Arteta said.\n\"We had a really tough week and it wasn't that much about the performance, it was about the result.\n\"You need the results to start confidence and now with two wins, I think everyone is in a much better mood.\n\"The best medicine is wins - it's a different world and a different story. The picture looks much better at the moment. We need that more consistency and try to win again.\"\nArteta, in charge of Arsenal since December 2019, said he had suffered \"in some moments\" this year, but had the support of the club.\nThe Spaniard, 38, added: \"Considering the context we're in now, the pandemic and the problems we've had recently, it's been quite a challenge.\n\"I'm enjoying and suffering in some moments, but I have great people around me and a great organisation.\"\nTuesday's display lacked the fizz of that 3-1 win over the Blues, and they were particularly sluggish in the first half when they only managed one effort on goal.\nHowever, the tempo and urgency was turned up a couple of notches after the break, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Gabriel Martinelli going close before French striker Alexandre Lacazette fired home in the 66th minute.\nThe second-half substitute had only been on the pitch 29 seconds when he swept in Bukayo Saka's ball for his third goal in three games.\nBrighton boss Graham Potter left forwards Neal Maupay and Danny Welbeck on the bench - two of six changes made to the starting XI. His side once again looked comfortable and composed on the ball but it was a frustrating story in attack.\nThe closest the home side came to scoring was when Alireza Jahanbakhsh forced a sharp save from Bernd Leno at his near post.\nArsenal climb up to 13th and now have 20 points, while Brighton remain two points above the drop zone in 17th.\nSecond-half revival benefits Arsenal\nDid Kieran Tierney give Arsenal's half-time team-talk?\nThe Scotland full-back was adamant that the emphatic victory over the Blues was partly due to the side starting on the front foot, so it came as a slight surprise that the Gunners retreated into their shells during the first half against Brighton.\nAubameyang replaced Lacazette in the starting XI, but he was left chasing scraps as his team-mates failed to provide him with adequate service. Thankfully for the club's fans, it was a match of two halves - their team looked rejuvenated after the break.\nAubameyang went close soon after the restart when he attempted to turn home Saka's cross but was thwarted by the knee of Robert Sanchez. His side then broke through.\nSaka, exceptional on the flanks, this time set up Lacazette, who barely had time to get his studs dirty as he fired his shot past the Seagulls keeper.\nThe display was in stark contrast with that shown against Chelsea, but the result is the same and will give Arsenal and their fans heart as they head into 2021.\nBrighton fall short again\nSeagulls supporters might question why their manager chose to leave two of his potent forwards out of the line-up.\nHad Maupay, their leading scorer this season, and Welbeck been involved in the first half, then would Brighton have made more of their first-half dominance?\nJahanbakhsh was competent in leading the attack, but only had two efforts on goal. He was wild with one strike from Bernardo's cross and saw another snap-shot saved by Arsenal's German stopper Leno.\nPotter brought on Maupay, along with wingers Leandro Trossard and Solly March, but by this stage Arsenal were 1-0 up and had seized the initiative - which they were not going to relinquish.\nThe Brighton boss remained in good spirits, despite his side having last won in the league on 21 November.\n\"There was lots to be positive about, certainly first half,\" he said.\n\"I thought we did well in the game against a team that has some good attacking players.\n\"It's just frustrating that we're not winning or picking up the points we'd like to.\n\"We're doing some things well but we need to carry on improving. This league is so demanding, so punishing. These things can happen and we have to stick together as a group.\"\nArsenal defence shine again - stats\nBrighton have won just one of their past 14 Premier League games, drawing seven and losing six.\nArsenal have won back-to-back league games this season for the first time since their opening two games back in September.\nBrighton end 2020 with just one Premier League home win (17 games), the lowest total of victories on home soil in a calendar year in the history of the competition (excluding promoted and relegated teams, who did not complete a calendar year in the top flight).\nArsenal kept their fourth away clean sheet of the season in the Premier League, a figure only Aston Villa can better in 2020-21 (five).\nLacazette has scored in each of his past three games for Arsenal in all competitions, after netting just once in his previous 12.\nHe scored 29 seconds after entering the field, the quickest goal by an Arsenal substitute in the Premier League since that data was first recorded at the start of the 2006-07 season.\nSince the start of last season, Bukayo Saka has registered 15 assists in all competitions for Arsenal, more than any other player for the club.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton host Wolves on Saturday (17:30 GMT) and Arsenal are at struggling West Brom on the same day (20:00 GMT).\nFestive food: Think you've eaten enough to master this quiz?\nDunkirk (2017) is streaming now: Christopher Nolan's wartime epic on the legendary evacuation"

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 0-5 Leeds United: Sam Allardyce rues heavy defeat\nWest Brom manager Sam Allardyce says an embarrassing 5-0 defeat by Leeds United shows he has a \"tougher challenge\" to keep his new club up than he thought.\nAllardyce had been encouraged by the 1-1 draw at champions Liverpool on Sunday, but saw his team outclassed by a Leeds side which was also promoted from the Championship last season.\nThe Baggies remain second bottom and are five points adrift of safety.\n\"Liverpool was fantastic, but this was dreadful,\" said Allardyce.\nLeeds scored four goals in a rampant first-half display at The Hawthorns, but were gifted the opening goal when home midfielder Romaine Sawyers bizarrely passed into his own net from 25 yards.\nFrom that point Leeds utterly dominated. Ezgjan Alioski's crisp drive and Jack Harrison's thumping close-range finish left Albion trailing 3-0, while worryingly devoid of ideas and confidence.\nRodrigo's deflected shot put Leeds 4-0 ahead before half-time - but there was no let up for the hosts after the break.\nAnother swift attack ended in Brazilian winger Raphinha cutting inside from the right and curling beautifully into the top corner for the fifth.\nFormer England manager Allardyce, 66, is still searching for his first win since replacing the sacked Slaven Bilic. In his first game in charge, West Brom were beaten 3-0 at home by Aston Villa on 20 December.\n\"I didn't think it was such a tough challenge when we played Liverpool but tonight it's made it even tougher than I thought it was by the way we collapsed,\" said Allardyce, who has never been relegated during spells in charge of Bolton, Newcastle, Blackburn, West Ham, Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Everton.\n\"Two sides who just got promoted, 11 v 11 and what a difference between the two.\n\"We need to make sure we don't dish up another performance like that.\"\nLeeds, who were promoted back to the top flight in July after a 16-year absence, move up to 11th place with 23 points from their opening 16 games.\nBut Leeds head coach Marcelo Bielsa has warned his side must strive to perform more consistently in the Premier League after demonstrating all of their attacking flair.\n\"We have only been in this league for 16 games and there are still many challenges and many tests we have to pass before we can legitimately say we belong,\" said Bielsa.\n\"We have to keep doing the same and keep doing it over a longer period of time.\"\nSwashbuckling Leeds provide a Bielsa masterclass\nTwo of the most recognisable managers in English football came head to head for the first time, with the contrasting styles of Allardyce and Bielsa promising to offer an intriguing clash.\nIn truth, it proved a mismatch as Allardyce's pragmatic approach was destroyed by Bielsa's attacking philosophy in a one-sided first half.\nOpinion on Bielsa's methods appeared to be polarised in the reaction to his team's 6-2 defeat at Manchester United before Christmas, yet performances of this calibre fully justify why the Argentine will not alter his tactics - whoever the opposition.\nAnd why would he? It is a style which has transformed Leeds from an average Championship team into a swashbuckling side which is catching the eye in the Premier League.\nTrue, there might be the odd blip along the way - there were also heavy defeats against Leicester and Crystal Palace - but very few Leeds fans would want to see anything different.\nAgainst Albion, they produced a masterclass of Bielsa's philosophy. Leeds held 75% possession, made 750 passes to Albion's 238 and had 14 shots compared to just four from their hosts.\nUnited have now scored 30 goals in the Premier League this season, meaning the only newly-promoted team in the competition's history to have netted more after their first 16 games of a season was Newcastle in 1993-94 (31).\nNot only are they impressing in an attacking sense though. While they have conceded 30 goals courtesy of those heavy defeats, the Whites have also kept six clean sheets.\nDefensively they were rarely troubled by Albion, who mustered their only shot on target in the second half.\nBy that time the game was long gone after Leeds' incisiveness was matched by top-quality finishing.\n\"It was a game where we defended well and we were efficient up front. From eight chances we scored five and that helped the result,\" added Bielsa.\n\"We played a serious game throughout and we managed the ball well, not committing any errors for them to attack us, apart from a few cases in the second half.\n\"Only two games ago we had an important defeat and our idea is to play in a consistent manner.\"\nBizarre own goal hampers Allardyce's Albion\nWhile nobody can argue Leeds did not deserve to win by such a scoreline, Albion will rue the bizarre own goal from Sawyers which swung the match in the visitors' favour.\nUnder little pressure after the home side had won back possession in their own half, Sawyers attempted to play the ball back to Sam Johnstone without looking. However, the Albion keeper was out of position as he had moved out left to try and give an easier option to Sawyers.\nAllardyce could scarcely believe what he had seen, slumping back into his dugout seat with his arms folded as he saw his gameplan ripped up inside 10 minutes.\n\"The own goal is a mistake, Romaine thought the keeper was there but he should have looked,\" Allardyce said.\n\"It was the last thing we wanted. Before I came we were riddled with conceding early goals and this time we gave them a Christmas present.\"\nThe Baggies showed organisation, resilience and fight to earn a point against Liverpool. None of that was evident against Leeds.\nAllardyce had named the same starting XI which played at Anfield, explaining he wanted to build consistency and reward the players who fought hard to earn that point.\nYet it appeared to backfire as they looked sluggish and unable to cope with the energy of a vibrant Leeds side - who themselves were unchanged from Sunday's gritty win against Burnley.\nAfter Sawyers' error, Leeds sensed Albion's deflation and seized their opportunity to wrap up victory before half-time. Positives were few and far between for the home side, although they did manage to limit Leeds to just one more goal after the break.\n\"I was shocked to see such a poor performance and we have to work hard to put it right,\" said Allardyce.\n\"Consistency is everything for us. We can't seem to get a consistency of attacking and defending right.\n\"When we lost the ball and tried to defend we were terrible, we have got to get that balance right in the transition. Life will get difficult if we cant get results quickly.\"\nMan of the match - Stuart Dallas (Leeds United)\nAlbion needing another great escape? - stats of the day\nWest Brom have won just eight points in the Premier League so far this season, only amassing fewer after 16 games of a top-flight campaign in 1985-86\nLeeds have now won seven of their 16 games in the Premier League this season, only six newly-promoted teams in the competition's history have picked up more victories at this stage of a season\nWest Brom manager Allardyce has lost consecutive home games by three or more goals in the Premier League for the first time since November 2007. The previous time came when he managed Newcastle United (4-1 against Portsmouth and 3-0 against Liverpool)\nLeeds equalled their biggest margin of victory in a Premier League game, winning by five goals for the sixth time in the competition. It was also their joint-biggest margin of victory away from home in their league history\nLeeds led by four goals at half-time in a Premier League game for the first time since May 2001 against Bradford City. The Whites led 5-1 at half-time, going on to win 6-1\nJack Harrison has been directly involved in seven goals for Leeds United in the Premier League this season (three goals and four assists).

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Too early for title talk, says Marcus Rashford\nManchester United striker Marcus Rashford says it would be \"stupid\" to think about winning the Premier League title at the moment despite his injury-time goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers moving the Red Devils up to second in the table.\nTuesday's game seemed destined to be a draw when Rashford took possession on the edge of the area, near to the goal-line.\nBut after cutting inside the box, the England man let fly with a left-footed shot that deflected off Romain Saiss to leave Rui Patricio completely wrong-footed.\nUnited are now two points behind leaders Liverpool having played the same number of games, which is as close as they have been to the top of the table at this stage of the season since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.\n\"We can't look too far ahead,\" Rashford told Amazon Prime.\n\"We are a team that is still doing a lot of work on ourselves and to be looking at the table so early on in the season is a bit stupid of us.\n\"We have to take it one game at a time and if we can keep finding ways to win like this we will see where we are at the end of the season.\"\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he is not willing to consider talk of a title challenge until after 30 games.\n\"There's no title race after 15 games,\" he said.\n\"You can lose the chance of being in the race in the first 10 games of course but play another 15 and get to 30 maybe, then we can start talking about it when we've at least played more than half the season.\n\"The belief is there - they think 'we can win against anyone, anywhere'. This result is massive for the attitude.\"\nTight affair\nThat the winner should come so late could have been predicted.\nSince Wolves returned to the top flight in 2018, these sides have now met eight times in league and cup. There have been four draws and two wins each, none of which has been by more than a single goal.\nUnited manager Solskjaer predicted a tight affair and so it proved as his defence was the equal of a Wolves attack that continues to struggle without Raul Jimenez, while the home side failed to inspire despite the return of Paul Pogba alongside Fernandes in midfield.\nUnusually for him, Fernandes was wasteful when Mason Greenwood picked him out with a deep cross just before half-time.\nSuch opportunities tend to find the net at the Portuguese's feet, but this one was turned away by Patricio.\nRashford and Anthony Martial wasted chances and although Edinson Cavani did have the ball in the net, the Uruguayan was correctly ruled offside.\nThere were appeals for a penalty for handball in the build-up, but VAR adjudged it was accidental by Wolves skipper Conor Coady.\nNeto's not bad\nAlthough the night did not end well for Wolves, it was another good one for Wolves' young forward Pedro Neto.\nManager Nuno Espirito Santo has been trying to play down expectations around the 20-year-old, who is only just starting to get exposed to senior football after a handful of appearances in his native Portugal for Braga and during a loan spell at Lazio.\nGlenn Hoddle and Jamie Redknapp have both spoken highly of Neto in recent days, and while his diminutive stature was ill-suited to the centre-forward role he was handed, there was more evidence at Old Trafford of a potential star in the making.\nEither through his own shot that tested De Gea or the inspired leave that created one for Ruben Neves, Neto shows he is always thinking.\nThe reverse pass that found Rayan Ait-Nouri in a packed penalty area was inspired even if it brought no reward.\nNeto is getting used to the physical side of the game too - he was accidently caught in the face by Nemanja Matic, which brought a shout of pain as the game continued without him.\nHe might have done better when he raced clear just before half-time, only to find Harry Maguire in his way as he tried to step inside to create more room for a shot, but the teenager continued to find pockets of space after the break before he was eventually replaced.\nTo underline the evolution of this Wolves team, 18-year-old former Liverpool defender Ki-Jana Hoever made his first Premier League start, as did 20-year-old Vitinha - a pass that nut-megged Pogba was the highlight of his 54-minute appearance.\nNot that it will be much consolation after such a disappointing end to the evening for Wolves.\n\"This is football and a learning process,\" Nuno said.\n\"It's cruel in the moment but you can't stay feeling sorry - you have to move forward. We created chances, sometimes we should finish more.\"\nLatest United winner since 2009 - the stats\nSince losing at home to Arsenal at the start of November, Manchester United have won seven of their past nine Premier League games.\nWolves have now conceded in each of their past nine league games; their joint-longest run without a clean sheet in the competition under Nuno Espirito Santo (the other was the nine games between December 2019 and January 2020).\nMarcus Rashford's goal for Manchester United was his first at Old Trafford in the Premier League in 845 minutes of play, since netting in July versus Southampton.\nAt 92 minutes and 51 seconds, Rashford's strike was their latest winning goal in a Premier League game at Old Trafford since September 2009, when Michael Owen scored at 95:27 against Manchester City.\nSince his Premier League debut in February, Bruno Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals in the competition than any other player with 32 - 18 goals, 14 assists).\nWolves' starting XI in this game had an average age of 25 years and 109 days - their youngest in a Premier League game since April 2012 (25 years 80 days v Sunderland).\nManchester United made six changes to their starting XI; their most in the Premier League since April 2019, when they had six changes for a game also against Wolves.\nWhat next?\nManchester United conclude their festive programme against another Midlands side, Aston Villa, on Friday, 1 January (20:00GMT). Wolves are next in action at Brighton on Saturday, 2 January (17:30GMT).\nBest of BBC Sounds 2020: When Peter Crouch got a very Royal guest...\nBest of BBC Sounds 2020: Ian Wright picks the tunes that have soundtracked his life"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 0-0 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp not looking at the table after draw\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said his side's position in the table is \"the last thing\" he is thinking about after they drew at Newcastle to finish 2020 three points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nThe Reds end the year where they started it but a second consecutive draw against a team in the bottom half means they are only three points clear of Manchester United, who have a game in hand.\nMohamed Salah missed two key opportunities either side of half-time at St James' Park, while Newcastle's Fabian Schar denied Sadio Mane a tap-in with a timely clearance off the goalline in the 80th minute.\nRoberto Firmino also went close midway through the second period, failing to hit the target after Newcastle keeper Karl Darlow was stranded following a corner.\nAnd the Brazil forward then saw his 88th-minute header superbly denied by Darlow as the hosts held on to a well-earned point.\n\"[Being top] is nice but it doesn't mean anything,\" Klopp said after the game.\n\"We drew tonight and we are still top of the table so that just shows how difficult the season is for everybody. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\"\nHow many Liverpool players made Garth Crooks' team of the year?\nRelive Newcastle's draw with Liverpool\nReds still stuttering on the road\nNo matter the result, Liverpool were always going to finish the calendar year at the summit of the Premier League table - it was just a question of how far they would be in front.\nAnd a draw away to Newcastle feels like an opportunity missed.\n\"We didn't get the result we wanted but it's not the worst thing in the world and there are worse things happening,\" Klopp told Amazon Prime.\n\"But I liked the game - we are not happy with the result but I'm fine with the performance, because that's the way we have to play and protect.\n\"We did all that but it's still disappointing.\"\nThe champions remain firm favourites to collect back-to-back titles for the first time since 1984, but their away form is a recurring issue.\nLiverpool have won seven of their eight home league games this season but on the road they've won just two in eight.\nThe Reds' injury list, particularly in defence, is widely reported. And Klopp revealed after the game that sidelined centre-back Joel Matip is likely to be out for a further three weeks with a muscle injury.\nYet it was their attacking trio of Mane, Salah and Firmino who looked out of sorts in the North East.\nAll three regularly found themselves in good positions but failed to find the breakthrough. Liverpool had 11 shots in total, but only four were on target.\nBruce - 'I hope the fans enjoyed it'\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce was quick to acknowledge 30-year-old Darlow, whose string of second-half saves kept the league-leaders at bay.\n\"When you play against arguably one of the best teams in the world you need a bit of luck but the spirit and the endeavour was there for all to see,\" Bruce told BBC Sport.\n\"I am delighted with my players. Overall, I'm very, very pleased with the performance.\"\nBruce came into this fixture under pressure, with his side's style of play being heavily criticised in recent weeks.\nThe Magpies' December had included just one win and a defeat in the Carabao Cup to Championship side Brentford.\nAnd as expected they sat back and defended in numbers, having only 27% of possession in the opening 45 minutes.\nBut they did have chances, Callum Wilson - who returned to the starting line-up - forced Liverpool keeper Alisson into a fine save from a tight angle after 11 minutes.\nAnd Ciaran Clark was also denied by the goalkeeper, Alisson flying to his left to keep out the defender's header after 79 minutes.\n\"We knew we let everyone down in a big cup tie. We blew it,\" added Bruce.\n\"We have to take the criticism that comes our way and accept it but I hope the supporters who watched this game today could really enjoy the performance.\n\"It was a great performance and let's look forward to Sunday.\"\nThe draw takes Bruce's side to 14th, four points from the top half but more importantly, eight points off the bottom three.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Southampton on Monday, while Newcastle's next fixture is at home to Leicester on Sunday.\nBest of BBC Sounds 2020: When Peter Crouch got a very Royal guest...\nBest of BBC Sounds 2020: Ian Wright picks the tunes that have soundtracked his life"

Neither side were able to dominate going forward, with the first shot on target coming on the stroke of half-time.\nMoyes and Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti have built their teams around defensive stability.\nSoucek's goal was only the second Everton have conceded in five league games, while West Ham have now kept two consecutive clean sheets.\n\"Coming here tonight and winning was really important,\" Moyes said.\n\"Everton are in a great moment, have been playing well, getting great results and had a chance to go second, so you couldn't underestimate what it would mean to Everton. And we were on the back of our third game in six days.\"\nWest Ham had the pick of the chances, Cresswell forcing Jordan Pickford into a smart save and Michail Antonio having a drilled effort kept out in the second half.\nThey also proved difficult to break down and were playing the better football when midfielder Soucek, their leading scorer this season, netted his fifth goal of the campaign.\nWest Ham win despite absentees\nAlthough West Ham picked up a third away victory in five games, there were areas of concern for Moyes.\nRight-back Ryan Fredericks dropped out of the squad after testing positive for Covid-19, while goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was injured during the warm-up.\n\"Ryan is fine,\" said Moyes. \"We are going to make sure we give the players four days off so they can have some time and we make sure we shut the training ground down for a few days because it is very bad, Covid, at the moment.\n\"The only reason is so we can get another clean and keep people out.\"\nBack-up keeper Randolph was rarely tested by Everton, who brought on Colombia forward James Rodriguez in the second half for his first appearance since 5 December.\nEverton remain fourth in the table, while West Ham stay 10th.\nWe must keep our belief high - Ancelotti\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti told BBC Sport: \"The game was in the balance. We didn't have a lot of opportunities; they didn't have a lot of opportunities.\n\"We have to accept the result. It will be important to keep our belief high.\n\"We are more comfortable defending and using the counter-attack. When we have the ball we have more difficulties and we have to adjust this.\n\"We are in the position we would like to be and hopefully we can be there at the end of the season. That is our target.\"\nEverton stutter at home - the stats\nEverton have lost three of their past five Premier League home games, as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 19.\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti has faced David Moyes more times in the Premier League without winning than against any other manager, drawing three and losing three of their six meetings.\nAaron Cresswell made his 200th Premier League start for West Ham, only the second Hammers player to reach that figure after Mark Noble (365).\nWest Ham's Jarrod Bowen has been substituted 15 times in the league this season from 16 starts, more than any other player.\nEverton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin is without a goal in five league appearances after netting 11 in his previous 11 games.\nWhat's next?\nEverton take on Championship side Rotherham in the FA Cup third round on 9 January, while West Ham travel to National League side Stockport County on 11 January.\nIdris Elba meets Paul McCartney: A special and exclusive one-off chat with the music icon\nCelebrities in the 21st Century: How has their rise come to define our culture?"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-1 Aston Villa: Bruno Fernandes penalty puts Red Devils joint top\nManchester United moved level on points with Premier League leaders Liverpool as a Bruno Fernandes penalty saw off stubborn Aston Villa.\nFernandes drilled his 11th league goal this season - and his fifth from the spot - into the bottom corner to punish Douglas Luiz's clip on Paul Pogba and hand United an eighth win in 10 games.\nBertrand Traore's calm finish underneath David de Gea had deservedly drawn Villa level, cancelling out Anthony Martial's stooping first-half header for the hosts.\nBut Fernandes' penalty extended United's hold over Villa - they have now won 32 and lost just one of the past 44 league meetings between the sides - and leaves Liverpool top only by virtue of goal difference.\nThe spot-kick award angered Aston Villa boss Dean Smith who claimed Pogba \"tripped himself\" and that the video assistant referee should have asked on-pitch official Michael Oliver to review his decision.\n\"I don't see why Michael couldn't have looked at it. That's what VAR is for isn't it?\" Smith told BBC Sport.\n\"I thought it was a penalty at the time, but I looked at it after the game and saw he tripped himself. I don't think it's a penalty.\n\"I think there's enough doubt there to send the referee over to the screen.\"\nSmith's side were perhaps unfortunate not to have left Old Trafford with at least a point from a thoroughly entertaining game but they also needed several fine saves from Emiliano Martinez to keep them in it.\nAfter Fernandes' spot-kick put United back in front, Martinez superbly tipped a stinging 25-yarder from the Portuguese on to the crossbar as well as denying Martial a second.\nMartinez's counterpart David de Gea was just as busy, with a late save from Matty Cash's long-range strike preserving the points, not long after Tyrone Mings had headed wide a glorious chance to level.\nIs much-derided Solskjaer bringing good times back to Man Utd?\nReaction to Man Utd v Aston Villa and Everton v West Ham\nUnited proving they mean business\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side have displayed their ability to grind out points at Old Trafford in recent weeks, as evidenced in 1-0 home wins over both West Bromwich Albion and Wolves.\nBut they have also shown a willingness to go toe-to-toe with teams who are happy to open up the game and, while this was not quite the shootout of the 6-2 win over Leeds, it was just as easy on the eye.\nA number of fluid first-half moves produced chances before Martial's opener as the France forward saw a curler tipped over by Martinez, while Fernandes and Wan-Bissaka were narrowly off target with similar efforts.\nMartial stole between Mings and Ezri Konsa to nod the Red Devils ahead from Wan-Bissaka's inviting cross for only his second league goal of the season on his return to Solskjaer's starting line-up.\nWhile Luiz was unfortunate to be penalised for what might have been an accidental clip on Pogba, there was enough contact for the penalty to be given and Fernandes continued his excellent record from the spot.\nUnited were nine points behind Liverpool after a 1-0 defeat by Arsenal at Old Trafford on 1 November but have made up that gap in just two months to set an intriguing title race into motion.\nA minute's silence before the game paid tribute to former boss Tommy Docherty, who famously prevented Liverpool claiming the treble by leading United to an FA Cup win over the Reds in 1977.\nAnd while talk of foiling a second successive Liverpool title might be premature, moving alongside them at the Premier League's summit will give Solskjaer's side even more confidence as they eye up a trip to Anfield on 17 January.\nVilla impressive even in defeat\nWhile Villa were ultimately outgunned by their hosts, their brave display was further evidence of the progress Smith's side have made this season.\nThey held their own in the first half, causing United a number of problems down the flanks, with playmaker Jack Grealish prompting and probing to show why the hosts have long considered a move for the Villa captain.\nBut they were even more impressive in the early stages of the second period, Grealish crossing for an Ollie Watkins header that was saved by De Gea before collecting a quick free-kick and finding Traore to tuck home the equaliser.\nLuiz's foul on Pogba came with Villa very much in the ascendancy and while they then had to ride a storm the visitors still came close to pinching a point as Mings beat fellow England centre-half Harry Maguire to a free-kick only to nod wide.\nWith Ross Barkley's return from a hamstring injury imminent, this performance should keep Villa optimistic even if defeat halted a five-game unbeaten run and saw them slip a place to sixth, behind Chelsea on goal difference.\nAnd while their rotten record at Old Trafford continues - just one win in 34 visits since 1983, which came courtesy of a Gabriel Agbonlahor header in 2009 - they have still only conceded five times in eight away games this campaign.\n'We have improved a lot in a year' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told BBC Sport: \"You are always delighted with three points. The performance was good and we created chances.\n\"It was maybe a little too open and we wasted chances. We tried to play the Hollywood pass instead of securing the first one and using the space that was there.\n\"We are happy with what we are doing. We have shown we have improved a lot in a year. We lost to Arsenal away last New Year's Day. We have improved immensely.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith told BBC Sport: \"I wasn't happy with the first half. We were miles off the levels where we have been. It felt like a testimonial pace then they deservedly had the lead at half-time. I told the players we needed to be upping our levels.\n\"We competed a lot better [in the second half], showed more quality and created chances. I'd take the second-half performance all day long. A dubious penalty has lost us the game.\n\"When you look at our performances and results, it shows we are very competitive in this league now, which is what we wanted it to be.\"\nUnited's hold over Villa goes on - the stats\nManchester United are unbeaten in their past 16 Premier League matches against Aston Villa (W12 D4).\nAston Villa have lost 13 of their past 15 away Premier League games against Manchester United at Old Trafford (W1 D1).\nIn Premier League history, the only player to be directly involved in more goals in their first 30 appearances in the competition than Bruno Fernandes (33 - 19 goals, 14 assists) is Andrew Cole (37 - 28 goals, nine assists).\nAnthony Martial has now scored on all seven days of the week in the Premier League for Manchester United, becoming the fifth player to do so, after Ryan Giggs, Andrew Cole, David Beckham and Wayne Rooney.\nOnly Tottenham's Harry Kane (10) has assisted more Premier League goals this season than Jack Grealish (7), while the last Aston Villa player to assist more than seven Premier League goals in a season was Ashley Young in 2010-11 (10).\nSince Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first Premier League match in charge of Manchester United in December 2018, the Red Devils have taken (27) and scored (21) the most Premier League penalties.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United host local rivals Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-finals on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) and welcome Watford in the FA Cup on Saturday 9 January (20:00 GMT).

The run of results lately was not good. We didn't play against Fulham, of course.\n\"Look at the table and you have one match less and [you are] not happy with what you see. [With] this three points, you are now happier to look at the screen.\n\"Leeds are a team with very specific qualities. Easy to understand but difficult to play against. We tried not to give them what they want. Close the door where they have situations where they can hurt people.\"\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa, speaking to BBC Sport: \"According to the display of both teams the result could have been a closer one. We had nine chances to score.\n\"And the chances they had and scored from, they came from errors. We already made these types of errors. We played the game on an even keel. Our forwards had the capacity to unbalance them and defenders had the capacity to neutralise.\n\"We were losing the ball when building up from the back and [there was] a goal from a set-piece.\n\"We need to demand more from ourselves. The start of the second half was a very important part of the game - we didn't go at it in a favourable manner.\"\nLeeds draw a blank away - the stats\nTottenham have won four of their last five Premier League home games (lost one), with this their biggest victory at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since July (3-0 v Leicester).\nLeeds failed to score in an away Premier League game for the first time this season, leaving Aston Villa and Manchester United as the only sides to have scored in 100% of their games on the road.\nLeeds have conceded six penalty goals this season, more than any other side in the Premier League. Only in 2003-04 (seven), have they shipped more in a single campaign in the competition.\nTottenham striker Harry Kane has scored against all 30 opponents he has faced in the Premier League, the best 100% record in the competition among players to have faced more than one side.\nSon Heung-min's first-half strike was his 100th goal in all competitions for Tottenham (253rd appearance), the 18th player to reach the milestone for the club.\nTottenham duo Harry Kane and Son Heung-min have combined for 13 Premier League goals this season - no pair have ever combined for more in a single campaign in the competition. Kane has assisted Son nine times - a joint-record for one player assisting another within a Premier League season.\nCourtesy of his penalty goal, Harry Kane became the first player to reach double figures for both goals and assists in the top five European leagues this season.\nMatt Doherty was sent off for Spurs in their first game of 2021 - the Lilywhites did not receive a single Premier League red card in 2020.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham face Championship side Brentford in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, 5 January (19:45 GMT) before travelling to non-league side Marine in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday, 10 January (17:00 GMT).\nTheir next Premier League game is scheduled for Wednesday, 13 January, when they visit Aston Villa (20:15 GMT).\nLeeds travel to League Two Crawley in the FA Cup on Sunday, 10 January (13:30 GMT).

No club has stayed up after such a start to a campaign.\nJeffrey Schlupp opened the scoring for Palace with a deflected finish before going off injured.\nEberechi Eze, his replacement, doubled the lead with a stunning solo effort, running from inside his own half and finishing from 18 yards after evading a couple of challenges.\n\"It was the perfect storm last season - players were at the top of their game and we had no injuries,\" said Wilder, whose side finished ninth on their return to top-flight football.\n\"Now injuries are hitting us quite hard... but we had enough on the pitch to get us a result. The result wasn't decided when the team sheet came in. It was decided in fourth minute and the last 30 seconds of the first half.\n\"This club, over the past three, four years, is not used to losing games. It's difficult, it's a struggle, its ruthless and murders you at times with what you're up against.\"\nAsked if United can get out of their predicament, Wilder said: \"We have to do it sooner than later. There are records to be broken - we have to find a win from somewhere.\"\nUnited finished the game with 16-year-old substitute Antwoine Hackford on the pitch, the youngest player to appear for the club in the Premier League.\nEberechi Eze: Earning respect in London's 'cages'\nJanuary transfer window: Who could be on the move?\nEze warming to Premier League\nAfter five games without a victory, this was a welcome return to winning ways for Roy Hodgson's Palace with the highlight undoubtedly Eze's exceptional goal.\nThe 22-year-old forward has adapted quickly since making the step up from Championship club QPR on a five-year deal for \u00a319.5m in August.\nEze's first Palace goal was a sublime free-kick against Leeds in November. His second was just as pleasing on the eye.\nBlades boss Wilder was furious his players did not close down the former Arsenal youth player but Eze's calm and composed finish, after running half the length of the pitch, was delightful.\nIt capped a solid team performance as Palace put the memory of recent heavy defeats by Liverpool and Aston Villa behind them with a first clean sheet win since the opening weekend of the season.\nWith the January transfer window about to open, Paris St-Germain and AC Milan are the latest clubs to be linked with Wilfried Zaha and the Ivory Coast forward played a part in Palace's opening goal.\nHe also set up a good chance for Christian Benteke, who later went off injured, before getting involved in an unnecessary spat with Jayden Bogle after failing to win a free-kick.\nBut Palace's season, after a couple of hiccups, is up and running again as they get ready for three away games, against Wolves in the FA Cup, followed by Arsenal and Manchester City in the league.\nBlades sinking fast\nWilder was clearly upset with his players for not stopping Eze as he galloped away to score at the end of the first half.\nHaving recorded a number of positive coronavirus cases during the latest round of testing, United were also without several players because of injury and suspension.\nThey were so depleted they could only name six substitutes instead of the usual nine, while Bogle was handed his first league start since arriving from Derby in September 2020.\nShortly before Palace's second goal, Vicente Guaita denied Bogle with a good save but the Blades offered little serious threat going forward and managed just two attempts on target.\nWith Tottenham (home), Manchester United (away) and Manchester City (away) to come in January, the picture is getting bleaker by the week.\nHowever, Hackford - aged 16 years 288 days - looked bright when he came on and was denied a goal in the 90th minute when Joel Ward blocked his effort.\n'I have seen some very good goals recently' - what they said\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: \"I have seen some very good goals recently but they have been against us so that has been the problem.\n\"It was nice to see one for us for a change because a lot of the goals we have conceded, in particular against West Ham and Liverpool, were incredible finishes.\"\nSweet 16 - the stats\nAntwoine Hackford is the 20th 16-year-old to play in the Premier League.\nSheffield United are the first English top-flight side to fail to win any of their first 17 games in a season since Bolton Wanderers in 1902-03.\nEberechi Eze is the fourth Crystal Palace player to score their first two Premier League goals for the club from outside the penalty box and first since Ricky Newman in 1994 (also Gareth Southgate and Simon Rodger).\nThe Blades have gone 20 league games without a clean sheet, the longest current run in the division.\nPalace have scored 12 first-halflLeague goals this season, two more than they scored before half-time in the whole of 2019-20.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in FA Cup third-round action next.

        "article_text": "Brighton 3-3 Wolves: Lewis Dunk salvages point for Seagulls\nLewis Dunk's header helped Brighton come from 3-1 down to earn a point against Wolves in an eventful Premier League encounter at the Amex Stadium.\nThe draw leaves the Seagulls only three points above the relegation zone, but the manner of the fightback will have heartened the fans who have seen their side win only once in 15 league games.\nIt began well for the home side when Aaron Connolly poked in from Leandro Trossard's delivery in the 13th minute, but Wolves were level six minutes later as Romain Saiss sent a looping header past Robert Sanchez after Nelson Semedo had retrieved a corner to the far post.\nWorse was to follow for the hosts in the 34th minute when the ball bounced off defender Dan Burn and into the net after Sanchez had saved from Pedro Neto. Burn had seconds earlier conceded the corner which led to the goal.\nBurn cut a distraught figure just before half-time when he brought down Adama Traore after the Spanish winger outpaced him on the byeline. Ruben Neves fired in from the penalty spot for his first goal since February.\nInstead of caving in, Brighton sprang out of the blocks from the restart. Within 50 seconds it was 3-2 when Neal Maupay scored from the spot after he was fouled by Joao Moutinho.\nBrighton continued to pepper the Wolves area and, after Adam Webster's header came off the bar, they were finally level when Dunk nodded home from Trossard's corner.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's full predictions v The Farm singer Peter Hooton\nSpirited comeback does not mask Brighton issues\nManager Graham Potter has been a man on the defensive having seen his stock fall following a promising debut season at Brighton.\nHe helped them comfortably avoid relegation with 41 points - their highest tally in the competition - but this season they have a sole victory against Aston Villa to show for their efforts in the past three months. It has left them in a precarious position.\nBrighton still play football which is easy on the eye, but they have often lack cutting edge in attack and lately Potter's team selection has been questionable.\nIn the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal he made six changes to his starting line-up, which did not include any recognised strikers, and against Wolves he asked 6ft 7in Burn to mark the pacy Traore on the left.\nBurn's blushes were spared by a spirited Brighton attacking display after the break, but the draw was their eighth of the season and they remain without a win at home in the league.\nWolves rediscover attacking swagger\nWolves have also been in a bit of a rut lately, to a lesser extent.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side came into the match having won one of their six league games since the head injury to striker Raul Jimenez\n, external\nin November. The Mexican's potency in attack had been missed, with just three goals scored in that time.\nAt least some of those issues were remedied as Neto and Traore impressed in attack, while Neves showed the type of composure and playmaking in midfield that helped Wolves finish seventh last season.\nThe visitors spent large chunks of the second half defending crosses from the wings, although they could have snatched a win in the final seconds when substitute Owen Otasowie headed over the bar from four yards.\nWhat's next?\nWolves host Crystal Palace in the FA Cup third round on Friday (19:45 GMT), while Brighton travel to League Two side Newport County on 10 January (19:45).\n'The players were amazing' - reaction\nBrighton head coach Graham Potter:\n\"It was tough for us at half-time of course because of the scoreline and how the half went.\n\"You're looking for a response, you're looking for character, and I thought we got it.\n\"The players were amazing, great spirit, great personality and quality. We hit the bar and pushed and pushed.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo asked how disappointed he was with the result:\n\"A lot because I think the first half was very good.\n\"We knew that Brighton is going to react and we had to control, and we didn't do it.\n\"I am disappointed with me, with everybody.\n\"We must do better with everybody. I am not disappointed individually with any of our players.\"\nBad day for Burn - stats\nBrighton conceded as many goals in the first half as they had in their previous 10 top-flight games against Wolves, but they remain unbeaten in their 11 top-flight meetings (W7 D4).\nThis was the fourth time Brighton have managed to rescue a point in a Premier League game in which they have been at least two goals behind.\nSince their promotion to the Premier League in 2017, Brighton have conceded nine own goals - more than any other side in the top flight.\nBrighton have conceded eight league goals this season from set-piece situations (excluding penalties). Only Leeds have conceded more (10).\nDan Burn is the first player to score an own goal and concede a penalty in the same Premier League game since Eliaquim Mangala for Manchester City against Hull in 2014.\nRomain Saiss has scored two goals in his past three league games, as many as in his previous 40.\nNeal Maupay's strike for Brighton (45mins 50secs) was the earliest goal scored from the penalty spot in the second half of a Premier League game since Opta began recording exact goal timings in 2006-07.\nIdris Elba meets Paul McCartney: A special and exclusive one-off chat with the music icon\nCelebrities in the 21st Century: How has their rise come to define our culture?"

Youth? How have Arsenal turned relegation talk into European hopes?\nPurring Arsenal show desired confidence\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta said he wanted his players to \"show confidence\" at The Hawthorns, and they certainly did that in a dominant and eye-catching display.\nHector Bellerin forced Sam Johnstone into a save within two minutes after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang broke down the left, and Saka tormented full-back Dara O'Shea on the opposite wing constantly during the opening half.\nIt was Saka's ball that fizzed past the back post, inches away from the toe of Aubameyang, after the 19-year-old had got the better of O'Shea and hit it straight at Johnstone.\nWest Brom were being suffocated and Tierney's burst of pace to get around Darnell Furlong, before bending it into the far corner, was the perfect way to open the scoring.\nSaka made it 2-0 by rounding off a slick, one-touch passing move that former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger would have been proud of.\nWest Brom could offer no response after the break either and Arsenal were 3-0 up on the hour when Lacazette eventually blasted in the rebound from a catalogue of errors by defender Semi Ajayi.\nThat was game over but Lacazette was allowed to add a fourth when he was left unmarked to divert Tierney's cross into the roof of the net four minutes later.\nArteta, knowing the job was done, was able to bring off Saka and Emile Smith Rowe following impressive performances from both youngsters, while Arsenal continued to create chances to round off a very enjoyable evening in the snow.\nChallenge facing Allardyce just gets bigger\nAllardyce's first match in charge of West Brom - a 3-0 drubbing by Aston Villa after captain Jake Livermore had been sent off - was a sign of just how tough this job was going to be.\nThen that 1-1 draw with Liverpool at Anfield provided hope. The Baggies were resilient, organised and tireless.\nBut heavy back-to-back defeats by Leeds United and now Arsenal at home have brought things back down to earth.\nWest Brom were overawed in defence, out-run in midfield and frustrated by a lack of opportunities in attack throughout this confidence-crushing defeat.\nTheir rare sniffs at goal came from a Granit Xhaka error in the first half - Matheus Pereira chipping it through to Matt Phillips who struck it straight at Bernd Leno - before Callum Robinson's finish was ruled out for offside in the second half.\nSubstitute Rekeem Harper's long-range strike deep in stoppage time was also comfortably turned behind by Leno.\nIt was West Brom's third home loss in three under Allardyce and they have conceded 12 goals with no reply in those games.\n'Everything looks much better' - what they said\nWest Brom manager Sam Allardyce: \"Another game gone by where we learn more about the players we have. We have learnt an awful lot about what we can and cannot do.\n\"We need to work out a way of not trying to be as sloppy as we have been at conceding goals. It appears when we try to open up we leave opportunities for the opposition and we cannot cope.\"\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta: \"We had a big week, three games in seven days, and we managed to win them and everything looks much better. It was difficult conditions but the team looked sharp from the start. It's a big win.\n\"After the results we had before we had to lift things straight away. Now we have got some discipline back. We look more creative in the final third and we look solid at the back.\"\nThe best of the stats\nWest Brom are the first side to lose consecutive home Premier League games by at least four goals since Wigan in August 2010.\nArsenal have scored in all 25 of their Premier League meetings with West Brom, the best 100% scoring record by one side against an opponent in the competition's history.\nThere were 20 passes in the build-up to Arsenal's first goal scored by Kieran Tierney - since Mikel Arteta's first game in charge on Boxing Day 2019, the Gunners have scored more goals following a sequence of 20+ passes than any other Premier League side (3).\nTierney became the first Scottish player to score an away Premier League goal for Arsenal and the first to do so in the top flight since Charlie Nicholas against Ipswich Town in March 1986.\nAlexandre Lacazette has scored five away Premier League goals in 2020-21, his best such tally in a single season in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom travel to Blackpool for an FA Cup third-round tie on Saturday, 9 January (15:00 GMT kick-off), before returning to Premier League action on Saturday, 16 January against Wolves (12:30 GMT).\nArsenal host Newcastle in their FA Cup match on the same day (17:30 GMT), before facing Crystal Palace at home in the league on Thursday, 14 January (20:00 GMT).\nIdris Elba meets Paul McCartney: A special and exclusive one-off chat with the music icon\nCelebrities in the 21st Century: How has their rise come to define our culture?"

It's something we have to improve on.\n\"I didn't think we deserved to lose the game but we have been punished and caught on the counter-attack. It's what we want to do but we keep getting caught the other way.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers on Sky Sports: \"I'm delighted with that. It was always going to be a tight game.\n\"We had some really good moments in first half but just failed with that final ball. In the second half we stayed strong defensively. Once we got the first goal it opened it up a little bit.\n\"The squad has been tremendous in terms of how they have coped with our European and league efforts. They showed really good capabilities in the game.\"\nLeicester extend hold over Bruce - the stats\nLeicester have won their past five Premier League matches at Newcastle.\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce has not won any of his eight home meetings with Leicester in all competitions (D4 L4).\nLeicester have won seven away games this season - as many as they did in the 2019-20 campaign.\nNewcastle have lost eight of their past 10 Premier League games against Leicester.\nLeicester's Jamie Vardy has been directly involved in 98 Premier League goals since turning 30 (80 goals & 18 assists), overtaking Paolo di Canio and equalling Ryan Giggs. Vardy is now joint-sixth for most Premier League goal involvements aged 30-plus.\nAndy Carroll scored his first Premier League goal for Newcastle since netting against Manchester City on 26 December in 2010, 10 years eight days ago.

When you see our guys fighting with everything they have it makes me really proud. You need to have the perfect game against Liverpool and I think we did have that.\n\"It felt like we were under massive pressure and the defending around the box was the key today - and then we still tried to play football.

The guys believed in what they were doing.\n\"It's a perfect evening.\"\nLiverpool manager Klopp to BBC Sport: \"What was disappointing? How long have we got? The start, obviously - not only the goal but the start in general. Congratulations to Southampton - they deserved it.\n\"You know exactly what you are going to get from them. You cannot be surprised but we looked surprised.\n\"It's not rocket science. We should have done much better. We played into their hands with the start.\n\"They put a lot of work in. Our decision making was just not good. That is how it is when you don't have momentum. We should have had much more chances.\n\"These are outstanding players but they were not ready from the start. Sadio Mane should have had a penalty tonight, and there was the handball - I've no idea.\n\"It's not an excuse for the performance, but you can get a point if they are given. Now we have to show a reaction.\"\nIngs' earliest strike\nSouthampton are the first team to beat all seven winners of the Premier League in the season after a title win.\nLiverpool have failed to score in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since May 2018.\nThe Reds' first shot on target on Monday came in the 75th minute - their latest in a Premier League match since December 2015.\nAfter having eight shots on target in their 7-0 victory over Crystal Palace, Liverpool have managed just seven attempts on target in their last three league matches.\nIngs' opener for Southampton was his 50th Premier League goal, and the earliest he has ever scored in the competition.\nSouthampton's Ward-Prowse has provided four assists in the Premier League this season - only in 2014-15 (six) has he had more in a top-flight campaign.\nSaints keeper Forster kept his first Premier League clean sheet since October 2017, though this was only his 13th appearance in the competition since then.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton are scheduled to face Shrewsbury in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday (20:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 1-0 Newcastle: Blades gain first league win of season\nSheffield United finally gained their first Premier League win of the season in their 18th game as they beat 10-man Newcastle United at Bramall Lane.\nNewcastle's Ryan Fraser was sent off late on in the first half after he picked up two bookings in a three-minute spell following fouls on John Fleck and David McGoldrick.\nWith a little over 15 minutes remaining the Blades were awarded a penalty when Federico Fernandez handled the ball, with the decision given after referee Andy Madley checked the incident on a video screen.\nSubstitute Billy Sharp sent goalkeeper Karl Darlow the wrong way from the spot for what proved the only goal of the game.\nRhian Brewster nearly added a second for the hosts late on but his deflected strike from 20 yards hit the foot of the post.\nThe victory ended a club record run of 20 league matches without a win since the Blades beat Chelsea 3-0 on 11 July, before ending the 2019-20 season with three successive defeats.\nTheir start to this campaign - no wins, two draws and 15 losses - was the worst in Premier League history.\nThe Blades remain bottom of the table but are now on five points, three behind 19th-placed West Brom and nine adrift of Brighton in 17th, having played a game more than both.\nMeanwhile, Newcastle, who have now gone eight games without a win in all competitions, remain 15th, eight points clear of the relegation zone.\nRelive Sheffield United v Newcastle as it happened\nSharp reaches Blades' landmark\nThe Blades, who only named seven out of a maximum nine permitted substitutes, were the better side in the first half, but, as so often this season, struggled to make that count.\nJohn Lundstram twice shot wide when well placed, David McGoldrick had an effort saved by Darlow and headed another chance over, and Jayden Bogle was also denied by Darlow.\nSharp, introduced from the bench just before the hour, helped earn the penalty he converted, trying to run past Newcastle captain Fernandez, who flicked the ball away with his left hand.\nReferee Madley had originally missed the handball, but after a video assistant referee check, he watched it again on a pitchside monitor, Sharp stepping up for his 100th league goal for the Blades.\nHowever, Newcastle manager Steve Bruce said the penalty decision \"baffled me\".\nHe added: \"The referee got it spot on in real time. It hit [Fernandez's] hand but it's not intentional. It could have been a foul on him as well.\n\"VAR is supposed to be for clear and obvious decisions. How someone 300 miles away on a TV screen can overturn it is beyond me.\n\"You know when the referee goes to the screen it will be a penalty - it's pathetic. It's beyond me.\"\nBrewster nearly added a second late on, but there was also time for an anxious moment for Chris Wilder's side in the fifth minute of stoppage time.\nA mix-up between Bogle and home goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale saw the ball heading towards goal, before Ramsdale recovered to claw the ball away for a corner.\nWilder will be hoping his side can take confidence from this victory, especially as they now play three of the Premier League's top five - Tottenham, Manchester United and Manchester City - in their next three league games.\nNewcastle's poor run continues\nFor Newcastle it has been a rotten month since they beat West Brom 2-1 on 12 December.\nSince then they have only picked up two points from six Premier League matches and gone out of both the FA Cup and the EFL Cup, beaten in the latter by Championship side Brentford at the quarter-final stage.\nBruce picked a defensive side for the trip to Sheffield and saw them fail to manage a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nTheir only opportunity of note fell to returning England striker Callum Wilson, who headed over from six yards out after a fine first-time cross from the right flank by Fernandez.\nBut after Fraser picked up two yellow cards inside a three-minute spell, fouling John Fleck and then McGoldrick needlessly out on the left touchline, Wilson was left isolated up front as Newcastle defended deep in a bid to hold on to a point.\nOnce behind, they brought on Andy Carroll and had a chance to score an injury-time equaliser but Jacob Murphy could only fire a free-kick straight at Ramsdale.\nBruce was also angry that a challenge from Sharp on Fabian Schar was only punished with a yellow card.\n\"There's a horror challenge by Billy Sharp that should be a straight red card. It's blatant,\" added Bruce. \"They didn't check it. It's laughable the whole VAR situation and I don't think anyone enjoys it.\n\"I'm struggling to cope with it. Week in week out, it's ruining the game.\"\nAnother away defeat for Newcastle - the stats\nSheffield United have won consecutive games across all competitions, after going 21 matches without a win beforehand (drawn three, lost 18).\nThey kept their first Premier League clean sheet in 21 matches, since a 3-0 win vs Chelsea in July.\nNewcastle United have lost three consecutive away Premier League games for the first time since October 2019.\nNewcastle have lost a Premier League away game against a team starting the day bottom of the league for the first time since October 2015 vs Sunderland (3-0).\nSheffield United have scored three goals from the penalty spot in the Premier League this season, their joint-best return alongside 1993-94.\nBilly Sharp scored his 100th league goal for Sheffield United and his fifth strike in the Premier League.\nNewcastle's Ryan Fraser was shown his first ever red card in the Premier League in what was his 128th appearance in the competition.\nFraser was the 40th different player to be sent off under Steve Bruce in the Premier League; only Harry Redknapp (41) and Arsene Wenger (44) have seen more different players see red.\n'We have to be difficult to play against' - what they said\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder said: \"I should imagine the sending-off and the penalty will be talked about but in my opinion we were value for the victory.\n\"Everybody needs a bit of luck. But it wasn't an outrageous stroke of fortune. The performance was good, considering the position we are in.\n\"We've had a load of tight games and we'll take it. I was looking for my car keys and to take up another sport if we'd thrown it away in added time.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce said: \"I've got no issues with the red card - we can't argue with that and you can't argue with how poor we are in the first half.\n\"If you are in the bottom half of the league it is always going to be difficult. We have to be difficult to play against. I offer no excuse, but we must be more of a threat going forward.\n\"Whoever you are in the Premier League the pressure comes upon you. That is what we have to deal with.\"\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United host Jose Mourinho's Tottenham in the league on Sunday, 17 January (14:05 GMT).\nNewcastle play their third away game in a row on Monday, 18 January (20:00 GMT) and it is another match at Arsenal, who beat them 2-0 in the third round of the FA Cup on 9 January\nLockdown Learning: See how we are making education more accessible than ever\nBBC Music's Sound of 2021: All the artists you need to look out for this year"

        "article_text": "Wolves 1-2 Everton: Michael Keane header sends Toffees fourth\nEverton maintained their challenge for a Champions League spot with victory at Wolves thanks to Michael Keane's 77th-minute winner.\nThe Toffees' sixth away win in the league this season lifted them to fourth in the table, level on points with third-place Leicester and only four off the lead held by Manchester United.\nThey got off to a brilliant start when Alex Iwobi fired home in the fifth minute for his first goal in 38 Premier League appearances.\nWolves, seeking only their second win in eight games, hit back in the 14th minute through Ruben Neves. The Portuguese midfielder ended his own barren run against Brighton at the start of January, and made it two goals in two league matches with a sublime sidefoot finish following brilliant movement from Rayan Ait-Nouri.\nThe home side looked more likely to edge the contest until Keane rose highest in the area to convert Andre Gomes' teasing cross from the left.\nReaction to Tuesday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Shame drummer Charlie Forbes\nIwobi impresses as Everton form continues\nThere were tweets of surprise on social media when Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti named a starting XI without a recognised striker. Leading scorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin was unavailable because of a hamstring problem, while the Italian opted to leave Cenk Tosun on the bench.\nGylfi Sigurdsson was billed as the player to lead the line, but the Toffee that looked most potent was winger Iwobi. His link-up play with his fellow attackers was key to many of the visiting side's best moves and he deserved to end his goalscoring drought.\nThe attack began when James Rodriguez floated the ball to Lucas Digne on the left of the area. The French full-back, making his first league start since 22 November, played a first-time pass to Iwobi, whose cleanly-struck effort took a slight deflection off Conor Coady.\nThe Nigeria international also forced a good low save from Rui Patricio following a swift one-two with Rodriguez.\nAncelotti's men looked short of ideas in attack after the break but made it count 13 minutes from time when Keane put away the only effort on target in the second half. It was the defender's fourth goal of the season.\nStriker or no striker, Ancelotti has got that winning feeling again and his expensively-assembled squad are back on course following their slump in November.\nJimenez absence continues to hurt Wolves\nThe large scar from his surgery was visible as Raul Jimenez watched his side from the stands at Molineux - how different might Wolves' campaign have looked so far had their talisman in attack not suffered a fractured skull against Arsenal in November.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side won that day at Emirates Stadium, but have picked up only the one other victory in the league in the eight games since. The Midlands club have fallen from seventh to 14th in the table.\nThey have clearly missed the natural finisher during this period, but the build-up play has rarely been found wanting.\nAgainst Everton the likes of Pedro Neto and Neves dictated play beautifully in the opposition third, while 19-year-old Ait-Nouri was exceptional as an attacking left-back. The way in which he drove past Abdoulaye Doucoure on the wing to set up the goal was dazzling. What was lacking was bite, because aside from Neves' late free-kick, which hit the bar, Everton keeper Jordan Pickford was untroubled in the second half.\nKeeping a clean sheet has also been Wolves' problem - the last time they kept a score to nil in the league was 12 games ago. The defenders should have done better to close down Iwobi while they made it too easy for Keane to get his head to the ball.\nNuno says he is very concerned about the situation, but it is unlikely his side will be caught up in a relegation battle.\n'I'm very worried' - reaction\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti: \"We knew this would be a difficult game to play here.\n\"We had a different approach without Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin. We played more to attack the flanks with Iwobi and Digne and it worked well because the first goal was a fantastic combination.\n\"Keane is unbelievable with his head. His goal helped us to stay in a good position in the table.\n\"We perform better away because at home we don't have the support of our fans at the moment, which is really important. When we played with 2,000 of our supporters against Chelsea we won.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"First half I think we played a good game and in the second half both sides were very organised. It was just the small detail that we should do better - focus inside the box. That detail cost us the game.\n\"We got a good goal and in the first half I think we had more of the ball and played better, but the second half was very tight. The moment we pushed to go for the game we conceded the goal.\"\nOn whether he is worried about their form: \"Very worried. It is something we know we need to improve but at the same time aware of what is happening and what we have to do for the future.\"\nEverton's assist-king Digne - stats\nWolves have lost five of their last eight Premier League games (W1 D2), after losing just one of the seven before that (W4 D2).\nEverton have won seven of their last 10 away Premier League games (D1 L2), as many victories as they enjoyed in their previous 28 on the road (D5 L16).\nWolves are without a clean sheet in 11 Premier League games, the longest current run in the division, conceding the first goal in 10 of those games.\nEverton have scored nine headed goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nCoady and Patr\u00edcio both made their 93rd Premier League start for Wolves, with only Matt Jarvis managing more for the club (95).\nDigne has now made 16 assists in the Premier League for Everton; since the start of the 2018-19 season, the only defenders with more are Liverpool pair Andy Robertson (28) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (27).\nIwobi scored for the first time in 38 Premier League appearances, since netting against none other than Wolves in September 2019.\nThree of Neves' eight Premier League goals for Wolves have come against Everton, with the Portuguese not managing more than one against any other side.\nNeves' equaliser was his fifth goal from inside the box for Wolves in all competitions (17 in total) but the first of those five not to come from the penalty spot.\nKeane has netted three goals in 16 Premier League appearances this season, as many as he managed in his three previous seasons in the competition combined (three in 94 appearances).\nWhat's next?\nWolves host West Brom on Saturday (12:30 GMT) and Everton are at Aston Villa on Sunday (12:00 GMT).\nLockdown Learning: See how we are making education more accessible than ever\nBBC Music's Sound of 2021: All the artists you need to look out for this year"

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-1 Manchester United: Paul Pogba winner sends Red Devils top of Premier League\nPaul Pogba's second-half volley was enough to give Manchester United victory at Burnley and send them three points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nUnited dominated a contest in which Burnley failed to register a single shot on target until stoppage time.\nBut they were struggling to make a breakthrough until Marcus Rashford picked Pogba out with an excellent cross to the edge of the area.\nThe Frenchman's connection was perfect, although it took a deflection off Matthew Lowton to ensure the ball went past Nick Pope and into the Burnley net.\nAlthough Burnley had three decent chances in a frantic ending, United secured the win to head the table after 17 rounds of matches.\nIt is the first time that has happened this many games into the season since December 2012, in Sir Alex Ferguson's final, title-winning campaign.\nReaction to Burnley v Man Utd and Wolves v Everton\nNew territory for post-Ferguson United\nIn the seven seasons since Ferguson retired, United have never been higher than second at this stage of the season.\nBut they were already well adrift of Manchester City during that 2017-18 campaign under Jose Mourinho.\nSurprisingly, in points terms, the nearest they have been to the top at this stage was under David Moyes, when they were eighth but only eight points behind the leaders after 17 games.\nThey made hard work of their ninth win in 11 Premier League games. On his return from a three-match ban, Edinson Cavani wasted two excellent chances and Bruno Fernandes fired a first-half effort straight at Nick Pope.\nAnthony Martial was off target with two first-half chances before failing to convert in the final seconds after he had been sent clean through.\nNone of this matters now though and, while manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was right to say nobody remembers what the table looks like in January, Pogba's clenched fist as Burnley's last chance went begging indicated the importance of these three points.\nVAR gets in the way\nIt is not often Solskjaer gets so angry on the touchline that he is reduced to swearing.\nBut the Norwegian could not help himself after one of those bizarre 10-minute periods that leaves you wondering what has happened to that simple game we fell in love with as kids.\nWithin the period of one passage of play, Luke Shaw left Johann Gudmundsson on the deck with a strong challenge, which ended with the full-back sliding into the Icelandic midfielder's leg. Play swiftly moved to the other end, where Cavani was chopped down by Robbie Brady when he seemed to be running through on goal.\nVideo assistant referee Stuart Atwell looked at both incidents, decided the first was not a red card and the second was, but as they were both part of the same phase of play, told referee Kevin Friend to check the monitor, which he did, before showing Shaw a yellow card.\nThe whole process, from the Shaw tackle to the free-kick being taken, took six minutes. And barely had that episode been concluded than Harry Maguire headed home from an acute angle and turned away to celebrate, only to find the effort had been ruled out for the type of foul on Erik Peters that former England forward Peter Crouch claimed on social media would have cancelled out the majority of his 108 league goals had it applied to him.\nHowever, if United felt those decisions had gone against them, they were might have benefited from one as the clock ticked down and Atwell decided Maguire had not handled in a goalmouth melee, when the call could easily have gone the other way.\nBattling Burnley need investment\nNew Burnley owner Alan Pace was absent from what would have been his first Premier League game since his ALK Capital company assumed control of the Clarets last month.\nThe American was isolating at home after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus.\nHe will have been heartened by Burnley's late flurry as Josh Brownhill, Matej Vydra and James Tarkowski all threatened. But with his team five points above the relegation zone, Mace needs to come good on promises to invest in Sean Dyche's squad during this month's transfer window.\nWhile reinforcements would be welcome, the Clarets displayed all the stubborn qualities and discipline that has seen them recently move clear of the bottom three.\nIf not for the moment of Pogba quality, their gritty approach almost yielded another valuable point after collecting 10 from a possible 12 in the past four games at home before the visit of the Red Devils.\nDefeat, just their second in eight league and cup matches, leaves them 16th in the table.\n'It's good times' - what the managers said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to BBC Sport: \"I'm very pleased of course. Any time you get three points you are happy. We had to dig in and earn it and we did.\n\"I've not seen the fouls but it must be right - the referee went over to look at it. The disallowed goal - that's a mistake, we have to be honest.\n\"The goal was top, great execution and style. Paul Pogba really played well tonight. It would have been easier for us, we should have got the second goal but we don't do it the easy way.\n\"We feel very confident going into games. Away from home we have really done well. We have to believe in ourselves and we do. We've done a great job, it's good times. It's a test against the champions [Liverpool on Sunday] who have been fantastic, a great test for us.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche to Match of the Day: \"It was a decent performance against a top side on decent form. We are growing into our season. Performances and results have improved.\n\"I'm a fan of VAR, and it will streamline over time but that's a tricky one with incidents at both ends. He had to look at both. We want it to be quicker but on that one it's not easy. It was a foul by Luke Shaw - the modern game would suggest you are in trouble with that one.\n\"United came out second half with more tempo and they have spells when they will do that. They scored a very good goal via a deflection and Pope would save it otherwise. The reaction was terrific.\n\"These players give everything and you can see that at the end when we were creating chances and half chances.\"\nBest of the stats\nThis is the first time Manchester United have ended the day top of the Premier League table, having played as many as 17 games, since the final day of their title-winning campaign in 2012-13 under Sir Alex Ferguson.\nManchester United have kept their first away clean sheet of the season in the Premier League, conceding 11 goals in their previous seven matches on the road in this campaign.\nBurnley have scored just one goal in their past 10 home league games against Manchester United, compared to 20 in their previous 10 games versus the Red Devils at Turf Moor.\nBurnley have won just one of their past 26 Premier League home games against the 'big six' sides (D4 L21), a 2-1 victory over Tottenham in February 2019.\nBurnley failed to get a single shot on target against United, the second time they've not found the target in a Premier League game this season - the other against Chelsea in October.\nManchester United forward Marcus Rashford has been directly involved in 11 goals in his past 14 Premier League appearances (six goals, five assists).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley are next in action against West Ham at London Stadium on Saturday, 16 January (15:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-0 Brighton: Phil Foden scores only goal for Pep Guardiola's side\nManchester City extended their unbeaten run to 14 matches in all competitions with a hard-fought win over struggling Brighton.\nPhil Foden grabbed the only goal just before half-time when he collected Kevin de Bruyne's pass, created space and fired into the bottom corner.\nThe hosts had chances to extend the lead, Riyad Mahrez shooting just wide, Ilkay Gundogan seeing an effort saved by Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez and Bernardo Silva hitting the crossbar. Most culpably, Raheem Sterling sent an injury-time penalty over the bar after Sanchez had fouled De Bruyne.\nAlexis Mac Allister had perhaps the Seagulls' best chance to equalise but shot over the top.\nCity's fourth straight win in the league moved them up to third. Brighton, meanwhile, have now not won in nine league matches and are just two points ahead of 18th-placed Fulham, who have two games in hand.\nRelive Manchester City v Brighton as it happened and analysis\nFrom the bottom half to title challengers\nCity have now not lost since 21 November when they were beaten 2-0 at Tottenham, a result that left Pep Guardiola's side 11th in the Premier League.\nHowever, their form has been superb since then with 11 wins and three draws in all competitions, and only three goals conceded in that period. Across league and cups, they have now won seven in a row.\nWhat makes those statistics even more impressive is that Guardiola has repeatedly been without key players because of coronavirus, with goalkeeper Ederson, defender Kyle Walker and forwards Gabriel Jesus and Ferran Torres among those to have missed recent matches.\nAgainst Brighton, City were missing striker Sergio Aguero, the Argentine self-isolating following contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19. With Sterling, Jesus and Torres starting on the bench, De Bruyne operated as a makeshift centre-forward.\nAnd the Belgium international was at the heart of City's best moves. He had a shot saved by Sanchez from a tight angle then released Mahrez, who could only shoot wide.\nBut just before half-time De Bruyne grabbed his ninth Premier League assist of the season when he slid a pass to Foden and the 20-year-old England midfielder did the rest, taking three touches to evade the Brighton defenders and then shooting past Sanchez.\nMahrez, Gundogan, Silva, Joao Cancelo and De Bruyne all had efforts inside the opening 20 minutes of the second half as City pushed for a second to kill the game off.\nSterling, who came on in the 82nd minute as a replacement for Foden, fired a penalty over in stoppage time after Sanchez's clumsy foul on De Bruyne.\nCity, champions in 2017-18 and 2018-19 and runners-up last time, are right back in contention. They are now only four points behind leaders Manchester United with a game in hand on their rivals.\nBrighton lack cutting edge needed to get a point\nBrighton, without a win in the Premier League since they beat Aston Villa 2-1 on 21 November, will be encouraged by their battling performance, but lacked the quality up front to get a point.\nGraham Potter's side had to wait 40 minutes for their first corner, and then the delivery was poor and City quickly broke with De Bruyne forcing a fine save from Sanchez.\nThe Seagulls did not have a shot on target until 10 minutes into the second half and that was no trouble for Ederson as Davy Propper's strike was straight at him.\nPercy Tau, making his Premier League debut more than two years after signing for Brighton, set up Mac Allister, who shot narrowly over.\nPotter brought on top goalscorer Neal Maupay for Tau for the last 22 minutes, but the Frenchman could not inspire an equaliser.\nAnother clean sheet for City - the stats\nManchester City have won their past four Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous 11 in the competition (won four, drew five, lost two).\nBrighton are without a win in nine Premier League games, the longest current run in the competition (drew five, lost four).\nNo side have kept more Premier League clean sheets this season than Manchester City (eight), who also having the fewest goals conceded (13).\nCity have won all seven of their Premier League meetings with Brighton, by an aggregate score of 21-2.\nCity have missed seven penalties in the Premier League since the start of last season, more than any other side. Three of these have been missed by Raheem Sterling.\nPhil Foden scored his eighth goal of the season in all competitions, more than any other Manchester City player.\nCity's Kevin de Bruyne provided his 14th assist of the season in all competitions - no Premier League player has more.\n'Back to our best' - what they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport: \"We knew how tough it would be. Brighton had a good mentality to play.\n\"We had a really good first half and had chances. After we missed a really clear chance in the second half, they were better.\n\"We need to win these sort of games. It is a good lesson for us. Every game will be like this.\n\"Phil Foden is 20 years old. Look at the stats, the amount of games, the assists compared to the bigger stars in football. He can play both sides, in the middle as a false nine. He is so clever in front of goal. That is why he deserves to play.\"\nManchester City match-winner Phil Foden said: \"It definitely feels like we're back to our best. We've taken confidence from the last few results.\n\"We could have done better but overall I'm very proud of the team. It's a great result.\n\"Brighton defended really well and had a good gameplan. To get the goal before half-time was really important. It ended up as the winning goal so I'm delighted.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter told BBC Sport: \"We are disappointed to come away with nothing. We met a top team. I'm so proud of the players. You have to suffer here, that's how it is. We tried to attack.\n\"You're always on the stretch because they have fantastic players. They're so good, they drive you back. Our intention was to be on the front foot and play and attack when we could.\n\"The boys defended well when they had to and left everything on the pitch which is all you can ask.\"\nOn Percy Tau, Potter added: \"I think you got glimpses. It's a tough game for a forward because you have to expend a lot of energy defending which takes away from the quality he has. He's got plenty of time and we need to help him.\"\nWhat's next?\nBrighton will be searching for only their third league win of the season when they play at Leeds on Saturday, 16 January (15:00 GMT).\nThis was the second of four home matches in a row for Manchester City and they host Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday (19:15 GMT).\nMark Wright joins Crawley Town: Can the TV personality make it as a pro footballer?\nThe Serpent: New drama brings the chilling crimes of Charles Sobhraj to life"

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Fulham: Ivan Cavaleiro earns a point for Premier League strugglers\nIvan Cavaleiro scored a late header to earn Premier League strugglers Fulham a hard-fought draw against Tottenham in their hastily rearranged London derby.\nThe Portuguese forward's finish cancelled out Harry Kane's first-half diving header and came just minutes after Son Heung-min hit the post in search of Spurs' second.\nCavaleiro sealed a remarkable turnaround for a side whose manager Scott Parker said it was \"scandalous\" to be given just two days' notice to face Jose Mourinho's men after Spurs' game at Aston Villa was postponed because of a Covid-19 outbreak in the Villa camp.\nTottenham boss Mourinho had little sympathy for the visitors as the derby itself was a rearranged fixture, having been called off three hours before kick-off when originally scheduled on 30 December.\nFor all the complications surrounding the fixture, the intensity from two sides at opposite ends of the table was high at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with Fulham's fifth successive league draw a valuable point in their efforts to escape the relegation zone.\nRelive Tottenham v Fulham as it happened and analysis\nFulham extend resolute run\nFulham made a bright start and Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's fierce shot to test Hugo Lloris was a warning of what was to come from a side who remain 18th despite the draw.\nThe excellent Alphonse Areola twice denied Son in the first 45 minutes, first blocking a toe-poked effort before palming a header away.\nAreola could do nothing, however, to deny Kane the opener in the 25th minute, with the striker beating the Frenchman with a thumping diving header from an excellently-placed Sergio Reguilon cross.\nKane was off target with another header and Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Kenny Tete threatened to respond for the visitors, who had the woodwork to thank for denying Son in the second half after the South Korean scuffed a shot past Areola.\nSubstitute Ademola Lookman was instrumental following his introduction, creating the equaliser for Cavaleiro seven minutes after coming off the bench.\nThe powerful finish extended Fulham's unbeaten run to five league matches, which is their longest such sequence in the top flight in three Premier League campaigns since 2012-13.\nThis latest draw highlights just how resolute Parker's men have become after a slow start to the campaign, in which they collected just one point from their first six matches.\nSpurs punished for reliance on Kane and Son\nWhile the Cottagers may be in the relegation places and had lost a record 13 successive top-flight matches to London rivals, they presented a significantly sterner test of Mourinho's men than non-league side Marine - a team made up of NHS workers, teachers and a refuse collector - which Spurs cruised past in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday.\nThe prolific pair of Kane and Son, a duo that has now scored 23 of Tottenham's 30 league goals this term, were among 10 to return to Spurs' starting line-up.\nSon was an unused substitute on their trip to Crosby but Kane, along with Lloris, Eric Dier, Serge Aurier and Harry Winks came back from being rested.\nWhile Kane was clinical with the nodded finish, he reacted in frustration as he flicked another header off target.\nThat miss, as well as the wastefulness of Reguilon - who sent an early effort over - and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's tame strike, ensured Fulham were still in it at half-time.\nMoussa Sissoko also dithered in the box when an early second-half chance presented itself, allowing Tosin Adarabioyo to superbly block.\nSon's effort off the post, and their reliance on him and Kane for goals, ultimately proved costly as Cavaleiro ended the hosts' run of three clean sheets in January.\nAnd while Reguilon did have the ball in the back of the net again for Tottenham in the final minute, it was immediately disallowed for offside as Spurs missed the chance to move up to third in the table.\n'Some players had one day's training' - what the managers said\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport: \"In the first half Alphonse Areola made some impossible saves, a couple of others in the second, too.\n\"We have to kill a game and we didn't - but you have to keep a clean sheet, not make mistakes, so it was a very avoidable goal. The markers are there, there wasn't even an advantage in terms of numbers.\n\"Fulham were intelligent enough to understand the way they play, they change, they become more defensive and they are getting results. I thought they were a bit lucky but they were good.\n\"We have bad results and we should - and we could have - avoided these results.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm very proud of this team for what we've been through. There's a lot of talk around - everyone assumes about what happened. I know what we've been through the last two weeks.\n\"We had players out there today who had one day's training. What pleased me most was a desire and a passion and a real quality at times tonight.\n\"There's a real determination and hard work from this group of players. They've never shied away from anything.\"\nOn Monday's announcement of the game with Tottenham: \"We were told, in the end, at 9:30. It was put to me on Saturday, if there was a possibility, but I just batted it off thinking 'no chance'.\n\"This game was supposed to be scheduled 16 days ago - for 10 days some of these boys were locked up in their houses. I was surprised but it wasn't in terms of preparing for this game, we've prepared in two days for a game before, it was more just getting told of the consequences that you face.\"\nBest of the stats\nTottenham and Fulham played out their first draw in the Premier League since December 2009, with Spurs winning 10 of the last 11 encounters (L1).\nTottenham are unbeaten in their last eight London derbies in the Premier League (W3 D5), they've never gone longer without defeat against sides from the capital in the competition.\nFulham have drawn five consecutive Premier League games, their longest such run since January 2007 (six games).\nFulham have gained five points in their last four Premier League away games (W1 D2 L1), more than they collected in their previous 13 on the road in the competition (W1 D1 L11).\nOnly Brighton (12) and Sheffield United (11) have dropped more points from winning positions than Spurs (10) in the Premier League this season.\nTottenham's Harry Kane has become just the third player to score 25 Premier League goals with his head (25), his right foot (94) and his left foot (34) - after Robbie Fowler and Andy Cole.\nAdemola Lookman has been directly involved in five goals (two goals, three assists) in the Premier League this season, more than any other Fulham player.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to Bramall Lane on Sunday (14:05 GMT) to face the Premier League's bottom side Sheffield United, who on Tuesday earned their first top-flight win of the season.\nFulham face Chelsea in another derby, hosting their west London rivals on Saturday (17:30 GMT).\nMark Wright joins Crawley Town: Can the TV personality make it as a pro footballer?\nThe Serpent: New drama brings the chilling crimes of Charles Sobhraj to life"

        "article_text": "Arsenal 0-0 Crystal Palace: Stubborn visitors end Gunners' winning run\nArsenal's recent resurgence was checked by a stubborn Crystal Palace, who claimed a hard-fought point from a forgettable encounter at Emirates Stadium.\nTagged as relegation candidates as little as three weeks ago, the Gunners came into the game off the back of four straight wins in all competitions, but were unable to find their way past the well-drilled and disciplined visitors.\nFor a side in such good form, Arsenal were a disappointment going forward, their best effort at goal a shot on the turn from Alexandre Lacazette into the side-netting.\nTheir only other clear-cut chance was an angled shot from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang that Vicente Guaita palmed away.\nThere was more goalmouth action at the other end, with James Tomkins heading an Eberechi Eze free-kick against the bar and Christian Benteke drawing a fine save from Bernd Leno with a nodded effort of his own.\nThe point leaves Arsenal 11th on 24 points and Palace two points and a league place worse off, but comfortably clear of any relegation worries.\nReaction and analysis from Emirates Stadium\nA game to forget\nIt was only three weeks ago that West Brom boss Sam Allardyce said Arsenal were in the middle of a battle against the drop.\nTo be fair to Allardyce, he had a point at the time. But that prediction has been made to look somewhat foolish by the Gunners' subsequent three straight league wins, which included hammering the flailing Baggies.\nIn light of their upturn in form this result has to count as a minor blip, but it underlines the fact that Arteta's side remain a work in progress.\nYoung players like Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe have added some much-needed zip and creative flair in recent games, but they were stifled here, flickering into life all too rarely against a dogged opponent.\nLacazette had scored in each of the last three league games but was marshalled well by Palace and spurned his only real chance, while Aubameyang remains frustratingly ineffective in his role on the left.\nArsenal also felt the absence of the injured Kieran Tierney and his driving forward runs from full-back.\nCredit then to Palace, who had gone five games without a win before beating Sheffield United 2-0 last time out in the top flight, but now have another, deserved clean sheet.\nThis was not purely a backs-against-the-wall display by Roy Hodgson's side. They sought to burst forward following transitions, using the guile and pace of Eze and Wilfried Zaha to challenge the home defence.\nBut for the crossbar, goalkeeper Leno and greater awareness from James McArthur, who was unable to turn in a flick on from Benteke from a corner, they would have claimed a win that would not have been entirely undeserved.\nBefore Thursday's game, Hodgson described Palace's situation - 22 points, 10 clear of the bottom three - as \"somewhat comfortable\". Thursday's point and their performance will only add to their sense of comfort.\nAnd the good news for Arsenal is that they now have their first home clean sheet of the league season as well as the option of a fit-again Thomas Partey, who played 20 minutes after recovering from a thigh injury that had sidelined him for a month.\n'Many players aren't fresh'\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta: \"We created a lot of situations against the low block but lacked the final quality. We probably didn't do enough to win the game.\n\"We are playing a lot of games and you can see fatigue is paying a price, many players aren't fresh.\n\"We had a period that was fatigue related where we kept giving the ball away. We lacked the quality in the final third to win the game.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: \"I'm more than satisfied. A hard-working performance, we defended well and maybe with a bit more composure we could have scored a goal. We were playing a team in excellent form and we go away with a deserved 0-0.\n\"I thought the game was end-to-end and we are happy we took something away from the game.\n\"Two clean sheets in a row now. If you don't defend well it is going to be hard to win games.\"\nArsenal now five without a win against Palace\nArsenal extended their winless top-flight league run against Crystal Palace to five matches, drawing four of those (L1).\nCrystal Palace have kept consecutive Premier League clean sheets for the first time since a run of four in a row between February and June last year.\nArsenal have kept four consecutive clean sheets in all competitions for the first time since October 2016.\nArsenal have failed to score in seven Premier League matches this season, as many as in the entirety of last season, last failing to score in more games in a season in 2015/16 (8).\nCrystal Palace's Christian Benteke had more shots than any other player tonight (6) - the last five players to have 6+ shots in a Premier League game at the Emirates have all been visiting players: John McGinn (Sept 2019), Raul Jimenez (Nov 2019), Sadio Mane (July 2020), Danny Welbeck (July 2020) and Benteke.\nCrystal Palace have kept more Premier League clean sheets in two matches in 2021 (2) than they managed in their final 24 matches in 2020 (1).\nMark Wright joins Crawley Town: Can the TV personality make it as a pro footballer?\nThe Serpent: New drama brings the chilling crimes of Charles Sobhraj to life"

It puts the fear of God into everyone else.\"\nWhy Nuno is facing tough questions at Wolves\nHow Leicester followed guidance on celebrations - and others didn't\nBoth spot-kicks came from clumsy tackles from behind on Callum Robinson, by Willy Boly and Conor Coady.\nThe penalties were similar too as Pereira sent Rui Patricio the wrong way. The first broke the deadlock after eight minutes, the second won the game 11 minutes into the second half.\nIn between, Fabio Silva and Boly turned the game on its head in the space of five minutes at the end of the first half, only for Semi Ajayi to level with a header straight after the restart.\nThe result extended a miserable run for Wolves, who since striker Raul Jimenez fractured his skull at Arsenal on 29 November have taken five points from nine games and slid down the table into 14th spot, with all the clubs below them having games in hand.\nBattling Baggies extend derby record\nAfter a nine-year break since the last one, this result extended an excellent West Brom record in derbies, which now contains just three defeats in 22 games.\nThey achieved victory without goalkeeper Sam Johnstone, who was absent following a positive coronavirus test, and with a vocal intervention from Allardyce.\nHaving spent most of the game in his dug-out, legs stretched out and arms folded, the former England boss finally came out to voice an opinion as his side, trailing and looking edgy, failed to execute what their manager felt was a routine clearance.\nAlllardyce's bellowing could be heard from the media seats. The instruction was clear - get the ball away from our goal quickly.\nThe advice was heeded and while he might not like the description, within minutes, his side had scored what might be regarded as a typical Allardyce goal as Kyle Bartley flicked on a long throw to the near post and Ajayi nodded it over Patricio.\nPereira was nerveless with his penalties and while West Brom can hardly be relied on to either score regularly or keep clean sheets at present, Allardyce has apparently instilled some drive into his players.\nWith significant additions before the transfer window closes on 1 February, it cannot be discounted that Allardyce will maintain his proud record of never getting relegated.\nWolves struggling without Jimenez\nIf there was one moment that underlined Nuno Espirito Santo's increasingly desperate search for an answer to his side's problems, it came 19 minutes into the second half.\nSkipper Coady had never been substituted before under the Portuguese.\nBut after the England man conceded his side's second penalty for another clumsy challenge on Robinson, Nuno evidently decided he was expendable as he switched his team around to accommodate the introduction of Rayan Ait-Nouri at full-back.\nIn a season where Nuno was committed to change anyway, the loss of Jimenez is threatening to undermine confidence in all the good work Wolves have done in progressing from a mid-table Championship outfit into a side capable of securing successive seventh-place finishes in the Premier League.\nIf, for instance, Wolves finished 15th this season, it would be an outcome they have only bettered three times since they were relegated in 1976. Evidently though, spending and improvement under Nuno has raised expectations.\nThey certainly made enough chances to beat West Brom - and had a staggering 23 shots - but without Jimenez, there was no consistent threat.\nFabio Silva took his goal well, opening his body up and sending a precise finish into the far corner from Boly's back-heeled pass. But when crosses come into the box, he does not routinely attack them as Jimenez would.\nWhen Boly put Wolves ahead with an instinctive effort just before the break, it did appear the hosts would claim victory.\nInstead, West Brom rallied and though the hosts had responded once to falling behind for the ninth successive league game, a second comeback proved beyond them.\nCovid protocols breached\nAfter all the talk about new Premier League protocols, Wolves celebrated both their goals normally and had pre-match huddles in the dressing room and on the pitch.\nAnd after the final whistle, West Brom's players celebrated in the usual fashion, underlining the difficulty in getting players to follow the demands of those trying to reinforce regulations.\n'We must rectify it and do better' - reaction\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to BBC Sport: \"Disappointing, frustrated with the way we played and the result.\n\"The beginning of the second half, we started very poorly.\n\"Two penalties and a throw-in [were West Brom's goals]. We knew we required better defending. We must rectify it and do better.\"\nWest Brom manager Sam Allardyce to BBC Sport: \"The only two disappointing moments for me were the two quick goals we conceded when we didn't look like we were going to concede.\n\"Defending set-plays has been one of our few strengths this season and we conceded two today.\n\"Overall it was a fantastic victory. It was the amount of chances we created which pleased me most. I haven't seen us create that many chances.\n\"A win was very important at this moment in time. The attitude, work-rate and determination of the players, that's brought us a big, big victory.\"\nWolves concede first again - the stats\nWest Brom manager Sam Allardyce has faced Wolves more often without losing than any other side in the Premier League (P6 W4 D2), winning his past two meetings.\nWest Brom have won consecutive away league matches against Wolves for the first time since a run of three between 1929 and 1931.\nWolves are without a clean sheet in 12 Premier League games, the longest ongoing run among sides currently in the division.\nWolves have conceded the first goal in each of their past nine Premier League games - their longest ever run of conceding the opening goal in games in the competition.\nWilly Boly became the first Wolves player to concede a penalty, assist a goal and score a goal in the same Premier League game since Adlene Guedioura in May 2011 - which was also against West Brom at Molineux.\nMatheus Pereira became the first player to score two penalties in a Premier League match for a newly promoted club since Chris Brunt also did so for West Brom against Liverpool in April 2011.\nSemi Ajayi's goal for West Brom was their first via a throw-in in the Premier League since Graham Dorrans vs QPR in April 2012. Indeed, since the start of 2018-19, no defender has scored more headed league goals in England's top four tiers than Ajayi (nine - level with Virgil van Dijk and Aaron Pierre).\nWolves have lost both of their Premier League games in which Fabio Silva has scored (also 1-2 v Burnley in December), making him the youngest player ever to lose both of the first two Premier League games in which he scored (18 years 181 days).\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to non-league Chorley in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday (19:45 GMT), before returning to Premier League action against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, 27 January (18:00 GMT).\nNext up for West Brom is a Premier League match against West Ham at London Stadium on Tuesday (18:00 GMT).\nRemembering an icon: Hear how David Bowie always managed to stay ahead of his time\nNeed a lift?: Joe Wicks and guests are here to bring positivity to your day"

There'll be periods when it is, but we're certainly not settling for where we are.\"\nThe Hammers have now kept four successive clean sheets in all competitions, and Moyes added: \"We are pleased with that because I don't think you win games without them.\n\"You always have a chance of picking up a point if you don't concede a goal, and that was very good.\"\nWest Ham were the greater attacking threat on Saturday, and went close again when Angelo Ogbonna's header came off the post before Antonio's effort was cleared off the line by Ben Mee.\nSean Dyche's Burnley never really got going as an attacking force, although they improved marginally after the break following Dwight McNeil's introduction. The midfielder produced a cross that came off the bar while Mee sent a header a foot wide.\nBrighton's win at Leeds means Burnley are now down to 17th, four points above the drop zone, and West Ham are up to ninth.\nHow Leicester followed guidance on celebrations - and others didn't\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v You Me At Six drummer Dan Flint\nMoyes' entertainers shining for West Ham\nMoyes' version of the 'West Ham way' seems to be doing the trick at the moment.\nThe Hammers have 10 more points than they did at this stage last season, and have scored six more goals. The manager likened himself to a headteacher this week, stating his side \"must do better\", but many will think his players have already surpassed pre-season expectations.\nKey to this healthier return has been the addition of creative and goalscoring midfielders such as Jarrod Bowen and Tomas Soucek, who have become vital cogs in the side a year after signing, while \u00a330m capture Said Benrahma appears to be gradually rediscovering his Brentford form.\nWinger Bowen, who cost \u00a318m, has an incredible engine and against the Clarets appeared to act as a second striker to Antonio because of the amount of times he found himself in the area. It was his good work on the left of the area which allowed Fornals to provide the cross for the opener.\nAntonio, 30, was already important to Moyes and is now even more so after the Sebastien Haller experiment failed. The former winger scored a glut of goals towards the end of last season and began this campaign well before hamstring injuries hampered his progress.\nHe kept his cool for his goal when Burnley's defenders did not and later saw a header cleared off the line.\nIf he can stay fit for the rest of the season then expect a glowing end-of-term report from Moyes.\nBurnley fire blanks again\nDyche has been in this position before with Burnley, but this time he might not have to rely on his man-management skills to pull the team out of the mire.\nNew owners have promised him funds for January signings, with reports linking them with two midfielders.\n, external\nThey certainly need better service for their front men.\nAshley Barnes failed to produce an effort on goal while Chris Wood's only strike was a first-half drive which drifted a foot wide. Burnley have now failed to score in six of their past seven away league games, and they have only managed nine goals in the league so far this season.\nFans should not panic yet, but it could be a different mood with matches against Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City to come in the next three weeks.\nLater on Saturday, Burnley announced new chairman Alan Pace had contracted coronavirus.\n, external\nPace has yet to watch the team play live because he has been self-isolating following a positive test in his household.\n'We need to get more effective' - reaction\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche said: \"It's rare in the Premier League to go away from home and have as much possession as we did.\n\"There's a lot of things right about the team at the moment but we've got to find the margins. We're close but we've got to make sure we do it rather than waiting for it to happen.\n\"After eight games we had two points. So we've been effective. But we need to get more effective.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham host West Brom on Tuesday (18:00 GMT) and Burnley are at Liverpool on Thursday (20:00 GMT).\nAntonio joins the '40 club' - stats\nWest Ham have won eight of their 18 Premier League games so far this season. They didn't pick up their eighth league win until their 32nd game last term.\nNo team has failed to score in more Premier League games than Burnley this season (10), while no team has scored in more games so far than West Ham (15).\nWest Ham have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since September 2019.\nAntonio became the fourth player to score 40 Premier League goals for West Ham, after Paolo di Canio (47), Mark Noble (46) and Carlton Cole (41).\nAll 40 of Antonio's Premier League goals have been scored from inside the box, with only four players having achieved the same in the competition (Tim Cahill, Javier Hernandez, Gabriel Jesus and John Terry).\nRemembering an icon: Hear how David Bowie always managed to stay ahead of his time\nNeed a lift?: Joe Wicks and guests are here to bring positivity to your day"

        "article_text": "Leeds 0-1 Brighton: Neal Maupay's goal ends Seagulls' winless league run\nBrighton head coach Graham Potter says his side have to \"take on the challenge and be brave\" after boosting their survival hopes with a deserved win at Leeds United.\nNeal Maupay's winner against a lacklustre home side ended Brighton's run of nine league games without a victory.\nTop-scorer Maupay tapped in after 17 minutes following slick build-up from Alexis Mac Allister and Leandro Trossard.\nBrighton hit the bar through Trossard's deflected cross shortly after, while the Belgian fired over another good chance in the second half.\n\"You can talk about performance, performance, performance but at the end we know we have to get results. We know we have to get points,\" said Potter.\n\"We have to believe we are on the right path. We are fighting for each other, which is clear, and we keep moving forward.\"\nBrighton's victory means they move five points clear of third-bottom Fulham, who lost against Chelsea later on Saturday.\nLeeds created little throughout and managed just two efforts on target.\nWith this defeat coming on the back of 3-0 losses against Tottenham and Crawley, Leeds head coach Marcelo Bielsa said he was \"worried\" by his side's winless start to 2021.\n\"Of course it worries me, these are three games that we could have resolved in a different manner,\" said the Argentine.\n\"The game against Tottenham less, but the game in the cup and the one today leave me worried.\"\nBielsa's side remain 12th in their first season back in the top flight, having taking 23 points from their opening 18 games.\nHow Leicester followed guidance on celebrations - and others didn't\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v You Me At Six drummer Dan Flint\nDeserved win provides Brighton with relief and renewed belief\nBrighton have not had the smoothest of seasons so far, unable to turn some positive performances into points and being decimated by injuries in recent weeks.\nBut, after scraping past Newport in the FA Cup and then losing narrowly at Manchester City, they capped a hectic week with what they needed most at Elland Road - three points and tangible encouragement they are good enough to avoid the drop.\nThe relief at earning their first win since a 2-1 win at Aston Villa on 21 November was clearly evident at the final whistle, although their roars of triumph were followed by relatively restrained fist-bumps as the players remained cautious after being warned about their conduct when celebrating.\n\"It is a big, big win for us, a much-needed win,\" said Maupay, who returned to the Seagulls side after starting on the bench against City on Wednesday.\n\"We have got quality we know that, but we need to keep pushing on and get more wins.\"\nOn the evidence of this performance, there should be no reason why Brighton cannot do just that.\nGraham Potter's side were organised and resolute in defence as Leeds struggled to find their rhythm on a heavy Elland Road pitch.\nBut the Seagulls also attacked intelligently at the right times, opening up the home side on several occasions.\nAs well as Trossard twice coming close, centre-back Adam Webster forced Leeds keeper Kiko Casilla - in for his first league start of the season for the unavailable Illan Meslier\n, external\n- into a save which he had to gather at the second attempt\nWhile they were unable to grab a second goal, there were few moments of apprehension at the other end as Potter's side saw out a deserved victory.\nLeeds' new year hangover continues\nLeeds were expected to provide a strong reaction to last weekend's embarrassing FA Cup defeat at League Two side Crawley Town - but never got into their stride in an uninspiring display.\nThe pitch could have been a factor, stopping them zipping the ball about with their usual pace as they dominated possession, with the lack of tempo perhaps contributing to the lack of mental sharpness which allowed Brighton to cut them open at the back.\nDefender Luke Ayling drifted off to leave Maupay unmarked for the winner, the Frenchman waiting all alone to convert Mac Allister's square pass after his neat one-two with Trossard.\nLike Brighton, Leeds have suffered their own injury problems defensively this season and were also without suspended midfielder Kalvin Phillips in this game.\nThe England international's energy at the heart of their team and ability to smother dangerous breaks was sorely missed by the Whites.\nIn his absence, the home side lacked the kind of attacking energy and tempo for which they have earned plaudits this season.\nTop scorer Patrick Bamford was inches away from turning home an equaliser shortly after Maupay's opener, while substitute Tyler Roberts came close with a low shot straight at Seagulls keeper Robert Sanchez in the second half.\nHowever, Bielsa's side did not show enough to warrant even a point.\nWhy Maupay loves playing Leeds - stats of the day\nLeeds have lost eight of their past 10 league matches against Brighton, although this was their first home defeat against the Seagulls in the top flight.\nEach of Brighton's past five top-flight victories have come away from home.\nLeeds have conceded 14 league goals at Elland Road this season, as many as they shipped in 23 home games last term in the Championship.\nLeeds have lost their first three matches in a calendar year for the first time since 2014 under Brian McDermott, when they lost their first four in all competitions.\nBrighton's Neal Maupay has scored more league goals against Leeds United (four in five games) than against any other opponent in his career in England.\nMaupay became just the second player to net 10 or more Premier League away goals for Brighton after Glenn Murray (11).\nLeeds have only had fewer shots on target in a game under Marcelo Bielsa at Elland Road once previously - when they registered none against Sheffield United in 2019.\nWhat's next?\nLeeds have a rare luxury of 10 days without a match.

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-1 Chelsea: Mason Mount goal settles London derby\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard says his side \"can't think everything is solved\" after labouring their way to a second Premier League win in seven games against 10-man Fulham.\nAntonee Robinson was sent off late in the first half for Fulham for a dangerous tackle on Cesar Azpilicueta.\nMason Mount - who earlier hit the bar - proved the match-winner with a half-volley after Alphonse Areola flapped at Ben Chilwell's cross.\nTen different players had shots for Chelsea, but they were wasteful in front of goal.\nThe win takes Chelsea up to seventh, while Fulham - who had drawn their previous five league games - are four points from safety.\n\"A month ago we were flying high, but since then we've struggled,\" Lampard told BBC Sport. \"It's a challenge even a man down.\n\"Maybe a bit [confidence affecting his players], that's normal in football, but every team are having phases of form. Within that you get individuals short of form. We've got talent at the top end and it's my job to sort that out.\n\"Perfection is not an easy thing to get. I won't say I was blown away with the performance. There were lots of bits I was happy with, but we won't get too ahead of ourselves.\"\nPremier League celebrations: Leicester & James Maddison lead the way\nFollow reaction plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nCan result help Chelsea kick-start season?\nChelsea went top of the table on 5 December when they beat Leeds. This was only their second victory in the league since then - and they sit seven points off Manchester United, having played an extra game.\nBoss Lampard talked about \"the experience and personality of\" Olivier Giroud and Antonio Rudiger when explaining their places in starting XI - and spoke of the need to \"kick-start\" their season.\nThe result came eventually, albeit not with a stellar performance.\nGiroud and Chilwell both missed the target with volleys, while Hakim Ziyech had a shot well saved before Mount hit the bar.\nRudiger had a header tipped wide, Ziyech went close with a shot from the left wing and Giroud flicked an effort wide at the near post.\nIt looked as if the goal was never going to come before Mount finally converted with a well-hit low finish.\nSubstitute Timo Werner had a glorious chance to end his Premier League goal drought - going back to 7 November - late on but slotted wide at the end of a counter-attack.\nRobinson red card costs Fulham\nRobinson's dismissal came during Fulham's best spell of the game - or rather at the end of it.\nThree of their five first-half shots came in the five minutes before the USA wing-back's mistimed tackle on Azpilicueta. Some disputed whether the red card was merited, but in the modern era it was dangerous enough to justify a sending off.\nIt was a disastrous three minutes for Fulham because Ivan Cavaleiro had just missed their best chance of the game when, unmarked on the penalty spot, he fired over from Kenny Tete's pass.\n\"The longer the first half went on we came into it. It was a great chance for Cavaleiro - that needs to go in,\" boss Scott Parker told BBC Sport.\n\"I've not seen it [the red card] again. In real time I didn't see it. I want my players to play on the line - to be committed and aggressive. But if he's crossed it he needs to look at that.\"\nThey ended up defending for most of the second half - with only 23.2% of the ball - although they did have chances. Harrison Reed and Aboubakar Kamara forced saves and Cavaleiro had a shot blocked by Thiago Silva.\nJust when it looked like they were going to make it six Premier League draws in a row, Areola failed to deal sufficiently with Chilwell's cross and Mount pounced.\n\"I thought defensively we were fantastic. You still want to be a bit of a counter-threat,\" said Parker.\n\"In the second half, you're playing the clock a bit - we tried to hold on but it wasn't to be. But I've nothing but admiration for my team - they were superb to a man.\"\nMatch stats - Chelsea are the 1-0 kings\nChelsea's win ended a run of three straight Premier League defeats on the road. This was the Blues' fourth away clean sheet of the season, after keeping just one last term.\nFulham remain winless in their last 19 Premier League London derby matches (D2 L17) since a 2-1 win over West Ham in January 2014.\nChelsea have lost just one of their 29 Premier League meetings with Fulham (W18 D10), remaining unbeaten in their last 19 against the Cottagers in the competition.\nChelsea have won 131 Premier League games by a 1-0 scoreline, the most common winning score for a single team in the competition's history.\nChelsea had 21 shots against Fulham, only managing more against other promoted sides West Brom (22) and Leeds (23) in Premier League games this season.\nAs well as scoring the winner, Mason Mount created seven chances in this game - the joint-most by a Chelsea player in a league game this season (Mount also seven against Leeds).\nAntonee Robinson's red card was Fulham's third in the Premier League this season - no side has had more so far this term.\nAntonee Robinson became the eighth different player from the USA to be sent off in the Premier League, with Fulham the first side to have two American players see red (also Carlos Bocanegra).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea visit Leicester City on Tuesday, while Fulham host Manchester United the next day (both games at 20:15 GMT).\nRemembering an icon: Hear how David Bowie always managed to stay ahead of his time\nNeed a lift?: Joe Wicks and guests are here to bring positivity to your day"

        "article_text": "Leeds 0-1 Brighton: Neal Maupay's goal ends Seagulls' winless league run\nBrighton head coach Graham Potter says his side have to \"take on the challenge and be brave\" after boosting their survival hopes with a deserved win at Leeds United.\nNeal Maupay's winner against a lacklustre home side ended Brighton's run of nine league games without a victory.\nTop-scorer Maupay tapped in after 17 minutes following slick build-up from Alexis Mac Allister and Leandro Trossard.\nBrighton hit the bar through Trossard's deflected cross shortly after, while the Belgian fired over another good chance in the second half.\n\"You can talk about performance, performance, performance but at the end we know we have to get results. We know we have to get points,\" said Potter.\n\"We have to believe we are on the right path. We are fighting for each other, which is clear, and we keep moving forward.\"\nBrighton's victory means they move five points clear of third-bottom Fulham, who lost against Chelsea later on Saturday.\nLeeds created little throughout and managed just two efforts on target.\nWith this defeat coming on the back of 3-0 losses against Tottenham and Crawley, Leeds head coach Marcelo Bielsa said he was \"worried\" by his side's winless start to 2021.\n\"Of course it worries me, these are three games that we could have resolved in a different manner,\" said the Argentine.\n\"The game against Tottenham less, but the game in the cup and the one today leave me worried.\"\nBielsa's side remain 12th in their first season back in the top flight, having taking 23 points from their opening 18 games.\nHow Leicester followed guidance on celebrations - and others didn't\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v You Me At Six drummer Dan Flint\nDeserved win provides Brighton with relief and renewed belief\nBrighton have not had the smoothest of seasons so far, unable to turn some positive performances into points and being decimated by injuries in recent weeks.\nBut, after scraping past Newport in the FA Cup and then losing narrowly at Manchester City, they capped a hectic week with what they needed most at Elland Road - three points and tangible encouragement they are good enough to avoid the drop.\nThe relief at earning their first win since a 2-1 win at Aston Villa on 21 November was clearly evident at the final whistle, although their roars of triumph were followed by relatively restrained fist-bumps as the players remained cautious after being warned about their conduct when celebrating.\n\"It is a big, big win for us, a much-needed win,\" said Maupay, who returned to the Seagulls side after starting on the bench against City on Wednesday.\n\"We have got quality we know that, but we need to keep pushing on and get more wins.\"\nOn the evidence of this performance, there should be no reason why Brighton cannot do just that.\nGraham Potter's side were organised and resolute in defence as Leeds struggled to find their rhythm on a heavy Elland Road pitch.\nBut the Seagulls also attacked intelligently at the right times, opening up the home side on several occasions.\nAs well as Trossard twice coming close, centre-back Adam Webster forced Leeds keeper Kiko Casilla - in for his first league start of the season for the unavailable Illan Meslier\n, external\n- into a save which he had to gather at the second attempt\nWhile they were unable to grab a second goal, there were few moments of apprehension at the other end as Potter's side saw out a deserved victory.\nLeeds' new year hangover continues\nLeeds were expected to provide a strong reaction to last weekend's embarrassing FA Cup defeat at League Two side Crawley Town - but never got into their stride in an uninspiring display.\nThe pitch could have been a factor, stopping them zipping the ball about with their usual pace as they dominated possession, with the lack of tempo perhaps contributing to the lack of mental sharpness which allowed Brighton to cut them open at the back.\nDefender Luke Ayling drifted off to leave Maupay unmarked for the winner, the Frenchman waiting all alone to convert Mac Allister's square pass after his neat one-two with Trossard.\nLike Brighton, Leeds have suffered their own injury problems defensively this season and were also without suspended midfielder Kalvin Phillips in this game.\nThe England international's energy at the heart of their team and ability to smother dangerous breaks was sorely missed by the Whites.\nIn his absence, the home side lacked the kind of attacking energy and tempo for which they have earned plaudits this season.\nTop scorer Patrick Bamford was inches away from turning home an equaliser shortly after Maupay's opener, while substitute Tyler Roberts came close with a low shot straight at Seagulls keeper Robert Sanchez in the second half.\nHowever, Bielsa's side did not show enough to warrant even a point.\nWhy Maupay loves playing Leeds - stats of the day\nLeeds have lost eight of their past 10 league matches against Brighton, although this was their first home defeat against the Seagulls in the top flight.\nEach of Brighton's past five top-flight victories have come away from home.\nLeeds have conceded 14 league goals at Elland Road this season, as many as they shipped in 23 home games last term in the Championship.\nLeeds have lost their first three matches in a calendar year for the first time since 2014 under Brian McDermott, when they lost their first four in all competitions.\nBrighton's Neal Maupay has scored more league goals against Leeds United (four in five games) than against any other opponent in his career in England.\nMaupay became just the second player to net 10 or more Premier League away goals for Brighton after Glenn Murray (11).\nLeeds have only had fewer shots on target in a game under Marcelo Bielsa at Elland Road once previously -

We got paid a compliment with the way they set up and you could see, led by the manager, that they thought this was going to be a tough afternoon.\n\"Apart from the last 10 minutes, it wasn't a foregone conclusion. The goals really, at any level... after Tuesday night, the first thing we needed was to have a bright start and get a foothold in the game and we didn't.\"\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho: \"The performance was good. The team was very dominant, created enough chances to kill game in the first half.\n\"In the second half, the intention was the same. A very basic mistake gave them the goal with the only chance they had, but then we had a genius action to bring us again to a two-goal advantage.\"\nYorkshire delight for Kane - the stats\nSpurs have lost just three of their past 30 matches in all competitions (W19 D8), winning four of their five in 2021.\nSheffield United are only the second team in top-flight history to lose 16 of their first 19 matches in a season after Bolton Wanderers in 1902-03, who were relegated in bottom place.\nSpurs registered their first away league victory against Sheffield United since December 1975, ending a seven-game winless run at Bramall Lane.\nSheffield United have conceded 15 home Premier League goals this season - as many as the Blades conceded at Bramall Lane in the whole of last season.\nSpurs forward Harry Kane has scored in each of his last six Premier League appearances in Yorkshire, netting 10 goals - Kane is the first player since Mark Viduka for Leeds between March and August 2003 to score in six consecutive appearances in Yorkshire.\nSheffield United striker David McGoldrick has ended on the losing side in four of the five Premier League games he has found the net (80%) - the joint-highest percentage of any player to score in at least five Premier League games along with former Sheffield United striker Alan Cork (also lost 4/5 games he scored in).\nJose Mourinho has never lost an away Premier League match against a side starting the day in the relegation zone (P28 W21 D7).\nAaron Ramsdale has kept just six clean sheets in 56 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth and Sheffield United combined (10.7%) - the worst ratio of any goalkeeper to play at least 50 Premier League games.\nWhat next?\nBoth sides switch their focus to the FA Cup fourth round next as Sheffield United host League One side Plymouth Argyle on Saturday, 23 January (15:00 GMT) while Tottenham travel to Championship outfit Wycombe Wanderers on Monday, 25 January (19:45)\nMissed all the goals, highlights and talking points from Saturday's Premier League action?

It's not just the result we're disappointed with, it's some of the performance. I know these boys can play better.\"\nUnited are now two points ahead of Manchester City, who moved up to second by beating Crystal Palace 4-0, and Leicester City in third. Liverpool, who have scored just one goal in their past four league games, have dropped to fourth, a point behind the Foxes.\n\"The performance was good enough to win it but to win a game you have to score goals and we didn't do that, so that's why we had that result,\" said Reds boss Jurgen Klopp.\n\"We try not to not score. We obviously have to ignore the fact and hope it will be good again.\"\n'From dejection to frustration in 12 months, Anfield draw underlines Man Utd progress'\nReaction from Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v You Me At Six drummer Dan Flint\nLiverpool and Klopp frustrated again\nKlopp cut a frustrated figure pretty much from the first whistle, his voice booming around Anfield with a tone of displeasure, showing unhappiness with his own players and officials.\nThe German's team, so used to steamrollering all before them in recent times, are going through a very dry spell and barely created an opening worthy of the name here against a resolute Manchester United defence.\nToo often, Liverpool's approach play ended with a careless pass or an aimless cross and the longer this game went on the more United looked the most likely winners.\nIt was perhaps inevitable Liverpool would be unable to maintain their relentless style, but there will be concerns they have now gone four league games without a win since Crystal Palace were demolished 7-0 at Selhurst Park.\nBefore this draw, West Bromwich Albion left Anfield with a point, while Liverpool also had a goalless draw at Newcastle United and lost at Southampton.\nSadio Mane and Mohamed Salah are feeding off scraps, while Roberto Firmino's impact was so minimal that he was withdrawn near the end, even with the hosts chasing a goal.\nA team as good as Liverpool will not remain off the boil for too long, but there is no doubt they are struggling for form and spark. The fact this is their longest barren sequence in the league since February and March 2005 tells the tale.\nDid Man Utd miss a big chance?\nManchester United may have a taken a point before this game and there will be justified satisfaction that they subdued Liverpool so completely, created the game's best chances and remain top of the table.\nAnd yet there must also be disappointment that they could not cash in completely on an off-colour Liverpool, with reality dawning on them very late that they could take all three points.\nFernandes, despite being poor in general, almost unlocked Liverpool twice, while Solskjaer and his backroom team threw their hands up in frustration as other good positions were wasted late on.\nIn the final reckoning, however, there will be few complaints at this outcome, which leaves them three points ahead of Liverpool with the visit to Anfield negotiated without mishap.\nUnited were well organised and grew into the game after a poor opening half-hour and had real defensive heroes in captain Harry Maguire and left-back Luke Shaw, with the latter particularly outstanding.\nIt is a display that will give them increased confidence and belief as they lead the pack - although they might just look back and think a point could so easily have been three.\n'It was an opportunity missed' - reaction\nManchester United manager Solskjaer said: \"They are a good side and they have some injury problems but we didn't pounce on that.\n\"I felt we grew into the game and got stronger and stronger and were closer to winning.\n\"We were a bit disappointed in the performance, not just the result. We didn't do well enough to cause them problems in the first half but we defended well and they didn't create too many chances.\"But I think everyone was a bit disappointed with the way we started the game but that is a good feeling to have - that we were disappointed in the performance.\"\nLiverpool boss Klopp told BBC Sport: \"The performance was good and the first half was exceptionally good.\n\"With all the things that were said before the game - United are flying and we were struggling - and then to play this kind of game, I was happy with that.\n\"We tried in the second half again, but you cannot deny United over 90 minutes, not with the counter-attacking threat they have. So they had two really good chances, I have to say, but we had our chances in the second half as well.\n\"The way we understood the game, the way we felt the game, the way we read the moments were really good. But it is not exactly how it should be so we have space for improvement, absolutely. We will keep working on that.\"\nMan Utd extend unbeaten run on the road - stats\nLiverpool and Manchester United have drawn 0-0 at Anfield in the league three times in the past five seasons, as many times as in the previous 48 top-flight campaigns.\nUnited are unbeaten in their past 16 away matches in the Premier League (W12 D4) - only once have they gone longer without a defeat on the road in the competition (17 games ending in September 1999).\nLiverpool are now unbeaten in their past 68 league games at Anfield, earning 178 out of a possible 204 points over this run.\nUnited are the first side to stop Liverpool scoring at Anfield in a Premier League match since Manchester City in October 2018 - this was Liverpool's 43rd home league game since then.\nUnder Klopp, Liverpool are unbeaten in all seven of their Premier League games at Anfield when facing the side starting the day top of the table (W3 D4).\nMarcus Rashford was caught offside five times in this match, the most of any Premier League player this season and the most by a United player since Robin van Persie (six) against Spurs in January 2013.\nWhat's next?\nUnited are at Fulham in the league on Wednesday (20:15 GMT) and Liverpool host Burnley on Thursday (20:00).

        "article_text": "Manchester City 4-0 Crystal Palace: John Stones scores twice as City go second\nJohn Stones scored twice for Manchester City as Pep Guardiola's resurgent title challengers cruised past Crystal Palace to go second in the Premier League.\nHours after Liverpool and leaders Manchester United shared a goalless draw, City capitalised to move within two points of top spot with their fifth successive league victory.\nStones opened the scoring with a header from Kevin de Bruyne's delightful cross as the Belgian made it 100 assists in all competitions since joining the club in 2015.\nThe hosts were already in complete control when Ilkay Gundogan added a superb second from the edge of the box shortly after the break.\nStones, having previously never scored in the Premier League for City, then smashed in his second from a corner before Raheem Sterling curled in a free-kick for City's fourth.\nGuardiola's side can go top if they win their game in hand, while defeat means Crystal Palace remain 13th.\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v You Me At Six drummer Dan Flint\nCity sparkle on eve of Pep's big day\nAfter this victory, Guardiola can celebrate his 50th birthday on Monday knowing his side's title ambitions rest in their own hands.\nThe Catalan hits that milestone as already one of the most decorated coaches in the modern era, with two Champions League triumphs complemented by eight league titles across three countries, but a third Premier League success looked a far cry when Manchester City sat 13th after a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham in November.\nGuardiola's side are undefeated in nine league games since and have now won five in a row to accelerate within touching distance of the summit with a game in hand.\nThis was a performance that showcased the best City have to offer at both ends.\nFormer Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola is not renowned for his defensive rigidity but his City outfit have conceded the fewest goals in the English top flight this season and this was their seventh clean sheet in the past nine games.\nIt was also the 10th time centre-backs Stones and Ruben Dias have started together in all competitions this campaign, with City shipping just one goal in that time.\n\"If there's one guy who deserves it, it is John, he has struggled for many reasons in the past, it belongs to him how he overcame this,\" said Guardiola afterwards.\n\"It's just minutes for him. He deserves to play, he doesn't make mistakes and he's created a good partnership with Ruben Dias.\"\nThey had the brilliance of De Bruyne to thank for unpicking a Palace side that had set up to frustrate the hosts in the first half.\nThe 29-year-old's wonderful assist, a perfectly weighted outside-of-the-boot cross, found a rising Stones for the defender to head beyond goalkeeper Vicente Guaita.\nThat was Stones' first Premier League goal since scoring for Everton in April 2015, and the England centre-back did not have to wait long for another as he pounced on a loose ball after the visitors failed to clear a corner in the second half.\nIt came after Gundogan curled in his fourth goal in the past six league games, while Sterling got in on the act late on with an excellent free-kick from the edge of the box.\nPalace's Etihad luck runs out\nRoy Hodgson is one of the few managers to have got the better of Guardiola at Etihad Stadium, earning a win and a draw in Palace's past two visits, but his side were outclassed on Sunday.\nThe visitors' task was made harder with the absence of talismanic forward Wilfried Zaha, who picked up a knock in the goalless draw at Arsenal in midweek.\nThe Eagles struggled to earn a foothold in the game, managing just 27% of possession and watching City make almost three times as many passes as they could manage.\nThat said, there was little they could do to defend against the quality of some of Manchester City's finishing, with the hosts only registering 0.7 for expected goals.\nHodgson will perhaps be concerned however that his side have now failed to score in 10 of their past 14 away games in the Premier League, including each of the last three.\nThe closest they came was a speculative Eberechi Eze attempt in the first half when the Palace playmaker spotted Ederson off his line, but his effort sailed over the crossbar.\n'A good glass of wine' for Guardiola\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"This is through the quality of the players, commitment and focus. We struggled the last two seasons to beat them here, we did a fantastic game.\n\"I don't want to send any messages. It is Aston Villa on Wednesday. It is one game at a time.

Smith Rowe did well to release Saka and his low cross found Aubameyang, but, off balance and from a tight angle, he could only hit the post with the goal unguarded.\nAubameyang twice more failed to hit the target when well placed and David Luiz should have done better with a free header.\nBut it only took five minutes of the second half to make a breakthrough as Thomas Partey's pass forward let Aubameyang run at the Newcastle defence from the halfway line and he blasted in only his second league goal in 10 games.\nIt became 2-0 10 minutes later when Smith Rowe did well down the left flank and his pass helped Saka score for the third time in six matches.\nSoares then made a fine run down the opposite wing and his pullback was steered into the net by Aubameyang, whose return to goalscoring form is a massive boost for the Gunners.\nAttacking line-up does not change Newcastle's fortunes\nBefore the game, Bruce defended the job he was doing with the Magpies and said he would not quit and would \"do my utmost to make this better\".\nBruce, whose arrival followed the departure of fan-favourite Rafael Benitez in 2019, added that criticism of him \"had been personal from day one\", and that \"certain people think I shouldn't have been in the job to start with\".\nNewcastle became the first side to lose a Premier League game this season against bottom-of-the-table Sheffield United, with a 1-0 defeat on 12 January and Bruce later admitted he had picked the wrong team.\nBut against Arsenal, Bruce made eight changes, with attacking players Joelinton, Almiron, Andy Carroll and Callum Wilson all starting as he pushed to get his side's first win since a 2-1 victory over West Brom on 12 December.\nHowever, the Magpies still struggled to create opportunities as Joelinton and Wilson had very quiet games. Almiron shot over in the first half and Carroll fired an effort wide in the second, but they never looked like producing a fightback after the hosts took the lead.\nIn fact, only a number of fine saves from Darlow, who twice denied Alexandre Lacazette and kept out a deflected Aubameyang cross, saved Newcastle from a wider margin of defeat on another worrying day for Magpies' fans.\nSeven games without a league win for Newcastle - the stats\nArsenal have kept five consecutive clean sheets in all competitions for the first time since February 2009 (six in total in that run).\nNewcastle are without a win in seven Premier League games (drew two, lost five), their longest run without a victory in the competition since October 2018 (10).\nThere were just nine days between this win and Arsenal's 2-0 FA Cup victory against Newcastle at the Emirates on January 9th, the shortest gap for the Gunners between home wins against the same opponent since January 2008, when they beat Newcastle twice at the Emirates in the space of three days.\nNewcastle made eight changes to their starting XI in the Premier League for the first time ever and are the first side to make 8+ changes in the competition since Manchester City also made eight against Burnley in June 2020.\nArsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made his 400th appearance in European League football (Arsenal 102, Borussia Dortmund 144, St Etienne 87, Monaco 19, Lille 14 and Dijon 34).\nAubameyang has either scored (five) or assisted (two) in six of his seven games against Newcastle in all competitions, finding the net in each of his last four against the Magpies.\nArsenal midfielder Thomas Partey registered his first league assist in 48 appearances, since April 2019, for Atletico Madrid against Valencia in La Liga.\nEmile Smith Rowe has either scored (two) or assisted (five) in seven of his 10 appearances for Arsenal in all competitions, whilst the Englishman has provided two more assists than any other player for the Gunners this campaign (five).\nOnly Nicolas Anelka (30), Cesc Fabregas (28) and Theo Walcott (12) have been involved in more Premier League goals for Arsenal as a teenager than Bukayo Saka (11 - five goals, six assists).\n'Trying to do the best I possible can' - what they said\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta speaking to BBC Sport: \"Really happy overall. Really positive performance, collective and individually we looked really solid and convincing from the first whistle.\n\"It took us a little bit longer than I expected to score the first goal but I really like the chemistry, cohesion and rhythm the team played with.\n\"I asked them to attack better, have more options in certain areas but without losing the structure that is needed to control Newcastle's good players up front. When we did it we were efficient and took our chances.\"\nOn his young players, he added: \"They are doing really well because they have the senior ones pushing them, coaching them, helping them all the time. I really like the chemistry.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We gave as good as we got and got into ourselves some decent opportunities but that little bit of confidence has ebbed away - that happens when you are on a run like we are. The only way it comes back is with a couple of victories.\n\"We always knew we entering a really difficult run of games. To play Arsenal, Leicester, Liverpool and Manchester City we always knew it was going to be difficult against these top teams.\n\"You have seen their [the players] approach. We are disappointed because we have been caught trying to get forward. Two passes and they are in on our goal.\n\"That is something we have to learn from and understand. The reason we have been defending deep was to avoid situations like that. We have to get the balance right and we will keep working on it.\"\nOn his own position, he added: \"I am trying to do the best I possibly can as always but you will have to ask others about that.\"\nWhat's next?\nArsenal are in action away from home on Saturday at 12:15 GMT in the fourth round of the FA Cup, although they do not yet know who their opponents will be.\nThey face the winners of the third-round tie between Southampton and League One side Shrewsbury, who play their rearranged match on Tuesday. It could mean back-to-back away games against the Saints as they play at St Mary's Stadium in the Premier League on Tuesday, 26 January (20:15 GMT).\nNewcastle have an away game in the Premier League against Aston Villa on 23 January (20:00 GMT), before entertaining Leeds at home three days later (18:00 GMT).\nAll the goals, highlights and analysis from the weekend's Premier League matches, including Manchester United's visit to Liverpool: MOTD2 is streaming now on BBC iPlayer"

I want us to be competing at the top end and to do that we have to keep winning.\"\nWest Ham took the lead on the stroke of half-time when Bowen chested in Vladimir Coufal's cross.\nThe visitors levelled soon after the restart through Matheus Pereira's thunderous drive from distance.\nDara O'Shea then blocked Manuel Lanzini's goalbound shot but Antonio gave West Ham the win with a hooked finish.\nFrom then on, West Ham looked comfortable without threatening to add to their lead as they claimed a third Premier League win in a row.\nDefeat for West Brom, meanwhile, leaves them 19th, five points from safety.\nAntonio underlines importance to West Ham\nAntonio has endured an injury-hit campaign and his start against Burnley at the weekend was his first since November.\nBut the striker made up for lost time by getting the decisive goal in that game and, despite concerns over how he would cope with starting a second game in three days, he was once again the match-winner against the Baggies.\nAntonio is a deadly finisher inside the box, with all 41 of his Premier League goals having been scored inside the penalty area and he is integral to how Moyes wants his West Ham side to play.\nThey have become a defensively more solid side under the Scot - with West Brom's goal the first the Hammers have conceded in their past five games in all competitions - but they are also winning games by narrow margins, underlining the need for a player of Antonio's quality.\nMoyes is looking to sign a striker in the January transfer window but keeping Antonio injury free for the remainder of the season will arguably be more important to West Ham's ambitions.\n\"We are looking to get him to get back to his level of fitness but he is certainly back to his level of goals because he is nearly a goal a game since he came back,\" Moyes added.\nAnother defeat, but some hope for Baggies\nWest Brom boss Sam Allardyce has forged a reputation for leading seemingly doomed teams away from relegation trouble but when he took over at the Baggies on 16 December, it looked like this would be a task too far.\nThey had won just one of their first 13 matches before Allardyce's arrival and lost three of his first four games in charge, conceding 13 goals and scoring just one in the process.\nBut a hugely impressive 3-2 victory at Wolves on Saturday has given Baggies fans hope that fortunes are starting to turn and although this game ended in defeat, there were signs of encouragement.\nIn a match of few chances for either side West Brom often looked a threat on the counter and could have snatched a point with more composure from Darnell Furlong, who flashed a volley wide in injury time.\nAllardyce said: \"Great response in the second half - we got our goal but you have to expect in the Premier League that the home team will put a bit of pressure on you and that pressure did come.\n\"So even though we did fight back and created a chance or two, ultimately we lost the game because their final-third play was better than ours.\"\nA first since Fenton - the stats\nWest Ham have won each of their opening four matches of a calendar year for just the second time in their history, last managing to do so in 1958 under Ted Fenton, a run in which they also beat Stockport County in an FA Cup encounter.\nWest Brom have now lost 12 of their 19 league games this season; indeed, seven of the past nine sides to have lost at least 12 matches at the halfway stage of a 38-game Premier League season have gone on to be relegated (except Swansea in 2016-17 and Burnley in 2018-19).\nThis match between West Ham boss David Moyes (564) and West Brom manager Sam Allardyce (518) was the 1,082nd Premier League game combined between the two men, the most number of matches between two bosses facing off since April 2018, when Manchester United beat Arsenal (Jose Mourinho (285) versus Arsene Wenger (825).\nAfter 11 matches without a goal in all competitions, Matheus Pereira has since netted in each of his past three appearances for West Brom (four goals), as many as he scored across his previous 37 games.\nBefore taking the West Ham job in 2011, Allardyce had only lost two of his 14 matches against the Hammers. However, since leaving the club in 2015, the now-West Brom boss has suffered defeats in each of his four such clashes - all in the Premier League.\nEach of Michail Antonio's 41 Premier League goals have come from inside the area, with his winner for West Ham his 14th strike at London Stadium in the top flight, now the outright most by any player.\nWest Brom extend their winless top-flight run on a Tuesday to 33 matches since beating Watford 2-0 in May 1985 (D14 L19). Indeed, their Premier League run of 30 games without a win on this day is the most by any side on any given day in the competition's history.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham are in FA Cup action as they host Doncaster in the fourth round on Saturday, 23 January (15:00 GMT). West Brom's next fixture sees them host Manchester City in the Premier League on Tuesday, 26 January (20:15).\nExcelling at esports: Can this British team make an impact on the global scene?\nThe show must go on in lockdown: David Tennant and Michael Sheen star in Staged"

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-0 Chelsea: Leicester win to go top of Premier League\nLeicester City moved to the top of the Premier League table and increased the pressure on struggling Chelsea manager Frank Lampard with an impressive victory at The King Power Stadium.\nThe Foxes knew a win would see them overhaul Manchester United and they were on their way after only six minutes when Wilfred Ndidi fired in off the inside of the post from 20 yards.\nChelsea rarely threatened, although they were denied a first-half penalty by VAR when Christian Pulisic went down under a challenge from Jonny Evans, only for the technology to confirm the offence took place just outside the area.\nLampard's misery was swiftly reinforced as Leicester City broke clear to add a second four minutes before the break, James Maddison sweeping a cool finish past Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy on the half-volley from Marc Albrighton's pass.\nLampard 'worried' by Chelsea slump\nChelsea barely raised a gallop after the break and it was Leicester who created the better openings as James Justin headed wide when unmarked and Mendy saved from Youri Tielemans.\nLeicester are now a point ahead of Manchester United having played a game more while Chelsea are in eighth, five points off the Champions League places.\nReaction to Leicester v Chelsea and West Ham's win against West Brom\nPremier League predictions. Cassia bassist Lou Cotterill takes on Lawro\nLampard feeling the heat\nMake no mistake - Chelsea manager Lampard is under increasing pressure after another dreadful performance on a night they could have used to show signs of recovery against an in-form side.\nInstead, this was a wretched affair lacking any spark and urgency, and more significantly desire, with Leicester closing out the win with barely a moment of anxiety all night.\nChelsea were sloppy in midfield, toothless in attack and soft in defence, falling asleep at a free-kick and a corner for Leicester's first from Ndidi then being undone by a routine angled pass from Albrighton.\nThe body language was resigned, with not the hint of a second-half revival, while there will also be renewed scrutiny on Lampard's transfer policy.\nTimo Werner, for all the consoling words heaped upon the \u00a347.5m signing by Lampard, only started on the bench while \u00a371m summer capture Kai Havertz was a non-existent presence on the pitch - it was no surprise when he was replaced in the second half.\nLampard will be well aware of the reality of his situation. He will know his background as a Chelsea great will not spare him from judgement by owner Roman Abramovich.\nHe must hope the fact that Chelsea are not yet adrift of the Champions League places will give him more time but given a summer expenditure of more than \u00a3200m, performances as poor as this will only turn up the heat on the manager.\nSuperb Leicester show title style\nLeicester fully deserve their place at the top of the Premier League after they delivered a performance of class and composure to win with ease.\nThe Foxes never looked like losing control once Ndidi put them ahead. They were in command at the back - with 20-year-old French defender Wesley Fofana magnificent - controlled midfield and could easily have won by more.\nIt may yet be a short-lived stay at the top with Manchester City playing Aston Villa on Wednesday but manager Brendan Rodgers has a team that only missed out on the top four on the final day of last season and looks stronger this term, despite the \u00a350m summer sale of England left-back Ben Chilwell to their hapless opponents here on Tuesday night.\nJames Justin has stepped in to Chilwell's place and been outstanding while on the other flank Belgium right-back Timothy Castagne looks a sound, assured addition.\nFofana, however, looks one of the signings of the summer with his combination of talent, pace and power.\nHe has forged a fine partnership with the experienced Jonny Evans and has been keeping Caglar Soyuncu, who has been sidelined by injury recently, out of the team.\nThis was such an assured win that anyone who had doubts about Leicester's ability to be involved at the top end of the table again this season will have to re-assess that thinking.\nOur performance was slow and sluggish - what they said\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers: \"You have seen the real spirit of the side tonight. We were a real threat going forward.\n\"The performance and maturity of the team was pleasing. I knew we were playing against a talented team and we had to be right on our game.\"\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard: \"There are players who are not playing as well as they should be, that's a simple fact.\n\"I'm disappointed with both the goals. We know we can compete with Leicester when we are are playing well but when you go 2-0 down and you are in a difficult period of form it affects the game hugely.\n\"The players know they were beaten by a better team, a team we are behind and one we want to catch. The general theme of our performance was slow and sluggish.\"\nTitle-winning similarities - the stats\nLeicester City will end the day top of the Premier League table having played as many as 19 games of the season for the first time since the final day of their title-winning 2015-16 campaign.\nLeicester City have won 30 of their 35 Premier League games when scoring first under Brendan Rodgers.\nChelsea have kept a clean sheet in just 17% of their away games in the Premier League under Frank Lampard (5/29); among those to have taken charge of 10+ away games in the competition, this is the lowest percentage of any Chelsea manager.\nSince the start of last season, only Newcastle (52) have conceded more away goals in the Premier League than Chelsea (50).\nLeicester City's Brendan Rodgers has now beaten all 34 of the teams he's faced in the Premier League as a manager - he had previously failed to beat Chelsea in each of his 11 top-flight meetings with the Blues before tonight (D7 L4).\nLeicester midfielder James Maddison has scored in three consecutive league appearances for the first time in his career.\nLeicester's Wilfred Ndidi has scored more Premier League goals versus Chelsea than any other team (two), while three of his seven goals in the competition have come from outside the box.\nWhat next?\nBoth sides switch their focus to the FA Cup fourth round next. Leicester are at Championship side Brentford on Sunday, 24 January (14:30 GMT) while Chelsea host Luton, also of the Championship, earlier the same day (12:00 GMT).\nExcelling at esports: Can this British team make an impact on the global scene?\nThe show must go on in lockdown: David Tennant and Michael Sheen star in Staged"

Cassia bassist Lou Cotterill takes on Lawro\nCity duo De Bruyne and Bronze voted into Uefa Fans' Teams of the Year\nCity's perseverance pays off\nFor long spells on a miserable night at Etihad Stadium it appeared that City's breakthrough would never come.\nThings might have been more straightforward for City had Bernardo converted from close range when a corner was headed into his path after four minutes, but instead Emiliano Martinez made a brave save at his feet and set the tone for a battling Villa performance.\nCity had 24 efforts at goal before Bernardo eventually broke the deadlock, but 12 of them were blocked and the closest they had come to a breakthrough was when Joao Cancelo's second-half shot bounced back off the bar.\nVilla rode their luck, especially when Martinez denied John Stones from a corner and the ball somehow evaded Gundogan when he appeared certain to follow up and score, but they also had chances of their own.\nBertrand Traore almost made the most of a slip by Kevin de Bruyne but his curling effort was well saved by Ederson, who also had to claw away a fierce Douglas Luiz effort to secure his side's fifth consecutive clean sheet.\nVilla vibrant on return to action\nVilla leave Manchester empty handed, just as they did in their previous Premier League game against United on 1 January, but they deserve great credit for their performance here.\nNine unnamed players and five members of their backroom staff had tested positive for Covid-19 at the start of January, and the club's training ground only reopened on Sunday.\nThey had seen their past two league games, against Everton and Tottenham, postponed but this was a reminder of the way they were playing before their season was interrupted.\nSmith was December's manager of the month after his side stayed unbeaten across five games and ended the year in fifth.\nThey have dropped out of the top half while they have been out of action but on this evidence that is a false position - the defensive improvement that has been the hallmark of their season was again on show here, as was their spirit.\n'Did they get juggling balls for Christmas?'\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola to MOTD: \"I had the feeling we controlled the game. The top four players they have, player like Jack Grealish and Ross Barkley, the feeling is that wow, you feel the dangers in every actions.\n\"We arrived at the byline many times but could not score the goal but Bernando Silva was there and his goal made the difference.\n\"We struggled against Brighton in the last game - they are one of the best teams for creating chances, so it has been hard for us. Maybe they are not clinical but they are good.\"\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith, speaking to MOTD: \"It was a farcical decision (to allow the first goal). I've not seen a goal like that given. It needs to be looked at. I don't think anyone in this stadium thought it was a goal.\n\"I thought they would go over to the VAR screen. I saw the incident and saw it was kicking off, so I asked the fourth officials did they get juggling balls for Christmas.\n\"For the second goal, a header from a yard out that has hit his arm. That's not handball. Ridiculous.\n\"It was a heroic performance in terms of energy and commitment but we didn't show enough quality against a very good team.\"\nWhat's next?\nCity travel to play League Two side Cheltenham in the FA Cup on Saturday (17:30 GMT) with the game being shown live on BBC One. They return to Premier League action on Tuesday with a trip to West Brom (20:15).\nVilla are out of the FA Cup but play their rearranged Premier League game with Newcastle, postponed at the end of November because of Covid-19 cases in the Magpies camp, on Saturday (20:00) as they begin to work through their fixture backlog.\nCity beat Villa again - the stats\nManchester City have won 15 of their past 16 Premier League home games against Aston Villa, including each of the past 11 in a row.\nCity have kept 10 clean sheets in their 18 Premier League games this season - only in 1976-77 (17 games) have they reached 10 in fewer games in their league history.\nAston Villa made 10 blocks against City - only Leeds against Liverpool on the opening day have made more in a Premier League game this season (12).\nThere were 39 shots in total in this match (28 for City, 11 for Villa) - only Manchester United v Leeds in December has seen more in the Premier League this season (43).\nCity's Bernardo scored his first Premier League goal since July, and his first at the Etihad since netting a hat-trick against Watford in September 2019.\nGundogan's penalty was his seventh goal in all competitions this season, his best goalscoring season in his top-flight career.\nWith five shots and six chances created, City's Phil Foden was involved in more shots than in any game in his Premier League career.\nYou can stream five fourth-round games live on the BBC this weekend, including Liverpool's trip to Manchester United.

He does everything. Now he is putting all the elements together in his performances and it is great to see.\n\"It was about getting him fit. He is enjoying his football, he is happy and physically in a good shape.\"\nThe win takes United to 40 points, two more than both Leicester and Manchester City, who had briefly taken top spot from the Foxes with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa on Wednesday.\nSolskjaer, though, was reluctant to get drawn into discussing his side's title credentials with so much of the campaign to go.\n\"It is always going to be talked about that when you are halfway through and top of the league, but we are not thinking about this, we just have to go one game at a time,\" he added. \"It is such an unpredictable season.\"\nFulham remain in the bottom three, four points behind 17th-placed Burnley.\nLive text commentary of Fulham v Man Utd, plus Man City v Aston Villa\nMan Utd or Man City to end day top? Cassia bassist Lou Cotterill takes on Lawro\nHard-fought but deserved win for United\nSolskjaer felt his side missed a big opportunity to fully assert their title credentials in failing to make the most of their chances in Sunday's 0-0 draw at champions Liverpool.\nUnited were clearly in no mood to repeat such a mistake at a wet and windy Craven Cottage on Wednesday against a less daunting and defining opposition, but one that is far more robust now than they were in the season's first month.\nThe visitors fell behind, but this is par for the course for this side, who once again did not panic, wrestled control of the game away from their opponents and took the win.\nIt is a handy trick for a title-challenging side to have in their locker, although one they would rather not have to repeatedly pull.\nIn truth, they should have won more handsomely.\nThey had the far greater share of possession and territory and were well ahead of their opponents on shots taken until a frantic finale in which the Cottagers threw in all they had in pursuit of a point.\nFred felt he should have had a penalty in the first half courtesy of being caught in the box by a loose challenge from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but both on-field and VAR officials disagreed.\nHarry Maguire twice headed wide from corners, the first from a far less forgivable, unmarked position than the second.\nEqually, though, it is a game that could have seen them drop points, especially in light of Fulham's late barrage, which saw David de Gea save superbly with his legs to deny Loftus-Cheek, and the ball pinballing around the United box on more than one occasion.\nThe Cottagers demonstrated that they are no pushover, but they are making of habit of being on the rough end of fine margins.\nFive straight draws followed by two defeats by a single goal suggests their battle against the drop will go right down to the wire.\n\"I'm really pleased but I'm disappointed at the same time, which shows how far we've come,\" said Cottagers boss Scott Parker.\n\"I saw a team today that looked threatening and tried their hardest to get back into the game, but we go again. The next challenge is to maintain where we are and don't let defeat sink us.\n\"No doubt we can win and operate in this division and we just need to push on and keep improving.\"\nUnited lead the way in early concessions\nNo side has conceded more goals in the opening five minutes of Premier League games this season than Manchester United (4). Manchester United have won seven Premier League games having gone behind this season - only Newcastle in 2001-02 (10) and Man Utd themselves in 2012-13 (9) have done so more in a single campaign.\nManchester United are unbeaten in their last 17 Premier League away games (W13 D4), equalling their longest ever unbeaten run on the road in top-flight history (17 between December 1998 and September 1999).\nThis was the 41st different game in which Fulham had led in all competitions under Scott Parker, but the first time they had lost such a game (W34 D6).\nEdinson Cavani became the first Man Utd player whose first four Premier League goals for the club were all scored away from home.\nSince his return to the club in 2016, no Man Utd player has scored more league goals from outside the box than Paul Pogba (6).\nAdemola Lookman has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Fulham player this season (6 - 3 goals, 3 assists).\nBruno Fernandes has gone three Premier League games without a goal or assist for the first time since his Manchester United debut in February 2020.\nWhat next?\nFulham's next game is in the FA Cup, against Burnley on Sunday (14:30 GMT). Their next league fixture, an away game on Wednesday, 27 January, is a big one.

        "article_text": "Liverpool 0-1 Burnley: Ashley Barnes scores winner as Reds' unbeaten run ends\nLiverpool's 68-game unbeaten home run in the Premier League came to an end as Ashley Barnes fired in a late winner from the penalty spot to secure a famous victory for Burnley.\nBarnes was tripped in the box by goalkeeper Alisson with seven minutes remaining and converted the spot-kick as Burnley won at Anfield for the first time since 1974.\nLiverpool's last league loss on their own ground came nearly four years ago, against Crystal Palace in April 2017, and they are now six points behind leaders Manchester United at the midway point in the campaign.\nDivock Origi was given his first start of the season and should have scored when he ran free on goal after pouncing on Ben Mee's error but struck the crossbar.\nThe hosts pushed to find the net in the second half but ran out of ideas, Nick Pope making a stunning save to deny Mohamed Salah and fellow substitute Roberto Firmino flicking an effort wide.\nBurnley's shock win lifts them up to 16th in the table, seven points clear of the relegation zone.\nKlopp takes blame but what has happened to Liverpool?\nRelive Burnley's stunning win at Anfield\nReds out of form\nJurgen Klopp said before the game he was \"not worried\" by his side's poor run, but the latest setback means this has now turned into a real problem for the Liverpool manager.\nAfter 19 games, Liverpool are out of form and out of confidence, failing to find the net in their last 440 minutes of top-flight action and awaiting their first league victory of 2021.\nThey looked to be hitting their stride on 19 December when they took apart Crystal Palace 7-0, but have not won in the league since and scored just a solitary league goal in that time, against relegation strugglers West Brom.\nTheir drop-off from the same stage last season is extraordinary - after 19 games last term the Reds were 13 points clear at the top with 55 points, but they have 21 fewer points now.\nAside from Pope's save to thwart Salah and stops from Origi and Trent Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool did not look a side who were threatening to find the net.\nThey had 72% possession but much of it was slow and ponderous, and although they had spaces out wide and put 30 crosses into the box, the resolute Burnley defenders headed and hacked clear every ball that came in.\nBurnley secure famous win\nLiverpool won 18 of 19 league games at Anfield as they cantered to the title last term.\nBurnley were the spoilers on that occasion - earning a 1-1 draw in July 2020 - and they bettered that showing here with another solid and well-organised display.\nCaptain Mee had 14 clearances and made two tackles, while centre-back partner James Tarkowski contributed five interceptions and won the ball back four times.\nBurnley are a well-drilled outfit and know their limitations, happy to sit back and soak up the pressure before looking to take their chances on the counter-attack.\nThey had sniffs on the break but were unable to get the final ball right and while Barnes forced an excellent save out of Alisson, the assistant referee's flag would have ruled it out.\nThey remain the lowest scorers in the league with just 10 goals - level with bottom side Sheffield United - but their defensive solidity means they will always pose a threat, even to the biggest teams.\n'We dealt with the basics' - manager reaction\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche to Match of the Day: \"Performance, we had to work very hard, as you do in these places, be diligent and do your jobs - shape was good, energy was good.\n\"We had a golden chance, kept searching, but you have to deal with the basics and we did that very well.\n\"We were close last year, you get a feel of a performance and I said 'you are used to playing against these players, working without the ball, there's always a chance and you have to take it'. Barnsey sticks it in there, gets a toe, it's a penalty and he sticks it away very well.\"\nGoal shy Reds - the stats\nThis was Burnley's second Premier League win away against the reigning champions (also v Chelsea in August 2017). Indeed, since the 2017-18 season, Burnley are the only side with two away league wins over the reigning English champions.\nLiverpool have gone four league games without scoring for the first time since May 2000. The Reds have had a total of 87 shots since Sadio Mane's 12th-minute strike against West Brom, 25 days ago.\nThis is the first time a Jurgen Klopp side has gone four league games without scoring since his Mainz side did so in the Bundesliga from November to December 2006.\nLiverpool have gone five Premier League games without a win (D3 L2) for only the second time under Klopp (also from Jan-Feb 2017).\nLiverpool have conceded two penalty goals at Anfield in this season's Premier League (also Sander Berge for Sheff Utd); they had only conceded two penalty goals at the ground under Klopp before 2020-21.\nLiverpool had 27 shots without scoring against Burnley, the most they have had in a single league match without finding the net since April 2013 v Reading (28), and most at Anfield since April 2012 v West Brom (30).\nAshley Barnes' penalty for Burnley was his first away goal in the Premier League in 11 appearances on the road, since netting against Watford back in November 2019.\nSince the start of last season, no goalkeeper has made more saves against a single opponent in the Premier League than Burnley's Nick Pope against Liverpool (19). Pope has made 14 saves in his last two games at Anfield, including six tonight.\nWhat next?\nLiverpool have another big game on Sunday against rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup. That game is live on the BBC (17:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 2-0 Newcastle United: Watkins ends goal drought as pressure on Bruce grows\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith believes his side can \"do something special\" after they beat Newcastle to increase the pressure on manager Steve Bruce.\nVilla moved above Chelsea and Southampton into eighth and are now just five points behind fourth-placed Liverpool with two games in hand.\nDespite playing a more positive 5-3-2 formation, the visitors were undone by a Villa team whose manager watched from the stands following his touchline ban.\nSmith's impressive outfit still showed the quick attacking interplay which has been a feature of their season as Ollie Watkins ended a run of nine league games without a goal when he headed in the opener following Fabian Schar's mistake.\nSmith, who would not be drawn on his side's European aspirations, said: \"I'm really pleased with the team spirit and attitude, we can do something special but we have to keep working game by game.\n\"I am really pleased for Ollie Watkins, it always weighs on forward's minds [not scoring for a while] and it was nice to get an early goal for himself. Really pleased, solid performance at 2-0 and another clean sheet at home.\"\nNewcastle, who have scored only once in their past eight games, lacked the sort of confidence in front of goal that Villa showed in doubling their lead.\nBertrand Traore played a one-two with Jack Grealish before cannoning a shot in off the crossbar.\nThere were first-half opportunities for Bruce's side, who introduced Allan Saint-Maximin - after a long coronavirus absence - and Ryan Fraser for the final 19 minutes.\nBut after their only shot on target in the fourth minute, they did not overly trouble a Villa team who have at least one game in hand on all the teams above them except Everton.\nDefeat for Newcastle means they are winless in 10 games and slip to 16th, seven points above the relegation zone.\nNewcastle offer better balance but same result\nNewcastle fans, who have been critical of Bruce's style, might point to Villa as a team who can play positive attacking football with similar resources.\nThe fact Villa have enjoyed an upward curve since Bruce left the club in 2018 will not be lost on them, and even though the Newcastle manager was right to say prior to this game that Smith has enjoyed the benefits of last summer's investment in players, Villa have been a joy to watch this season.\nIn contrast, Newcastle, who started the season positively, have been in a rut. Debate about Bruce's formations have been rife on Tyneside and his position came under further discussion on Saturday after former Magpies manager Rafael Benitez left his job in China.\nBut in picking a 5-3-2 formation, it did seem to offer a better balance. Jonjo Shelvey, Miguel Almiron and the deeper Jeff Hendrick made up the midfield, allowing Andy Carroll to support Callum Wilson up front.\nFor much of the first half it looked promising. But when getting into good positions, Newcastle were let down by poor crossing or finishing, with Carroll wasting two good opportunities.\nTheir dwindling confidence was not helped by Schar's error when he failed to clear Matt Targett's first-time cross, allowing Watkins to nod past a flapping Karl Darlow.\nTraore's finish put a comfortable distance between the two sides and Newcastle never looked like breaking through.\nThere was a brief lift once Saint-Maximin and Fraser came on with the latter almost getting on the end of Almiron's through ball, but it was another dismal night for Bruce, who has plenty to ponder as he attempts to arrest a worrying slide towards the bottom three.\nVilla hotting up for European chase\nIn losing three of their past four games, Villa have been on their worst run of the season.\nYet this performance, plus the fact that a draw and two defeats in the league came against Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City, showed that Smith's team are still on the right track, especially after recovering from a coronavirus outbreak in their squad.\nBy moving above Chelsea and within touching distance of the top four, European ambitions must still feature in Smith's plans.\nDespite sitting in the stands on a freezing night after criticising the officials in the midweek defeat by Manchester City, his side will have provided fans with much optimism for the rest of the season with another efficient attacking display.\nThey might have been fortunate for the first goal, although Targett's cross was excellent, but Traore's fifth goal of the season three minutes before half-time typified their approach despite Newcastle claiming Darlow was fouled beforehand.\nThere could have been more for Villa, with the impressive Grealish curling one effort wide. The effervescent Watkins, who had a first-half strike ruled out for offside, could also have added to his nine goals this season.\nBut with their defence well-marshalled by the vocal Tyrone Mings, and Douglas Luiz providing cover in midfield, Villa ran out comfortable winners.\n'I know we are capable' - manager reaction\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce: When you're in the bottom half of the Premier League, you are always looking over your shoulder and what you need to erase it all is to win a couple of games.\nI know this group of players are capable, we've done it before. We've had a particularly tough time in terms of illness and injuries and let's hope we can stay fit and healthy, because if we can do that then I'm convinced we will be OK.\nAshley is a patient man - analysis\nFormer Newcastle winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 Live: If the fans had their way, I'm sure they would say they want Steve Bruce out now. But Mike Ashley is a patient man and as long as he sees a future in the Premier League, and there's no risk to that, I don't think Steve Bruce has got a problem.\nIt's about results. If you play well, it's entertaining and you get results that's the best thing in the world, but Steve Bruce needs a couple of wins quickly. That would give him a gap to the bottom three but he needs to find a [winning] formula.\nGrealish the assist king\nJack Grealish has provided eight assists in 17 Premier League appearances for Aston Villa this season, more than he had in his first four seasons in the competition combined (seven in 70 games).\nAston Villa have kept a clean sheet in nine of their 17 Premier League games this season, with only Manchester City (10) recording a shutout more often.\nAston Villa's Ollie Watkins scored his third headed goal in the Premier League this season, with only Dominic Calvert-Lewin having scored more so far this term (four).\nWhat next?\nVilla travel to face Burnley on Wednesday in the Premier League before a trip to Southampton the following Saturday.\nNewcastle host Leeds on Tuesday in the Premier League before travelling to Everton next Saturday.\nBarack Obama's A Promised Land: Hear from the former US president as he reflects on his time in office\nBBC Food: How can you eat well for \u00a31 a portion?"

        "article_text": "Newcastle 1-2 Leeds: Steve Bruce finds encouragement in midst of worst run of his career\nSteve Bruce said he may be on his worst run of results in 20 years as a manager but was encouraged by his Newcastle side's second-half display in a home defeat by Leeds.\nTuesday's loss - inflicted by goals from Raphinha and Jack Harrison for the visitors, either side of a Miguel Almiron finish - was Newcastle's fifth in a row in the Premier League and means them have now picked up just two points from the past 27 available to them.\nThey have now not won in 11 games in all competitions - the longest such run of Bruce's career. The last time he endured a similarly lengthy run without victory was a 10-game stretch as Aston Villa boss between December 2016 and February 2017.\nHowever, Almiron did end Newcastle's run of 454 minutes of football without a goal during a much-improved second-half showing, which saw Jamaal Lascelles clip the bar with a header following a corner and Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier make a number of good saves.\n\"This league is demanding and cruel at times,\" Bruce told BBC Sport. \"I don't know if I've been on a worse run in 20 years but tonight, I've seen a little bit of something and we will start again tomorrow.\"\nNewcastle have been deprived of some of their best attacking talent in recent weeks because of injury and illness, chief among them Allan Saint-Maximin, but the French winger came off the bench against Leeds and almost inspired his side to a point.\n\"Any club near the bottom, if you take out your best players going forward, they make such a huge difference,\" added Bruce.\n\"Saint-Maximin has been the one, along with Almiron, who lifts the place up with their ability and to be more of a goal threat, we need him and Ryan Fraser to stay fit.\n\"If those two stay well and Almiron stays well, then hopefully we have a front three that will create enough to hopefully get us where we want to be.\"\nWhere they are now is seven points above the relegation zone but having played two more games than 18th-placed Fulham. Leeds are seven points better off in 12th place in the table.\nLive text commentary of Newcastle v Leeds, plus Tuesday's other Premier League games\nLawro's predictions v guitarist Alex Sprogis from post-punk band TV Priest\nFootball Daily podcast: Tuchel in, Bruce out?\nLeeds edge it but there are positives for Newcastle\nRaphinha was key to Leeds' win, superbly slotting in the opener after he was found by Rodrigo and then supplying the pass for Harrison's superb winner. The Brazilian winger also hit the post from a tight angle in the first half and tracked back tirelessly to help his defence.\nThe Whites have struggled in recent games, failing to score in back-to-back losses against Tottenham and Brighton, either side of an FA Cup humbling at League Two Crawley, but this was a decent riposte to their critics.\nIt means they have now done the league double over Newcastle for the first time since 1975-76.\nLeeds' victory came at a cost, though, with Spain international centre-back Diego Llorente limping off less than 10 minutes into his full debut to continue the injury woes he has suffered since joining the club in September.\nFrom the outside, Bruce's position appears perilous and edging towards untenable.\nThe conservative football Newcastle have served up for much of the campaign is palatable only if it brings results with it, but those have long dried up for a side whose meagre return of points since a 5-2 loss at Elland Road in mid-December has seen them plummet into trouble.\nA week ago, Bruce declared it was time Newcastle started playing \"my way\" - something he has subsequently clarified to mean defending 20-30 yards higher up the pitch.\nThere was little evidence of that in the first half as Leeds comfortably took control of possession and the contest through Raphinha's well-taken goal.\nLeeds are not in their best moment of the season, but their opponents' stand-offish approach in the first 45 minutes acted as a leg-up, and as Marcelo Bielsa's side have demonstrated already they need little invitation to ruthlessly pour forward.\nBruce and owner Mike Ashley are fortunate that St James' Park is empty at the moment, sparing them both what would have been the ire of 50,000 frustrated home fans at the half-time whistle.\nHowever, Bruce warrants a tip of the cap for his changes in the second half, which saw his side harry the visitors higher up the pitch and look more dangerous than they have at any stage this year.\nBut for Meslier and a better placed header from Lascelles from a corner they would have had a point, possibly more.\nUltimately, though, Leeds had the edge. Their goals were a showcase for the incisive attacking play we have seen in spades this campaign, while their resilience in the second half is a rare but pleasing facet that will serve them well if they can maintain it.\n\"We expected a difficult game,\" said Bielsa. \"There was a 20-minute spell after Jack Harrison's goal where it was difficult to control the game.\n\"For us it was a game we needed to win and it was very difficult but we managed to do it.\"\nNewcastle's worst run since May 2015\nNewcastle have lost six consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since a run of eight in May 2015.\nNewcastle are winless in nine Premier League games (D2 L7), their longest run without a win in the competition since October 2018 (10 games).\nLeeds are the final Premier League side to score in 2021, ending a run of 304 minutes in all competitions without a goal.\nLeeds United's Raphinha has been directly involved in six goals (three goals, three assists) in his six Premier League away starts for the club - scoring and assisting in a single league game tonight for the first time since April 2019 (for Sporting Lisbon).\nMiguel Almiron's 57th-minute strike for Newcastle ended a run of 454 minutes of football without a goal in all competitions for the Magpies, since Andy Carroll's goal v Leicester.\nRaphinha became the first Leeds United player to score each of his first three Premier League goals for the club away from home, since Michael Bridges in August 1999.\nNewcastle's Fabian Schar made his 50th Premier League start tonight, becoming the ninth Swiss player to reach the milestone in the competition.\nWhat next?\nNewcastle are away at Everton, who have won four of their last five games, on Saturday for a 12:30 GMT kick-off.

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-3 West Ham: Hammers into top four but still improving - David Moyes\nWest Ham David Moyes feels his side have \"not scratched the surface yet\" of their potential after they beat Crystal Palace to continue their flawless start to 2021 and move into the top four of the Premier League.\nThe Hammers have now won six in a row in all competitions, with the latest victory coming from an impressive away display, epitomised by Tomas Soucek, who was on target twice.\nPalace took an early lead through their returning talisman Wilfried Zaha, but Moyes' side were soon back on terms through a goal from their Czech midfielder and from thereon in dominated.\nThe free-scoring Soucek added another and Craig Dawson netted a third with a routine header before Michy Batshuayi's late strike for the hosts took some of the shine off the scoreline but not the result.\n\"We are getting better and we are an improved team, but I think we are not scratching the surface yet. I think we have so much more we can give,\" said Moyes.\n\"Part of a manager's job is to raise expectations at your football club but I will not try and be stupid because West Ham have done it too often and maybe got it wrong.\n\"I am going to be a bit more steady and sensible if I can. But I am ambitious, I want to manage teams at the top of the league and be competing in the competitions if I can.\n\"And the players are giving me every hope, they're doing a great job and they have been exceptional in the way they have played and they want more - I can sense it in the dressing room.\"\nWest Ham are now on 35 points from 20 games, but Palace - still a healthy 11 points clear of danger - have won just one in 10.\nFollow reaction from Crystal Palace v West Ham, plus Tuesday's other Premier League games\nLawro's predictions v guitarist Alex Sprogis from post-punk band TV Priest\nEurope the target for West Ham?\nThe Hammers sit fourth in the table, above champions Liverpool, a scenario few would have imagined just a year ago.\nWest Ham were 17th in the Premier League, just one point above the relegation zone, when Moyes returned for a second spell in December 2019.\nNow he may have his sights on matching the club's best ever Premier League finish of fifth in 1999 - although he will know as well as any manager not to take his side's form for granted in this most unpredictable of seasons.\nZaha's brilliant early goal had the Hammers on the back foot right away but they settled well and were level when Michail Antonio hooked a ball across for the ever-dangerous Soucek to power in a header.\nThe Czech, a relative bargain at \u00a319m, has had a great year under Moyes and soon added a second, controlling a deep free-kick on his thigh before smashing in at the near post.\n\"When you think this time last year we signed him and to come in and hit the ground running in the Premier League is really difficult at any time, but he has not only done that - he has made a big difference,\" added Moyes.\n\"He has made a difference with his performances, with the type of lad he is and his honesty, so he has been great and he can score and he showed that tonight.\"\nAntonio will feel he should have bettered Soucek's efforts but he twice hitting the post and saw Vicente Guaita make a wonderful reflex save to keep him out.\nHis misses would not matter though, despite Batshuayi's stoppage-time finish. Dawson's powerful header made it five wins for Moyes in five matches at Selhurst Park, for five different teams - Preston (2001), Everton (2004), Manchester United (2014), Sunderland (2017) and West Ham (2021).\n'More to come from West Ham' - analysis\nFormer England defender Alex Scott, discussing West Ham on BBC Match of the Day: \"There is free-flowing football. When I watch West Ham now they are exciting and on the front foot. They want to take the game to teams now instead of waiting to see how a game develops.\n\"I was impressed again with their attacking play tonight. They won the ball back high up the pitch. Tomas Soucek is getting forward and pressing into attacking spaces.\n\"I've been really impressed with Said Benrahma. He exploits space, wanting to make something happen.\n\"Michail Antonio will be so disappointed that the only thing he didn't have today was a goal. But his movement, going out wide to help create space for Benrahma through the middle.

Not that Arteta is looking.\n\"I don't want to look at the table,\" said the Spaniard. \"I want to look at ourselves, how we can get better, the reason we are playing better and winning football matches.\"\nArteta's team are finally producing results, with a fifth win in six league games easing the pain of Saturday's FA Cup exit, while building further momentum before Saturday's intriguing home game with high-flying Manchester United.\nSaka once again showed why he is being touted for a big future with an energetic performance, which he capped with a fine finish, while Granit Xhaka and Lacazette also created goals.\nArsenal, who are close to signing attacking midfielder Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid on loan, are still a long way from where Arteta wants them to be.\nBut there are clear signs the Gunners are heading in the right direction after taking 16 points from the past 18 on offer.\nOnly Manchester City have won more points (18) and conceded fewer goals (one) than Arsenal in the Premier League since 26 December.\nArteta's players left the pitch wearing big smiles - a far cry from earlier in the season when they struggled to put a run of wins together.\nStuttering Saints\nSouthampton reach the halfway stage of their season with a healthy 29 points in the bank, but it is now one win in seven top-flight games for Hasenhuttl's side.\nThere is much to admire about the way they have gone about their business but this was an off-day as the Saints slipped to 11th in the table.\nIt might have been a different outcome but for Leno, with the Arsenal keeper making excellent saves to keep out Adams and, late in the game, a Ward-Prowse free-kick.\nArmstrong's goal had given them the perfect start but Arsenal found plenty of space down the left hand side as they picked off the hosts.\nThe Saints went into the game on the back of five clean sheets in six league and cup games but struggled at the back against Arsenal without the presence of the suspended Ryan Bertrand and the injured Kyle Walker-Peters.\n\"The quality wasn't good enough to be competitive against this team,\" said Hasenhuttl.\n\"We still have 29 points, that is a good thing.\n\"We know that we are a good team if everything is perfect and we are in a good shape.\"\nThere will be no panic at St Mary's - and rightly so. But Hasenhuttl will be desperate his side return to winning ways sooner rather than later.\nYoung Gunner makes his mark - the stats\nBukayo Saka became the second English teenager to score for Arsenal in consecutive Premier League appearances, after Ashley Cole in October 2000.\nStuart Armstrong's opener for Southampton was the first Premier League goal Arsenal have conceded since Tammy Abraham scored against them for Chelsea on 26 December. It ended the Gunners' run of 367 minutes without conceding in the league.\nSouthampton's James Ward-Prowse (26 years 86 days) made his 250th Premier League appearance, becoming the ninth-youngest player to reach this milestone in the competition's history.\nAlexandre Lacazette is the first Arsenal player to reach 10 goals in all competitions this season, while he has now hit double figures for goals in all four seasons since joining the Gunners.\nOnly Matt Le Tissier (63) has registered more Premier League assists for Southampton than James Ward-Prowse (27, level with Dusan Tadic).\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in Premier League action on Saturday, with Southampton hosting Aston Villa (20:00 GMT) after Arsenal's home game with Manchester United (17:30).\nMark Wright's Last Chance: He's made his debut now can he keep a spot in the team?\nSecrets of Cinema: How British comedy kept us all laughing"

        "article_text": "West Brom 0-5 Man City: From stop-gap to goal-machine - Ilkay Gundogan emerges as unlikely driving force\nIlkay Gundogan was not the obvious or most exciting answer to the question of how Manchester City would replace their midfield talisman David Silva, but after doing that he has now turned into their new Sergio Aguero too.\nThe versatile Germany international has stepped into Silva's silky shoes to set the tempo for Pep Guardiola's side since the Spaniard left last summer and, even more surprisingly, he has also borrowed Aguero's shooting boots to help fire City to the top of the Premier League.\nPreviously, the 30-year-old had not managed more than six league goals in a single season, either with City or back in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund or Nuremberg, but his two goals in Tuesday's thumping win over West Brom mean he has hit seven in eight league appearances since 15 December.\nWhere have his goals come from? \"I don't know to be honest, there is not really a secret,\" Gundogan said at full-time.\n\"We try to be a bit flexible [with our positions], especially when we see our centre-backs or holding midfielder building up and, if the player has the time and the space to put in the right ball, we try to make movements - which is exactly how we scored our first goal here.\n\"I just try to be in the right spaces at the right moment. I have played the past few weeks in a bit more offensive role and, if I get the chance close to the opponent's box, then I try to be there and try to take the right decisions.\"\n'Gundo is a guy with an incredible sense of goal'\nGundogan's goal rush has coincided with City's rise to the summit on the back of seven straight league wins, and 11 in a row in all competitions, scoring 30 goals in the process.\nHe is not the only reason Guardiola's side have brushed aside the continuing absence of Aguero, their all-time top scorer, to hit form in such devastating fashion, but he has certainly played a big part with some key contributions - four of his goals have been City's first of a game.\nThere have been a variety of finishes too, from the spectacular - like his sumptuous strikes from the edge of the box against the Baggies and Crystal Palace - to proper poachers' efforts like his close-range finish from a Raheem Sterling cut-back against Newcastle.\nThat goal was an example of how much further forward he is getting these days, in a new advanced role, to have more shots per game than ever before since he arrived at Etihad Stadium for \u00a320m from Borussia Dortmund as Guardiola's first signing in June 2016. He is also making them count.\n\"Gundo is a guy who has an incredible sense of goal,\" Guardiola explained after his side's stylish win at The Hawthorns.\n\"It is not just knowing the right time to arrive at the box, it is the right second. This is the most difficult thing - not to arrive one metre before, or one metre later, but at exactly the right time, and Gundo has this sense.\n\"And it's not just that - with his finishing too he has this way to control the ball, slow down and take a second to compose himself and see what happens, and be clinical.\"\nFrom stop-gap to main man\nThe problem for Gundogan in the past has been finding a place in the team, but not any more.\n\"He's under-rated but it's always been difficult for him at City because of the players ahead of him,\" says former City defender Micah Richards. \"Sometimes he has just had to fill in where he could, often just instead of Fernandinho or Rodri.\n\"But he always had a lot more to his game than just being a holding midfielder and now he is showing it.\n\"He can score goals, he can create goals, and if you look at the timing of his runs into the box, he is very intelligent as well - and he is a team player.\n\"I've been critical of Rodri in the past because sometimes it feels like he doesn't make that killer pass forward - it almost goes side to side - but Gundogan affects the game with passes and goals, so no wonder Pep loves him.\"\nA 'safety-first' pick? Not any more\nRather than goalscoring, it is the balance and discipline that Gundogan brings to the team that remain his best attributes, however. They have always been appreciated by his manager, but sometimes less so by City's supporters.\nGundogan, who suffered a serious knee injury early in his City career and was sidelined by Covid-19 at the start of this season, has now played 185 games for the club.\nHe is clearly trusted by Guardiola, who called him \"an incredible player and incredible human\" after December's win over Newcastle, explaining \"he gives us the right tempo\", but he has spent much of the past four years seen as something of a back-up plan by his side's fans.\nThat might sound unfair, but then City's first-choice midfield for most of that period was Fernandinho, David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne so it is not too much of a slur for anyone to have been viewed as an unfavourable option to any of them.\nGundogan has always been able to play across midfield but because he could ably replace Fernandinho or, later, Rodri in the holding position, seeing his name on the team-sheet suggested a more conservative approach by Guardiola, no matter what role he was being asked to fill.\nHe first got that tag of being a safety-first pick when he was surprisingly preferred to Sterling for City's 3-0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield in the first leg of their Champions League defeat in 2018. It persisted when he was played ahead of Leroy Sane and De Bruyne at the same stage in Europe in 2019 and City lost at Tottenham.\nThis run of form should end any such negative perceptions for good - and also allay any fears about the impact De Bruyne's absence will have on City's attacking output in the next few weeks. On this evidence, Gundogan is capable of replacing him too.\n\"First of all I am so happy about Gundo's performances - but also the recognition that he is starting to have,\" Guardiola added. \"We are more delighted with what he is doing but not just this moment of time.\n\"In 2018-19, when we won our second Premier League title in a row, he played holding midfielder when Fernandinho was injured and he did incredibly well.\n\"The first season he had an ACL [anterior cruciate injury] and we missed him a lot, but since then we have seen his performances like this and also his personality - on the biggest stages, the personality he plays with is outstanding.\"\nMark Wright's Last Chance: He's made his debut, now can he keep a spot in the team?\nSecrets of Cinema: How British comedy kept us all laughing"

I don't take plusses from this game at all. We did enough to get the points, so not happy.\"\nSuperb Pope performance denies Villa\nFor Villa, who stay 10th, they will be wondering how they failed to take all three points and then left Lancashire empty-handed.\nWithin three minutes, the away side should have gone ahead when Ezri Konsa headed over when well placed, before Watkins was the first of many players to be denied by England international Pope.\nWatkins flicked Villa into a 13th-minute lead, but Pope then saved from the impressive Grealish and in a one-on-one chance with Watkins, with Ross Barkley then shooting against the crossbar with the rebound.\nBut Villa kept on creating chances as Bertrand Traore's strike was blocked by Mee, with Pope showing great reflexes to then save Tyrone Mings' follow-up. Targett was the next man to be frustrated and the missed opportunities continued to come in the second half with John McGinn also denied.\nWith the score at 1-1, Grealish, following a superb individual run from the halfway line, saw his strike blocked by Pope, although Grealish then got a deserved goal before Pope then stopped Watkins making it 3-1 to Villa.\nThe hosts ended strongly and goals from McNeil and Wood, both coming inside a three-minute spell, gave Burnley the three points.\nBurnley battle for third win in seven days\nWhen these two sides met in December at Villa Park, it ended in a 0-0 draw and the point was enough to take the Clarets out of the relegation zone.\nSince then, they have won four of seven Premier League matches, including a 1-0 victory at reigning champions Liverpool on 21 January - becoming the first team to win a Premier League game at Anfield since April 2017.\nJust like that victory against Jurgen Klopp's side, Sean Dyche will be extremely proud of his team for not giving up when they looked like being overwhelmed.\nA tough first half for them against Villa saw away goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez barely troubled with Robbie Brady's 25-yard strike that went well over one of only a handful of attempts at goal.\nDyche brought on Jack Cork for Josh Brownhill at half-time and the Clarets performed much better after the break.\nVilla's misses proved costly as Mee headed an equaliser early in the second half from Ashley Westwood's corner and they could have taken the lead but Wood was denied by Martinez.\nDespite Grealish restoring Villa's lead, the hosts did not let their heads drop and equalised through McNeil. However, the goal had a slice of luck to it as his low cross was aimed for substitute Matej Vydra, with the ball evading everyone and going into the far corner of the net.\nBut there was nothing fortunate about the winner as Wood's fourth goal of the campaign gave Burnley back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time this season.\nIt seals a great week for the Clarets as they have now won three times inside seven days after also beating Fulham 3-0 away from home in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday.\nWood heads in another goal - the stats\nThis was Burnley's highest-scoring Premier League win since they won 3-2 against Chelsea in August 2017 - before this, their last 12 league games with five or more goals had all ended in defeat\nAfter winning all nine previous Premier League games in which they scored first this season, Aston Villa suffered their first league defeat after scoring first since a 2-1 loss to Chelsea last June.\nSince his Premier League debut for Burnley in August 2017, no player has scored more headed Premier League goals than Chris Wood (15, level with Harry Kane).\nAston Villa striker Ollie Watkins netted his eighth Premier League goal of the season in his 18th appearance, equalling their top league scorer last season (Jack Grealish, eight in 36 apps).\nAston Villa had 45 shots against Burnley in the Premier League this season, their most against an opponent in a top-flight campaign since 2010-11 vs West Ham (51 shots).\nThis was only the second time Burnley have conceded first at Turf Moor in the Premier League and gone on to score three times, after their 4-2 win over Spurs back in May 2010.\nAston Villa's Jack Grealish has been directly involved in 14 goals in 18 Premier League appearances this season (six goals, eight assists), as many as in 36 appearances last season (eight goals, six assists).\nOnly Johann Berg Gudmundsson (17) has more Premier League assists for Burnley than Ashley Westwood (16).\n'The game should've been over at half time' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Second half I was very proud. I thought they were the better side first half, had more creativity and we didn't ask many questions.\n\"Sometimes we have to rely on our resilience and the players kept working, plus [Nick Pope] made big, important saves.\n\"The change at half time was thanks to the mentality of the players, asking questions, being on the front foot. The second half was really pleasing against a really good Aston Villa side.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Pope has made some really good saves but the game should've been out of sight.\n\"It's very tough to win any game in this league and we have started the season so well but you can't get three points the way we played.\n\"We didn't do the basics well enough in the second half.

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 0-0 Fulham: Seagulls' long winless run at home continues\nBrighton's long winless run at home continued as they were held by fellow Premier League strugglers Fulham.\nGraham Potter's side have now failed to win any of their last 14 top-flight matches on the south coast.\nLewis Dunk, Leandro Trossard, Adam Webster and Solly March all had excellent opportunities to score for the hosts who had the better of a hard-fought contest.\nBrighton remain 17th in the table, with Fulham five points behind them in 18th.\nWhile Fulham appeared to be holding on for long periods, they will also feel they could have claimed an important three points after failing to convert two glorious late chances.\nAleksandar Mitrovic saw his glancing header saved by Seagulls goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, while Dunk's brilliant goal-line clearance prevented Ruben Loftus-Cheek from scoring in stoppage time.\nReaction from Brighton v Fulham, plus Wednesday's other Premier League games\nLawro's predictions v guitarist Alex Sprogis from post-punk band TV Priest\nBrighton fail to fire\nBefore their victory against Leeds, Potter's side had endured a run of nine league games without a victory.\nAnd this fixture represented an opportunity to put a major dent in Fulham's hopes of Premier League survival, while enhancing their own by establishing a seven-point gap to the bottom three.\nHowever, once again their lack of prowess in front of goal proved the stumbling block.\nOnly six clubs have scored fewer goals than the Seagulls this term, with the bottom three as well as Newcastle and Burnley - the sides directly above them - among five of them.\nNeal Maupay has managed a reasonable return of seven goals from 18 appearances but none of Brighton's best opportunities fell at his feet.\nInstead, the French forward twice created opportunities for Trossard, who fired straight at Fulham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola from eight yards and saw a second attempt blocked.\nAnd while Dunk and Webster also went close from corners the home side rarely gave the impression that they could break the deadlock.\nFulham with work to do\nWhile Fulham have improved as the season has developed - notably starting a five-game unbeaten run with a draw against Liverpool on 13 December - they now remain without a win since 30 November.\nAlarmingly for manager Scott Parker, his side also initially exhibited many of their early-season shortcomings in defence that, against more ruthless opponents, would have been punished.\nLax play from Tosin Adarabioyo and two poor passes from Ola Aina provided Brighton with three presentable opportunities to open the scoring after the visitors had started brightly.\nHowever, Trossard and Pascal Gross were unable to capitalise and the visitors regrouped and improved after the break.\nAnother area of concern for Parker, like Brighton, is their lack of goals. And though the late introduction of Mitrovic could have swung all the points in their direction, two of their three efforts on target came in the final three minutes.\nUntil that late salvo, their only other effort of note came via an Ivan Cavaleiro shot just before the hour mark which was saved by Sanchez.\n'It was an onslaught at times' - what they said\nBrighton manager Graham Potter to BBC Sport: \"Over the course of the 90 minutes we were the better team. We had the better chances and more chances.\n\"But in any Premier League game you feel the other team will get a chance. It's a big chance at the end. We defended well. I'm really happy with the players for what they put into the game against a team fighting for points too.\n\"There are still 50-odd points to play for. A lot of football to play. We have to focus on ourselves. Sometimes it's not your day in terms of a bit of luck in front of goal.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker to BBC Sport: \"We missed elements of our game. In the first half we had control about us - played our way. We lacked in duels and battles, we were second best.\n\"We addressed that at half-time. We showed that in the second half, we had more resilience, but lost the other side. We couldn't get a foothold. We had to defend an awful amount. It was an onslaught at times.\n\"Am I fully happy with the overall performance? No, I'm not. I'm satisfied as can be with the point.\"\nDraw specialists Brighton - match stats\nSince winning five consecutive league games against Fulham between 2014 - 2017 (all in the Championship), Brighton have since failed to win any of their four matches against the Cottagers (D3 L1 - all in the Premier League).\nSince the start of their first season in the Premier League in 2017-18, Brighton have played out 14 goalless draws, more than any other side in the competition.\nFulham have drawn both Premier League games 0-0 against Brighton this season, the first time the Cottagers have played out two goalless draws against an opponent in a single league campaign since 2001-02, against Leicester.\nBrighton have won just one of their last 19 Premier League games at the Amex stadium (D10 L8) and remain winless on home soil since a 2-1 victory against Arsenal in June 2020 (P14 D7 L7).\nFulham remain winless in their last nine Premier League games (D6 L3), since a 2-1 victory against Leicester in November.\nOnly West Brom, Sheffield United and Burnley (10 each) have failed to score in more Premier League games this season than Fulham (nine).\nThere were 26 shots in this game (16 for Brighton and 10 for Fulham).

The second goal we conceded is so poor, so sloppy. Easy. We stopped getting out to the ball - three or four bad decisions which is out of character.\n\"There will be no big inquest. There have been so many odd results this season but with the world as it is we have been the most consistent team - it hit us today.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder: \"There's not been many moments for us this season. The players are jumping about celebrating and they have every right to. It's been a tough old season but I'll bring them back down to earth tomorrow. It's a great result and I'm delighted for the players because they've been through a lot.\"\nBryan and Burke off the mark - the stats\nManchester United have lost four of their 10 Premier League home games this season, their most in a single campaign since 2013-14 under David Moyes (6) and Ryan Giggs (1).\nSheffield United are only the third side from Yorkshire to win at Old Trafford in any competition during the Premier League era, after Leeds United in January 2010 (FA Cup) and York City in September 1996 (League Cup).\nManchester United have lost two of their past four Premier League home games against the side starting the day bottom of the table, one more loss than in their other 21 such matches in the competition (W16 D4 L1).\nSince 2003-04, Sheffield United are just the fourth side to have as few as five shots in a Premier League game at Old Trafford against Manchester United and win, after Burnley (January 2020), Crystal Palace (August 2019) and Swansea (August 2014) - all in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.\nSince the start of last season, no Premier League side has conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (14, level with Brighton & Chelsea).\nAt the age of 38 years and 163 days, Phil Jagielka was the oldest outfield player to start a Premier League match at Old Trafford against Manchester United since Richard Gough in February 2001 for Everton (38y 304d).\nHarry Maguire's equaliser for Manchester United was his first in the Premier League at Old Trafford, with each of his five goals in the competition before this coming away from home.\nSheffield United pair Kean Bryan and Oliver Burke are the first Premier League players to both net their first goals in the competition in the same match against Manchester United since September 2014 - Esteban Cambiasso and Jamie Vardy for Leicester.\nWhat next?\nManchester United will look to get back to winning ways when they travel to Arsenal in the league on Saturday (17:30 GMT), while Sheffield United face another tough match, against leaders Manchester City, on the same day (15:00).\nI'm Not A Monster: Hear from the American mother inside an Isis caliphate\nFKA Twigs x Louis Theroux: Female inspirations, online trolls and her relationship with Shia LaBeouf"

        "article_text": "Everton 1-1 Leicester City: Foxes battle to point at Goodison\nLeicester proved their appetite for a Champions League challenge by coming from behind to earn a battling point at Everton.\nBrendan Rodgers' side showed plenty of endeavour in the first half, but went behind to a James Rodriguez strike after 30 minutes when he curled a right-footed shot into the corner from 20 yards after his first effort rebounded back to him.\nThe hosts finished the first half on top, but without injured striker Jamie Vardy, Leicester responded in the second half as Jordan Pickford made several saves and Yerry Mina denied James Maddison with an impressive interception.\nThe visitors' pressure eventually led to Youri Tielemans' low strike, which Pickford got a hand to but failed to keep out.\nLeicester pressed for a winner although they were fortunate to see late headers from Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin miss the target.\nThe draw meant the Foxes remain third but are now two points behind leaders Manchester City, and a point behind Manchester United after their shock 2-1 home defeat by Sheffield United.\nEverton stay seventh, two points behind fourth-placed West Ham.\nLeicester show mettle without Vardy\nRodgers will be disappointed that his side, who were on top for much of the second half, did not earn victory, especially on a night when they could have overtaken Manchester United following their Old Trafford loss.\nBut they also extended their unbeaten run to nine games, and showed they had the ability to get back into the game when Everton finished the first half stronger.\nMaddison, watched by England manager Gareth Southgate, was heavily involved in their build-up play early on, and looking to score for a fifth game in succession, the 24-year-old went close with a curling 25-yard effort that was just over.\nHarvey Barnes also impressed with his direct running.\nBut after Everton took the lead, all the early endeavour looked to have been wasted. Skipper Kasper Schmeichel sensed his side's situation and bawled at his team-mates to improve.\nIn that regard, half-time came at a good time for the visitors. They regrouped and although they lost Wilfred Ndidi to injury, adding to the continued absence of Vardy, they still searched for an equaliser, which eventually came in fortunate circumstances.\nTielemans' effort lacked power but an unsighted Pickford could not keep it out. After creating the best of the second-half chances, though, it was a deserved reward.\nCengiz Under added extra zip to the attack when he came on shortly afterwards, and although the impressive Maddison continued to ask questions of the Everton defence, a point at a side who had won five of their past six Premier League games will offer some solace.\nRodriguez shines as Everton's European hopes continue\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti admitted on Tuesday that he was missing the Champions League, having won the trophy three times as a manager. The Italian has always spoken of European ambitions with Everton, but has kept his short-term focus on the Europa League.\nVictory on a soggy night on Merseyside would have lifted Ancelotti's side into the top four, with their sights on what he calls \"the best competition in the world\".\nBut if they are to break into the established top six, or even top four, they will also have to overcome a Leicester side who offer more energy in attack.\nEverton's recent run, which included a 2-0 win at Leicester in December, has been built on an improved defensive solidity, with top scorer Calvert-Lewin adding goals to Rodriguez's guile.\nYet with the England forward extending his goalless run to six Premier League games, despite scoring in the FA Cup win over Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday, Rodriguez delivered on the half-hour with a fine strike.\nHaving first tried his luck with his left foot, the ball bounced back to him off Wesley Fofana, and this time Rodriguez found the corner for his fourth goal of the season.\nThat came after a spell when Everton carved out chances and although they were under pressure for much of the second period, they almost grabbed a winner at the end when their aerial ability threatened to pierce the Leicester defence once more.\nThe disappointment will come from the manner in which they conceded, though.\nAlthough Tielemans' shot came through a crowd of players, Pickford could only palm it on to his right post and watch agonisingly as it bounced in.\nThe Toffees have now only lost once in their past seven league games, but this result showed they may be hard pressed to make the top four with the Europa League offering a more realistic target.\n'Two points dropped'\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"We should have gone on and won the game. That was maybe two points dropped for us but they're a really good side.\n\"It's a big credit to our players that they were able to open Everton up. We have good players with a good mentality and I thought overall we were excellent in the game.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti: \"I'm happy with the draw. The result is fair. We had an opportunity at the end to win but the result is fair. It's a good point for us.\n\"This is not the right place to talk about this [Jordan Pickford]. He can do better but it doesn't matter.\"\nRodriguez shows class - best of the stats\nLeicester have only lost one of their past 10 Premier League away games (W7 D2), and are unbeaten in their past five games on the road since a defeat at Anfield in November (W3 D2).\nEverton's James Rodriguez has scored 19 goals from outside the box while playing within the top five European leagues (three for Monaco, 11 for Real Madrid, three for Bayern Munich and two for Everton), however this was the first he's scored from outside the box with his right foot.\nOnly Dominic Calvert-Lewin (11) has been directly involved in more Premier League goals for Everton this season than Rodriguez (seven - four goals, three assists).\nAll five of Youri Tielemans' goals for Leicester in the Premier League this season have been scored away from home - indeed, he's netted the most away goals of any player yet to score at home this term.\nWhat next?\nEverton host Newcastle in the early game on Saturday in the Premier League (12:30 GMT), while Leicester are at home to Leeds United on Sunday (14:00).\nI'm Not A Monster: Hear from the American mother inside an Isis caliphate\nFKA Twigs x Louis Theroux: Female inspirations, online trolls and her relationship with Shia LaBeouf"

        "article_text": "Tottenham 1-3 Liverpool: Premier League champions end poor run\nLiverpool returned to form in impressive fashion as the Premier League champions secured a convincing victory at Tottenham Hotspur.\nAfter a run of five league games without a win - four of those without a goal - Liverpool moved back into the top four as they discovered their cutting edge in style at the expense of an uninspiring Spurs.\nSpurs, who lost striker Harry Kane to an ankle injury at half-time, had an early Son Heung-min strike ruled out for offside before Liverpool's threat was rewarded with their first league goal in 482 minutes in first-half stoppage time.\nBrazil striker Roberto Firmino took advantage of hesitation between Eric Dier and Hugo Lloris to tap in Sadio Mane's low cross from close range.\nFrance keeper Lloris was at fault again two minutes after the break when he pushed Mane's shot into the path of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who finished emphatically.\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg's 20-yard strike gave Spurs hope almost immediately but Liverpool were always in control of an entertaining second period.\nAfter Mohamed Salah saw a goal disallowed by VAR for handball by Firmino in the build-up, Mane stole in at the far post to pounce on an error by the otherwise impressive Joe Rodon to secure the win for Jurgen Klopp's side.\nLiverpool are now four points behind leaders Manchester City having played a game more.\nSpurs striker Kane injures ankle against Liverpool\nWill Liverpool rethink need to sign defender after Matip injury?\nLiverpool show they are here to stay in title race\nReaction as Liverpool end winless Premier League run\nLiverpool overcome more injury woe\nThis was an outstanding result and performance by Liverpool in the face of yet more central defensive injury problems.\nFabinho, who has excelled in an unfamiliar centre-back role in the absence of Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez, was ruled out with what was described as a \"minor muscle issue\" while the fragile Joel Matip lasted only 45 minutes on his return to the side.\nIt meant Liverpool's central defensive partnership in the second half was captain Jordan Henderson and the inexperienced Nathaniel Phillips.\nWhile that unlikely centre-back pairing coped well, it was at the other end where Liverpool were right back to their brilliant best, with Mane a constant threat while Firmino and Salah were full of menace and creation.\nTheir disappointing recent form has seen Liverpool drop down the Premier League table and also exit the FA Cup at Manchester United - but the manner of this display was an ominous warning to write off the champions at your peril.\nWatch: 'He made the impossible happen' - Luis Suarez's best Premier League goals\nSpurs flat - and now have Kane concerns\nJose Mourinho spent much of the second half bellowing instructions at his Spurs players in an attempt to spark a reaction - but it was to no avail as they produced a lacklustre performance.\nLiverpool always carried a greater threat once Son's early finish was ruled out for VAR but it was a moment of indecision between Dier and Lloris that opened the door for Firmino right at the end of the first half.\nThen, straight after the break and moments following a warning from Mourinho after Spurs let Salah in for a chance, Alexander-Arnold scored to give Liverpool a two-goal advantage.\nSon threatened occasionally on the break but even Hojbjerg's blockbuster from the edge of the box failed to inspire Spurs, who looked devoid of ideas long before the final whistle.\nThe lack of threat was perhaps less surprising after the loss of Kane, who twice received treatment for ankle knocks before eventually succumbing to the second one on his left ankle which was sustained in an innocuous challenge with Henderson.\nMourinho suggested after the match Kane may miss \"a few weeks\" and on this evidence Spurs will struggle to be anywhere near their best without their talisman and leading marksman.\nWhy Liverpool love playing Spurs - every day of the week\nLiverpool have won six consecutive league matches, and three consecutive away league matches, against Spurs for the first time in their history\nLiverpool have now beaten Tottenham in the top-flight on all seven days of the week, becoming just the third side to have done so after Everton and West Ham\nJose Mourinho has now lost six home league games in charge of Tottenham, more than he has at any of his previous clubs\nAll three of Liverpool's Premier League away wins this season have come in London, with the Reds also winning 2-0 at Chelsea in September and 7-0 at Crystal Palace in December\nRoberto Firmino's opener ended Liverpool's run of 482 minutes and 93 shots without a Premier League goal, since Sadio Mane scored against West Brom last month\nFirmino has scored in five of his last six Premier League appearances against Tottenham, including each of his last three against them away from home\nSince the start of last season, Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other defender in the competition (21 - five goals, 16 assists)\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg's strike was his first goal for Tottenham in all competitions, in what was his 30th appearance for the north London side\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to West Ham - the team they leapfrogged in the table by beating Spurs - on Sunday (16:30 GMT). Tottenham are also back in action on Sunday, when they visit Brighton (19:15 GMT).\nI'm Not A Monster: Hear from the American mother inside an ISIS caliphate\nTailenders: Fresh from a series victory Jimmy Anderson has a very special guest"

        "article_text": "Everton 0-2 Newcastle United: Steve Bruce lauds 'braver' performance\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce said a pressure-relieving win over Everton came from a \"braver\" approach crowned by Callum Wilson's double.\nBruce has endured intense criticism from Newcastle's fan base as his team lost their past five Premier League games to slip towards the relegation zone.\nBut after switching to a 4-4-2 diamond formation they secured their first win in 12 games, with Wilson's 50th and 51st Premier League goals helping to beat a passive Everton.\nWilson, who went close either side of the break, ended a seven-game goal drought by heading in Jonjo Shelvey's corner before adding a second in stoppage time.\nBruce was understandably delighted at the final whistle as his team moved nine points clear of the relegation zone.\n\"There's no disputing it - it's been very difficult,\" he said.\n\"When you're on a bad run in the Premier League it's difficult whether you're [Arsenal boss] Mikel Arteta or [former Chelsea manager] Frank Lampard.\n\"You have to be brave and make these decisions. We're trying to be more on the front foot and push up the pitch. That's something we want to do more. We're a lot better.\n\"The players have enjoyed the change, certainly by looking at that performance today. What you need is a result to go with it, so today of course everybody's happy.\"\nEverton, who tested keeper Karl Darlow in the first half, could not find a way through Newcastle's defence and missed out on a chance to move within a point of Liverpool.\nCarlo Ancelotti's side remain seventh, four points off the top four, but the Italian labelled their performance as \"lazy and slow\".\n\"The spirit was missing. I was surprised,\" he added. \"We have good quality but you can only show that if you show the spirit. Without spirit there is no quality.\"\nWilson sparkles as Newcastle end wretched run\nBruce has borne the brunt of fans' frustrations for the past two months as Newcastle dwindled towards what looked like a scrap for survival.\nBut he has always maintained his side are capable of turning the corner once they got Allan Saint-Maximin and Jamaal Lascelles back from coronavirus problems, and Ryan Fraser from injury.\nThere has been criticism of his formations and team selection too, but, in a week when Bruce added Bournemouth coach Graeme Jones to his staff, Wilson's return to form and a new formation offered supporters much-needed hope.\nThere were signs of improvement in the second half of their midweek defeat by Leeds, but, with Miguel Almiron at the tip of the diamond and Wilson and Fraser further forward, this was Newcastle's best display for months.\nWilson, often isolated in previous matches, got better support and, although starting slightly to the right, he looked dangerous from the outset.\nShelvey had already gone close with a deflected shot when Wilson drew a fine stop from Pickford with a header from Fraser's corner. Further good link-up play from Wilson led to a free-kick where Shelvey could not hit the target.\nBut with a better balance in midfield and a firm defence, Bruce bellowed at his players from the sidelines as he sensed a positive result.\nThat came when Wilson nodded in his ninth of the season to give the visitors a deserved lead.\nAlthough he wasted a great chance to make it 2-0 when he rounded Pickford and hit a post, he made up for that error with a 10th goal of the season by firing in unmarked.\nThe only disappointment for Bruce was a second-half injury to captain Lascelles, who came off the pitch to be replaced by Ciaran Clark with a hamstring injury.\nEverton's European challenge stutters\nAncelotti spoke on Friday about how his team are playing to their strengths this season by being solid in defence and combining the passing range of James Rodriguez with their aerial prowess.\nBut their more direct approach and a lack of midfield control showed against an often superior Newcastle side, even if Abdoulaye Doucoure, Alex Iwobi and Gylfi Sigurdsson, on his 300th Premier League appearance, were back in the side.\n\"We were lazy, we were slow,\" Ancelotti said. \"We were not focused.\n\"We conceded corners to them. We didn't win duels, second balls. The game is also about winning duels and second balls, avoiding corners and throw-ins. We were not on the pitch today.\"\nEverton took advantage of their best assets early on when Yerry Mina headed over from Rodriguez's cross, with Darlow taking out the Colombia defender as he struggled to meet the centre.\nAlthough there were chances for Rodriguez, who had a shot saved by Darlow despite suspicions of a handball by Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the build-up, and Richarlison skewed wide, having hit the target with an earlier effort, they failed to dominate their opponents.\nPickford, who stayed in the side following his error against Leicester, repaid the faith Ancelotti had shown in him by keeping out Wilson's first-half header.\nBut he could do little about the opening goal as it sailed to Wilson, who was unchallenged at the back post.\nEverton began to leave gaps as they searched for an equaliser, but Wilson, who was supported well by Fraser and his replacement Saint-Maximin, continued to cause problems for a Everton defence who had been resolute in recent matches.\nA second defeat in nine league games is not terminal, but it leaves Ancelotti with much to consider as he attempts to mount a European challenge which has stuttered this week.\nNewcastle continue second-half improvement\nEverton have lost four home league games this season, the most in a campaign for manager Carlo Ancelotti since 2007-08 with AC Milan (also four).\nThis was Newcastle's first Premier League double over Everton since 2001-02, and their first league victory at Goodison Park since September 2010.\n81% of Newcastle's league goals this season have come in the second half (17/21), a higher ratio than any other side.\nCallum Wilson's opener was his 50th Premier League goal (145th appearance). He has only scored more against West Ham (8) in the competition than against Everton (6).\nWilson has been involved in 67% of Newcastle's 21 league goals this season, scoring 10 and assisting four.\nJonjo Shelvey's assist for Newcastle's opener was his first goal involvement in 13 league appearances this season. He led the way for goals & assists for the Magpies last term (8).\nEverton's Gylfi Sigurdsson made his 300th Premier League appearance, the second Icelandic player to reach the milestone after Hermann Hreidarsson (332).\nWhat next?\nNewcastle host Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Tuesday, while Everton travel to Leeds United on Wednesday.\nA huge day of matches in the Premier League on Saturday, all the goals and highlights are streaming now on BBC iPlayer"

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-0 Sheffield United: Gabriel Jesus strikes in narrow victory\nPep Guardiola said his Manchester City players were \"fighting like animals\" after the Premier League leaders beat bottom club Sheffield United to record a club-record 12th successive victory.\nAside from Gabriel Jesus' close-range strike from a Ferran Torres cross, an instinctive header from Bernardo Silva - created by a stray Oliver Norwood header - was City's only effort on target until Aaron Ramsdale denied Oleksandr Zinchenko and then Aymeric Laporte from the corner that followed.\nBut the Blues' defensive strength was again on show. Guardiola's side have now kept five clean sheets in a row in the Premier League, and an impressive 11 out of 13.\nThe last team in England's top flight to register 12 consecutive wins in all competitions were Arsenal, who did so between August and October 2007.\n\"In December and January to show this consistency is amazing,\" Guardiola told BBC Sport. \"In this league every game is so difficult.\n\"It was an incredible performance. We played incredibly well in many areas. We conceded few chances. We didn't create much, but enough to win the game.\n\"We will drop points, it's about how we overcome it. Hopefully we react good in the bad moments, which for sure are coming.\"\nIt was certainly far too strong for a visiting team who never looked like emulating their victory at Manchester United three days ago and remain rooted to the foot of the table, 10 points adrift of fourth-bottom Brighton.\nFor Guardiola, this was a staggering 500th win of a managerial career of 673 games.\nManchester United's goalless draw at Arsenal on Saturday evening leaves City three points clear of their neighbours at the top of the Premier League with a game in hand.\nJesus back to form\nIt has been a strange season so far for Gabriel Jesus.\nGiven Sergio Aguero has been missing virtually all season, the Brazilian should have been the focal point of City's attack.\nBut Jesus suffered a thigh injury at Wolves in the opening game of the season, then missed a game against Southampton with a tooth problem before returning a positive coronavirus test at Christmas.\nThe stop-start nature of his season has prevented Jesus getting the flow of games he needs to make the scoring contribution Guardiola would have hoped for after goals in both his first two league matches of the season and nothing in the nine that followed.\nHis third was clinical enough, although the visitors' defence helped him by not getting near enough to prevent him controlling and driving home Torres' cross from the edge of the six-yard box. However, as they had already allowed Torres to recover his position after finding himself on the ground in the build-up, it was not their worst error collectively.\nAfter that though, Jesus was relatively quiet and only burst into life in the final minute, when he did the right thing in opening his body up to shoot at Ramsdale, only to steer his effort straight at the Blades keeper.\nBlades blunted\nAnother shock like Sheffield United's victory at Manchester United three days ago was probably too much to expect of them.\nAfter all, they have only beaten both Manchester clubs away from home in a single season three times in their entire history.\nIt is now 20 years since they last scored in an away game against City and there were not many occasions when it appeared they might break that barren sequence.\nClub record \u00a323.5m signing Rhian Brewster did turn sharply on the edge of the box in the opening period, only to shoot straight at Ederson. Jayden Bogle had a better shooting opportunity from a similar distance after the break, only to snatch at the effort and send it way off target.\nThe nearest they came to an equaliser was at the end when John Fleck fired narrowly wide from the edge of the area. But even that was not close enough to give City any real scare.\nConcussion subs are coming\nA clash of heads between City midfielder Phil Foden and Blades counterpart John Lundstram at the start of the second half and another between Aymeric Laporte and Oli McBurnie later in the game brought medical staff from both teams on to the field.\nThankfully, there was no major damage and all four were able to continue after treatment. However, it was a reminder of the physical nature of the game, which is why, should such incidents occur from 6 February, two additional 'concussion substitutes' will be available after a trial for the remainder of the season was confirmed on Friday.\n'This is not a fairytale' - what the managers said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola to BBC Sport: \"People think if we won the last one 5-0, we will win this one 5-0. This is the real world, not a fairytale.\n\"You see Sheffield United are bottom of the table and realise how tough is the Premier League. We always struggle to beat them every season.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder to BBC Sport: \"We're playing a world-class team who are on an incredible run. It's a long way back when you fall behind to Manchester City early on, but we gave ourselves a chance to get something out of the game at the end. Unfortunately we didn't.\n\"We've won a couple of games and had a couple of tight games against Spurs and City. From my point of view, we're alive.\n\"I'm scratching my head at times to understand the position we're in, but we have a belief, fight and togetherness that we can pick up a couple of wins before the end of the season.\nCity set new club record - the stats\nSheffield United have scored just one goal in their 10 Premier League matches against City (D3 L7), the fewest goals ever scored by a team in their first 10 Premier League games against an opponent.\nManchester City have won all nine matches in all competitions in January, the most they have ever won in a single month in their entire history.\nSheffield United have now lost 20 of their past 24 Premier League matches (W2 D2), seven more than any other side in this timeframe (since July 16 last year).\nOnly James Milner (54) and Darius Vassell (46) have scored in more Premier League games without ending on the losing side than City forward Gabriel Jesus (37 - W35 D2).\nManchester City have kept 20 clean sheets in all competitions this season - at least five more than any other side in the top-five European leagues.\nThis was Sheffield United's eighth 1-0 defeat in the Premier League this season, the joint-most ever by a side at this stage (after 21 matches) of a top-flight season, along with Ipswich Town in 1985-86.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City's next game is at Burnley on Wednesday, 3 February (18:00 GMT). Sheffield United have a crucial encounter with West Brom at Bramall Lane on Tuesday, 2 February (18:00 GMT).\nSupercar, Superfam: Who's behind revamping some of the world's most powerful cars?\nFKA Twigs x Louis Theroux: Female inspirations, online trolls and her relationship with Shia LaBeouf"

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-0 Wolves: Eberechi Eze scores winner\nCrystal Palace midfielder Eberechi Eze continued his excellent debut season in the Premier League and added to Wolves' troubles with the only goal at Selhurst Park.\nThe \u00a319.5m signing from QPR settled a poor game with a thumping finish, his third league goal since making the step up last summer.\nIn a match of few chances, Willian Jose - in his first start for Wolves since joining on loan from Real Sociedad - was twice denied by Palace keeper Vicente Guaita.\nWilfried Zaha almost made it 2-0 when he hit the crossbar on the counter-attack.\nThe win lifted Palace above Wolves, who dropped to 14th in the table and are without a win in eight league games.\nPalace bounce back\nThis was a timely win for Roy Hodgson's side, who had taken one point from their previous three league games since beating Sheffield United on 2 January.\nEze also scored in that game and the 22-year-old continues to be one of the big success stories of the season at Palace.\nAfter Jordan Ayew had rolled the ball into his path, Eze drilled past Rui Patricio to inject some much-needed life into a match which had been a dreadful spectacle.\n\"I think he is a player who will improve all the team,\" said Hodgson of Eze's contribution.\n\"Most importantly of all he is getting used to the intensity of the Premier League and all the other things that the Premier League requires from you.\"\nHodgson, who made six changes and left new signing Jean-Philippe Mateta on the bench, will hope his side can kick on after avenging their FA Cup defeat by Wolves this month.\nTesting times for Nuno\nNuno worried by Wolves' form\nWolves were hoping to build on a hard-earned point at Chelsea in midweek but instead ended up going backwards at Selhurst Park.\nThey have taken only three points from the last 24 on offer and have won once in 11 league matches since losing talismanic centre-forward Raul Jimenez to a serious head injury.\nBrazilian forward Jose, who has been brought in to fill the void left by Jimenez's absence, twice went close.\nGuaita reacted well to tip a shot over the bar shortly before Eze's winner, and also kept out a header in the closing stages.\nWolves, without a goal in two games, are sinking fast and this is undoubtedly the biggest test of manager Nuno Espirito Santo's reign.\nThey have enjoyed some memorable moments under the Portuguese but need to start winning quickly to avoid getting sucked into a relegation fight.\nNuno donates \u00a3250,000 to poverty project\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: \"We have been stuck on 23 points or close to 23 points for a little while so it was good to move away from that total.\n\"A team like Wolves, they will climb the table sooner or later with the type of players they have and the organisation they have.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It was not one of the best performances. We came with the expectation to try and improve and build up our game and momentum.\n\"We were organised in the first half, second half not so much. We lacked creativity, speed in possession and circulation and passes that break the lines of Palace. We didn't do it.\"\nEze shines again - the stats\nFour of Eberechi Eze's five Premier League goal involvements for Crystal Palace have come in home games, including all three of his goals.\nWolves are without a win in eight league games (D3 L5), with only Fulham (10) currently on a longer run.\n71% of Crystal Palace's league wins this season have come in the traditional Saturday 15:00 GMT kick-off slot (5/7).\nWolves have failed to score in seven of 21 league games this season, one fewer than they did in the entire 2019-20 campaign (8 in 38 games)\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in action on Tuesday as Palace make the journey to Newcastle (20:15 GMT) and Wolves host an improving Arsenal at Molineux (18:00).\nA huge day of matches in the Premier League on Saturday, all the goals and highlights are streaming now on BBC iPlayer"

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 2-2 Fulham: Premier League strugglers draw\nWest Bromwich Albion boss Sam Allardyce says his side playing \"too much complex football\" was the reason they were so poor in the first half of the draw against fellow strugglers Fulham.\nThe Cottagers dominated the first period and looked on course for a first top-flight win since 30 November thanks to Bobby Decordova-Reid's early goal.\nHowever, a change of system and the introduction of new loan striker Mbaye Diagne helped the Baggies engineer a complete turnaround after the break.\n\"Playing a more simple game of football with better quality made life extremely difficult for Fulham,\" Allardyce said.\n\"We were playing too much complex football. We kept giving the ball back to Fulham instead of to our players. We just simplified our game. We said 'we have brought a big man from Galatasaray. I want you to play off him - off his feet or chest'.\n\"We haven't had a target man of his type. I am surprised he arrived here from Galatasaray to take up the fight. It is a great credit to the man that he has actually looked at the table and said 'yes I will come and fight with you'.\n\"I have struggled to find anybody that has wanted to do that in the whole of January.\"\nKyle Bartley's equaliser - the centre-back finishing impressively from close range - two minutes after the break shifted the momentum towards the Baggies and Matheus Pereira flicked in a cross from Diagne to give the home side the lead.\nHowever Ivan Cavaleiro headed in an inviting cross from fellow substitute Harrison Reed to earn the visitors a point.\nThe result leaves Fulham 18th in the table, while West Brom - who gained their first point at home since Allardyce took charge in December - are in 19th, two points further back.\nRecap of the action in all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nLawro's Premier League predictions v Lewis Evans from Black Country, New Road\nMixed emotions for Allardyce\nThe result is likely to have mixed emotions for Allardyce, who had pinpointed this game against another team in the relegation places as one the Baggies needed to win.\nHis side were fortunate to be only one goal behind at half time but, having tweaked tactics and personnel to take control after the break, he will be frustrated they could not hold out for three points.\nThe Baggies' new boss will also surely be concerned that the organisational and defensive principles for which he is renowned have yet to be witnessed on the pitch.\nIn his eight matches at the helm West Brom have taken five points from the 24 available - and conceded 24 goals at an average of three per game.\nAfter a demoralising 5-0 loss to Manchester City at home on Tuesday, the manner in which they fell behind after 10 minutes will have infuriated the former England boss.\nConor Gallagher and Dara O'Shea failed to apply any pressure as Ademola Lookman drifted a pass into Aleksandar Mitrovic and Kieran Gibbs switched off as the Serbia striker fed the ball inside him for Decordova-Reid to apply a cool finish.\nMore pleasing, though, was his team's response after what was presumably a half-time rocket from Allardyce as they fought for every ball and squeezed mistakes out of Fulham.\nThat enthusiasm and work-rate led directly to defender Bartley's well-taken equaliser while Diagne made a promising debut, unsettling the visiting defenders when he was introduced and teeing up Pereira to put West Brom in front.\nFulham rue missed chances\nIt must have been an equally bewildering afternoon for Fulham and their manager Scott Parker, who will be wondering what his side have to do to end a winless run that now stands at 10 Premier League matches.\nDecordova-Reid's 10th-minute goal provided the perfect platform to change that statistic but they were unable to build on it as a result of their profligacy in front of goal.\nFormer Bristol City winger Decordova-Reid was unfortunate to see an effort to double Fulham's lead come back off the left post after being played through by Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\nBut he, Lookman and Loftus-Cheek all had other chances to convert when well-placed to put the Cottagers out of sight by the interval.\nInstead, they found themselves dealing with a rejuvenated and more abrasive home side after Bartley equalised.\nDefenders Joachim Andersen and Tosin Adarabioyo suddenly found themselves under much more pressure - with a mark of West Brom's emphasis after striker Diagne came on being the fact Tosin was involved in more aerial duels (15) than any other player.\nParker will take some comfort from their own recovery, though - and both Mitrovic and Cavaleiro spurned late opportunities to score a winner.\n'I want to build on that' - what they said\nWest Brom manager Sam Allardyce speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: \"With our defensive frailties we needed three goals but we didn't get them. We made a magnificent effort to get the third [goal] but two should have been enough.\n\"We have showed we can create more chances than I have seen since I have been here. I want to build on that.\"\nFulham manager Scott Parker: \"The game should have been out of sight at half time. We were fantastic in the first half and they had to make changes 20 minutes into the game.\n\"We had some big chances and it should have been done. We didn't do well enough in the first 15 minutes of the second half but the substitutes came on and did very well.\n\"We're disappointed it's not three points but we'll keep moving. It's a useful point but there were big chances to kill the game off and we're not on the right side of the big moments. We're playing some good football but you need to put those moments away. It should have been 3-0 or 4-0 at half time.\"\nPereira's growing influence - the stats\nSince Sam Allardyce took charge of West Brom, Matheus Pereira has had a direct hand in five of the Baggies' seven goals in the top flight, netting four times and assisting another.\nFulham are now without a win in their last 10 Premier League games (D7 L3) - only once before in the competition's history have they endured a longer such run (12 between November 2007 and January 2008).\nWest Brom have taken five points from Allardyce's eight Premier League games in charge (W1 D2 L5), with only Fulham (4), Newcastle (4) and Wolves (3) picking up fewer since his first match as Baggies boss.\nNo side has conceded more home goals (19) under a specific manager in the Premier League this season than West Brom have under Allardyce, despite this being just the Baggies' fifth game at the Hawthorns under him.\nOnly in 2017-18 (21) has Bobby Decordova-Reid scored more goals in all competitions in a single campaign than the seven he has netted this season for Fulham, with his opener surpassing his total for last season in 25 fewer appearances (six in 47).\nKyle Bartley's equaliser for West Brom ended a run of 466 minutes and 22 goals without a Baggies reply at the Hawthorns since Conor Gallagher netted against Crystal Palace back in December.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom travel to play Sheffield United in the Premier League on Tuesday, 2 February (18:00 GMT).

Both managers probably think we should have won it.\n\"Three of our best players were out and that probably has an impact but I'm really happy with the players.\n\"In the second half we were so dominant and created some good chances to win it.\"\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"You look at the games we played against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool - we defended well and didn't really concede too many chances.\n\"That is a foundation to play from. We need to take our chances - we know we have the players to do that, but we haven't done it lately.\n\"I felt we controlled and played well in the first half. We created two massive chances and did some good play.\"\nWinless against Arsenal under Solskjaer - the stats\nArsenal remain unbeaten in each of their last six league games against Manchester United, since losing home and away in 2017-18. It is the Gunners' longest unbeaten run against the Red Devils in league competition since October 1980 to May 1983.\nUnited have failed to score in three consecutive league matches against Arsenal for the first time since between September 1981 and May 1983 (a run of four games).\nThis was the first goalless draw between Arsenal and Manchester United in the Premier League since February 2014.\nUnited are winless in all five Premier League games against Arsenal under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - the Norwegian is the only Red Devils manager to face Arsenal more than once in the top flight without winning a game.\nArsenal have kept four consecutive home clean sheets in all competitions for the first time since April 2019.\nArsenal's Willian made his 250th Premier League appearance in the match, playing more games in the competition than any other Brazilian.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in Premier League action on Tuesday.

I want top six, we have a great team and a great manager.\"\nSaints frustrated by failure to finish\nSouthampton were top of the league in November, albeit for just 48 hours, but have slipped into the bottom half of the table after three successive defeats.\nThey have also failed to score in five of their past seven Premier League games.\nTheir penalty appeal came in the first 10 minutes, but was not given after a review by the video assistant referee.\nIngs produced a delightful piece of skill to flick the ball over Douglas Luiz with his heel and tee up Armstrong, whose effort hit Cash on the arm after a slight deflection off the right-back's body.\nThe hosts enjoyed plenty of possession and strung together several dangerous moves, but could not manage one on target until the 70th minute when Martinez saved from Adams.\nRalph Hasenhuttl's side enjoyed 20 shots in total, three of those following a corner in the 85th minute.\nFirst Martinez palmed Jan Bednarek's header away, then the goalkeeper kept out Adams' follow-up and finally Cash blocked Jack Stephens' shot on the line.\nThe number of chances created were at least a positive for Hasenhuttl, who said his side \"invested everything\" but \"must do better\" to convert them.\n'We have to find a way out of this'\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It's not nice to lose like this. But you know football is not always fair. Today we did not deserve to lose.\n\"They told me the penalty decision in the first half was a goal if it did not hit the hand. These moments can be decisive if you go 1-0 up.\n\"We created more chances. Twenty shots on goal is not bad in 90 minutes. We are missing the clinical edge and maybe at the end a bit of luck.\n\"We had a time in the season where we scored easily. Now there's always a block or a goalkeeper makes a great save. At the moment there are injuries too. We have to find a way out of this.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"We didn't change the team from the other night against Burnley.

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-0 Burnley: Thomas Tuchel records first win as boss\nEmphatic finishes from Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso gave Thomas Tuchel his first victory as Chelsea head coach against a below-par Burnley.\nCaptain Azpilicueta - the longest-serving player in the team - drilled Callum Hudson-Odoi's lay-off high past Nick Pope just before half-time in the Premier League encounter at Stamford Bridge.\nAzpilicueta's fellow Spanish defender Alonso added a classy second late on, skilfully controlling a Christian Pulisic cross before lashing a volley over Pope at his near post.\nThe impressive Hudson-Odoi was unlucky not to score in between with a shot that was deflected on to a post by Burnley defender Erik Pieters.\nChelsea comfortably registered a second successive clean sheet under Tuchel, whose first game was the midweek goalless draw with Wolves, as Burnley did not manage a shot on target.\nThe only downside for Tuchel was Timo Werner's failure to score for a 12th league game as Chelsea climbed three places to seventh in the table, while Burnley remain 15th.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League matches\nOld faces welcome Tuchel's new era\nNo players in Tuchel's starting line-up have been at Chelsea longer than Azpilicueta, a 2012 signing from Marseille, and Alonso, who arrived four years later from Fiorentina.\nIt was strangely fitting that an Azpilicueta goal should christen the Tuchel era given he was the only member of Chelsea's current crop to play alongside predecessor Frank Lampard as well as under him.\nAzpilicueta's goal was reminiscent of Lampard's habit of appearing in the penalty area at the right time, crowning a flowing break by overlapping Hudson-Odoi and firing into the roof of the net.\nIt was Azpilicueta's first goal in more than a year and, while Alonso's effort was not quite as surprising given his propensity to find the net, his mere inclusion in Tuchel's side was an eye-opener given he had not played for more than four months.\nRecalled in place of Ben Chilwell, Alonso produced a superb piece of skill, chesting down Pulisic's centre and taking another touch on his knee before unleashing a powerful volley.\nThe finish gave the scoreline a fairer slant with Chelsea dominant, attempting 19 shots to Burnley's one, and Hudson-Odoi a menace throughout.\nChelsea remain three places and four points off the Champions League spots but this display - against a Burnley side that had been in fine form - will give Tuchel belief that the gap can be bridged.\nBurnley unable to recreate Anfield heroics\nFor the majority of the first half, the game had the feeling of Burnley's memorable recent win at Liverpool, when they frustrated their hosts for long periods and pinched a late winner.\nUntil Azpilicueta's opener Pope was troubled only by a couple of routine long-range efforts from an increasingly desperate Werner.\nBut once Burnley went behind they did not have an answer and were not helped by the withdrawal though injury of leading scorer Chris Wood just after the hour.\nJames Tarkowski's stoppage-time header from a corner was the sum total of their efforts, and even that failed to hit the target as Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy remained a spectator.\nSuccessive wins - at Anfield and at home to Aston Villa - lifted Burnley eight points clear of the relegation zone and suggest this meek display should be a one-off.\nHowever, any lengthy absence for Wood would worry manager Sean Dyche given his side remain the second lowest scorers in the division with 13 goals as they drew a blank for the 11th time in 20 games.\nThey were indebted to England keeper Pope for limiting the margin of defeat, denying Reece James, Werner and Pulisic in the second half as well as preventing Ben Mee turning a Hudson-Odoi cross into his own net.\n'We never got scared' - what they said\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel told BBC Sport: \"We had a lot of half chances but we had to wait a long time. What impressed me was that we never lost control and we had courage and confidence to impose our style.\n\"We never got scared and we stayed patient. The attitude and energy was very good. We only conceded one shot in the 94th minute.\n\"It was a hard team effort and a deserved win. The guys against Wolves also took their chance. I'm very happy with the performance and energy. It gives us a big boost for confidence.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"The best side won. I've got no complaints. In the second half they were by far the better side.

He preferred the team got a third than he got a second.\"\nThe 27-year-old has been directly involved in 15 goals in his 20 Premier League appearances for Leeds this season, with England boss Gareth Southgate present to witness this 11th and perhaps most spectacular strike in the competition this season.\nFoxes struggling without Vardy?\nLeicester would have moved two points behind leaders Manchester City with a win but dropped points for the second successive game, after a draw at Everton in midweek.\nWith Jamie Vardy absent following a hernia operation, the Foxes' most dangerous attacking outlets have been Barnes and Maddison, and it was the two England hopefuls who combined for Leicester's opener.\nBarnes collected the ball in the Leeds half and accelerated towards the penalty box, exchanging a one-two with Maddison before sliding an effort beyond Illan Meslier.\nMaddison's assist was the playmaker's 10th goal involvement in his past 11 games in all competitions, while Barnes now has seven league goals this season - one more than he managed in 2019-20.\nBut Vardy has scored 11 goals in the league this season, with back-up forwards Ayoze Perez and Kelechi Iheanacho contributing just one between them, and the Foxes have now failed to win either of their league games since his surgery.\nIt means Rodgers has had to alter his approach and he brought Caglar Soyuncu on at half-time as the hosts switched to a back three in an effort to regain control against Leeds.\nIt almost worked immediately as wing-backs Ricardo Pereira and James Justin combined, but Justin's effort was blocked.\nA stretching Jonny Evans poked wide at the far post with Leicester looking to level late on, but the hosts were caught out as Leeds flew forward to kill the game with six minutes left.\n\"Make no mistake, we have won games without Jamie but the physicality of him and Wilf (Ndidi) benefits the team immensely,\" said Rodgers. \"We just weren't good enough to get the result today.\"\n'We knew how to survive the difficult moments'\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa speaking to Match of the Day: \"We knew how to survive in the difficult moments and we tried to avoid them accumulating passes because it can be very difficult to take it off them.\n\"We managed the offensive actions we wanted to create.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"We made a good start, a fantastic goal from Harvey Barnes, who was a fantastic threat for us. We didn't close the space quickly enough and their goal is too easy from our perspective. We still had opportunities but didn't manage to score.

        "article_text": "West Ham United 1-3 Liverpool: Mohamed Salah double sends Reds third\nMohamed Salah scored for the first time in seven Premier League games with a brilliant double at West Ham United to help Liverpool move up to third in the table.\nA trademark quick shift and curling finish from the Egypt striker was reward for a bright start to the second half from the Reds after Jurgen Klopp's side had failed to add a cutting edge to their first-half possession.\nSalah capped a scintillating Liverpool counter-attack to double his side's lead 11 minutes later, instantly controlling Xherdan Shaqiri's looping pass over the top before prodding past Lukasz Fabianski.\nWithout the injured Sadio Mane and with Roberto Firmino among the substitutes, the onus was on Salah to end his mini drought and he delivered in style.\nFirmino came off the bench to set up Georginio Wijnaldum for a slick Liverpool third before Craig Dawson steered home a corner to hand West Ham a consolation.\nLiverpool's second win in London in four days cut the gap to leaders Manchester City - who have a game in hand - to four points, and the two sides meet at Anfield on Sunday.\nReaction from West Ham v Liverpool, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League matches\nLiverpool approach Preston about defender Ben Davies\nKlopp's decisions pay off\nEyebrows were raised at the exclusion of Firmino from Liverpool's starting line-up given Senegal forward Mane was missing with a minor muscle injury.\nA toothless first-half display, in which Liverpool's only effort on target was a 20-yard Salah strike straight at Fabianki, suggested the reigning champions were suffering from the absence of two of their famed front three - as well as the injured Diogo Jota.\nBut Klopp's introduction of Curtis Jones from the bench early in the second half proved a game-changer as the young playmaker neatly played in Salah for the opener.\nHis surging run through the centre of the pitch put West Ham on the back foot and, after exchanging passes with Trent Alexander-Arnold, he found Salah, who made space for himself against Aaron Cresswell before curling the ball past Fabianski.\nLiverpool's second goal was even easier on the eye, Shaqiri receiving a cross-field diagonal ball from Alexander-Arnold before picking out Salah with a first-time pass as the visitors broke from a Hammers corner with devastating effect.\nTheir third was every bit as impressive, as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's backheeled one-two with Firmino set the Brazilian free and the substitute squared for Wijnaldum to coolly fire home.\nThe goals, on the back of three at Tottenham on Thursday, suggest Liverpool have found their attacking verve again after going four games without scoring - just in time to breathe life into their faltering title defence.\nThe stylish Thiago Alcantara looks increasingly at home in midfield and was part of a Liverpool diamond that controlled the game throughout while the inexperienced Nathaniel Phillips and midfielder Jordan Henderson - excelling at centre-back every bit as much as Fabinho has done this season - were solid at the heart of the defence.\nLiverpool's weakened squad will face a significant examination against in-form City on Sunday, but the victories over Tottenham and West Ham mean Klopp's side will begin that game - and Brighton on Wednesday before it - in notably better spirits.\nThey look set to be bolstered by the arrival of Preston North End's Ben Davies, who is likely to sign on Monday for \u00a32m and add depth to a defence missing Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip, Joe Gomez and Fabinho.\nTitle race thinning out?\nFour weeks ago, only seven points separated the top 10 in what was building up to be one of the most congested title races ever but, after eight consecutive wins, leaders City now hold a nine-point advantage and a game in hand over fifth-placed West Ham.\nWith Manchester United and Leicester dropping points twice this week, Liverpool's back-to-back victories in London suggest they could emerge as City's likeliest challengers despite their injury problems.\nWest Ham briefly climbed into the Champions League places with Tuesday's win over Crystal Palace but this emphatic defeat is likely to give pause to any Hammers fans dreaming of a top-four push.\nDavid Moyes' side came into the game on the back of six straight wins in all competitions but never looked like they truly believed they could extend that run against the reigning champions.\nMichail Antonio pounced on a James Milner slip to curl their best opening just wide moments before Salah broke the deadlock - but in truth they were second best throughout.\nThis was an off-day for Moyes' side compared to their recent performances but their form overall this season will give them hope they can have realistic hopes of qualifying for Europe for the first time this century.\nDawson's consolation was a small reward for the hosts for not giving up but they are now winless in their past 10 games against Liverpool.\nThe Hammers will certainly be glad to see the back of Salah for a while, the forward having scored in seven of his last eight meetings against them, including Liverpool's 2-1 win at Anfield in October.\n'Three unbelievable goals' - what they said\nWest Ham boss David Moyes told BBC Sport: \"It was tight. We found it hard against Liverpool. We were better in the first half but didn't show enough composure at times against a really good side.\n\"We have been in good form. We came into the game with a lot of confidence. This is the difference, at this level it shows. We're trying to catch a few teams up, not Liverpool, that's for sure.\n\"The players have been excellent. Even today, it's a lesson for them - the levels we have to get to. We didn't do the things we usually do well today.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"We didn't create enough in the first half. We made little adjustments at half-time and it paid off. We scored three unbelievable goals.\n\"These boys are a really good group. They're not happy at not being successful, not winning, but they always have the right attitude.\n\"We slept one night at home [after Tottenham] and then we came to London. That's two great results.\"\nCapital gains for Reds - the stats\nLiverpool have won more Premier League matches against West Ham than they have against any other side in the competition (31), while only against Arsenal (32) have the Hammers lost more Premier League games than they have against Liverpool (31).\nLiverpool (W4 D1) became only the second team to go unbeaten in their five Premier League away games at London Stadium, following Manchester City (W4 D1).\nLiverpool have lost just one of their past 16 Premier League games in London (W11 D4), winning their past three fixtures in the capital and scoring 13 goals across those wins.\nWest Ham manager David Moyes is winless in his last 14 Premier League matches against Liverpool (D4 L10), losing each of the last five in a row (all with West Ham).\nMohamed Salah became the first player to score 20+ goals in all competitions in four consecutive seasons for Liverpool since Ian Rush did so six times running from 1981-82 to 1986-87.\nSalah has scored nine Premier League goals against West Ham, his best return against a side in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham visit Aston Villa in the Premier League on Wednesday (20:15 GMT) before a London derby at Fulham on Saturday (17:30 GMT). Liverpool host Brighton on Wednesday (20:15 GMT) before welcoming league leaders Manchester City to Anfield on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nSupercar, Superfam: Who's behind revamping some of the world's most powerful cars?\nFKA Twigs x Louis Theroux: Female inspirations, online trolls and her relationship with Shia LaBeouf"

We have to keep fighting for everything until the last kick.\"\nA winless December may have had Brighton boss Potter looking over his shoulder.\nBut three wins in their past four games in all competitions - including three clean sheets - suggests the Seagulls are starting to find the form they need to pull away from the bottom three.\nSorry Spurs out of ideas\nAfter losing to Liverpool on Thursday night, Spurs needed a response - the omens were not great, given when they lost to the champions in December they followed it up with a 2-0 defeat to Leicester.\nA win would have put the visitors fifth in the table. Instead, they suffered back-to-back defeats for a second time this season.\n\"I can imagine that the team when it loses is a sad team,\" Mourinho told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"The reaction after that defeat was not phenomenal, the fact that you lose, I don't like to speak on behalf of the players, but they feel too much the absence of a player like Harry [Kane].\"\nWith Kane sidelined with injuries to both ankles, Real Madrid loanee Bale started just his second league game of the season.\nBut, like the rest of Spurs' forward line, the four-time Champions League winner looked uninspired in the opening 45 minutes. The Welshman was subbed shortly after the hour mark.\nSon Heung-min and Carlos Vinicius both tested Brighton keeper Robert Sanchez late on, Vinicius' effort in particular worrying the Spanish keeper.\nBut without talisman Kane, Tottenham looked bereft of ideas, rarely threatening their 17th-placed opponents.\n\"It's not about the players. I told them there is no replacement for Harry Kane,\" added the Spurs boss.\n\"In the first half we tried to give the dynamic that [gave] us the success with a number of goals, which is the connection with Son.\n\"We changed in the second half to playing with a clear target man.

        "article_text": "Wolves 2-1 Arsenal: David Luiz & Bernd Leno sent off as Gunners lose\nArsenal had two players sent off as they threw away a lead and lost to Wolves - who won for the first time in nine Premier League games.\nThe Gunners, who had earlier hit the woodwork twice and had a goal disallowed, went ahead when Nicolas Pepe held off two Wolves challenges and curled a fine finish into the net.\nBut Arsenal were reduced to 10 men when defender David Luiz brought down Willian Jose, with Ruben Neves equalising with the resulting penalty in first-half injury time.\nJoao Moutinho scored with a brilliant strike from 30 yards out to put the hosts ahead soon after the restart.\nHowever, the Gunners were then reduced to nine men as goalkeeper Bernd Leno handled the ball outside of his penalty area after racing out trying to deny Adama Traore.\nThis was Wolves' first league victory since a 2-1 victory at Molineux against Chelsea on 15 December, although they had also won two FA Cup ties - against Crystal Palace and National League North side Chorley - since then.\nWolves remain in 14th and Arsenal - who would have gone sixth with victory - stay 10th, eight points behind fourth-placed Leicester City in the final Champions League qualification spot.\nLuiz red card changed game - Arteta\nWolves v Arsenal as it happened, plus the rest of Tuesday's Premier League matches\nLawro's predictions v Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett\nLuiz red card changes the game\nThe turning point came in first-half injury time when Arsenal were leading 1-0 and were dominant.\nDaniel Podence played the ball through to Jose and the Brazilian, on his home debut, had his heel clipped from behind by compatriot Luiz.\nReferee Craig Pawson decided that Luiz had made no attempt to play the ball and sent the centre-back off. It was Luiz's third red card for Arsenal after also being dismissed in the 2-2 draw at Chelsea in January 2020 and then again in the 3-0 loss to Manchester City in June.\nAfter the match, both managers had contrasting opinions with Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo saying Pawson had \"no other option\" but to award the penalty and send off Luiz.\nHowever, Gunners manager Mikel Arteta said he \"cannot tell you where the contact is\" and suggested the club may appeal Luiz's red card.\nWolves, whose main threat had been restricted to set-pieces and long-range efforts, equalised with Neves' penalty, which he fired into the top corner.\nGunners boss Mikel Arteta made a defensive substitution at the break as centre-back Gabriel came on for forward Alexandre Lacazette, but it only took the hosts four minutes of the second half to go ahead, through Moutinho's superb strike.\nThe visitors brought on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for goalscorer Pepe in the 61st minute in an attempt to rescue something from the game.\nBut Leno made a shocking decision in the 72nd minute as he sprinted out of his box, trying to reach the ball before the pacey Traore, but the goalkeeper misjudged the bounce, handled the ball and was dismissed.\nWith Mat Ryan, who signed from Brighton last month, injured, third-choice goalkeeper Runar Runarsson was given a Premier League debut.\nThe 25-year-old Iceland international, signed for \u00a31.8m from Dijon in September, did well to deny Pedro Neto and substitute Vitinha as Wolves looked to finish the game off.\nThat left Arsenal largely playing with two banks of four, in defence and midfield, with long spells of no-one playing up front before they could regain possession.\nAubameyang and Hector Bellerin had shots from the edge of the penalty area blocked, but the Gunners could not force an unlikely equaliser.\nArsenal's first-half display a plus for Arteta\nWhen these two sides met on 29 November at Emirates Stadium, Wolves won 2-1 and Arteta was facing questions over whether he would lose his job with the Gunners down in 14th.\nArsenal had gone into Tuesday's game on an unbeaten run of seven Premier League matches and the Spaniard will surely be disappointed they did not extend that sequence, because they could have taken the game beyond Wolves in the first half.\nThe Gunners nearly went ahead inside the opening 40 seconds when Saka hit the post after a fine pass from the excellent Thomas Partey.\nSaka then had an effort saved by Rui Patricio before the England midfielder did put the ball in the net, but it was ruled out by the video assistant referee because Lacazette was offside in the build-up.\nPepe was denied when his strike was superbly pushed on to the crossbar by Patricio, but the Gunners' record signing did get on the scoresheet when he did superbly to nutmeg two Wolves defenders before curling the ball into the far corner.\nAt that point, it looked like Arsenal would run away with the match, but the penalty and first red card on the stroke of half-time changed everything, with the Gunners unable to create any real opportunities in the second half.\n'I cannot tell you where the contact is' - what they said\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo said: \"Everything changes with the penalty, the dynamic of the game changes there. I think the referee doesn't have any other option in both situations [the penalty and the red card for Luiz].\n\"The [Moutinho] goal is amazing. He is such a talented player and he deserves this moment. It's a very welcome win. It means a lot, we have been in a tough moment.\n\"We have done many beautiful things in past seasons and we want to emulate them again. The standards are very high and we have to chase them.\n\"We cannot allow ourselves to ever put our heads down. I will not allow our players to stop believing in themselves.\"\nArsenal manager Arteta told Match of the Day: \"The team was really on top of the game, we should have been three- or four-nil up and in that action [the Luiz red] the game changed completely.\n\"I've seen it 10 times in different angles and I cannot tell you where the contact is. If they have another 50 different angles to watch it, maybe I will be surprised. I looked at seven different angles and I cannot see any contact there.\n\"The team kept trying, kept playing, kept believing. At half-time, the boys were so animated because they believed they could still win the game. Obviously it was an incredible goal from long range, before that they didn't have any chances. But still we lost and we have to react.\n\"We hit the post, hit the bar, the keeper made a couple of great saves. We played exceptionally well, scored one goal and should have scored three or four and had more of a gap, but obviously you concede two red cards in the Premier League. I don't have any [complaints about] the second red card.\n\"The team is encouraging me every day to believe in them and to give me a positive feeling all the time.\"\nWolves do the double over Arsenal - the stats\nWolves completed their first league double over Arsenal since 1978-79.\nSince Arteta's first game in charge of Arsenal on 26 December 2019, the Gunners have been shown nine Premier League red cards, six more than any other side.\nOnly Sheffield United and West Brom (16 each) have conceded the first goal in more Premier League games this season than Wolves (15).\nArsenal's Pepe has scored three goals in his past four starts in the league, as many as in his previous 16.\nPepe has scored in three consecutive away league matches for the first time since January 2019, when he scored in four in a row on the road for Lille.\nSince making his Premier League debut for Arsenal in August 2019, Luiz has picked up more red cards (three) and conceded more penalties (six) than any other player in the competition.\nMoutinho scored his first home goal for Wolves (61 games at Molineux) - and all three of his Premier League goals have come from outside the box.\nLeno became the second Arsenal goalkeeper to be sent off in the Premier League, after David Seaman in November 1993 against West Ham.\nGranit Xhaka made his 200th appearance for the Gunners. Since his debut for the club in August 2016, he has played 46 games more than the next player (Bellerin, 154).\nWhat's next?\nThis was the first of three successive home matches for Wolves, who take on Leicester in the Premier League on Sunday (14:00 GMT) and then play Southampton in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Thursday, 11 February (17:30).\nArsenal are in the West Midlands again for their next match as they face Aston Villa in the league on Saturday (12:30).\nYou can stream all the goals and highlights from Sunday's Premier League matches with Match of the Day 2 on BBC iPlayer"

Just because we have won a couple of games recently, it's the Premier League and it hurts you.\n\"I have a group that are alive and kicking and fighting for their lives.\"\nBoth Wilder and his opposite number Sam Allardyce had identified the importance of this fixture to their hopes of avoiding relegation.\nInitially the Baggies' more direct approach appeared to give them the upper hand at a rain-soaked Bramall Lane, with Phillips tapping in after home goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale had parried efforts from Callum Robinson and Mbaye Diagne.\nHowever, the Blades levelled after the break when Jayden Bogle lashed a left-footed effort into the bottom right corner after being teed up by Chris Basham.\nRamsdale's superb close-range save from Robinson then provided Sharp with the platform to secure the Blades' third victory of the season with a prodded finish into the bottom left corner.\nWhile Wilder's side remain bottom of the table they are now just a point behind West Brom, in 19th, and are 10 points from safety.\nRelive Tuesday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett\nBlades bounce back\nFor the first 45 minutes it had looked like being another typical hard-luck story for Sheffield United.\nThe Blades displayed plenty of endeavour but rarely showed enough spark to break down a stubborn West Brom defence.\nHowever, the introduction of Oliver McBurnie at the break provided Wilder's side with an extra body in attack and the impetus to recover.\nA late first-half injury to George Baldock also inadvertently helped, with Bogle switching to the right and marauding forward at every opportunity.\nHis impressive understanding with Basham offered a useful outlet and provided the hosts with the goal that started their comeback.\nAfter having just four attempts on goal in the first period, the hosts managed 10 in the second, which was a reflection of their dominance.\nAnd with Wilder preparing to substitute Sharp, the forward atoned for a wayward first-half header with the winning contribution.\nBaggies in need of instant improvement\nSince their Black Country derby victory over Wolves at Molineux, West Brom have collected just one point from 12 available.\nAnd with fixtures against Tottenham and Manchester United on the horizon, manager Sam Allardyce had suggested that this was a \"must-not-lose\" game.\nWith that in mind, the former England boss said his side would revert to a \"simple\" style of football after they were completely outplayed at times in their 2-2 draw at Fulham.\nAnd he stuck to his word, with the Baggies shifting from a three-man defence to a conventional 4-4-2 formation and taking few chances by attempting to play out from the back.\nWhile neither of his deadline-day loan signings - Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Okay Yokuslu - featured, Diagne was handed a first start.\nAnd his robust presence, complemented by Robinson's running and an energetic display from Phillips set the tone for an early spell of dominance.\nHowever, that control faded and bar Robinson's chance midway through the second period, they rarely looked capable of adding to their goal tally.\nMore disappointingly for Allardyce, they were undone by some lax defending with both Bogle and Sharp being surrounded by a posse of West Brom defenders, when they scored.\n\"You can't not do your job correctly, particularly when you are defending,\" said Allardyce.\n\"Overall, our defending today was very good. Those two moments could have been avoided and it's cost us two goals.\n\"It leaves us with a great gap to fill. It's simple maths. We know how many points it takes to stay in this league. What other people do and what other clubs do, we can't affect. We have to focus on getting 38 points.\"\nBaggies' defensive woes\nSheffield United have now won three of their last five Premier League matches (L2) - as many as in their previous 27 in the competition (W3 D4 L20).\nWest Bromwich Albion have conceded 26 goals in nine Premier League games under Sam Allardyce - as many as they conceded in 13 games under Slaven Bilic this season.\nSince January 9th, when Sheffield United ended a 21-game winless run in all competitions with a 3-2 win over Bristol Rovers in the FA Cup, the only Premier League side with more wins in all competitions than the Blades (5) is Manchester City (7).\nWest Brom goalkeeper Sam Johnstone has conceded 50 Premier League goals in his first 21 appearances - the joint-quickest a goalkeeper has ever shipped 50 goals in Premier League history, along with Barnsley goalkeeper David Watson in 1997/98 (also 21).\nIn just 10 appearances in all competitions for Sheffield United, Jayden Bogle has scored as many goals as he managed in 90 games for Derby County (3).\nWest Brom's Matt Phillips scored his first league goal of the season - he has now found the net in each of the last 13 seasons in English league football, stretching back to the 2008/09 season.\nSince Chris Wilder first game in charge of Sheffield United in August 2016, Billy Sharp has scored 76 goals in all competitions - 44 more than any other Blades player in that time.\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United next play in the Premier League when they host Chelsea on Sunday, 7 February (19:15 GMT).\nWest Brom travel to Tottenham on the same day for their next top-flight match (12:00 GMT).\nYou can stream all the goals and highlights from Sunday's Premier League matches with Match of the Day 2 on BBC iPlayer"

Missing injured strikers Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood, Wednesday's match was always likely to be a struggle.\nDyche's side had just 25% possession and have now lost their past eight games against City, shipping 30 goals and scoring just once.\nAnd their wretched home record against the division's established 'big six' - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - is now one victory from the past 27 meetings.\nMatej Vydra volleyed wide from a promising position and Johann Gudmundsson smashed a long-range strike over in a rather relaxed evening for Ederson, though the City goalkeeper did receive a yellow card for haring off his line and chopping down Erik Pieters.\nWhat the managers said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche to BBC Sport: \"Manchester City were every good. They're on a good run of form. They are really sharp in transition in defence and attack.\n\"They can open you up. We'd like to do better with the goals. Fair play to them. They get their noses in front.\n\"We defended well in general and stuck to the task.\n\"This batch of injuries, I don't think are serious.\n\"They play with a three and a half [at the back]. The right-back or left-back goes into midfield when they have the ball.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola to BBC Sport: \"We struggled a little bit to break - the first pass, first movement. The first 15 minutes of the second half was our best football. Unfortunately we could not score a third or fourth goal.\n\"In the last 15 minutes we passed the ball without the intent to attack, just to control.\n\"Strikers need goals for their confidence. Gabriel Jesus played really good.\"\nWinning on Wednesdays - the best stats\nManchester City's 13-match winning run is the longest by a Premier League side since Arsenal between March and August 2002 (also 13).\nBurnley have failed to have a shot on target in their past two league games - the first to do that since Everton in January 2018.\nCity have won all three of their games against Burnley this season by an aggregate score of 10-0.\nManchester City have kept a clean sheet in their past six league games, their joint-longest run without conceding in the competition (also September 2015 and October 2018).\nThey have become the first side to win 12 consecutive Premier League matches played on Wednesday.\nGundogan has scored (seven) or assisted (one) eight goals in his past 10 Premier League games for City, as many as in his previous 61 appearances.\nSterling has been directly involved in 154 goals under Guardiola (99 goals and 55 assists) - eight more than any other City player in that time.\nJesus has scored 68 goals in the 107 games he has started for Manchester City, netting in each of his past three starts.\nWhat next?\nBurnley have a potentially crucial match against fellow strugglers Brighton on Saturday (15:00 GMT kick-off).\nCity too have a huge game when they travel to champions Liverpool on Sunday (16:30).

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 1-2 Crystal Palace: Eagles fight back to beat Magpies\nCrystal Palace recorded back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time since September as they kept an attack-minded Newcastle at bay at St James' Park.\nThe Magpies had a handful of chances to add to the second-minute strike from Jonjo Shelvey, while Roy Hodgson's side made the most of their opportunities, turning the match around in a four-minute spell courtesy of goals from Jairo Riedewald and Gary Cahill.\nRiedewald's effort trumped Shelvey's half-volley, when his 20-yard rocket took a slight deflection off Ciaran Clark in beating keeper Karl Darlow. And then in the 25th minute 35-year-old Cahill leapt highest to flick Eberechi Eze's corner delivery past the reach of the Magpies keeper. In doing so, the former Chelsea defender became the club's oldest scorer in the competition.\nAndros Townsend should have made it 3-1 in stoppage time, but almost inexplicably struck his effort high and wide from four yards.\nThe visiting backline was busier of the two defences with Vicente Guaita producing a great instinctive block to deny Ryan Fraser and making another save to deny the Scot.\nVictory sees Palace move level on 29 points with 12th place Southampton, while Newcastle remain in 16th and eight points above the drop-zone.\nWhether Hodgson's side can make it a hat-trick of successes at Leeds next Monday might depend on how serious Wilfried Zaha's injury is. The Ivory Coast winger came off in the 58th minute with what appeared to be a hamstring injury.\nReaction from Tuesday's Premier League matches\nLawro's predictions v Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett\nPatience pays off for Palace\nThis fourth away win of the season in the league was the product of disciplined defending, efficiency in attack and some luck.\nThe Eagles had more than enough time to regroup after the early jolt from Shelvey and were thankful Newcastle's defending was not at the level it was during last weekend's win at Everton.\nHodgson's own defence was exceptional on Tuesday. Guaita once again underlined his importance in the backline when he rushed out to get enough of a hand on Fraser's strike to push it wide.\nFull-back Nathaniel Clyne made a crucial challenge to deny Callum Wilson a shot on goal and Scott Dann produced a brave block to prevent substitute Allan Saint-Maximin from testing Guaita.\nAnother loss but Magpies on right track\nDespite this eighth defeat in the past 11 league games, this was not a return to the bad old ways for Steve Bruce's side.\nThey set up with a similar attacking formation which reaped rewards at Goodison Park and had Palace on the backfoot for much of the match, enjoying 61% of the possession.\nThe only thing lacking was the same intensity they showed against the Toffees. Riedewald was given too much space to line up his shot for Palace's opener and the defence lost Cahill as he ran clear to nod in the second.\nHad Fraser stuck away his chance at 2-1 when he was one-on-one with Guaita then the Magpies might have got something out of this game.\nBruce has got it tactically right now, he just needs his side to discover a cutting edge.\n'Zaha doesn't normally get injured' - reaction\nPalace boss Roy Hodgson speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"We knew it wouldn't be easy, but it's good to get six points from here [and Wolves].\n\"I thought we played well. Having seen the [Shelvey] goal back, it was a much better strike than I first anticipated. It was one heck of a strike really.\n\"We played well after that. At half-time I felt good about our play. But then you tend to be more cautious because you know they have to do something special and you perhaps stop asking questions. We really should have scored the third goal to put the game to bed.\"\nOn Zaha's injury: \"Suddenly we are looking around wondering where all our players are. It's going to be a problem trying to get these players fit again. These injuries have to be assessed. Zaha doesn't normally get injured so it's concerning he has come off. Hopefully it's nothing serious.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"Frustrated and disappointed as our performance didn't deserve for us to be beat. We had 10 minutes where we went too deep and let in sloppy goals. In this league that punishes you.\n\"Our performance levels have been better certainly over the last few weeks. We have tried to implement change in the last month or so and what you're looking for is a performance to go with it. As often in the Premier League, it's defining moments. Apart from that 10 to 15-minute spell, we had the better chances and should have taken something from the game.\"\nNo home comforts for Newcastle - stats\nThis was the first time Palace have won an away Premier League game after conceding the first goal since October 2019 against West Ham (2-1), having gone winless in their previous 14 such matches (D2 L12).\nNewcastle have lost each of their first three home league games in a calendar year for just the second time, previously doing so in 2014 in the Premier League.\nShelvey's opener for Newcastle (71 seconds) was the fastest goal Crystal Palace have conceded in a Premier League game since Ian Taylor's strike for Aston Villa in March 1998 (1st minute).\nRiedewald's equaliser was just his second Premier League goal and first since October 2020 against Fulham, ending a run of 13 games without a goal in the competition.\nCahill (35 years, 45 days) became the oldest Englishman to score a Premier League goal at St James' Park since Alan Shearer, for Newcastle against Wigan in April 2006 (35 years, 245 days).\nWhat's next?\nThe Magpies host Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT) and the Eagles are at Leeds next Monday (20:00 GMT).\nYou can stream all the goals and highlights from Sunday's Premier League matches with Match of the Day 2 on BBC iPlayer"

It was an unbelievable cross.\n\"He's created lots of moments for the team [and showed] great skill on the edge of the box for the second goal. He's an absolutely outstanding young player and I'm so happy he plays in my team.\"\nYouri Tielemans also had an excellent game at the heart of midfield, winning possession 10 times and completing more passes than any other Leicester player.\nOnly Manchester United have collected more points on their travels this season than Rodgers' side, who have now won eight of their 11 away league matches in 2020-21.\nToothless Fulham in deep trouble\nFulham came into Wednesday's game without a win since beating Leicester 2-1 at King Power Stadium on 30 November.\nThe Cottagers have proved tough to beat in recent weeks, but their failure to convert chances into goals has seen them lose ground on the teams above the drop zone.\nThey carved out the first opportunity of the game after 12 minutes, but Justin produced a fine block to deny Aleksandar Mitrovic after a marauding run from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa down the left.\nAdarabioyo forced Schmeichel into an outstanding one-handed save late in the first half, only for Justin's goal moments later to leave Scott Parker's side with a mountain to climb.\nParker brought on Mario Lemina and Ivan Cavaleiro at half-time and the latter went close to halving the deficit within minutes of the restart, dragging a low shot wide of Schmeichel's left-hand post.\nBut that was the closest the hosts came to a route back into the match, as their winless league run stretched to 11 games.\nNo home comforts for Cottagers - the stats\nFulham have lost their first four home games in 2021 in all competitions - the first time they've lost their first four home games in a calendar year as a Football League side.\nLeicester have won 26 away points in the Premier League this season - their second highest such total in a Premier League campaign after their 2015-16 title success (39).\nFulham have gone 11 games without a win in the Premier League (D7 L4) - the current longest such streak in the competition.\nFulham have won only two of their 21 Premier League games this season - before this term, 13 of the 15 previous Premier League sides to win two games or fewer after 21 were relegated at the end of the campaign, although one of the sides to survive were Fulham in 2007-08.\nLeicester's Kelechi Iheanacho scored his first Premier League goal in 15 games since netting against Crystal Palace in July 2020.\nLeicester's James Maddison assisted two goals in a single Premier League game for the first time in his career (87th app).\n'Quality at both ends the difference' - what they said\nFulham boss Scott Parker, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"The cold hard fact is that we've lost a football match today and we know what we need to do - we need to win.\n\"Quality at both ends was the difference, we had some good moments in the first half but we still didn't cause them many problems. Their quality in the final third was evident.\n\"There's still 17 games left. I understand what the perception will be, but we have a team here that have been in games. We know what we need to do and there needs to be a clear focus on that.\"\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was important for us to respond, that's how you define your team in terms of setbacks. I thought we were excellent and scored two outstanding goals. We showed real moments of quality.\n\"I think the team is maturing - it's hard physically for players this season.

Coming into this game they had won just one of their last 37 top-flight away games against Leeds.\nLeeds United have conceded 17 goals via set-pieces in the Premier League this season (including penalties), the most of any side.\nLeeds have lost five of their 10 league matches at Elland Road this season (won three, drew two) - a Marcelo Bielsa side last lost more home league matches in a single campaign in 2012-13 with Athletic Bilbao in La Liga (eight).\nLeeds have gone 12 league games without a draw within a single top-flight campaign for the first time since October 1999 to February 2000 (13 games).\nEverton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored nine headed goals in the Premier League since the start of last season; the only player in Europe's top five leagues with more over this period is Robert Lewandowski (12).\nEverton's Lucas Digne has six assists in the Premier League this season, the most of any defender. Since he joined Everton for the 2018-19 campaign, the only two defenders with more Premier League assists than himself (17) are Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson (both 28).\nRaphinha became the second Leeds United player to score home and away against Everton in a single Premier League campaign after Michael Bridges in 1999-2000.\n'A difficult game against a difficult team' - what they said\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The two goals they scored were preventable. The first 30 minutes of the game was good for us and the second half as well. We managed to find goalscoring opportunities and avoid a third goal. Finally we didn't manage the second goal.\n\"It is true they played an energetic game. Maybe the fact they were in front allowed us to take the initiative.\n\"After they were winning by two goals they gave us the ball and started defending in their own half. The amount of goalscoring opportunities we created makes us think we should have had a draw or win.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's special because it was a difficult game against a difficult team. We did really well in the first half. Second half was more difficult because we conceded early. To arrive at the end of game was not easy.\n\"The sacrifice, concentration and motivation was good. I'm really pleased with the reaction after the [home 2-0] Newcastle defeat.\n\"The plan was to be intelligent in the game and defend well and find the opportunity to counter-attack. They push a lot of players in front.\n\"We lost a little bit of confidence after the goal. But this team is showing when they defend we are comfortable.\n\"We have better luck away from home. I hope [next opponents] Manchester United scored all their goals against Southampton.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeeds are at Elland Road again next time out when they entertain Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday (20:00 GMT), before an away league game at Arsenal on Sunday, 14 February.\nEverton play at Manchester United in the league on Saturday (20:00), then have a home tie against Tottenham in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday, 10 February (20:15) before they face Fulham at home in the Premier League four days later (19:00).\nThe Monday Night Club: How has Pep turned things round and can Micah get Timo Werner firing?\nHip Hop that shook America: How Kanye West challenged ideas about rap and religion"

We need to carry on. We don't get too down when things don't go our way and shouldn't get too excited when they do go our way.

Tough one to take. A really tough week - two away games, two very intense games - and tonight we looked really like we weren't fresh enough mentally and physically.\n\"A lot of moments where we gave the ball away too easily, in moments the boys looked tired mentally. I know they can pass the ball from A to B but it didn't happen. We made it easy for Brighton but they also did really well.\n\"Brighton deserved to win, no doubt about it. For me, it's more important to find an explanation for why we lost this game and understand what happened here. We didn't look convincing.\"\nBrighton manager Potter: \"We showed courage when we had the ball and when we didn't. We defended with our lives. We limited a good team to not too many chances. We had a few ourselves.\n\"You have to be disciplined here. Huge credit to the players who worked so hard. I can't speak highly enough of the character of performance - sensational.\n\"It's not an easy place to get points. They're a top team. We're just trying our best in this league.

        "article_text": "Tottenham 0-1 Chelsea: Jorginho condemns Spurs to third Premier League loss in a row\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho criticised referee Andre Marriner's performance after his side lost at home to Chelsea, who continued their unbeaten start under new boss Thomas Tuchel and moved into the Premier League's top six.\nJorginho's first-half penalty, awarded after Eric Dier clumsily upended Timo Werner, gave the Blues a win their more progressive approach deserved against a Spurs side devoid of ideas and ambition until it was too late.\nBut Mourinho, who talked to Marriner at length as they walked off the pitch on Thursday, said: \"I consider him one of the best referees in the Premier League. I care for him and one I have big admiration for him. That gives me a good position to tell him I did not like his performance.\n\"In the end a penalty decides the game. In the end they score a penalty which is not a penalty where you say it is a dangerous situation, one on one, almost scoring.\n\"It's a penalty that is difficult to accept and to lose the game like this is a bit painful.\"\nTuchel has now enjoyed two wins and a draw, without conceding a goal, since replacing the sacked Frank Lampard, and while the animated German occasionally displayed signs of frustration in his technical area, this was ultimately a satisfying outcome.\n\"The whole first half we totally controlled the game,\" said Tuchel. \"Maybe we lost confidence in the second half because we lost the ball possession.\n\"A bit more killer instinct and more aggression in the box would have been nice. It was a big win in an away game and I am very happy.\"\nIn contrast, it was a third successive defeat in a dismal sequence for Tottenham and Mourinho, as they were punished for a desperately negative gameplan which, shorn of main marksman Harry Kane, barely gave Chelsea an anxious moment until Carlos Vinicius headed Serge Aurier's cross wide at the far post when unmarked late on.\n'Devoid of ambition, lacking in ideas - troubling times for Mourinho'\nReaction to Chelsea's win at Tottenham\nDemanding Tuchel continues good start\nTuchel has wasted no time in laying down his demands to Chelsea's players and his presence on the touchline certainly galvanises them into action.\nHe was on the move throughout this win, constantly expressing pleasure and discontent, on one occasion shouting \"yes\" and applauding his side vigorously after bellowing \"go, go\" to order Chelsea to pressurise Spurs.\nIt is early days but Tuchel has got Chelsea playing at a faster pace and the right-sided combination of Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi is clearly something he feels has promise.\nIn reality, this was a relatively comfortable night for the Blues, despite losing the experienced Thiago Silva with a hamstring injury in the first half.\nChelsea keeper Edouard Mendy was barely troubled, apart from a diving save from Erik Lamela, while Mason Mount's driving runs and energy from midfield were sure to have impressed his new manager.\nWerner is still struggling for a break, but he won the crucial penalty and never stopped running despite not always enjoying the best of fortune.\nAll in all, this was a pleasing night for Tuchel and his new charges.\nNegative Spurs deserved nothing\nSpurs manager Mourinho will no doubt point to that bad late miss by Vinicius as a moment when they might have snatched a point - but, in reality, they got what their approach merited: nothing.\nMourhino's side looked desperately short of threat without the injured Kane, with even Son Heung-min struggling as he received little support or service.\nIn a bewildering first-half display, Spurs at times almost seemed unwilling to leave their own half, instantly handing the initiative to Chelsea. It was an invitation the visitors were only too happy to accept.\nTottenham, as they had to do, showed more positive intent after the break, but it was hardly a wave of attacks and, when he did make changes, it was significant Mourinho turned to Lamela and Lucas Moura rather than Gareth Bale, who was left unused.\nKane's absence would strip any team of an edge of menace but it was also Mourinho's no-risk strategy that let Tuchel's side benefit for most of the game.\nLate rally aside, particularly Vinicius' miss, this was a grim evening for Spurs their manager.\nLawro's predictions v Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett\nMourinho's first back-to-back home defeats - the best stats\nMourinho lost back-to-back home league matches for the first time in his 327th such game.\nTuchel became the first Chelsea manager to keep clean sheets in his first three matches in charge since Mourinho in August 2004.\nTottenham have suffered three successive Premier League defeats for the first time since November 2012.\nChelsea have seven points from Tuchel's three matches - as many as they managed in Lampard's final eight.\nSpurs have lost four of their past five league games when Kane has not played.\nMourinho has not won any of his past seven games against former club Chelsea - his joint-longest winless run against an opponent in his managerial career (also against Barcelona between April 2011 and January 2012 when he was Real Madrid boss).\nJorginho's opener for Chelsea was his 10th Premier League goal, eight of which have been penalties.\nAlongside Jamie Vardy, Anthony Martial and Patrick Bamford, Chelsea striker Werner has won the joint-most Premier League penalties this season (three each).\n'The spirit in the second half was untouchable' - what they said\nTottenham manager Mourinho told BBC Sport: \"We had a great chance by Vinicius. We can analyse the game from the first to the last minute. If you want to be pragmatic - one penalty, one goal, 1-0.\n\"When a team is in a difficult game against Chelsea, you concede that penalty and are affected by it. By the end of the the first half I saw a team that was struggling, but it was totally the opposite in the second half.\n\"We miss a lot of important players but the spirit in the second half is untouchable.\n\"We don't like it [the form] but the way we finished the game gives me positive feelings. It is not that that stops the defensive mistakes but it gives us a difficult smile on the face, to stick together and go tomorrow.\n\"Hopefully, next week, Harry Kane will be back, but not any of the others. We play Sunday against West Brom and they need points as much as us for different reasons.\"\nChelsea boss Tuchel said: \"We are super happy about the result. It was a tough game against a strong opponent but we did very well and controlled the game well.\n\"It was a good first half. In the second half, we lost more of the possession and the distances in the passing were too long.\n\"If you play against a quality team you have to accept there are moments you have to suffer. We defended very actively and brave. We were looking for a second goal desperately as that would have killed the game.\n\"I'm happy with the spirit and the attitude in defending. A very solid team performance and a deserved win.\n\"It's not about my methods. I'm happy with the attitude, the squad, the potential. They are fine guys - it's a nice group and they are open. It's a pleasure to be around them. We have a lot of support in the whole club. It was a quick start but an easy one because I feel very welcome.\"\nOn Silva going off injured: \"I saw Thiago with a big strap around his muscle, but we have to wait.

People talk about that and you fall flat on your face against West Ham.\"\nLacklustre Arsenal\nArsenal once again struggled without their inspirational forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who started on the bench for the second successive game.\nGabon striker Aubameyang has been absent in recent weeks because his mother has been in ill health.\nSince the captain last started for his club, the Gunners have gone out of the FA Cup and taken four points from four games in the league, where they are without a win in three.\nAubameyang came on for the final 30 minutes at Villa Park but, despite a spell of sustained pressure towards the end, Mikel Arteta's side failed to score for the third time in five games.\nAfter scoring against Wolves on Tuesday, Nicolas Pepe wasted two good chances while Martinez saved well from Hector Bellerin. Substitute Martin Odegaard blazed a late chance over the bar.\nThe Gunners, who had two players sent off at Wolves in the previous game, were unhappy when Konsa's first-half foul on Saka did not result in a red card.\nRyan, Arsenal's fourth keeper of the season, recovered from conceding early to produce some good saves but Arteta's side remain anchored in mid-table after a 10th league defeat.\nArteta was frustrated by his side's performance. \"We gave them the goal and another three big chances,\" said the Gunners boss.\n\"We created more than enough openings but when we had to score a goal we didn't find the the right pass or the right shot. We should have won the game comfortably.\"\nDouble joy for Villa - the stats\nAston Villa have completed a league double over Arsenal for the first time since the inaugural Premier League season in 1992-93 under Ron Atkinson.\nArsenal have lost three consecutive league games against Aston Villa without scoring a goal for the first time since August 1920-March 1922.\nOllie Watkins became the first Aston Villa player to score in three consecutive Premier League matches at Villa Park since Darren Bent in November 2011.\nMat Ryan became just the fourth goalkeeper in the competition's history to concede within the opening two minutes of their full Premier League debut for a club, after Gavin Ward (Bolton Wanderers), Ian Bennett (Sheffield United) and Daniele Padelli (Liverpool).\nRyan is the first Australian to appear for Arsenal in a competitive game since John Kosmina against Red Star Belgrade in December 1978 in the Uefa Cup.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams have a full week to prepare for their next Premier League matches. Aston Villa visit Brighton next Saturday (20:00 GMT) and Arsenal host Leeds on Sunday, 14 February (16:30).\nMore to follow\nNothing is unplayable: Disability and the gaming revolution\nEating With My Ex: Can they settle the score and go again?"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 3-2 Southampton: Miguel Almiron inspires hosts to valuable win\nNewcastle held on to beat Southampton despite playing the last 18 minutes with nine men, as Miguel Almiron scored twice for the hosts at a rain-soaked St James' Park.\nThe Magpies remain in 16th but the result may ease some of the pressure on manager Steve Bruce, whose side are now 10 points clear of the bottom three.\nHowever, it was a dismal conclusion to the week for Southampton, who were unable to bounce back from their 9-0 defeat at Manchester United despite Jeff Hendrick's dismissal early in the second half and an injury to Fabian Schar - when the hosts had already made their three substitutions.\n\"We played half an hour with 10 [men], 20 minutes with nine, we know how difficult that is - Southampton shipped in goal after goal the other night,\" Bruce said.\n\"They were terrific in their defending with their attitude and their application to get a result was pretty evident.\n\"I'm never going to say we've turned a corner but I've been pleased over the last month. There have been been signs of improvement. The players are buying into it, so let's hope we can get a few more results along the way.\"\nOn-loan Arsenal midfielder Joe Willock gave the hosts a perfect start, steering in Allan Saint-Maximin's cutback to open the scoring on his debut, before Almiron doubled their lead with a shot that deflected off Saints defender Jan Bednarek.\nThe Paraguay winger then restored Newcastle's two-goal advantage after Takumi Minamino lashed in a brilliant debut goal for Southampton.\nJames Ward-Prowse's wonderful free-kick had given the visitors hope of rescuing a point even before Hendrick was sent off for two bookings, but a resilient Newcastle clung on.\nSouthampton have now lost five consecutive top-flight games for the first time since September 1998.\nReaction to Newcastle v Southampton, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v BBC's Morning Live presenter Gethin Jones\nNewcastle turning a corner?\nAfter a winless run of 11 matches in all competitions, Newcastle appear to be showing signs of a recovery, taking six points from the last nine available.\nManager Bruce will be quietly satisfied by the way in which his side eked out this success.\nHaving used midfielder Isaac Hayden to solve a central defensive crisis, Bruce disbelievingly saw both right-back Javier Manquillo and top scorer Callum Wilson depart with injuries before half-time.\nUntil then his tactics had worked wonderfully well, as the hosts looked to capitalise down their left where Southampton central defender Jack Stephens started in an unfamiliar right-back role.\nAlmiron, who covered more ground than any other Newcastle player (11.29km), and Willock were key to that plan, roaring forward in support of Wilson and Saint-Maximin at every opportunity.\nHad Jonjo Shelvey not missed a great chance from Willock's pass a minute after the break, they may have enjoyed a more comfortable afternoon.\nInstead, it became a rearguard action once Hendrick's tug on Minamino's shirt brought a second yellow card for fouls on the Japan international.\nWith Southampton laying siege to the home goal, keeper Karl Darlow brilliantly blocked Jannik Vestergaard's close-range header to confirm the three points.\nSuffering Saints\nAfter Tuesday's bruising defeat, Southampton's trip to the north-east of England was always going to be a test of character.\nHowever, they made the worst possible start and, at times, Bednarek - who had his red card at Old Trafford rescinded - must have wished his suspension had stood.\nThe Poland defender had already been turned inside out once by Saint-Maximin before the French winger accelerated past him to lay on the opener for Willock.\nFor the second, Bednarek's positioning in front of Alex McCarthy left the goalkeeper with no chance to react when Almiron's effort diverted off him and McCarthy was then at fault for the third with a careless pass.\nSouthampton, who had a Che Adams tap-in correctly ruled out for offside, did show flashes of brilliance.\nBoth Minamino's goal - he ghosted past Hayden before producing a memorable finish - and Ward-Prowse's exquisite free-kick, which found the top left corner, were fit to grace any game.\nAlthough his team controlled possession, manager Ralph Hasenhuttl's expression at the final whistle was almost as gloomy as the conditions.\n\"The story is easy to tell. A horrible start again, conceding goals far too easy and it is always tough to fight back,\" said the Austrian.\n\"We had chances in the second half but not enough to deserve to win. It is good some players are coming back and we must quickly find the reset button.\n\"We are in a tough situation at the moment, but we have to find a way out as quickly as possible.\"\nNewcastle's first-half goal glut\nNewcastle have won two of their past three Premier League games (L1), as many as they had in their previous 13 in the competition (W2 D2 L9).\nThis was the first time Newcastle had scored at least three goals in the first half of a Premier League game since October 2015 v Norwich. The Magpies netted their three goals from just four shots on target.\nSouthampton's James Ward-Prowse has scored four direct free-kick goals in the Premier League this season - only David Beckham (five in 2000-01) and Laurent Robert (five in 2001-02) have ever scored more in a single campaign in the competition.\nWard-Prowse became the ninth player to reach double figures for direct free-kick goals in Premier League history. 37% of his Premier League goals have been from direct free-kicks (10/27) - only Seb Larsson has scored a higher ratio among players with 25+ goals in the competition (42% - 11/26).\nNewcastle's Miguel Almiron has scored four goals in his past 12 Premier League games, as many as he had in his previous 55 in the competition.\nJoe Willock became the 11th different player to score on their Premier League debut for Newcastle, and the third to do so this season after Jeff Hendrick and Callum Wilson. His opener was his second Premier League goal, with his other strike also coming against Southampton in a 2-0 victory for Arsenal last season.\nTakumi Minamino became the first player to score on his Premier League debut for Southampton since Jan Bednarek in April 2018. He netted just 30 minutes into his Saints debut, after scoring just one goal in 531 minutes of league action for Liverpool.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea in their next Premier League match on Monday, 15 February (20:00 GMT).\nSouthampton travel to Molineux to play Wolves in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Thursday (17:30 GMT) before welcoming the same opponents to St Mary's in the Premier League on Sunday, 14 February (12:00 GMT).\nNothing is unplayable: Disability and the gaming revolution\nEating With My Ex: Can they settle the score and go again?"

In the end it's a good point for us and we're happy with that.\n\"Our goalkeeper did really well. He's helped us out a lot. He made some saves and helped us out aerially with the balls they put into the box.\n\"Burnley did well in the second half. They hit their forwards well, pick those second balls up and attack well. We're happy with the point - it keeps us moving forward and we move on to the next one.\n\"We've had seven points this week - we have to be delighted with that. We're in good form, but we have to carry on.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche told BBC Sport: \"First half I thought we were not a million miles away.\n\"Second half I felt we had a bit more belief in what we were doing. First half I felt we were waiting for things to happen but in the second half we were making things happen.\n\"I thought our approach play in the second half was excellent. I talk about framework and freedom. You need a defensive framework but you need freedom as well and I felt we showed that in the second half.\n\"I thought there were a number of good performances. I thought we were terrific in the second half. We are not too greedy and we have come a long way since the first eight games. I was pleased with the mentality and the quality today.\"\nWhat next?\nBoth sides turn their attention to the fifth round of the FA Cup as Burnley host Championship Bournemouth on Tuesday, 9 February (17:30 GMT) before Brighton visit Leicester on Wednesday, 10 February (19:30).\nNothing is unplayable: Disability and the gaming revolution\nEating With My Ex: Can they settle the score and go again?"

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-0 West Ham: Tomas Soucek sent off as Hammers miss chance to go fourth in Premier League\nWest Ham manager David Moyes called referee Mike Dean's decision to send off Tomas Soucek \"embarrassing\" as the Hammers drew with Fulham - and missed a chance to move into the top four of the Premier League.\nThe Hammers ended with 10 men as Soucek was shown a straight red card for elbowing Aleksandar Mitrovic in injury time.\nAs the pair jostled for position at a free-kick, Soucek raised his elbow and caught the Fulham striker in an incident that looked accidental.\nHowever, following a lengthy video assistant referee check, Dean was advised to check the incident himself, with VAR official Lee Mason telling Dean to look at Soucek's \"clenched fist\".\nDean, taking a few minutes to make his decision, repeatedly watched the incident on the pitchside monitor and eventually sent him off for violent conduct.\n\"I'm embarrassed for whoever has done VAR and I'm a bit embarrassed for Mike Dean - the level of referee he is, to make that decision,\" said Moyes.\nFulham v West Ham as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nLawro's predictions v BBC's Morning Live presenter Gethin Jones\n\"It was obvious to everyone it was accidental. He [Dean] obviously didn't see it and looked at the screen and I'm really embarrassed he chose to send him off.\n\"We want them to get the decisions right. I find it really difficult that someone back at Stockley Park [where the VAR officials are based] would not say 'this is accidental, let's get on with it'.\n\"It has come down to a poor refereeing decision and a poor VAR Stockley Park decision and we can't do much about it.\n\"It's unfair to the boy. I'm sure they will come up with enough excuses to justify the reason for sending him off.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker agreed that Soucek, who will miss an FA Cup game against Manchester United and Premier League matches against Sheffield United and Tottenham, did not deserve to be dismissed.\n\"It probably was a bit harsh and the game is becoming very sterile,\" said Parker. \"I don't think it was a sending off but that's the way the game is going.\"\nIn a quiet first half, both sides only managed one shot on target each - the visitors' Declan Rice having an effort saved by Alphonse Areola and Ivan Cavaleiro heading tamely at Lukasz Fabianski for the hosts.\nWest Ham's Vladimir Coufal then headed against the crossbar from Rice's cross from the left.\nTosin Adarabioyo could have given Fulham all three points but narrowly headed over from eight yards out as neither side could make the breakthrough.\nWest Ham would have gone above Liverpool with victory, but stay fifth, one point behind last season's champions, who host league leaders Manchester City on Sunday.\nFulham have now not won in 14 matches in all competitions, since a 2-1 victory at Leicester City on 30 November, and remain 18th - in the relegation zone.\n'Worst decision ever' - Wright\nDiscussing the Soucek red card on Match of the Day, former England striker Ian Wright said: \"The amount of times Mike Dean had to have a look at it.\n\"You have debates about the best goals, but there is no debate here - this is the worst decision I've ever seen. He is trying to move his arm.\"\nEx-Aston Villa striker Dion Dublin, also speaking on Match of the Day, added: \"Mike Dean will be embarrassed - the decision is shocking. Soucek was trying to move his arm over the top of Mitrovic and stop him holding him.\"\nHowever, former Blackburn forward Chris Sutton, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, said: \"I don't think Mike Dean is left with any choice. What does he do if he doesn't send him off?\n\"I think it was accidental, but whether or not it was accidental it was dangerous.\n\"Mitrovic did get caught. Can we have a go at Mitrovic for going down? I think Soucek caught him fairly strongly. I think the red card will stick.\"\nEurope-chasing West Ham may be happy with a point\nWest Ham came into this match in a great run of form with seven wins in their past eight - and that one defeat was against Liverpool.\nAlthough Fulham had the greater share of possession, the best chance fell to Coufal, but the woodwork denied the Czech defender his first goal for the club.\nHis countryman Soucek, looking for his ninth Hammers goal of the season, should have done better when he met Jesse Lingard's cross but could not keep his header down.\nHowever, it has still been a great campaign so far for West Ham, who finished 16th in 2020-21, but are hoping to qualify for European competition for the first time since they finished seventh in 2015-16 under Slaven Bilic.\nIn the end, West Ham were hanging on and may regard this a decent point.\nFulham substitute Mitrovic shot wide late on, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek also missing two chances in the last five minutes for the hosts.\nFulham's lack of ruthlessness shows again\nFulham began the day eight points adrift of Burnley and Newcastle, although Burnley drew 1-1 against Brighton and nine-man Newcastle beat Southampton 3-2 to increase the pressure on Scott Parker's side.\nBut this latest draw keeps the Cottagers eight points from 17th and in grave danger of making an instant return to the Championship after winning the play-offs to get promoted last season.\nWhen these sides met in November, West Ham won 1-0, but Fulham missed a glorious chance to equalise in injury time as Ademola Lookman's weak chipped 'Panenka' penalty was easily saved by Fabianski.\nLookman was one of Fulham's positives in a quiet first half at Craven Cottage as he twice created space for chances, but could not hit the target.\nFulham started the second half brightly as Bobby Decordova-Reid volleyed over and Loftus-Cheek, when played in by Lookman, shot into the side netting.\nBut once again Fulham's lack of ruthlessness in front of goal cost them as Adarabioyo headed just over and Cavaleiro missed the target when unmarked.\nManager Parker handed a late debut to striker Josh Maja, signed on loan from Bordeaux on transfer deadline day, and also brought on Mitrovic in an attempt to get what would have been only their third league win of the season.\nThey had chances too, but Mitrovic and Loftus-Cheek failed to take the opportunities on another frustrating day for the Cottagers.\nAnother London derby without a win for Fulham - the stats\nFulham have failed to win any of their past four league games against West Ham (D1 L3), failing to score in three of those matches.\nFulham are winless in their past 20 Premier League London derbies (D3 L17), with only Crystal Palace having a longer such run in English top-flight history (31 between August 1969 and March 1973). However, this was the first time the Cottagers have kept a clean sheet in a Premier League London derby since March 2013 (1-0 vs Tottenham), having conceded in each of their previous 28 such matches.\nNo side has played out more goalless draws in the Premier League this season than Fulham (four - level with Manchester United).\nWest Ham have won as many points this season in 23 games as they did in the entirety of 2019-20 (39).\nOnly Burnley (12) have failed to score in more Premier League games than Fulham (11) this season.\nThere were just three shots on target in this game, two for Fulham and one for West Ham, the joint-lowest tally in a Premier League game this season (level with three other games).\nFulham (D8 L4) have gone 12 league games without a victory for the first time since April-September 2014, while it is their longest such run solely in the top flight since November 2007-January 2008 (a run of 12).\nWest Ham's Jarrod Bowen (19) has been substituted on more occasions than any other player in the Premier League this season, whilst team-mate Andriy Yarmolenko (13) has made the most appearances from the bench in the competition this campaign.\n'From start to finish we were superb' - what they said\nFulham boss Scott Parker told Match of the Day: \"It's a tough one to take because I felt from start to finish we were superb.\n\"We had 20-odd shots and our finishing was probably the deciding factor. We caused them loads of problems. The players executed the plan superbly - we were a real threat.\n\"We know what the difference is at this level. This is a group of players working tirelessly and I saw that today.\n\"We need to get that win, we need something to drop for us.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes told Match of the Day: \"We didn't play as well as we have been - sometimes the games can catch up on you quickly.\n\"Fulham were the better team - we cant deny that. I don't think the quality of our play was right from the start. Several things didn't work from the start.\"\nWhat's next?\nFulham have a week without a match as they do not play again until Sunday, 14 February when they are at Everton in the Premier League (19:00 GMT).\nWest Ham play at Manchester United in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Tuesday (19:30), before returning to league action on Monday, 15 February as Sheffield United are at London Stadium (18:00).\nNothing is unplayable: Disability and the gaming revolution\nEating With My Ex: Can they settle the score and go again?"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 3-3 Everton: Dominic Calvert-Lewin scores late goal to deny hosts\nDominic Calvert-Lewin secured a dramatic point for Everton in the fifth minute of stoppage time as they twice came from behind to hold Manchester United in a six-goal thriller at Old Trafford.\nOn the 63rd anniversary of the Munich air disaster, Scott McTominay's header seemed to have sealed a victory that would have taken United level on points with Manchester City at the top of the Premier League.\nHowever, after they had already responded superbly to falling two behind before half-time on Saturday, Everton refused to buckle.\nAnd, as United grew increasingly desperate, Calvert-Lewin took advantage of weak defending from a Lucas Digne free-kick to stab in from close range.\nUnited are now two points behind league leaders City and have also played two games more than their neighbours.\nSpeaking about the situation at the top of the table, boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told Sky Sports: \"We're not talking about winning titles.\n\"We've come a long way. We shouldn't be considered as title chasers. That's one for you [media]. We've got better as a team - let's see where we end up.\"\nSolskjaer's side only had themselves to blame for failing to secure maximum points. Excellent first-half efforts from Edinson Cavani and Bruno Fernandes should have been the prelude to a comfortable second period.\nBut goalkeeper David de Gea's mistake gifted Abdoulaye Doucoure a goal four minutes after the restart and, on the visitors' next attack, James Rodriguez rifled home the equaliser before McTominay's header was cancelled out by Calvert-Lewin's late intervention.\nReaction to Man Utd's draw with Everton, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League matches\nLawro's predictions v BBC's Morning Live presenter Gethin Jones\nFernandes' brilliant effort in vain\nGiven the poignancy of the day, it was fitting one of the four academy graduates in the United line-up should play a significant role in the opener.\nMarcus Rashford has represented the Old Trafford club in the best way possible off the field during lockdown but it should never be forgotten what an excellent player the 23-year-old forward is.\nHis cross, from the right side of the box to the far post, dropped perfectly over Michael Keane for Cavani, who had used all his game intelligence to give himself the space required to finish.\nFernandes' superb second brought back memories of Eric Cantona's audacious chip against Sunderland in 1996 - the Portugal midfielder taking his time, after Tom Davies had misread his intentions, before lifting the ball over Robin Olsen from the edge of the area, even though the Everton keeper was only a couple of yards off his line.\nIs Bruno Fernandes the best ever January signing?\nFrom his seat in the directors' box, Sir Alex Ferguson must have been impressed. And the character United showed to respond to Everton's fightback after the break would no doubt have pleased their former manager too, although questions will be asked of Olsen, who failed to keep out McTominay's header from Luke Shaw's deep free-kick.\nSadly for Ferguson, the ending was reminiscent of a 4-4 draw between these two teams at this ground in 2012 - a costly result as they were pipped to the title by City on goal difference.\nAs good as a win for Ancelotti\nAlthough Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti did not become the second manager after Tottenham's Jose Mourinho to win at Old Trafford with three different teams, after previous successes with AC Milan and Chelsea, the manner of the draw must feel like a victory for the Italian.\nCalvert-Lewin had already given notice of the Toffees' battling qualities when he failed to take a good chance at the end of the first half and the visitors showed no sign of inferiority when they came out with a clear sense of purpose after the break.\nThey would have known also that United have lost six times at home already this season, winning consecutive games only twice and - Wednesday's 9-0 hammering of Southampton apart - are in an inconsistent run of form that has returned just nine points from their past six matches.\nOn his first appearance at Old Trafford, Rodriguez made life difficult for the hosts and the Colombian's sweet strike for the equaliser gave De Gea no chance.\nHowever, the Spain keeper had already given Everton a helping hand by pushing Calvert-Lewin's weak cross straight to Doucoure when he appeared to have a number of alternative options.\nJudging by this performance, Calvert-Lewin is certainly getting his early-season confidence back.\nThe England forward has now scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since the beginning of October, taking his tally to 13, the same as Fernandes and two behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah.\n'The last kick of the ball kicks us in the teeth' - what they said\nManchester United manager Solskjaer told BBC Sport: \"We deserved to win the game but that is football for you. You have to take your chances and cannot concede with every shot.\n\"In the first half, I did not feel we played particularly well but we scored two fantastic goals. You go in at the break 2-0 up feeling we have not hit where we could do. After 2-2, we played really well then the last kick of the ball kicks us in the teeth and we go home disappointed.\n\"We have to focus on improving as a team. We are scoring more goals, creating chances and felt we dominated the game and should have won it. The fans can see we are a team that is trying to go for it. Even at 3-2 up we wanted to get the fourth.\"\nEverton boss Ancelotti speaking to BBC Sport: \"Wow, what a game. It was fantastic emotion. What can I say?\nEven if we were shy in the first half, we played with more courage in the second half. We attacked and pressed forward. At the end, we deserved to have a point.\n\"The first half we started well and were in good control. Instead of passing forward we passed backward. Play with more courage, I told the players. That is what they did second half.\n\"[James] Rodriguez had a problem at the end of the first half with a tight calf. But he said he wanted to try and after that he was tired. It was a risk but I was confident in him.\n\"It was like a win but it is just one point, We competed against one of the best in the Premier League. We are not at the same level but we can fight and compete with our qualities. I am proud of my team.\"\nUnited's defensive lapses - the stats\nThis was just the fourth time Manchester United led a Premier League home game by at least two goals and failed to win, with Everton responsible for the past two occasions (also 4-4 in April 2012).\nUnited have conceded 18 goals in 12 home league games this season, one more than they did in the whole of last season at Old Trafford.\nEverton scored with all three of their shots on target, while Manchester United found the net with three of their five attempts on target.\nFour of Cavani's six Premier League goals for Manchester United have been headers, with only Calvert-Lewin scoring more headed goals in the competition this season (five).\nSince his debut in the Premier League, only Liverpool's Salah (22) has scored more Premier League goals than United's Fernandes (21). Meanwhile, only Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse (five) has scored more goals from outside the box than the Portuguese's four.\nUnited midfielder McTominay has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time, with the Scotland international netting four goals in his past five league games at Old Trafford.\nShaw has assisted three goals in his past two Premier League games for United, as many as in his previous 48.\nEverton's Doucoure scored more Premier League goals against Manchester United (three) than he has against any other team.\nRodriguez has been involved in 12 goals for Everton this season (five goals, seven assists), with his strike on Saturday his first goal or assist away from Goodison Park.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United entertain West Ham in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Tuesday (19:30 GMT kick-off) before visiting West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on 14 February (14:00).\nEverton also have a home FA Cup tie, against Tottenham on Wednesday (20:15), then host Fulham in the league next Sunday (19:15).\nNothing is unplayable: Disability and the gaming revolution\nEating With My Ex: Can they settle the score and go again?"

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 West Bromwich Albion: Harry Kane scores on return\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho says Harry Kane will break \"every possible record\" after returning from injury to inspire Spurs to victory over West Brom.\nKane returned ahead of schedule from ankle problems to help end Spurs' three-game losing streak, with his 208th Tottenham goal drawing the England captain level alongside Bobby Smith and behind only Jimmy Greaves in Spurs' all-time scoring list.\nTottenham had failed to score in both matches Kane, 27, had missed but he took Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's through ball into his stride to slot home and break stubborn Albion's rearguard resistance early in the second half.\n\"Harry Kane is a special player in the history of the club,\" Mourinho told BT Sport.\nFollow reaction to Tottenham v West Brom and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\n\"He is one of the best strikers in the world. The team depends a lot on him, we can't hide that.\n\"It's the goals he can score, the assists he can make, the link play he has, that personality that players like that can have and he is always an important influence for us.\"\nKane's goal was his 13th in the Premier League this season, taking him ahead of strike partner Son Heung-min for all of four minutes until the South Korea striker sealed Spurs' victory with an emphatic finish from Lucas Moura's pass.\nVictory moved Spurs up two places to seventh, four points off the Champions League places, although that position and gap could change later on Sunday with Chelsea and Liverpool in action.\nWest Brom remain 19th and 11 points behind 17th-placed Burnley despite an improved defensive display.\nRecent loan signing Mbaye Diagne was unlucky not to register his first Baggies goal on three occasions. The Senegal striker's first-half header forced a fine save from Spurs skipper Hugo Lloris and he also saw two second-half finishes ruled out for offside.\nKane in the record books\nTottenham: Joint second on 208 goals, alongside Bobby Smith - 58 behind Jimmy Greaves (266)\nPremier League: Ninth on 156 goals - 104 behind Alan Shearer (260)\nEngland: Sixth on 32 goals - 21 behind Wayne Rooney (53)\nKane's goal against West Brom was his 20th in all competitions for Spurs this campaign, a milestone he has passed in his past seven seasons - if he keeps up his scoring rate and, of course, stays at Spurs, he could be on course to break Greaves' record by the time he turns 30.\nOf the eight forwards above Kane on the all-time list of leading Premier League marksmen, only Sergio Aguero (180) is an active player, while none of the five strikers ahead of him on the England charts are still playing.\nKane and able - Harry's return kick-starts Spurs\nLeading into Sunday's game, both teams appeared to be in varying degrees of disarray. Two months ago, Spurs topped the Premier League but had dropped to ninth, seven points off the top four, while a bedraggled West Brom had fallen increasingly adrift from safety.\nFrom minute one, Kane's return clearly boosted the hosts who, as they have historically done, boasted a far greater cutting edge with him than they had during the two games he missed.\nSince the 27-year-old became a Spurs regular in the 2014-15 season, Tottenham have won 56% of Premier League games when he has been available but just 41% without him. Their average goals-per-game figure drops from 1.9 to 1.2 with him out of the side.\nThose discrepancies have been magnified even further during Mourinho's reign - Spurs' win ratio in the league has dropped from 51.4% with him in the team to 30% without, losing five of the 10 matches he has missed, while both points and goals per game slip from 1.8 to 1.1.\nWhile the limitations of the opposition are a factor that should be taken into account, Spurs looked a different side with their talismanic forward, enjoying more touches in the opposition box in the first half (15) than they did in the entirety of Thursday's dour 1-0 defeat by Chelsea.\nKane could have had a first-half hat-trick but his finishing was atypically wasteful, lashing one chance on to the stanchion behind the goal and dragging another wide before finally forcing a near-post save from Sam Johnstone.\nHe made amends by holding his run perfectly to avoid being flagged offside for his coolly taken opener and, having set up Son for an earlier chance that Johnstone saved well with his legs, also played a part in the swift break that ended with the South Korean drilling home the second.\nKane continues to underline his importance to a Tottenham side who really do appear lost without him, with Son stressing the impact his fellow striker's return had made on both he and the team.\n\"Harry Kane is so, so important for us. It was only a couple of games but we missed him a lot. Him coming back and scoring straight away, it's what we needed. I missed him,\" said Son.\nStill no joy against Mourinho for Allardyce\nWest Brom boss Sam Allardyce relegated in-form playmaker Matheus Pereira to the bench in a bid to shore up Albion and cure the defensive ailments that have plagued their campaign, having conceded a mammoth 54 goals in 22 games.\nIt worked to an extent as Albion frustrated their hosts for long spells but they were still reliant on Kane's first-half wastefulness, as well as a smart save from Johnstone to thwart Serge Aurier's far-post header.\nHad they displayed this sort of defensive fortitude in previous games, West Brom might not be in the desperate position in which they find themselves.\nThree apparent opportunities fell to on-loan Galatasaray forward Diagne. However, the two that he stuck away - a close-range header and a prodded finish - were both scored from offside positions, whereas when he did stay the right side of the Tottenham defensive line he headed too close to Lloris, who still did well to save down low.\nUltimately, West Brom were undone by Spurs' quality in the opening 15 minutes of the second half and it was another defeat for Allardyce against Mourinho, who he has never beaten in 13 attempts - three draws and 10 losses.\nAllardyce will be heartened by the impact of several transfer-window signings - Diagne's liveliness suggested he will score goals at this level, Robert Snodgrass delivered good crosses and Ainsley Maitland-Niles made an assured, if understated, debut.\nBut after just one win in 13 games, and with the teams above the relegation zone continuing to regularly collect points, the Baggies will need a miraculous turnaround to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.\n'That lapse can't happen' - what they said\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Sport: \"I'm not used to losing three matches in a row and Tottenham is the same, so we have to admit that it was not a week where we felt very, very comfortable, but I was very positive because of what the players showed in this game. I knew that they would.\n\"I think we played very well but I'm speaking about the mentality the players brought to the game.\n\"The players are together, the players want to win, they are committed and today they went to the pitch only with one thing in their mind and that was to win the game. This was the thing that pleases me more, the way the players approached it.\"\nWest Brom boss Sam Allardyce told BBC Sport: \"The downside is letting the goals in after containing them in the first half. Seeing Harry Kane in our box unmarked. That lapse at this level just can't happen. We should be stopping that at source.\n\"Then we let them go from their box to our box without putting a mark on anyone. We scored, it got disallowed, we scored again and that was disallowed but at least we scored two 'goals' here. If we get the right service in the box we've got a man who can score.\n\"Until we shut the back door, better life is going to be difficult for us. This is it now, the window is shut, we've got what we've got. We've got to start winning games and we won't do that by keeping on losing. We need an undefeated run with more wins than draws in it.\"\nMore Sunday sorrow for Baggies - the stats\nWest Brom have failed to win any of their past eight Premier League games on Sunday, losing seven times.\nTottenham have lost just one of their past 27 Premier League home games against promoted clubs (W24 D2), going down 3-1 against Wolves in December 2018.\nOnly in 2016-17 (14) has Tottenham's Son Heung-min scored more goals in a single Premier League campaign than the 13 he has netted already this season.\nSpurs' Harry Kane has now scored in 13 of his past 15 Premier League appearances against newly promoted opposition (14 goals) including each of the past six - the first player to manage that since Mohamed Salah between January and December 2018.\nOnly Callum Wilson (40%) and Dominic Calvert-Lewin (38%) have scored a higher portion of their team's Premier League goals this season than Spurs duo Kane and Son, who have both netted 13 each (13/36 each - 36%).\nSubstitute Dane Scarlett (16y & 320d) became Tottenham's youngest player to make an appearance in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham visit Everton in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday (20:15 GMT) before travelling to leaders Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday (17:30 GMT).\nWest Bromwich Albion host Manchester United in the Premier League next Sunday (14:00 GMT).\nThe NFL Show: What can we expect from tonight's showdown?\nSuper Bowl Snacks: Here's some US classics that will keep you fuelled all night"

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-2 Leicester City: Foxes strengthen top-four push with comfortable victory\nLeicester strengthened their position in the Premier League's top four with victory over Fulham, whose survival hopes suffered a further blow at Craven Cottage.\nJames Maddison played a key role in both the visitors' goals, delivering a delightful in-swinging cross for Kelechi Iheanacho to head home before teeing up James Justin to double the Foxes' lead on the stroke of half-time.\nBrendan Rodgers' side had three goals disallowed - Caglar Soyuncu's first-half header was ruled out for a push on Tosin Adarabioyo before Iheanacho and Ricardo Pereira were denied by the linesman's flag in the second half.\nFulham had chances too - notably when Adarabioyo's header was palmed over the crossbar by Kasper Schmeichel moments before the visitors' second goal.\nThat header, however, was the Cottagers' only effort on target in the entire 90 minutes.\nThe result lifts Leicester two points behind second-placed Manchester United, while Fulham remain seven points adrift of safety in 18th.\nListen to reaction in the Football Daily podcast\nMaddison the key for Leicester\nRodgers admitted his team \"weren't good enough\" in Sunday's defeat by Leeds United - a result that saw them miss the chance to move two points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nThe Foxes were without injured defenders Timothy Castagne and Wesley Fofana at Craven Cottage, while key duo Wilfred Ndidi and Jamie Vardy are only set to return against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday.\nLeicester had earned just one point from their past four league fixtures without Vardy, while winning only six of their 22 league matches without Ndidi since the Nigerian's debut in January 2017.\nHowever, two superb assists from Maddison steered the Foxes to victory in west London.\nThe 24-year-old's teasing delivery from the right gave Iheanacho the simple task of directing a close-range header past Areola, while he showed great composure to tee up Justin for the visitors' crucial second goal.\nThe former Norwich City man has now been directly involved in 12 goals in his past 12 appearances in all competitions for the Foxes.\n\"He's got immense quality,\" Rodgers said. \"The cross that comes in [for the first goal], if it was Kevin de Bruyne everyone would be talking about it. It was an unbelievable cross.\n\"He's created lots of moments for the team [and showed] great skill on the edge of the box for the second goal.

Their quality in the final third was evident.\n\"There's still 17 games left. I understand what the perception will be, but we have a team here that have been in games. We know what we need to do and there needs to be a clear focus on that.\"\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was important for us to respond, that's how you define your team in terms of setbacks. I thought we were excellent and scored two outstanding goals. We showed real moments of quality.\n\"I think the team is maturing - it's hard physically for players this season. We had one shot against us all night which shows the concentration. Second half we controlled it and stayed calm.\n\"The culture we have created is an environment where we ask the players to be courageous.

        "article_text": "Liverpool 1-4 Man City: Alisson errors help send leaders five points clear\nManchester City took a potentially decisive hold on the Premier League title race as they thrashed Liverpool at Anfield - helped by a virtuoso performance by Phil Foden and a nightmare display from the champions' goalkeeper Alisson.\nCity's comprehensive triumph, their first at Anfield since 2003 and Pep Guardiola's first away to Liverpool as a manager, was achieved in such comfort that they were able to recover from Ilkay Gundogan's first-half penalty miss.\nGundogan, who skied his spot-kick after Fabinho fouled Raheem Sterling, made amends when he put City ahead four minutes into the second period, after Alisson could only push out Foden's shot.\nMohamed Salah equalised for Liverpool from the spot just after the hour after he was hauled back by Ruben Dias - but then came the combination of Alisson's errors and Foden's genius as the hosts were run ragged.\nAlisson was punished for two poor clearances as Foden set up Gundogan to put City back in front after 73 minutes, then three minutes later the Brazil keeper inexplicably sent a pass straight to Bernardo Silva, whose clever cross was headed in almost on the goalline by Sterling.\nCity saved the best until last when Foden, the game's outstanding performer and watched by England manager Gareth Southgatei, thundered a magnificent finish high past the beleaguered Alisson seven minutes from time.\nThe emphatic victory leaves City five points ahead of second-placed Manchester United, having played a game less - and 10 points ahead of Liverpool with a match in hand.\nOnly Man City collapse will stop title win now, but I don't see them cracking - Shearer analysis\n'Too soon to talk of crisis, but champions on worrying slide'\nFoden a 'huge talent' but can 'still improve' - Guardiola\nPayback time for Guardiola and Man City\nManchester City and Guardiola have had some miserable days and nights at Anfield since Jurgen Klopp became Liverpool manager - this was the game, the performance and the scoreline that made this almost the perfect day.\nGuardiola's incendiary reaction to Gundogan's first-half penalty miss demonstrated how much he wanted to win this game and perhaps how he feared history repeating itself. But his frustration was short-lived as City produced a second-half masterclass that left the champions badly beaten.\nAnd while the Reds will point to their collection of injuries as a reason for their fall from grace, it should also be pointed out that City were missing the brilliance of midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and the predatory instincts of striker Sergio Aguero.\nIt was only a rare error from Dias that gave Liverpool hope - although Sadio Mane headed over in the first half and Ederson saved well from Roberto Firmino - and once Gudogan restored City's advantage there was only one winner here.\nAt the heart of it all was the brilliant Foden, head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch and flourishing even more when Guardiola cleverly removed Riyad Mahrez and placed the 20-year-old England international on the right flank.\nHe made two goals and scored a sensational fourth as City put down a marker and confirmed their status as the team to beat in the title race. It was also a 14th straight win, which equals the all-time winning run by an English top-flight team, shared with Preston in 1892 and Arsenal in 1987.\nCity have been growing in stature in recent weeks, imperious in defence and threatening in attack - but this ruthless dismissal of an opponent that has haunted them at Anfield in the recent past is their most powerful statement of intent yet.\nAlisson sums up Liverpool despair\nThe sight of Liverpool keeper Alisson slumping in dejection after Foden's shot tore past him into the roof of the net - he could barely have seen it - for Manchester City's fourth goal summed up the sheer misery of the champions.\nAs Liverpool have won Premier League and Champions League titles, the 28-year-old Brazilian has been one of their most reliable figures, a game-changer to place alongside the arrival of defender Virgil van Dijk.\nHowever, he suffered arguably the biggest nightmare of his Liverpool career on Sunday, making two bad clearances in the build-up to City's crucial second goal, then compounding it with an even worse error as he picked out Silva standing all on his own with an inexplicable pass, the Portuguese accepting the invitation to set up Sterling.\nLiverpool showed occasional flashes of the old flair in the first half but ended up outclassed and on the receiving end of their third successive Premier League home loss, City following in the footsteps of Burnley - who ended the Reds' 68-match unbeaten league run at Anfield - and Brighton.\nIn reality, it was City - so organised, composed and determined to press Liverpool - who were vastly superior over the whole piece.\nOf course, Liverpool injuries will take a heavy toll, but this was a tough 90 minutes for midfielder Thiago Alcantara, who is struggling to adapt to the pace of the Premier League and made life difficult for himself with a needless early foul on Gundogan that brought a yellow card.\nAnd while much is rightly made of the attacking prowess of full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, they struggled to cope with City's width as Sterling and Foden exposed them brutally at times.\nLiverpool look very flat at Anfield and the stats say it all. They are the first side to lose three straight home matches the season after winning the title since Chelsea in March 1956 and have 27 points fewer than they did at the same stage last season - the biggest drop by any reigning champions in top-flight history.\nKlopp clearly felt this was not the day to risk his deadline-day centre-back signings Ben Davies and Ozan Kabak, but they still looked horribly vulnerable.\nLiverpool's manager and their players have enjoyed some triumphant days against City here in recent seasons - this was not one of them.\n'Two massive mistakes and a genius' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Klopp told BBC Sport: \"I saw a really good game and big mistakes. In each game, when you make these kind of mistakes, it's very likely you concede goals.\n\"It's easy to agree that the first half was a really good game, two sides really trying a lot to cause problems for each other, and I liked a lot I saw in the game.\n\"Coming out in the second half, they changed the system and we didn't move enough in midfield. We scored our goal and in that moment it was possible the game goes in our direction, but Alisson made two massive mistakes, gave two goals away - and then a genius situation from Phil Foden.\n\"The confidence could have suffered after the last game but tonight I saw a very confident team, if I'm honest. I liked the football we played. It's very difficult to explain that we lost 4-1.\"\nManchester City boss Guardiola told BBC Sport: \"I have a lot of emotions, many things happening in the game. Gundogan missed a penalty - it's like a routine against them - but we started really, really well, doing what we want to do.\n\"In the second half, the way we reacted to the goal, the way we played with quality, made the difference.\n\"For many years we were not able to win here. Hopefully next time we can do it with people. Anfield is so intimidating.\"\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, he added: \"It is an important win, but it is February. Of course, the gap to fifth is big right now and [qualifying] for the Champions League next season is important - but 10 wins in a row in this period is something exceptional.\"\nMan City not on the spot but Foden shining amongst youngsters - the stats\nFour of the past six penalties to have missed the target completely in the Premier League have been by Manchester City players, with three of those coming against Liverpool (Mahrez in October 2018, De Bruyne in November 2020 and Gundogan on Sunday).\nIn comparison, Liverpool have converted their last 19 Premier League penalties, with Salah scoring 13 of those.\nCity's Sterling won his 21st penalty in the Premier League - more than any other player in the history of the competition.\nSterling is only the third player to score 100 or more goals under Guardiola, after Barcelona's Lionel Messi (211) and City team-mate Aguero (120).\nOf all players to score at least 10 goals within the top five European leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) this season, only Borussia Dortmund's Erling Braut Haaland (20 years 2021 days) is younger than Manchester City's Foden (20 years 255 days).\nSince netting his first goal of the season on 15 December, City's Ilkay Gundogan has scored at least three more Premier League goals than any other player (nine).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool visit third-placed Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday (12:30 GMT kick-off). Manchester City travel to Championship side Swansea City in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday (17:30) and then host Tottenham Hotspur in the league on Saturday (17:30).\nThe NFL Show: What can we expect from tonight's showdown?\nSuper Bowl Snacks: Here's some US classics that will keep you fuelled all night"

We have to follow up and not lose any intensity or determination.\"\nRelive Monday night's Premier League action\nFootball Daily podcast: Tuchel's triumph and Wilder's woes\n1,000 minutes, 31 attempts, 14 games\nWerner came into this match having not scored in the league since a 4-1 win against bottom side Sheffield United on 7 November.\nHe had chances within the opening half an hour with the best coming from Marcos Alonso's header which Werner poked wide.\nIt threatened to be a similar story for Werner, who has been creative for Chelsea this season but has failed to deliver goals following a high-profile move from RB Leipzig in the summer.\nBut after taking a whack in the face from Newcastle defender Jamal Lewis and running off to receive treatment, Werner returned to the pitch to provide a cross that ultimately came to Giroud to coolly thump into the net, and the German added Chelsea's second from a corner before half-time.\nIt was Werner's first goal in exactly 1,000 minutes of Premier League action for Chelsea and ended a run of 31 attempts without scoring - he even had to wait for a video assistant referee decision before being allowed to celebrate properly, which he did with a relieved smile.\nHis performance capped off another positive result for Chelsea under new boss Thomas Tuchel, who handed a start to out-of-favour goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and came through unscathed.\nIt was Arrizabalaga's first league start since a 3-3 draw with Southampton on 17 October after losing his position under former manager Frank Lampard.\nThe Blues have now picked up 13 points from a possible 15 under the new leadership, winning four successive league matches in a row for the first time since November 2019.\nTuchel described it as \"the perfect evening\" but admitted Abraham's injury was \"serious enough he had to go out and we worry about him\".\nNewcastle struggle to compete\nNewcastle had picked up two wins from their previous three league matches after a burst in form but they struggled to compete with an in-form Chelsea side at Stamford Bridge.\nAbraham's injury, as a result of Jamaal Lascelles' strong recovery tackle in the box, saw the introduction of Giroud, who has enjoyed playing Newcastle and scored his ninth goal against them in the league.\nWerner caused the defence problems too, and when Newcastle were able to get on the ball creative players Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin were short of options.\nNewcastle did ride a wave of pressure in the second half as Reece James, Werner and Mason Mount all came close to adding to Chelsea's tally.\nBut the visitors' best chance - Joe Willock's header which was scrambled away by Arrizabalaga - did not come until the 74th minute, when Chelsea were in complete control.\nAlmiron drilled another effort wide minutes later and Newcastle had all four of their shots on target after the break but they never really threatened to get into game.\n'The perfect evening' - what they said\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel to BBC Sport: \"It was a very good night, the perfect evening. We knew we had the opportunity to jump into the top four. We took this chance.\n\"Now we've made this big step today we have to follow up and not lose any intensity or determination.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce to BBC Sport: \"We were excellent in the second half and in the first half we found it very difficult. The way they played, the system they had, the two inside forwards - we didn't deal with it well enough.\n\"Second half we got to grips with it and we were more aggressive - a lot of positives. First half was very difficult for us.\"\nTuchel emulates Mourinho - the best of the stats\nNewcastle have lost six of their last seven away Premier League games after losing just one of the six before that.\nChelsea have won eight consecutive home top-flight matches against an opponent (Newcastle) for the first time since winning nine in a row against West Brom between 1984 and 2013.\nTuchel has picked up 13 points from his first five Premier League games in charge of Chelsea (W4 D1), level with Jose Mourinho's first five with the club and bettered only by Carlo Ancelotti and Maurizio Sarri (15 pts each).\nHe is just the third manager to see his team concede just one goal in his first five games as a boss in the Premier League, after Mourinho with Chelsea and Peter Taylor with Leicester.\nIn his 100th Premier League appearance as a substitute, Giroud scored his 21st goal in the competition from the bench, with only Jermain Defoe netting more (24).\nArrizabalaga kept his first Premier League clean sheet in five appearances (11 goals conceded in previous four), since a shut-out against Norwich in July 2020.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Southampton on Saturday, 20 February (12:30 GMT kick-off), while Newcastle go to Old Trafford to play Manchester United on Sunday, 21 February (19:00).\nTrump Takes on the World: Lifting the lid on the former president's 'America First' foreign policy\nNEW The Ranganation: Romesh returns with celebrity guests, a virtual nation and his mum..."

        "article_text": "Leeds 2-0 Crystal Palace: Jack Harrison and Patrick Bamford score in deserved win for hosts\nPatrick Bamford scored the 100th goal of his career as Leeds United gained a deserved victory over Crystal Palace to move into the top half of the Premier League table.\nThe 27-year-old finished into an open goal to make it 2-0 as he converted a rebound after Eagles goalkeeper Vicente Guaita had parried Raphinha's shot.\nEarlier on, Leeds had taken a third-minute lead when Jack Harrison's strike from the edge of the penalty area took a big deflection off Gary Cahill and looped past Guaita.\nBamford's century of goals includes 21 on loan at MK Dons, eight on loan with Derby, 33 with Middlesbrough and 38 with his current side.\n\"The most important thing is getting the three points but it is nice to get to 100 career goals,\" said Bamford, who was with Chelsea for five years but had seven loan spells elsewhere and never played a competitive game for the Blues.\n\"It is probably long overdue but nice to get there.\"\nRelive Leeds v Crystal Palace as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nLawro's Premier League predictions v BBC's Morning Live presenter Gethin Jones\nListen to the BBC Radio 5 Live Football Daily podcast\nThe victory moves Leeds up from 11th and above Arsenal to 10th, while Palace, who themselves would have gone into the top half with a win, remain 13th.\nBamford's 12th Premier League goal of the season means only two English players - Tottenham's Harry Kane and Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin, both with 13 - have scored more goals than him.\n\"What a player he has been this season for Leeds,\" said former England striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"People doubted whether he could score goals at this level but he has done. I would give him a go for England. I really like him, he has proved a lot of people wrong this season.\"\nEngland have three World Cup qualifiers at the end of March - at home against San Marino and Poland with an away game in Albania in between.\nBamford said he did not expect international recognition but it was nice to be talked about.\n\"If you had said that at the start of the season I would've brushed it off and said 'you're mad', but now people are talking about it,\" added the former England Under-21 forward.\n\"We have four or five strikers that have not been involved in the England squad many times and they are doing well so it will be interesting to see who gets called up.\"\nBamford, who failed to score in a nine-game loan spell with the Eagles in 2015-16, could have got on the scoresheet in the first half but saw a header saved by Guaita and then shot wastefully over the crossbar with only the goalkeeper to beat.\nRaphinha and Pascal Struijk had opportunities to also score for a dominant Leeds and Harrison nearly grabbed his second and Leeds' third late on but saw his effort rebound off the crossbar.\nLeeds continue to impress\nLeeds won the Championship last season as they ended a run of 16 seasons outside the top flight and while the two teams that came up with them - West Brom and Fulham - have struggled and are in the bottom three, Marcelo Bielsa's side have thrived.\nThis was their 10th league win of the season and Leeds are aiming for their first top-10 finish in English football since they came fifth and qualified for the Uefa Cup in 2001-02.\nIt was one of their most straightforward outings of the campaign and they never looked like squandering the lead given to them by Harrison's early goal.\nThe excellent, skilful Raphinha curled a free-kick over the top and then had a shot on the turn blocked by a desperate Cahill challenge as Leeds continued to create chances.\nStruijk missed two good headed opportunities but those misses did not prove costly as Bamford followed up after Raphinha's shot was parried to score the home team's second.\nThe only downside for Leeds was an injury to England international Kalvin Phillips, who went off late in the second half with what looked to be a calf injury.\nZaha absence hurts poor Palace\nPalace were without top goalscorer Wilfried Zaha after the Ivory Coast winger injured a hamstring in the 2-1 win at Newcastle on Tuesday and Roy Hodgson's side desperately missed their talisman.\nThis defeat means Palace have now lost 17 of the past 19 games in which Zaha has not played, including all four Premier League matches without him this season.\nThe injury-hit Londoners could only name six substitutes and handed a debut to French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, who joined the club on loan from Bundesliga outfit Mainz in January.\nBut his first involvement saw a clearance bounce off him in the build-up to Leeds' opening goal.\nThe Eagles had won their past two matches but were outplayed in the first half, with only 33% of possession, one shot on target and one corner.\nRoy Hodgson brought on Andros Townsend for Patrick van Aanholt at half-time in an attempt to get back in the game, but they found themselves two goals behind six minutes later.\nMichy Batshuayi replaced the ineffective Mateta after 65 minutes and set up Eze, who blazed well over.\nHodgson also introduced another striker, Christian Benteke, and he had an effort saved by Illan Meslier as Palace left Elland Road empty-handed.\nAnother blank for Palace on the road - the stats\nLeeds have won three of their past four Premier League games (lost one), as many victories as they enjoyed in their eight before that (lost five).\nCrystal Palace have failed to score in seven away games in the Premier League this season, the joint-most of any side (level with Burnley).\nLeeds scored with the first shot of the game (by either side) for the third time in the Premier League this season, with no side doing this more in 2020-21.\nIn a mirror image, Crystal Palace conceded from the first attempt of the game (by either side) for the third time in the Premier League this season, with no side doing this more in 2020-21.\nJack Harrison's opener (2 minutes 35 seconds) was Leeds' fastest Premier League goal since Steve Caldwell netted against Blackburn Rovers back in April 2004 (second minute).\nLeeds midfielder Jack Harrison has netted three goals in his past four league games, as many as he managed in his previous 24 for the club.\nJean-Philippe Mateta became the 175th player to play for Crystal Palace in the Premier League and the 214th Frenchman to appear in the competition overall (second only to English players, 1,593).\nLeeds striker Patrick Bamford became the first player to score in three Premier League games in a season against teams he previously played for in the competition (versus Crystal Palace x2 and Burnley) since Romelu Lukaku in 2017-18 (vs Everton, West Brom and Chelsea for Manchester United).\nKalvin Phillips made his 200th appearance in all competitions for Leeds this evening, becoming the third player to do so this season for the club (after Cooper & Dallas); this is the first season to see three players reach this milestone for Leeds since 2000-01 (Nigel Martyn, Lucas Radebe and Lee Bowyer).\n'Disappointed in the way we started each half' - what they said\nLeeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa, speaking to the BBC, said: \"It was a deserved triumph. We could have scored a few more goals. We defended well and conceded very few chances.\n\"The performance of the team was even and constant. It was an objective for today [to keep a clean sheet]. It was very important we didn't concede a goal today.\"\nAsked if Leeds were looking at the Europa League places, Bielsa replied: \"It's too early. Right now we don't have the consistency to imagine any higher up the table.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to the BBC, said: \"Everything depends upon the opposition and we met a good team. I'm disappointed in the way we started each half. It is of course going to put you on the back foot against any team, not least one of Leeds' quality.\n\"You try to encourage your players not to make mistakes in those moments to give your opposition a head start if you like. I don't think we created enough to get back into the game and we had to work really hard to make sure they didn't score more goals.\n\"I didn't think our passing was as good. The pitch was difficult for both teams which doesn't help when you're the team chasing the game and trying to get back into it.\n\"They are maybe more used to it. It's not the reason we lost the game but it may have affected the way we were able to pass the ball which I didn't think we did well enough.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeeds play at Arsenal on Sunday (16:30 GMT) after Crystal Palace host Burnley on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nBoxing With The Mob: What role has an alleged drugs boss had in arranging Britain's biggest ever bout?\nKatie Price: Harvey And Me: A deeply personal film following Katie Price and her son Harvey as he enters adulthood"

        "article_text": "Leicester 3-1 Liverpool: Foxes take advantage of late defensive errors\nLeicester City staged an astonishing late comeback to beat Liverpool as the Premier League champions collapsed and paid the price for another defensive calamity involving keeper Alisson.\nLiverpool looked to be cementing their top-four aspirations when Mohamed Salah put them ahead after 67 minutes with a clever finish after a piece of individual brilliance in the penalty area by Roberto Firmino.\nLeicester - who were not at their best even though Jamie Vardy missed two glorious first-half chances - suddenly bounced off the canvas to sink the champions with three goals in a chaotic seven-minute period.\nThe Foxes saw a 78th-minute penalty award ruled out by the video assistant referee and even though James Maddison's resulting free-kick found its way into the net past Alisson it was initially ruled out for an offside against Daniel Amartey before being given after a VAR check.\nLeicester's second three minutes later was another horror show for Liverpool keeper Alisson, whose poor clearances contributed to two goals in Manchester City's win at Anfield last Sunday. This time the Brazilian recklessly dashed out to clear Youri Tielemans' long ball, only to farcically crash into debutant defender Ozan Kabak, leaving Vardy to run the ball into an empty net.\nAnd Brendan Rodgers watched the Foxes rub salt in his former side's wounds as Harvey Barnes applied a composed finish to Wilfred Ndidi's pass with five minutes left.\nLeicester go second while Liverpool's third successive league defeat means their place in the top four looks in peril.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League games\nLawro's Predictions v Mike Rosenberg aka Passenger\nLiverpool's slide continues\nLiverpool's unimpressive defence of their Premier League title suffered more embarrassment as they cast aside a position of relative control at Leicester to capitulate at the first sign of a setback.\nJurgen Klopp's side are unrecognisable from the overpowering combination of talent and concrete-clad self-belief that swept aside all challengers last season to win their first title in 30 years.\nThe Reds had plenty of possession, without much punch, until Salah put them ahead - and the warning signs had been posted in the first half when Vardy headed straight at Alisson and struck the bar with two chances he would normally have taken.\nThere was an element of controversy surrounding Maddison's equaliser for Leicester but it was the lack of response - a total capitulation, in fact - that will be of huge concern to Klopp as his side lost a third successive league game for the first time since November 2014, when Rodgers was in charge.\nThe visitors' slumped body language once they had conceded spoke volumes, and their recent decline was summed up by another Alisson error as he came dashing out and crashed into new loan signing Kabak in an incident that had trouble written all over it from the moment the Brazil keeper left his area.\nHe then redeemed himself with a magnificent save from Vardy but the game had already gone and Barnes was able to confirm Leicester's win.\nOf course, Liverpool will cite their lengthy injury list but the players currently in action must be doing better, with Thiago Alcantara, on as substitute for the injured James Milner, badly off the pace and losing possession on countless occasions.\nThis is the worst period of Klopp's reign but Liverpool will have to pick themselves up instantly with a Champions League game against RB Leipzig and a Merseyside derby against Everton at Anfield facing them in the next seven days.\nLeicester dig deep for victory\nLeicester looked jaded after their midweek FA Cup exertions against Brighton and seemed to be heading for defeat when Salah put Liverpool in front - so it says much for their character that they fought back and cashed in ruthlessly when it counted.\nYes, Liverpool offered them a gift for the second goal but the hosts seemed to sense the champions had been badly hit by Maddison's leveller and pounced for the three points that put them in second place at the final whistle.\nIt also meant Rodgers became the first former Liverpool manager to win against them in the Premier League since Roy Hodgson won with West Brom in April 2012.\nVardy proved his importance once more while Barnes, who struggled in the first half, showed his quality and determination in the second to show a touch of class for Leicester's third.\nIt was a 4-0 thrashing here by Liverpool that signalled the beginning of the end of the Foxes' title hopes last season - this victory will bolster their belief that they are very serious top-four contenders after missing out on the Champions League places on the final day of last season.\n'It is not that cool' - reaction\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a clear game that we should win.\n\"We played good football, dominated possession, took the game out of Leicester. Their first goal for me is offside. The difference is we think it's an objective thing but it's not. Three players offside, but it was decided to take another moment in the game. That is how it is.\n\"The second goal is a misunderstanding obviously. It is a situation where we should shout and I didn't hear anyone shout. It is not that cool.\n\"The third goal I really don't like. We are so open. I cannot accept. That was it. The performance for 75 minutes or so was outstanding then we lost 3-1. That shows what a tricky situation we are in.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a very good win, the players deserved it.\n\"We didn't sink when we went a goal behind, we stayed calm and the players were brilliant in that period - a real collective team performance.\n\"You can see the improvement in the team's mindset. Our reaction was superb.\"\nReds leaking goals - stats\nKlopp became the ninth manager to take charge of 300 games for Liverpool in all competitions, while the German became the first Reds boss to lose his 300th match since Bill Shankly in 1965.\nRodgers became the first former Liverpool manager to beat the Reds in the Premier League since Roy Hodgson did so with West Brom in April 2012.\nLiverpool have conceded seven goals in their past two Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous 10. The Reds have conceded 32 goals in 24 league games this season, just one fewer than they did in the whole of 2019-20.\nOnly against Arsenal (11) has Vardy scored more Premier League goals than he has against Liverpool (eight).\nMaddison has been involved in eight goals in his past nine Premier League games, scoring four and assisting four.\nBarnes has scored more Premier League goals (eight) than any other English midfielder this season.\nSalah became the first player to score 10 away goals in the Premier League this season.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool face RB Leipzig in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) and Leicester play Slavia Prague in the Europa League last 32 on Thursday (17:55 GMT).\nStanding Up To Infertility: Rhod Gilbert with a frank, funny and personally revealing look at the condition\nScarlett Moffatt Wants To Believe: What is the theory behind ghost sightings and does it prove anything?"

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-3 Burnley: Lowton scores stunner as Clarets hammer woeful Palace\nBurnley took advantage of some woeful defending before Matt Lowton scored a superb volley as they brushed aside a limp Crystal Palace to move further clear of the Premier League's bottom three.\nThe Clarets came into the game as the division's lowest scorers, but quickly set about changing that in the opening 10 minutes, thanks in large part to the hospitality of the home side.\nA lack of communication at the back and a fluffed attempted clearance from Scott Dann allowed Johann Berg Gudmundsson to turn and fire in the opener before Jay Rodriguez headed the second directly from a corner.\nIt provided an early mountain to climb for a Palace side without their injured top-scorer and talisman Wilfried Zaha.\nDespite naming a team with Christian Benteke, Michy Batshuayi, Jordan Ayew and Eberechi Eze all starting and so seemingly possessing considerable attacking potential, the hosts failed to even leave base camp.\nTheir challenge was all but ended shortly after the break by the game's highlight, with Lowton driving past two challenges before exchanging passes with Rodriguez and lashing a volley across home keeper Vicente Guaita and into the far corner of the net.\nHaving failed to record a league win until the ninth game of the season (also over Palace), Sean Dyche's side are now on the up, with the 11-point gap between themselves and the bottom three not insurmountable but sizeable enough for comfort.\nThe only negative for Burnley was the loss of two defenders to injury late in the game.\nCaptain Ben Mee was carried off on a stretcher after a clash with Ayew, with Erik Pieters seemingly pulling a groin muscle soon after. Both will now be a doubt for important upcoming fixtures with Fulham and West Brom.\nPalace are three points better off than the Clarets, with 29 on the board. They're unlikely to go down, but will either need a fit again Zaha soon or a serviceable plan B without him to avoid a long, miserable trudge through the second half of this campaign.\nFollow all Saturday's Premier League action\nPremier League predictions: Lawro v singer-songwriter Mike Rosenberg aka Passenger\nTeam ethic triumphs for Burnley\nIt is unfair to label Palace a one-man team, but they are arguably as close as a current Premier League side gets to satisfying the brief, such is their woeful form without Zaha.\nThey offered little in the absence of their top-scorer and talisman at Leeds on Monday and were once again uninspiring in attack, meaning they have now lost 18 of the last 20 games they have played without the forward, failing to score in 16 of those.\nHodgson's attempted solution to the problem against Burnley was to promote Benteke and Batshuayi from the bench and pair them attack, with Ayew and Eze deployed as chief creators on the wings in a 4-4-2 that matched their opponents' formation.\nNeither striker lasted the 90 minutes, with Batshuayi failing to provide a single effort at goal, while replacements Jean-Philippe Mateta and Andros Townsend similarly underwhelming.\nThere were periods of home pressure during the match, but Nick Pope had no serious saves to make.\nBurnley are the polar opposite of a one-man team, but what they lack in high-profile superstars, they make up for with discipline, tactical acumen and efficiency.\nThe Clarets have struggled for goals this campaign, with their three on Saturday taking them to just 17 for the season in 23 games, but they are a nightmare to try and break down when they have their noses in front, let alone when they are gifted an early two-goal advantage.\nAs impressive as their finishing was in the opening 10 minutes, their work-rate and anticipation to snuff out any threat from an admittedly disjointed home attack was equally laudable.\nThe stand-out moment in the game, though, was undoubtedly Lowton's solo goal, which initially showcased his physical prowess and determination and then his technique, as he planted Rodrigiez's lofted ball past Guaita.\nIt was his first Premier League goal since April 2013, ending a run of 158 games, and meant his side had scored as many goals in one afternoon as they had in their previous 10 away league games combined.\nThe cost of the win could well be the absence of the ever-reliable Mee for future matches, although encouragingly the club captain was able to walk to the dressing room unaided after he had been taken off on a stretcher.\n'A performance we can't, in any way, be happy with'\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I thought there was a really good energy to the performance, a real good tempo and quality as well.\n\"Today I thought was a very good performance, we found all kinds of different chances. The tempo was there from early on. In the second half we started well and got a fantastic goal from Matt Lowton and really controlled it out from that.\n\"We take things one game at a time, as we did today.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: \"It was pretty obvious that it was a performance we can't be in anyway happy with or proud of. We were beaten by the better team.\n\"They dealt with our attacks quite easily and we found it difficult to deal with their attacks.\n\"I am afraid it one of those defeats that you have to take on the chin but there won't be many of us going home thinking we did the best job we could do.\"\nAge is just a number\nBurnley (29y 349d) became the first opponent to name a starting XI with an older average age than Crystal Palace (29y 148d) in a Premier League game against the Eagles this season.\nBurnley have won four of their last six Premier League games in London (L2), more than they'd won in the first 30 such games in the competition (W3 D4 L23).\nOnly Leeds (8) have conceded more goals from corners in the Premier League this season than Crystal Palace (7).\nBurnley's Johann Berg Gudmundsson has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career (108th game), after going 21 matches in a row without scoring before this run.\nBurnley's Jay Rodriguez has scored five league goals against Crystal Palace, only versus Nottingham Forest (6) has he bagged more in his career.\nBurnley defender Matt Lowton scored his first Premier League goal since April 2013 versus Stoke City - seven years and 313 days ago.\nStanding Up To Infertility: Rhod Gilbert with a frank, funny and personally revealing look at the condition\nScarlett Moffatt Wants To Believe: What is the theory behind ghost sightings and does it prove anything?"

        "article_text": "Manchester City 3-0 Tottenham Hotspur: 11 league wins in a row for leaders\nManchester City extended their winning run to 16 games and their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points as they easily defeated Tottenham at Etihad Stadium.\nIlkay Gundogan scored twice after Rodri had put City ahead from the penalty spot midway through the opening period.\nRaheem Sterling might have had another late on as City strengthened their grip at the summit, where they also have a game in hand over second-placed Leicester.\nIt was a chastening night for Tottenham and their manager Jose Mourinho.\nWhen they won the first meeting between these sides in November, Tottenham were top of the table.\nSince then, City have taken 41 points from a possible 45 to take a decisive advantage in the title race.\nIn contrast, Spurs have now collected 16 points in 14 games and lost four games out of five in all competitions and remain in eighth.\nOn this evidence, few will give Mourinho any chance of overcoming Pep Guardiola at Wembley when these sides meet in the Carabao Cup final on 25 April.\nIs Gundogan on track to be player of the season?\nReaction from Etihad Stadium\nRB Leipzig make Angelino move permanent\nEderson all smiles after penalty pain\nAfter last week's win at Liverpool, when Gundogan became the third City player to miss from the spot, Guardiola suggested goalkeeper Ederson might be next in line.\nIt was not entirely clear whether the City boss was joking.\nCertainly Ederson did not think so judging by the way the Brazilian strode purposefully forward after the foul on Gundogan by Pierre-Emile Hojberg had been confirmed by the video assistant referee.\nIt took a firm hand from Bernardo Silva to stop him and there was an element of disgruntlement at the way Ederson went back to his position as Rodri found the net.\nIt was easy to have sympathy for the City keeper.\nAside from the Harry Kane free-kick that hit the post in the opening minutes, Ederson had virtually nothing to do until Erik Lamela fired straight at him just before the hour.\nHis disappointment did not last, though.\nWhen he dropped a superb long ball from the edge of his own area over the visitors' defence for Gundogan, the German ensured Ederson could claim the assist to a quite brilliant goal as he got the better of Davinson Sanchez before finishing superbly.\nFrom 70 yards away, Ederson celebrated with a wide smile and a thumbs up.\nIt took Gundogan's tally to 11 goals in 12 games, having already benefited from Raheem Sterling's excellent close control and pass to double the hosts' advantage five minutes after the break.\nThere was concern at how Gundogan's night ended as he was substituted with what appeared to be a groin injury.\nCity will hope the problem will not keep the Premier League's player of the month out for too long.\nBale problem goes on\nIt was another frustrating night for Gareth Bale.\nRestored to the Spurs squad after a rather odd week, in which Mourinho said the Welshman had asked to be left out of the FA Cup defeat by Everton in midweek because he did not feel right, then rejected the insinuation of a social media post that he was training well, Bale was not introduced until the 71st minute.\nBy then, Tottenham were three down and Mourinho had already used two substitutes, which further underlines the gap between manager and player.\nBale was responsible for the only moment of inspiration for the visitors in open play, when he took possession from Rodri, then beat three men before shooting too close to Ederson from the edge of the box, allowing the City keeper to save.\nWithout a swift change of fortune, a season that promised so much for both parties is in danger of turning into damp squib, with the plea from those close to Bale that he just needs a run of games to find his form unlikely to be heeded.\n'Patient, patient, calm' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"It was well deserved, they hit the post and that can turn the game but the way we wanted to play was there. Tottenham have special quality, we have played well against them in the past and lost 2-0.\n\"They don't need anything to create chances. It is the quality and the approach of their manager.

We had shots, had attacks and reduced Villa's attacking players. We are disappointed with just the one point.\n\"Their goalkeeper made some really good saves and has been an important player for them. That is football but the overall performance - we had enough shots, attacks and goes at them to score, just not that last little luck you need.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith to BBC Sport: \"We were bang average. I have not seen us make so many enforced errors. We needed our goalkeeper - he had a good game.\n\"We showed a little resilience and our keeper played well but I can't take much more from it. It was a fighting performance.\n\"He's a fantastic goalkeeper, a great acquisition for Aston Villa, but in the other 12 clean sheets he's kept this season he's been protected really well.\n\"He was called into action too much today, and it was a one-man show at times, such was the sloppiness of our play.\"\nA first since 1981 - the best of the stats\nBrighton have gone unbeaten in six consecutive top-flight games for the first time since a run of eight ending in November 1981.\nThe last seven league games in which Brighton have hosted Aston Villa have seen just eight goals scored in total, with neither side managing to score more than one goal in a game in this run (one win each, five draws).\nMartinez has kept seven away clean sheets in the Premier League this season - the only Aston Villa goalkeeper to register more away shutouts in a single campaign in the competition was Brad Friedel in 2009-10 (8).\nDespite only coming on in the 62nd minute, no player created more chances in the match than Brighton's Adam Lallana (4).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton welcome Crystal Palace to the Amex on Monday, 22 February (20:00 GMT), while Aston Villa host Leicester City a day earlier (14:00 GMT).\nStanding Up To Infertility: Rhod Gilbert with a frank, funny and personally revealing look at the condition\nScarlett Moffatt Wants To Believe: What is the theory behind ghost sightings and does it prove anything?"

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-2 Wolves: Ralph Hasenhuttl says VAR is 'destroying the game'\nManager Ralph Hasenhuttl said video refereeing was \"destroying the game\" as he reacted to a controversial penalty decision during Southampton's defeat by Wolves.\nDanny Ings scored in the 25th minute to give Saints a 1-0 lead, and Hasenhuttl's men comfortably held the advantage until Wolves were awarded a second-half penalty when Ryan Bertrand blocked Nelson Semedo's attempted cross with his arm.\nThe point of contention was whether the left-back's arm was in an unnatural position. The VAR team, led by official Martin Atkinson, saw no need for the on-field referee to reconsider his initial decision to award the kick.\nRuben Neves scored from the spot before Pedro Neto produced a dazzling winner for the visitors.\n\"I am normally a big fan, and if the VAR followed the rules everything would be easy,\" said Hasenhuttl, whose side slumped to their sixth successive Premier League loss.\n\"I don't know what Mr Atkinson saw today, but they are not doing a good job at the moment. It is that simple. VAR is destroying the game, that's right.\n\"The referee explained that the arm was stretched away from the body. But when the ball hit the arm it stretched the arm away for me.\"\nThe Austrian manager then questioned an incident at the other end of the pitch when a cross struck the arm of Wolves' Leander Dendoncker, which referee Graham Scott and the VAR team this time declared legal.\nHe added: \"I haven't spoken with the VAR because he isn't at the stadium so we can't.\n\"This is the issue: the games aren't decided in the stadium any more, the games are decided at Stockley Park. This is not so good for the game I don't think.\"\nThe match was a tale of two halves, with the visitors improving markedly as an attacking force after the break.\nThe home side controlled the opening period and took the lead when Ings scored with a brilliant volley after he was picked out by Stuart Armstrong.\nThe game turned seven minutes into the second half when Neves converted from the spot. Wolves, buoyed by the goal, went on the front foot and took the lead when Neto jinked his way past Jannik Vestergaard before threading his angled strike between Jan Bednarek and keeper Alex McCarthy.\nSaints pressed for an equaliser but were thwarted by Wolves stopper Rui Patricio who made a double save from James Ward-Prowse and Che Adams.\nWolves go 12th in the Premier League table, a point and a place above Southampton.\nFollow live coverage of Sunday's Premier League action\nSaints undone by controversial decision\nContentious decisions irk any team, but it prickles that little bit more when you are desperate for a point, never mind a win.\nIn the split second Bertrand turned his back to avoid getting struck in the face by Semedo's cross, he cannot have imagined that referee Scott would point to the spot.\nHasenhuttl's side never recovered from that as the frailties in defence that have cost them so dearly in the recent past resurfaced. As brilliant as Neto's strike was, could Vestergaard have blocked his run? And should McCarthy have been beaten from such a tight angle?\nIt is a shame for the Saints because early in the match they displayed the kind of dominance that saw them beat Wolves in the FA Cup on Thursday.\nIngs along with Stuart Armstrong and Nathan Redmond looked formidable in attack and his opening strike was typical of him - instinctive and creative. It was his 30th Premier League goal since the start of last season, and only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (36), Leicester's Jamie Vardy (35) and Tottenham's Harry Kane (31) have managed as many.\nThe forward's progress has been blighted by injuries in recent years, but if he stays fit Hasenhuttl's side should be able to escape this rut.\nNuno tactical change pays dividends\nThis result should settle Wolves fans' nerves. That is now seven points in the past three league games, which perhaps proves to the team they can still churn out wins without leading striker Raul Jimenez, who continues his rehabilitation following his head injury.\nThe visitors sat too deep in the first half but manager Nuno Espirito Santo tweaked the system for the second period, with wide men Semedo and Adama Traore beginning to take more risks.\nNeves has arguably been Nuno's most valuable player in attack in the absence of Jimenez, and took his penalty confidently, while 20-year-old Neto once again highlighted why he is one of the brightest prospects in football with his picture-book goal.\n'This is a little too much for me to take' - reaction\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl speaking to Amazon Prime: \"I think we shouldn't discuss our run. We know what happened today. It is hard to explain, hard to explain this defeat.\n\"Until their penalty they had no chances at goal. When you concede that penalty, I just don't understand.\n\"This is a little too much for me to take, to be honest.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo speaking to Amazon Prime: \"It was a very tough game. Both halves were very tough. In the first half Southampton managed the game. In the second half we were on the front foot, scored two goals and then defended very well.\n\"It was a good move before the penalty; afterwards it's the decision of the referee.\n\"I don't agree that the first half was disappointing. It was a tough game. Southampton are a good team.\"\nPortuguese players' Premier League prowess - stats\nSouthampton have lost six consecutive league matches for the first time in their history.\nSince the start of 2018-19, Wolves have won 10 Premier League matches after going behind, the third-most of any side after Liverpool (14) and Manchester United (12).\nSouthampton have led in each of their past four Premier League matches against Wolves but have not won any of them (D2 L2).\nWolves have not opened the scoring in any of their past 14 Premier League games; only Manchester City in 1995 (16 games) have gone on a longer run without scoring first in a match.\nPortuguese players have now scored more Premier League goals for Wolves than players from any other nation (47), outscoring Englishmen by one goal.\nNeto has been directly involved in nine Premier League goals this season (five goals and four assists), the most of any under-21 player in the competition this campaign.\nWhat's next?\nWolves host Leeds on Friday (20:00 GMT) and Southampton host Chelsea on Saturday (12:30 GMT).\nStanding Up To Infertility: Rhod Gilbert with a frank, funny and personally revealing look at the condition\nScarlett Moffatt Wants To Believe: What is the theory behind ghost sightings and does it prove anything?"

        "article_text": "West Brom 1-1 Man Utd: Bruno Fernandes scores stunning volley\nBruno Fernandes' stunning volley salvaged a point for Manchester United at struggling West Brom, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side lost further ground in the Premier League title race.\nUnited moved back above Leicester in second place, but are now seven points behind leaders Manchester City, who also have a game in hand.\nThe Baggies took a shock lead after just 83 seconds as on-loan striker Mbaye Diagne outmuscled Victor Lindelof to head in from Conor Gallagher's cross.\nUnited were finding it difficult to make inroads in a lacklustre opening period until Fernandes hooked Luke Shaw's cross into the top corner with his weaker left foot.\nThe visitors improved in the second half, Mason Greenwood testing Sam Johnstone with a low strike and Scott McTominay seeing his follow up cleared off the line.\nWith time running out, skipper Harry Maguire leapt to send his header towards the top corner, but Johnstone tipped the effort against the post to deny United an injury-time winner.\nSam Allardyce's side could have won it themselves late on, but Diagne struck his effort over the crossbar from six yards out.\nThough they claimed a draw, West Brom remain in deep trouble at the wrong end of the table, second from bottom and 12 points from safety.\nRelive Man Utd's draw at West Brom\n'We won't let City run away with it' - Solskjaer\nDefensive issues to deal with for Solskjaer\nA poor start from United proved costly, they had won eight games on the road having fallen behind this season, but on this occasion were not able to find a second goal to seal the three points.\nSolskjaer's side extended their unbeaten away run in the league to 19 games but that will be of little consolation as they dropped points against a team staring at relegation, just as they did against Sheffield United in late January.\nUnited's last title triumph came in 2012-13, with Sir Alex Ferguson's last game in-charge at The Hawthorns, but the prospect of number 21 in 2021 looks to be fading.\nThey conceded within two minutes courtesy of Diagne getting ahead of Lindelof to the ball, but the often-criticised Swede should have been stronger and reacted quicker.\nDe Gea, who conceded poor goals against Everton last time out, was hesitant too and could have come off his line for a ball which was lobbed to the edge of the six yard box.\nOn a day when defensive target Dayot Upamecano agreed to join Bayern Munich from RB Leipzig, Solskjaer must surely have cast an eye to the summer and the need to bring in a centre-back to shore up a backline that has conceded 31 goals, the most of any club in the top nine.\nAt the other end, Fernandes' goal was magical - drawing comparisons with Zinedine Zidane's famous strike in the 2002 Champions League final - but that was their high point from an attacking perspective.\nAnthony Martial was once again anonymous and withdrawn on 65 minutes. His replacement, Greenwood, went close and skipper Maguire thought he had a penalty when he was bundled over by Semi Ajayi and referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot.\nBut after consultation with the VAR and viewing the replay on the pitchside monitor, the decision was overturned. Maguire could still have won it deep in injury-time but could not divert his header past Johnstone.\nA point gained for West Brom?\nWhether this draw will help West Brom stay up at the end of the season remains to be seen, but they will take heart from an assured performance against a side aiming for the title.\nDiagne scored his first goal since joining on-loan from Galatasaray in January, but they have collected just six points in 11 games since veteran boss Allardyce took charge.\nThey have also conceded 55 goals this season - the most in the top-flight - and still have a huge task to maintain survival with 14 games remaining.\nWest Brom - who have scored just 19 goals this term - did offer a threat in the final third, Robert Snodgrass seeing a header tipped over the crossbar by De Gea and maybe could even have won it.\nDiagne dispossessed Maguire in the box but his clipped effort from close range was kept out by De Gea and he had an even bigger chance with three minutes remaining but could not keep his shot on target.\nWhat next?\nWest Brom travel to Burnley in the league next Saturday (kick-off 15:00), while United are in Europa League action on Thursday against Real Sociedad (17:55).\nSam's Senegalese contingent - the stats\nManchester United have won just one of their last five Premier League games (D3 L1), their 9-0 hammering of Southampton at Old Trafford.\nWest Brom have won only one of their 11 Premier League matches under Sam Allardyce (W1 D3 L7), shipping nine more goals than any other team since his first match in charge (29).\nBruno Fernandes has been directly involved in 38 Premier League goals in 38 appearances for Manchester United (22 goals, 16 assists) - in Premier League history, the only player with more goal involvements in his first 38 games is Andrew Cole (46 in 1993/94 for Newcastle).\nWest Brom's goal was scored after just 83 seconds by Mbaye Diagne - the earliest conceded by Manchester United in a Premier League game since Christian Eriksen's 11-second strike for Spurs in January 2018.\nManchester United have recovered 22 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, 10 more than any other team.\nManchester United are unbeaten in all 12 away Premier League matches this season (W8 D4), only the fourth time a team has avoided defeat in their first 12 away Premier League games of a season: Arsenal in 2001/02 and 2003/04 and Liverpool in 2019/20, all of whom went on to win the title.\nWest Brom striker Mbaye Diagne became the 12th different Senegalese player to score a Premier League goal under Sam Allardyce, eight more than have scored under any other manager.\nMan Utd left-back Luke Shaw registered his fifth Premier League assist of the season, the most he's ever managed in a single season. In fact, Shaw only had seven assists in 156 Premier League appearances before this campaign.\nStanding Up To Infertility: Rhod Gilbert with a frank, funny and personally revealing look at the condition\nScarlett Moffatt Wants To Believe: What is the theory behind ghost sightings and does it prove anything?"

It's been a tough time for me.\"\nRight from the off the Gabon international looked lively, cutting in from the left and finding the bottom corner with a cultured finish in the opening quarter.\nAnd he was denied a second moments later when Leeds defender Luke Ayling superbly blocked his shot after good work from David Luiz.\nVAR intervention led to referee Stuart Atwell overturning an Arsenal penalty after Bukayo Saka was brought down by Liam Cooper in the 35th minute.\nBut the 19-year-old won another spot-kick minutes later, being tripped by Leeds keeper Illan Meslier after the stopper was unable to clear a routine backpass.\nAubameyang made no mistake from 12 yards - sending Meslier the wrong way - before Bellerin caught out the Frenchman at his near post to net Arsenal's third.\nArsenal started the second half just as they finished the first, with Aubameyang heading home Emile Smith Rowe's cross to net his second ever Arsenal hat-trick - his first since the Gunners beat Valencia 4-2 in the Europa League in May 2019.\nAnd Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was quick to praise his captain at full-time, remarking that the forward is \"key\" to Arsenal's success.\n\"We have been missing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's goals and him at his best,\" said Arteta.\n\"He has been training after a difficult period with a family issue and we had a feeling he could be key in this game.\n\"We know that a big part of our future success is related to Auba being at his best and scoring as many goals as possible.\n\"If he is in that type of form we are going to be closer to winning football matches, that is for sure - we cannot just rely on him but he is a big piece of our puzzle and you saw today that when he is firing he is a difficult player to play against.\"\n'Arsenal prepared better' - Bielsa\nDespite a disastrous first 47 minutes, at one point in the second period Leeds looked destined to leave London with a point.\nStruijk's thumping header from a Raphinha corner just before the hour-mark and Costa's close-range finish 11 minutes later halved the deficit, with the Yorkshire side's first two real chances of the game.\nAt 4-2 Patrick Bamford went down in the area under pressure from multiple Arsenal defenders with 15 minutes remaining, only for play to be waved on.\nBut, after a few nervous minutes, it was Arsenal who always looked the likelier to grab the game's seventh goal, with Aubameyang nearly grabbing a fourth, curling the ball against the crossbar, and Saka striking the post in the closing stages.\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa, routinely praised for his team's approach this season, admitted he got his tactics wrong.\n\"We couldn't pressure their build-up and we could not avoid their pressure when we were trying to build from the back,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"You could see it clearly, the opposing manager prepared the game better than I did.\n\"We did not manage to bring the ball from our half to their half.\"\nWithout star midfielder Kalvin Phillips the visitors struggled to get on the ball, and have now conceded four goals or more for the fifth time since gaining promotion to the Premier League.\nFor all their attacking flair Leeds remain leaky at the back, with strugglers West Brom the only side to have conceded more goals in the league this season.\nThe result means Arsenal leapfrog Leeds to go 10th in the table, six points off the top four.\nLeeds' London woes - the stats\nArsenal scored four (or more) goals at the Emirates for the first time in the Premier League this season, having last done so in a 4-0 win over Norwich in July of last season.\nLeeds have won just one of their last 24 away league games in London (D6 L17), losing all four such matches this season by an aggregate 14-4 score.\nLeeds remain without a win in nine meetings with Arsenal in all competitions (D2 L7), since a 3-2 victory in the Premier League at Highbury in May 2003.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his 199th, 200th and 201st goals in Europe's big-five leagues in what was his 369th appearance.

        "article_text": "Everton 0-2 Fulham: Josh Maja double boosts Fulham's survival hopes\nJosh Maja said he saw a dream become reality as he marked his full debut with a brace to help Fulham boost their Premier League survival hopes with a deserved win at Everton.\nThe visitors were by far the better side in the first half but were left frustrated as they missed several opportunities to score, with Bobby Decordova-Reid hitting the post and Harrison Reed driving over.\nBut their dominance was rewarded early in the second half when Maja - a deadline day signing on loan from Bordeaux - slid in to turn home Ola Aina's cross from close range.\nMaja, 22, then capped a superb debut with a second, tapping in after Reed's shot had hit the woodwork.\nThe former Sunderland striker said: \"This is a night I have been dreaming about for a long time. I had a feeling it was coming and pleased it became a reality.\n\"We took our chances when it came and put in another good performance again, we want to continue like this.\"\nEverton were poor throughout and although Seamus Coleman clipped the outside of the post in the first half, they rarely looked like scoring.\nJoshua King did have the ball in the back of the net late on but it was ruled out for offside.\nThere is still plenty of work to do for Fulham to escape the drop, with this victory cutting the deficit to safety to seven points, but it will significantly boost their hopes they they can fight their way out of trouble.\nDefeat for Everton, meanwhile, means they remain seventh on 37 points.\nMaja provides spark Fulham have missed\nThis was a much-needed win for a Fulham side that has often been competitive in games this season but a failure to convert chances into goals has meant they have rarely got the rewards their performances have warranted.\nThey had 20 shots on goal at West Ham last time out but only two of those were on target as they had to settle for a frustrating draw, and it looked like that pattern would continue in this game as they squandered numerous chances in the first half.\nBut with Aleksandar Mitrovic having struggled for goals this season, Fulham have missed a clinical striker who can finish off the many chances they create - but this performances suggests Maja could be that man.\nNeither of the former Sunderland striker's goals were fantastic strikes but crucially he was in the right place at the right time to put the ball in the back of the net.\nMaja's impact and this result could provide the spark Fulham have needed to haul themselves out of the relegation zone.\n\"Today it has been the difference,\" said Fulham boss Scott Parker, when asked about his side finding the back of the net.\n\"I constantly say to this team, you cannot keep creating the chances and that is a good marker to keep belief.\n\"We have been on the wrong side of fine margins but in and around the six-yard box we have sniffed out chances and got a big win.\"\nToffees come unstuck at home again\nEverton are enjoying one of their best Premier League seasons, having taken 37 points from 22 games to sit seventh and just three points off the top four.\nDespite that, performances like this one highlight a frustrating issue the Toffees appear to have on home soil.\nOnly four of their 11 league victories have come at Goodison Park, where they have not won in the Premier League since 19 December, and this was another flat performance by Carlo Ancelotti's side.\nThis was a far cry from their scintillating display in the 5-4 FA Cup fifth-round win against Tottenham in midweek as they sorely missed Dominic Calvert-Lewin in attack.\nThey did not manage a single shot on target in the first half and only two in the second half, but both of those efforts - from Gylfi Sigurdsson and Michael Keane respectively - came when they were already 2-0 down.\nThis was a real opportunity for Everton to underline their credentials as top-four contenders but they came up disappointingly short.\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti to BBC Sport: \"[We struggled with] the physical aspect [after the 5-4 midweek win over Spurs].\n\"Practically we were not able to play as we wanted. We wanted to have a good control of the game, putting more midfielders on the pitch, but they press a lot and we could not play as we want.\"\nA first for Fulham - the stats\nEverton have lost three of their last four Premier League games at Goodison Park (D1), as many defeats as they suffered in Carlo Ancelotti's first 17 home games in charge in the competition (W8 D6).\nFulham picked up their first ever away win at Everton in league competition, on what was their 28th attempt. Coming into Sunday evening's game, they had lost each of their last 22 away league games against the Toffees.\nEverton have only kept one clean sheet in their last 15 Premier League games at Goodison Park, with that coming against Chelsea back on 12 December of last year (1-0).\nFulham picked up their first Premier League victory since November 2020 versus Leicester (2-1), ending a run of 12 games without a win in the competition (D8 L4).\nEverton have lost five of their last seven Premier League home games against newly-promoted teams (W1 D1), including each of the last two - 0-1 v Leeds United last November and 0-2 v Fulham on Sunday night.\nAged 22 years and 49 days, Josh Maja is the second-youngest player to score on his first Premier League start for Fulham, after Collins John v Blackburn in April 2004 (18 years and 178 days).\nFulham striker Josh Maja is just the second Nigerian player to score a brace on his first Premier League start, following Efan Ekoku for Norwich City back in May 1993 (v Middlesbrough).\nEverton's first shot on target of the game came in the 76th minute through Gylfi Sigurdsson - indeed, their total of seven shots was their joint-fewest in a Premier League home game under Carlo Ancelotti (also seven v Man Utd in November and Leicester in July 2020).\nWhat next?\nEverton host Premier League leaders Manchester City on Wednesday (20:15 GMT) while Fulham travel to Burnley earlier the same day (18:00).\nStanding Up To Infertility: Rhod Gilbert with a frank, funny and personally revealing look at the condition\nScarlett Moffatt Wants To Believe: What is the theory behind ghost sightings and does it prove anything?"

The teams around us are top, top teams and we are going to have to play incredibly well to be there.\n\"But I think we've got another gear or two to what we've shown tonight.\"\nChris Basham's lunge on Jesse Lingard helped gift the Hammers victory, Rice making no mistake from the spot before Diop, who was forced off with a head injury in his previous game, doubled the lead from Aaron Cresswell's corner.\nSubstitute Fredericks added a third deep into stoppage time.\nSheffield United, 14 points from safety with 14 games left, went close to equalising at 1-0 only for Lukasz Fabianski to produce an outstanding save to keep out David McGoldrick's deflected header.\nWest Ham had been awarded an early penalty when Craig Dawson was fouled by Enda Stevens and referee Simon Hooper pointed to the spot, but after a VAR consultation the decision was overturned.\nHow Monday's Premier League action unfolded\nIs Moyes' reputation now fully restored?\nFootball Daily podcast: Tuchel's triumph and Wilder's woes\nIs Europe beckoning for the Hammers?\nWest Ham's phenomenal form after last season's struggle shows no sign of going off the boil.\nHaving spent last term locked in a relegation battle, the Hammers are now level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea.\nWhen Harry Redknapp's class of 1998-99 finished fifth in English football's top flight, they accumulated 57 points.\nVictory over the Blades moved Moyes' team to 42 points with another 42 to play for, and they have to be considered serious contenders for Europe next season.\nTheir latest win was down to one moment of madness and one moment of brilliance - Basham's clumsy foul on Lingard and Fabianski's save to deny McGoldrick at 1-0.\nFabianski had a busier game than he would have liked while at the other end Aaron Ramsdale denied Vladimir Coufal after he found himself with just the keeper to beat.\nBut Fredericks sealed a polished team display with the third after a lovely assist from fellow substitute Said Benrahma.\nWith forward Michail Antonio due back from injury, West Ham look in decent shape with the business end of the season looming.\nBlades look doomed\nSheffield United have shown signs of fight in recent weeks with victories over Manchester United, Newcastle and West Brom.\nBut they can have few complaints about the outcome at London Stadium as their hopes of survival suffered a significant setback.\nThey were once again authors of their own downfall, Basham's clear-cut foul on Lingard - and Rice's resulting penalty - undoing their bright start.\nMcGoldrick was lively but after Diop's header made it 2-0, the Blades then allowed Fredericks time and space to drill home the third goal.\nOn a bad night in London, defender John Egan left the pitch with his leg in a protected brace.\nBarring a great escape, a 19th league defeat leaves the Blades facing a return to the Championship.\n'We have another level' - what they said\nWest Ham boss David Moyes: \"Our form after lockdown was good and a couple of signings have worked really well for us, and the players have kicked on.\n\"I think we have another level. It's a very good result, very few teams will get three goals against Sheffield United.\"\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder: \"At this level you can't make it easy for the opposition and we gift-wrapped two goals.\n\"I thought we would be competitive, which we were. I thought we were well in the game up until that moment [the penalty]. We had a foothold in the game.\n\"Then we started the second half well but then conceded from a set-play.

It's not over. Now we've made it and it's the moment to hang in and keep on showing the hunger we had. We've made this big step today. We have to follow up and not lose any intensity or determination.\"\nRelive Monday night's Premier League action\nFootball Daily podcast: Tuchel's triumph and Wilder's woes\n1,000 minutes, 31 attempts, 14 games\nWerner came into this match having not scored in the league since a 4-1 win against bottom side Sheffield United on 7 November.\nHe had chances within the opening half an hour with the best coming from Marcos Alonso's header which Werner poked wide.\nIt threatened to be a similar story for Werner, who has been creative for Chelsea this season but has failed to deliver goals following a high-profile move from RB Leipzig in the summer.\nBut after taking a whack in the face from Newcastle defender Jamal Lewis and running off to receive treatment, Werner returned to the pitch to provide a cross that ultimately came to Giroud to coolly thump into the net, and the German added Chelsea's second from a corner before half-time.\nIt was Werner's first goal in exactly 1,000 minutes of Premier League action for Chelsea and ended a run of 31 attempts without scoring - he even had to wait for a video assistant referee decision before being allowed to celebrate properly, which he did with a relieved smile.\nHis performance capped off another positive result for Chelsea under new boss Thomas Tuchel, who handed a start to out-of-favour goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and came through unscathed.\nIt was Arrizabalaga's first league start since a 3-3 draw with Southampton on 17 October after losing his position under former manager Frank Lampard.\nThe Blues have now picked up 13 points from a possible 15 under the new leadership, winning four successive league matches in a row for the first time since November 2019.\nTuchel described it as \"the perfect evening\" but admitted Abraham's injury was \"serious enough he had to go out and we worry about him\".\nNewcastle struggle to compete\nNewcastle had picked up two wins from their previous three league matches after a burst in form but they struggled to compete with an in-form Chelsea side at Stamford Bridge.\nAbraham's injury, as a result of Jamaal Lascelles' strong recovery tackle in the box, saw the introduction of Giroud, who has enjoyed playing Newcastle and scored his ninth goal against them in the league.\nWerner caused the defence problems too, and when Newcastle were able to get on the ball creative players Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin were short of options.\nNewcastle did ride a wave of pressure in the second half as Reece James, Werner and Mason Mount all came close to adding to Chelsea's tally.\nBut the visitors' best chance - Joe Willock's header which was scrambled away by Arrizabalaga - did not come until the 74th minute, when Chelsea were in complete control.\nAlmiron drilled another effort wide minutes later and Newcastle had all four of their shots on target after the break but they never really threatened to get into game.\n'The perfect evening' - what they said\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel to BBC Sport: \"It was a very good night, the perfect evening. We knew we had the opportunity to jump into the top four. We took this chance.\n\"Now we've made this big step today we have to follow up and not lose any intensity or determination.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce to BBC Sport: \"We were excellent in the second half and in the first half we found it very difficult. The way they played, the system they had, the two inside forwards - we didn't deal with it well enough.\n\"Second half we got to grips with it and we were more aggressive - a lot of positives. First half was very difficult for us.\"\nTuchel emulates Mourinho - the best of the stats\nNewcastle have lost six of their last seven away Premier League games after losing just one of the six before that.\nChelsea have won eight consecutive home top-flight matches against an opponent (Newcastle) for the first time since winning nine in a row against West Brom between 1984 and 2013.\nTuchel has picked up 13 points from his first five Premier League games in charge of Chelsea (W4 D1), level with Jose Mourinho's first five with the club and bettered only by Carlo Ancelotti and Maurizio Sarri (15 pts each).\nHe is just the third manager to see his team concede just one goal in his first five games as a boss in the Premier League, after Mourinho with Chelsea and Peter Taylor with Leicester.\nIn his 100th Premier League appearance as a substitute, Giroud scored his 21st goal in the competition from the bench, with only Jermain Defoe netting more (24).\nArrizabalaga kept his first Premier League clean sheet in five appearances (11 goals conceded in previous four), since a shut-out against Norwich in July 2020.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Southampton on Saturday, 20 February (12:30 GMT kick-off), while Newcastle go to Old Trafford to play Manchester United on Sunday, 21 February (19:00).\nTrump Takes on the World: Lifting the lid on the former president's 'America First' foreign policy\nNEW The Ranganation: Romesh returns with celebrity guests, a virtual nation and his mum..."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 Fulham: Clarets hit back to frustrate Cottagers\nRelegation-threatened Fulham lost some of the momentum built up by their win at Everton but showed battling qualities to claim a point at Burnley.\nOf the three sides currently adrift at the bottom of the Premier League, the Cottagers seem the most capable of clawing their way to safety, as illustrated by their impressive win at Goodison Park on Sunday.\nBut they failed to repeat that bright and incisive display at Turf Moor against a typically hard-working and competitive Clarets side, who married their industry with the game's main moments of attacking ingenuity.\nIt was the visitors, though, who took the lead, as much through fortune as design, with Ola Aina's chested effort from a corner finding the net despite an attempted clearance from Robbie Brady on the line.\nCrucially, the visitors were denied the time to draw confidence from the opener, with Burnley hitting back three minutes later through a well-taken Ashley Barnes finish, following a superb low ball from Jay Rodriguez.\nThe same two strikers had both narrowly failed to get a goal-bound touch on a superb low cross from James Tarkowski in the first half, while Rodriguez saw a low drive kicked away by Alphonse Areola shortly after his side had levelled the score.\nThe draw represents an opportunity missed for Burnley to put further ground between themselves and the London side, with the gap between the two a sizeable but not yet entirely comfortable eight points.\nScott Parker's side remain six points shy of safety, with Newcastle the 17th-placed side most in danger of being reeled in.\nFollow live text commentary of Burnley v Fulham in the Premier League\nA point gained, or two lost for Fulham?\nEarning a result at Burnley against a side built to expose the mental and physical weaknesses in an opponent, especially a newly promoted one, is not an easy task.\nIn doing so, Fulham have further demonstrated their growth into a top-flight side, after claiming a number of creditable draws earlier in the campaign and then dispatching an aspiring big-hitter in Everton last weekend.\nUnfortunately, the Cottagers' development could have come too late.\nOnly wins will really eat into the gap between themselves and safety and they cannot afford to let one slip from their grasp when it is there to be had.\nIt is why Parker and his side will be so disappointed at the speed and manner with which they conceded the equaliser at Turf Moor, throwing away the lead and momentum they had seized by allowing Barnes a free run in on goal to finish.\nThey had been on the back foot for large periods before that and were indebted to a bit of fortune for their goal, but aesthetics come a distant second to actual points right now.\nThe biggest positive for Burnley will be that their advantage over the Cottagers remains the same as it was before kick-off.\nWith the likes of Newcastle and Palace in far worse form than they are, and Brighton a point worse off, they will feel relatively calm about their situation.\nWhat will worry manager Dyche is further injuries to his already depleted squad, with Johan Berg Gudmundsson having to depart, and his replacement Robbie Brady also needing to be replaced.\nThere is no respite for either side, with both facing further important fixtures at the weekend.\nBurnley host West Brom, the side a place below Fulham in the table, while Parker's men welcome bottom club Sheffield United to Craven Cottage.\n'When we get ahead we need to weather something'\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche talking to Sky Sports: \"Another point on the board, we are stripped to the bare bones. A committed performance.\n\"The reaction to their goal was excellent and I thought we defended well. It's remarkably unfortunate how many injuries we have had.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker talking to Sky Sports: \"It is a tough place to come, the ball is in play not a lot, it is scrappy. We got our noses in front and disappointed with the goal we have conceded.\n\"We take the point though. That is four points so far this week. When we get ahead we need to weather something. There were a couple of mistakes for their goal.\n\"I thought we were solid, dealt with the threat of balls coming in but were not able to get our identity on it.\n\"We regroup, it has been a busy week. Every game is big for us. Six points. This team has honest belief and confidence.\"\nBurnley's best unbeaten home run extended - the stats\nBurnley are unbeaten in their past 31 home meetings with Fulham in all competitions (W25 D6), extending their longest ever unbeaten run against an opponent at Turf Moor in their history. Their last such defeat was back in April 1951 (2-0).\nFulham's 31-game winless streak away from home against Burnley in all competitions is their longest run without a victory on the road against an opponent in their history.\nThere have been just 24 Premier League goals scored at Turf Moor this season (Burnley scoring 10 and conceding 14) - the joint-lowest total at a top-flight ground in 2020-21 (level with Craven Cottage).\nFulham have gone six consecutive away games without defeat in the Premier League (W1 D5), their joint longest such run in the competition (also in August 2004 under Chris Coleman).\nBurnley have conceded the first goal of the game in eight of their 12 Premier League matches at Turf Moor this season, including each of the past five - only Sheffield United (10) have done so more often on home soil in the competition this campaign.\nThere were just 224 seconds between Ola Aina's opener for Fulham and Ashley Barnes' equaliser for Burnley.\nBurnley's Jay Rodriguez has assisted in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time in his career, with this his 196th appearance in the competition.\nBurnley's Robbie Brady is the only player to have been substituted on and off in two separate Premier League games this season.\nTrump Takes on the World: Lifting the lid on the former president's 'America First' foreign policy\nNEW The Ranganation: Romesh returns with celebrity guests, a virtual nation and his mum..."

At the moment they are the best team, they have quality, power, belief.\n\"It is very difficult to compete with them.\"\nPhil Foden fired City on their way to a 17th successive win in all competitions with a right-footed shot which hit Everton substitute Seamus Coleman on its way past Jordan Pickford.\nHard-working Everton were back on level terms five minutes later, Lucas Digne's powerful attempt coming back off the post and hitting Richarlison before flying over the line.\nHowever, a wonderful curling finish from 18 yards by Riyad Mahrez restored City's lead before Bernardo Silva beat Pickford from a similar distance in the closing stages.\nBy beating Everton they also become the first team in English top-flight history to win their opening 10 matches in a calendar year.\nHow the action unfolded at Goodison Park - plus reaction\nRuthless City marching towards title\nThis was Manchester City's game in hand after the original fixture, due to be played on 28 December 2020, was postponed after Guardiola's side reported a number of coronavirus cases.\nAt the time, City were sixth in the table - six points behind then-leaders Liverpool - but their lead is now into double figures after a 12th successive league win.\nNot that Guardiola's players are getting carried away.\n\"I have not seen that the team is thinking of the table, we have spoken about that,\" said the City boss.\n\"There are 42 points still to fight for, we are in the middle of February. Now we rest for a few days, there are so many games.\"\nCity have not trailed for a single minute in any of the last 16 Premier League matches and did not panic after Everton became the first team to score against them from open play since 3 January.\nThis latest impressive performance was achieved without Ilkay Gundogan, who has enjoyed a rich run of goalscoring form but was nursing a groin injury.\nIt looked business as usual when Foden broke the deadlock with aid of a deflection off Coleman, an early replacement after Yerry Mina suffered an injury.\nRicharlison's equaliser only served to antagonise City, who stepped up another gear after the interval to take the game out of Everton's reach.\nMahrez's strike was the pick of the goals while Silva's exquisite finish sealed another highly-satisfactory night for Guardiola's relentless side, who ended the game with Kevin de Bruyne on the pitch for the first time since 20 January after injury.\nNo reward for battling Toffees\nEverton produced a battling performance and, at one stage, threatened to become the first team since West Brom on 15 December to stop Guardiola's side from winning.\nBut like so many before them, the Toffees were undone by City's exceptional quality and now prepare for Saturday's derby at Liverpool, where they have not won since 1999, on the back of two successive league defeats.\nPickford, on his return to the side after injury, had looked set to frustrate the leaders.\nHaving dived full-stretch to deny Joao Cancelo when the game was goalless, the England keeper did well to block out Silva at 1-1 before City took the game away from the hosts.\nEverton have made progress under Ancelotti but the Italian will be frustrated by his side's stuttering run of form.\nThey are missing their injured forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin and it is now one win in six in the league which threatens their chances of a first top-four finish since 2004-05.\n'It'll be different against Liverpool' - what they said\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti: \"Manchester City are the best team and we are not at the same level.\n\"It will be a different game against Liverpool. We are on a good run away and we believe more. Liverpool are a fantastic team but in football you never know.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"Everton are well-organised, but we had the patience to attack them. It was well deserved.\n\"It was a real tough game, the pitch was not in a perfect condition in winter and they are such a physical team. It was a solid performance.\"\nIn-form Foden - the stats\nIn the top five European leagues this season, the only player younger than 20-year-old Phil Foden to score at least 11 goals in all competitions is Borussia Dortmund's Erling Braut Haaland.\nEverton have lost their last six Premier League games against Manchester City, their worst losing run against an opponent in the competition since losing nine in a row against Manchester United between 1999 and 2004.\nThe Toffees have lost three consecutive home league games for the first time since March 2016, while manager Carlo Ancelotti has suffered three in a row for the first time since November 2006 when he was AC Milan manager.\nAll four of Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez's Premier League goals against Everton have been scored at Goodison Park - his joint-favourite opposing ground in the top flight, also scoring four times at Watford's Vicarage Road and the Hawthorns, home of West Brom.\nThe only Everton player with more goals in all competitions this season than Richarlison (9) is Dominic Calvert-Lewin (18).\nWhat's next?\nEverton are away to Liverpool in the Merseyside derby on Saturday (17:30 GMT), while Manchester City have an extra day to prepare for their away match at Arsenal on Sunday (16:30).\nGrounded with Louis Theroux: The top ten unexpected revelations from his incredible guests\nHow to Avoid a Climate Disaster: Listen as Bill Gates outlines his plan to save the earth"

They have now won three of their past four games in the Premier League.\nDefeat for Leeds, meanwhile, was their second in succession having lost 4-2 to Arsenal last time out, but this was a much more even encounter and they were unlucky in the manner of the goal they conceded and not to have scored themselves.\n\"All evaluations from the game are in favour of us. The possession, the dominance and the chances,\" said Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa.\n\"We had double the chances they did to score but we didn't manage to do so.\"\nReaction to Wolves' game with Leeds\nKaren Carney column: How Neto can fill Wolves' Jimenez void\nWolves turning the tide after poor run\nThis has arguably been Wolves' most difficult season since their return to the top flight in 2018, having had to deal with the absence of key forward Raul Jimenez through injury for much of the campaign as well as a loss of form.\nA run of eight Premier League games without a win had seen them drop away from the top six into the bottom half of the table, but that poor run was halted by a victory against Arsenal at the start of February and they have not lost since.\nAgainst Leeds they looked back to their attacking best, with the excellent Pedro Neto impressing once more.\nThe 20-year-old Portugal international has stepped up in Jimenez's absence with five goals and four assists, and he was unfortunate not to be on the scoresheet.\nNeto was at his best in the first half as he had several shots on goal, notably drawing a fingertip save out of Meslier.\nWith Wolves back in form and confidence high, Neto in particular could flourish further as Nuno Espirito Santo's side have their eye on finishing in the European places again.\nNuno said: \"We still have some issues to assess but the approach that we have during these tough moments - always believing, always committing - you can't say anything about the attitude of the players.\n\"We chase the high standards we have and let's keep on doing that.\"\nLeeds feeling Phillips' absence\nLeeds are having to deal with a sizeable injury list but the absence of Kalvin Phillips is proving a particularly big blow.\nWith him in the side this season they have had a 50% win rate but that drops to just 17% without him and his absence was felt against Wolves.\nLeeds' swashbuckling attacking style will create chances - as it did against Wolves and they were unfortunate not to have taken a point as they rallied late on - but without Phillips they struggle to control the midfield.\nThe visitors gave the ball away in the centre of the pitch far too often in the first half and could have been punished before the unfortunate own goal.\nWith 32 points from 24 games, Leeds are well on the way to cementing Premier League football next season, but one of their priorities this summer will surely be finding adequate cover for Phillips.\nMeslier makes history - the stats\nWolves have won seven of their past nine top-flight league games against Leeds United (L2), and remain unbeaten in nine such meetings at Molineux (W6 D3) since a 0-2 loss in September 1973.\nNone of Leeds United's past 19 away league games have ended level - it's their longest run of away league games without a draw since a 20-game run from November 2002 to November 2003.\nWolves are the first side to complete a league double over Marcelo Bielsa in the top flight since Montpellier and Paris St-Germain defeated his Marseille side home and away in Ligue 1 in 2014-15.\nThis was just Wolves' second 1-0 win in the Premier League thanks to an own goal, the other coming against Chelsea in January 2011 when Jose Bosingwa scored. This is the first time Leeds have lost 1-0 in the Premier League after scoring an own goal.\nLeeds' Illan Meslier (20 years and 354 days) became the youngest goalkeeper to score an own goal in the Premier League.\nWolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio made seven saves to go with his clean sheet. The last Wolves goalkeeper to make more saves in a Premier League match while keeping a clean sheet was Marcus Hahnemann against Everton in March 2010, with nine.\nWhat next?\nLeeds host Southampton in the Premier League on Tuesday, 23 February (18:00 GMT), before Wolves travel to Newcastle on Saturday, 27 February (20:00).\nRugby Union Weekly: Another huge weekend in the Six Nations is unpacked by the boys\n1 Xtra's Money Moves: Top tips on a positive approach to managing your finances"

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-1 Chelsea: Ralph Hasenhuttl hopes Saints will kick on after draw\nRalph Hasenhuttl said he hoped Southampton's draw against Chelsea was the start of his side returning to their normal selves after they ended a run of six successive Premier League defeats.\nThe hosts took the lead against the run of play in the first half when Nathan Redmond played a brilliant ball to send Takumi Minamino clear and the on-loan Liverpool striker showed great composure to slot beyond Edouard Mendy.\nBut the Saints gifted Chelsea an equaliser eight minutes after the break when Danny Ings brought down Mason Mount inside the box and the Blues midfielder stepped up to send Alex McCarthy the wrong way from the penalty spot.\nChelsea were unable to kick on after that and instead it was Southampton who went closest to grabbing a winner as Jannik Vestergaard hit the crossbar with a header before Ings put the loose ball into the side-netting.\nHowever, Saints manager Hasenhuttl was satisfied with a positive result in light of their recent torrid run.\n\"A draw feels like a win,\" he said. \"It's a step towards us returning to our normal form.\"\n\"We are believing in what we are doing. The Premier League is tough. For us, it is good that we take a point from such a strong side.\"\nThe point left Chelsea in fourth place on 43 points with Southampton 13th on 30 points.\n'I was not happy with his attitude' - Tuchel critical of Hudson-Odoi\nReaction to Southampton versus Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's action\nChelsea's James talks Fifa, family and the legend Silva\nCan you name every Chelsea player to have scored a Premier League penalty?\nSaints end losing run\nSouthampton were third on 16 December but a terrible run of losses going into this game had seen then slide down into the bottom half of the table. While they may not have been looking nervously over their shoulder, arresting their alarming slide down the table had become a priority.\nFor large periods against Chelsea they were like a plucky lower league side aiming to shock a Premier League opponent. They barely saw the ball for the majority of the first half and it was from their first touch inside the Blues' area that they got the goal with a brilliantly composed finish by Minamino.\nHowever, no side has dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League than Southampton and once again they were their own worst enemy as Ings gave away a penalty with Chelsea having rarely looked like creating anything from open play.\nWhile it could have been an even better result, particularly with Vestergaard hitting the woodwork, the point is a positive against an in-form Chelsea. They will hope it provides a good base to try and build from before a tricky-looking run of four successive away games in the Premier League.\nA good test for Tuchel\nThomas Tuchel enjoyed a near perfect start to his reign at Chelsea, winning four of his first five Premier League games and drawing the other one - a goalless stalemate with Wolves in his first match in charge.\nThe Blues had never been behind during that run, so Minamino's goal - the first scored by an opposition player since Tuchel's arrival - presented a new challenge for the German in his short time so far in England.\nEven before the Southampton goal, Chelsea had struggled to break down their stubborn opponents and that continued after Mount equalised from the penalty spot.\nThe visitors' attacking play became increasingly sloppy as frustration grew with their inability to find a way through the Southampton defence, exemplified by a poor Reece James finish when he lashed over at the far post.\nTuchel showed he is not afraid to make tough decisions when things are not working for his side. He replaced Callum Hudson-Odoi on 76 minutes despite the winger having only come on at half-time and after the game was critical of the player's body language.\nFailure to win meant Chelsea missed the opportunity to strengthen their position in the top four but Tuchel will have learned a lot about how his side fare when they come up against sides set up to stifle them.\n\"We not only had possession but good possession in the opponent half, in the last 20 metres we lacked quality and that is the truth,\" said Tuchel.\n\"We lacked determination, aggressiveness and more one on one chances. We controlled 80 metres, all counter attacks and when you control the match like this and you need a penalty to score, you see the problem is clear.\"\nNo penalty blues for Chelsea - the stats\nMason Mount became the 25th different player to score a penalty for Chelsea in the Premier League, with the Blues having more penalty scorers than any other team in the competition's history.\nSouthampton ended a run of six successive Premier League defeats, the club's worst losing run in their Football League history, since winning 1-0 against Liverpool on 4 January.\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel is the 16th manager in Premier League history to avoid defeat in his first six games in the competition (W4 D2) and the first since Maurizio Sarri in September 2018, also with the Blues.\nSouthampton have lost 18 points from leading positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nChelsea are unbeaten in three away league games (W2 D1) after losing four of the five before that (W1).\nSouthampton conceded their fifth penalty goal of the league season; only in 1993-94 and 2016-17 (both six) did the Saints concede more goals from the spot in a Premier League campaign.\nSouthampton's Takumi Minamino became the first opposition player to score against Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea in all competitions, ending a run of 572 minutes without such a goal for the German manager (Antonio R\u00fcdiger scored an own-goal in game v Sheffield United).\nSouthampton scored with their first shot of the game via Takumi Minamino's opener on 33 minutes, with that strike also Saints' first touch in Chelsea's box.\nSouthampton's Nathan Redmond registered his first assist in his last 16 Premier League appearances, since July 2020 against Bournemouth.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton travel to Leeds on Tuesday, 23 February (18:00 GMT) in the Premier League while Chelsea are in Champions League action on the same night as they play Atletico Madrid in Bucharest (20:00)"

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-0 West Brom: Sam Allardyce praises 'one of best' 10-man performances\nWest Brom boss Sam Allardyce says his side produced one of the best performance by 10 men he has seen as they were held to a goalless draw by Burnley.\nThe Baggies secured their first clean sheet since 28 November despite the first-half dismissal of Semi Ajayi.\nAnd although the point did little to boost their hopes of avoiding relegation - they are 11 points adrift of safety - Allardyce was pleased with what he saw.\n\"We are showing how much we are improving,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"That was one of the best 10-man performances I have ever seen in my time.\n\"I have actually won a lot of games with 10 men, and this one well deserved a win with 10 men, but unfortunately we have to kick ourselves for missing golden opportunities.\"\nMatheus Pereira was the chief culprit in that respect. The Brazilian somehow missed his kick in the middle of the six-yard line with only Nick Pope to beat after being set up by Mbaye Diagne.\nIn the melee that followed, Pereira failed to turn home an Ainsley Maitland-Niles cross as James Tarkowski eventually cleared.\nPereira also went close in the opening period with a low shot that was heading for the bottom corner until Pope made the save.\nWhen it came to missed chances, Diagne was not blameless either, blasting against the bar from six yards after cutting inside Tarkowski.\nDarnell Furlong and Maitland-Niles also threatened the Burnley goal but the failure to score just heightened the frustrations of a West Brom side who played the final hour a man down after Ajayi was sent off for deliberate handball.\nSean Dyche's Burnley were uninspiring going forward. Indeed, the hosts were limited to just one shot on target as West Brom comfortably kept their first clean sheet in 15 matches.\nBut second-bottom West Brom remain in massive trouble, while the point nudges an uninspiring Burnley outfit a bit closer to safety despite remaining in 15th spot.\n\"I am pleased in the end because we were absolutely miles off it,\" Dyche said.\n\"I am not going to be too critical because I'm asking a lot of the players. They looked physically and mentally jaded today.\n\"Over a season's work a clean sheet is a pleasing thing and it is another point on the table. We are not the real deal and we are so stretched so I accept the point.\"\nReferee Dean back in the spotlight\nReferee Mike Dean did not take charge of a Premier League game last weekend in order to remove him from the spotlight after his recent decisions to dismiss Southampton's Jan Bednarek and West Ham's Tomas Soucek - both following the intervention of VAR - were overturned.\nThe official must have had a sense of dread as Michael Oliver told him to take another look at Ajeyi's misdemeanour.\nIn truth, this decision was straightforward and Dean had no hesitation in brandishing his 111th Premier League red card. The 52-year-old has shown 44 more than any other referee in the competition's history.\nHe explained to Furlong and Maitland-Niles as they headed for the dressing rooms at half-time that once it was determined Ajeyi's hand moved towards the ball, it had to be a red card - even though Matej Vydra had a long way to run if he was to score.\nUnder the circumstances though, it was a surprise Dean was not ushered back to the screen at the start of the second half when Albion skipper Kyle Bartley controlled a header by Conor Townsend with an outstretched arm inside his own box.\nBaggies relegation fear\nWest Brom's struggles have continued throughout Allardyce's time in charge, with their defending a major issue.\nA routine early cross from Burnley defender Matt Lowton, which picked out Jay Rodriguez unmarked between Ajeyi and Bartley, did not hint at training ground defensive work transferring to game day.\nYet, as it turned, out Burnley, lacking Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood, were largely lifeless. Josh Brownhill had a couple of efforts at goal but the Rodriguez effort was the best they had.\nBurnley did not need to win though. Their task now is to keep others - including West Brom - at bay.\nAnd just as against Manchester United last week, Allardyce will wonder how his team failed to secure maximum points.\nHow the Pereira tap-in failed to end up in the net was beyond comprehension. The only plausible explanation, other than a bobble, was momentary panic.\nAllardyce can take solace from his team looking more like the side he wants them to be - and going two games unbeaten for only the second time this season. But West Brom need points - and for the second game running, they didn't get enough.\nThe Albion manager added: \"It makes it more difficult because one more game has ticked by and we have not gained any points on teams near by to put them under pressure and make them think we are on our way and catching up.\n\"We are very, very close but unfortunately - because of our finishing today and against Manchester United - not close enough.\"\nSending off number 111 for Dean - the stats\nWest Brom's last clean sheet before this was the 1-0 win at home to Sheffield United in November.\nBurnley have won just one of their eight Premier League meetings with West Brom (D4 L3), winning 2-1 at the Hawthorns in March 2018.\nThe last two occasions West Brom have received a red card and avoided defeat in a Premier League game have both been against Burnley (also winning 1-0 in August 2017).\nSince the start of last season, Burnley have kept 24 clean sheets in the Premier League, only Manchester City (31) have more in this period.\nMike Dean brandished the 111th red card of his Premier League career - Phil Dowd is next on the list with 67.\nWest Brom defender Semi Ajayi was shown a red card for the first time in his English league career, in what was his 186th appearance (including play-offs).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley's next game is away at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, 28 February (14:00 GMT). West Brom have another game against a bottom half side, Brighton, at The Hawthorns on Saturday, 27 February (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 0-2 Everton: Toffees secure first Anfield win since 1999\nEverton produced an outstanding Merseyside derby performance to beat Liverpool at Anfield for the first time since 1999.\nIn a landmark result for both sides, Everton earned their first derby win anywhere since 2010, while Liverpool have now lost four successive home matches for the first time since 1923.\nEverton finally rid themselves of their Anfield bogey with a brilliantly drilled performance in which goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and Michael Keane were excellent, while Richarlison led the line tirelessly.\nRicharlison put Everton in front after three minutes when he latched on to a superb pass from James Rodriguez to beat Allison.\nLiverpool responded and Pickford saved well from Jordan Henderson, who went off injured in the first half, while Everton captain Seamus Coleman should have added to Richarlison's strike only to head straight at Alisson from six yards.\nSadio Mane wasted two headed chances for Liverpool in the second half while Pickford saved superbly from Salah, leaving Everton to wrap up their first derby win in 24 attempts when substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson scored from the spot with seven minutes left after Dominic Calvert-Lewin tangled with Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti was all smiles at the final whistle but this was more abject Anfield misery for his Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp, as his team's flimsy Premier League title defence crumbles.\nReaction to Everton's win at Liverpool, plus the rest of Saturday's action\nEverton finally end the hoodoo\nThis Anfield win means more than just three points for Everton. It means the end of a miserable sequence stretching back to 27 September, 1999 when Kevin Campbell gave Walter Smith's side a 1-0 win.\nSince then, Everton and their fans have endured unrelenting gloom when crossing Stanley Park - so it was no surprise this win was greeted with such joy by manager Ancelotti and his team.\nThis will be a huge psychological lift for Everton, who have now won eight of their past 12 away games and demonstrated here exactly why they are so good on their travels.\nAncelotti's smart game plan worked to perfection as he achieved the feat that eluded David Moyes in 11 years in charge as well as his successors, Roberto Martinez, Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardyce and Marco Silva.\nEverton struck early, then defended magnificently while always carrying a threat on the break, although it took heroics from keeper Pickford, the villain when Virgil van Dijk was injured in the derby at Goodison Park last October, in the vital moments to keep listless Liverpool at bay.\nKeane and Ben Godfrey were faultless in defence and once they had blunted Liverpool, Ancelotti's Everton added the second goal that ended the contest.\nAncelotti beamed as he embraced his players on the Anfield turf after the final whistle - and no-one can begrudge them their deserved celebrations.\nLiverpool hit a new low\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp gathered his players in a huddle at the start of the second half to try to galvanise a title defence that has fallen apart - and rescue a league season that is now about finding a way into the top four.\nKlopp's frustrated body language on the touchline as Everton went ahead and then defended with calm organisation and resilience, while still posing a threat, was symbolic of a Liverpool team who have lost their way.\nIf it was intended to inspire, it did not work as Liverpool failed to breach Everton and were beaten at Anfield once again.\nIt is almost unfathomable how Liverpool have declined to such an extent that after Burnley ended a 68-game unbeaten league run at Anfield, three more teams - Brighton, Manchester City and now Everton - have all arrived and gone home with the points.\nAnd to make matters worse, Henderson appears to be facing a lengthy lay-off with an injury that forced Klopp to employ his 18th central defensive pairing of the season in Ozan Kabak and Nat Phillips.\nLiverpool impressed with a 2-0 Champions League win over RB Leipzig in Budapest last Tuesday, as they did in away victories at Tottenham and West Ham in late January, but at Anfield they looked lost and for all their possession Everton were never truly shaken out of their stride.\nKlopp's side are now in sixth place, three points off the top four, with Everton level on points in seventh but having played a game fewer.\nThis is as close to a crisis that Klopp has had to deal with since becoming Liverpool manager and it will hurt even more that arch-rivals Everton have inflicted the latest blow.\n'We have to improve our finishing' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is [tough to take] but we conceded this early goal which was completely unnecessary and have to defend it better.\n\"We had to chase the game and did it well creative-wise. We created some chances in the first half and even more in the second half but we did not finish our situations off.\n\"We made one mistake in the first half and they used it.\n\"I don't like to talk today about the good stuff because we lose the game and we feel that deeply. I have to use it tomorrow and it is our lifeline to keep going.\n\"We have to improve on the finishing stuff and then we will win football games.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We are really happy, really pleased. After a long time Everton are able to win at Anfield, it is a good gift for our supporters. The performance was good. We were focused, worked hard and when we had the opportunities we were clinical.\n\"We have three points. The derby is a special game as we said before but we have to catch three points at home too. It [our form] is not good enough at home.\"\nA first for Klopp - the stats\nEverton picked up their first win over Liverpool in 24 meetings in all competitions (D12 L11) - ending what was Liverpool's longest ever unbeaten run against a single opponent.\nThis win ended Everton's run of 23 visits to Anfield to face Liverpool without a win in all competitions (D10 L13) since a 1-0 victory in September 1999.\nLiverpool manager Klopp has suffered four consecutive league defeats for the first time since November 2014 when he was in charge at Borussia Dortmund, while he has lost four in a row at home in league competition for the very first time in his managerial career.\nEverton have won eight of their 12 away league games this season (D2 L2); only in 2008-09 have they won more on the road in a Premier League campaign (nine).\nAmong defending Premier League champions, only Leicester City in 2016-17 (21) and Chelsea in 2015-16 (30) have had fewer points after 25 games the season after winning the Premier League title than Liverpool's 40 this campaign.\nRicharlison's third-minute opener was Everton's second-fastest Premier League goal scored against Liverpool, behind only Olivier Dacourt's first-minute strike in a 3-2 defeat in April 1999.\nRodriguez has provided more assists in all competitions this season than any other player for Everton (eight).\nSigurdsson has scored five away goals against Liverpool in all competitions - more than he has away at any other opponent in his career in England.\nWhat next?\nLiverpool travel to Sheffield United in the Premier League on Sunday, 28 February (19:15 GMT) while Everton host Southampton on Monday, 1 March (20:00).\nEating With My Ex: Celebrity Specials: Famous exes come face to face to answer some awkward questions\nLine of Duty series 1-5: You won't be able to stop watching this nail-biting show"

        "article_text": "Fulham 1-0 Sheffield United: Ademola Lookman goal boosts Cottagers' hopes of survival\nScott Parker says his Fulham side have enjoyed a \"massive\" week in their fight for Premier League survival after they claimed a vital win over fellow strugglers Sheffield United.\nSeven points from three games has seen the Cottagers move just three points behind Newcastle in 17th, having been 10 points adrift at the start of last Sunday.\n\"We set a challenge to the boys tonight to not get swallowed up. To worry about ourselves and put in a performance where we showed our quality. I think we did that. We showed our quality,\" said the Fulham manager.\n\"Like all these games it took one moment to win the game and it came from Ademola [Lookman] and he found the net.\n\"I'm really proud of this team because it's a huge moment. Not just this game but this week. It's been massive.\"\nParker's side had dominated for long periods but it took them until just after the hour mark to break the deadlock.\nJoachim Andersen's raking pass was superbly collected by Lookman, who profited from weak defending by Ethan Ampadu to cut inside and drill a shot through the legs of Blades goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.\nRuben Loftus-Cheek had earlier seen visiting defender George Baldock hook his goal-bound effort to safety after he prodded past Ramsdale.\nAnd while the hosts had goalkeeper Alphonse Areola to thank for a point-blank save which denied Enda Stevens an equaliser, they more than merited only their second top-flight win at Craven Cottage this term.\nSaturday's Premier League action\nFantasy Football tips for gameweek 25\nLawro's full predictions v Architects frontman Sam Carter\nFulham start to believe?\nWhile Fulham have now only lost one of their past seven top-flight matches, their biggest problem has been transforming creditable draws into victories.\nOnly Brighton have drawn more games than Parker's side this term and until Lookman delivered the game's defining moment it looked like being another occasion on which they were frustrated.\nHowever, having collected eight points from the past 12 available, Parker will now feel that his side have given themselves a chance of reeling in the clubs above them.\n\"This team have real belief and I want us to focus on us,\" Parker added.\n\"The quality that we have will ultimately get us results in this division. We are a young team who want to improve and get better. We have got something about us that you need in these moments.\"\nNewcastle, whose game in hand is at Old Trafford on Sunday, are the most obvious target but even the likes of Brighton and Burnley are now within sight.\nA third clean sheet in the past four matches augurs well in that regard but Parker will also be aware that his side need to become more clinical in front of goal.\nJust six of their 15 shots found the target and the likes of Lookman, Loftus-Cheek and Mario Lemina all had good opportunities to make the margin of victory more comfortable.\n'A ridiculous VAR decision'\nPrior to this fixture Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder had talked about the disruption that losing \"eight or nine big players\" had caused his side this season.\nAnd when Chris Basham limped off after 51 minutes it was hard not to feel some sympathy for the Blades, who have now lost 20 of their 25 matches this season.\nAlready without John Egan and long-term absentee Jack O'Connell, they had, until then, borne a resemblance to the side that had the fourth-best defensive record in the top flight last term.\nIn Basham's absence Ampadu switched back into defence and his mistake ultimately cost the Blades at least a point.\nBut to lay all the blame all at his door would be wrong. Like Fulham, Sheffield United have spent the season trying to find a formula that can provide them with goals.\nLast season Billy Sharp's second-half volley, or even Stevens' effort on goal might have crept in but this term their meagre ratio of 15 goals from 25 games has shown few signs of improving,\nAnd a late decision not to give a penalty after a VAR review when Jayden Bogle clashed with Areola was symptomatic of a campaign where they have not enjoyed too many moments of good fortune.\n\"We had opportunities to get back into the game and didn't take them,\" Wilder said.\n\"And then we had a ridiculous VAR decision. I thought it was a reckless challenge from the Fulham goalkeeper. It's a penalty. Yes I'm clutching a bit but it was a penalty all day long. No question from me.\n\"I am completely seeing a different game. The stills and watching it in slow motion, how does VAR not see that? I don't care if he's being brave or whatever. It was a ridiculous challenge. Another fine margin has cost us.\"\nSpeaking on Match of the Day, pundit Danny Murphy also suggested the Blades should have been awarded a penalty.\n\"Fulham have got away with one and I understand Chris Wilder's frustrations,\" said Murphy.\nHome comforts return for Fulham - the stats\nFulham picked up just their second victory in 14 Premier League home games (W2 D4 L8) and first since beating West Brom in November.\nSheffield United have only won two of their 28 Premier League games in London (D8 L18), winning at Chelsea in October 1992 (2-1) and Crystal Palace in February 2020 (1-0).\nSheffield United have kept fewer clean sheets than any other team in the Premier League this season (1).\nFulham have won two of their past three Premier League games (D1), as many as they'd won in their previous 24 in the competition (W2 D9 L13).\nAdemola Lookman has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other Fulham player this season (4 goals, 3 assists).\nFulham's Lookman has scored four goals in 22 Premier League appearances this season - only in 2017-18 (5 in 11 Bundesliga apps) has he netted more in a top-flight campaign.\nWhat's next?\nFulham travel to Crystal Palace in their next Premier League game on Sunday, 28 February (12:00 GMT).\nSheffield United welcome Liverpool to Bramall Lane in their next top-flight game on the same day (19:15 GMT)."

You need a bit of luck along the way but we had all the right things.\"\nAntonio - back in the Hammers' starting line-up after a two-game absence - poked the hosts in front after Hugo Lloris had failed to deal with Jarrod Bowen's cross.\nLingard's third goal in four league games was initially disallowed for offside against Pablo Fornals.\nBut VAR ruled that the Spaniard was not interfering with play when the Manchester United loanee skipped through the visiting defence before powerfully finding the far corner to make it 2-0.\nHalf-time substitute Bale set up Moura to give Spurs hope, before hitting the top of the crossbar with a fierce strike 10 minutes later.\nSon also struck the frame of the goal in stoppage time.\nThe win - Moyes' first over Jose Mourinho in 16 attempts - lifts West Ham two points clear of Chelsea in fifth, while Spurs remain in ninth.\nIn-form Hammers grind out win\nMoyes recently admitted to feeling \"uneasy\" when discussing the Hammers' place near the top of the table, but that is unlikely to die down following their seventh win in nine league matches.\nWest Ham looked much sharper from the off and deservedly took an early lead through Antonio, whose pace and physicality caused the Spurs defence all sorts of problems in the opening exchanges.\nMoyes' side limited Tottenham to just two shots on target before the break - both of which came in the final minutes of the half - and they made the perfect start to the second period when Lingard combined with Fornals before lashing beyond Lloris to continue his recent revival, having swapped red for claret and blue.\nHowever, the hosts had their backs to the wall for the rest of the game as Spurs increased the urgency, with Moura's header from Bale's cross setting up a nervy finish.\nThey rode their luck when Vladimir Coufal's clearance struck Son before looping over Fabianski and onto the outside of the post, but few could begrudge Moyes's team all three points.\nWest Ham face both Manchester clubs, Leeds and Arsenal in their next four league matches. If they can emerge from those fixtures relatively unscathed, it could set the platform for an exciting end to the campaign for Hammers fans.\nSluggish start costs Spurs\nReports on Sunday\n, external\nsuggested Mourinho's job could be at risk if Spurs failed to beat West Ham, and the Portuguese's team could hardly have made a worse start at London Stadium.\nMourinho will have been furious at the manner of the Hammers' opener, as Eric Dier failed to clear Bowen's in-swinging delivery before Lloris' fumble allowed Antonio to prod home.\nThe goal seemed to drain the confidence out of Spurs' players, who looked desperately short of ideas until Harry Kane tested Fabianski's reflexes late in the first half.\nLingard's strike left the visitors with a huge task but the introduction of Bale - a half-time replacement for Lamela - soon paid dividends.\nThe Welshman's corner was flicked in off the post by Moura to reduce the arrears, before the Real Madrid loanee skimmed the top of the crossbar from the edge of the area.\nKane - left out of Thursday's win in Budapest for fitness reasons - also went close from the edge of the box and Son almost salvaged a draw in bizarre circumstances, but it was not to be for Tottenham.\nThe result leaves Spurs nine points behind the fourth-placed Hammers, although they do have a game in hand on their London rivals.\nAntonio is West Ham's fox in the box - the stats\nTottenham Hotspur have lost five of their last six league games (W1), only picking up points in a 2-0 home victory against West Brom in this time. Their eight league defeats this season are Jose Mourinho's most since 2015-16 with Chelsea, when he was sacked after nine league defeats.\nMourinho took charge of his 50th Premier League game with Tottenham today (W23 D12 L15). The 81 points Spurs have picked up under the Portuguese is 14 fewer than he's managed with any other side throughout his first 50 league games in charge (Man Utd, 95).\nWest Ham will spend a night in the top four places in a top-flight campaign after at least 25 matches have been played, for the first time since 1985-86, when they finished the season in third.\nWest Ham's Michail Antonio has scored 42 Premier League goals and they have all come from inside the box - in the competition's history, only Tim Cahill (56), Javier Hernandez (53) and Gabriel Jesus (45) have scored more with all of them coming from inside the box.\nAntonio has scored five Premier League goals against Tottenham Hotspur, his best return against any single side in the competition.\nJesse Lingard has scored three goals in four league games under David Moyes for West Ham, as many as he netted in his 36 total league appearances under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r at Man Utd.\n'It was a big, big ask' - what the managers said\nWest Ham boss David Moyes speaking to BBC MOTD: \"It is a great result for us. Today we felt it was a big, big task. Tottenham are one of the top sides and have fantastic players. For us to get a result and keep our momentum going is really good.\n\"There was a period we could have gone 2-0 up when we went 1-0 up and we didn't take it, so that allowed Tottenham to grow in confidence as the game went on.\"\nOn Jesse Lingard's impact: \"Players want to play. They want to show what they can do. It wasn't long ago Jesse was an England international so I knew if we could get that level of player, it would improve us.\"\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho speaking to BBC MOTD: \"The way we finished the game showed it was not a physical problem that stopped us having a result.\n\"I think we did [have enough to win]. Losing 1-0 at half-time you have to lift the players and play better in the second half, which we did.\n\"You are playing against a team that fought in the second half. They defended - we attacked and created and were unlucky.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday, 27 February (12:30 GMT), while Spurs host Burnley the following day (14:00 GMT).\nEating With My Ex: Celebrity Specials: Famous exes come face to face to answer some awkward questions\nLine of Duty series 1-5: You won't be able to stop watching this nail-biting show"

We're playing some great football, but at times you have to dig in and have spirit, and we are able to do that.\"\nVilla were given a lifeline when Bertrand Traore volleyed home a loose ball, but Leicester controlled the game and held on to all three points.\nMaddison & Barnes 'caused a bit of havoc' - so will they make Euro 2020?\nReaction to Leicester's win over Aston Villa\n'I'm very proud of the team'\nWith England manager Gareth Southgate watching on, English duo Maddison and Barnes starred for Leicester in the first half.\nMaddison, 24, had been involved in eight goals in his past nine league appearances coming into this fixture, and it took him just 19 minutes to curl Leicester in front after a lay-off from Barnes.\nAnd Barnes was then in the right place moments later, tapping in after Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez parried a close-range Jamie Vardy effort.\nMaddison was substituted midway through the second half after a knock to his hip.\nBut Rodgers told BBC Sport that the change was merely a preventative measure.\n\"James had an issue with his hip last season so we'll assess that. He felt some pain, so as a precaution we took him off.\"\nHe added: \"I thought some of our football and the speed of our game was really, really good. We didn't have too many concerns defensively.\n\"I was so pleased and very proud of the team.\"\n'We'll assess Grealish as we go'\nA leg injury sustained during training meant that for the first time since November 2019, club captain Jack Grealish was not in the Aston Villa squad for a Premier League match.\n\"We will assess it as we go. It is certainly not a recurrence of an old injury and certainly not long term,\" Aston Villa boss Dean Smith told BBC Sport.\n\"I expect him to be pushing, if not for [our next game against] Leeds, then the week after; but I'll be guided by the medical staff.\n\"They haven't told me how long he'll be out for yet, so the speculation is great. We'll just see how it goes.\"\nNobody has been involved in more Villa goals than Grealish this season, and without their captain, Smith's side looked a shadow of their usual selves in the first half as they went 2-0 down.\nForward Traore halved the deficit three minutes after the restart, pouncing on a loose ball after Matt Targett's cross was flicked on by John McGinn.\nBut Leicester easily wrestled back control, with a late Tyrone Mings header the only other chance of note for the hosts.\nGrealish had started Villa's previous 48 league fixtures - but they must learn to adapt to life without him if he does not return quickly.\nMore Villa Park joy for Rodgers - the stats\nLeicester City have won back-to-back away top-flight matches against Aston Villa for the first time since October 1960.\nAston Villa have won just one of their past 21 Premier League games against sides starting the day in the top three (D4 L16), losing 11 of their past 12 such fixtures (W1).\nLeicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has won all six of his away Premier League games against Aston Villa as a manager, his best such 100% record versus an opponent in the competition.\nUnder Dean Smith, Aston Villa have averaged 1.5 points per game in league competition when Jack Grealish has featured (P80 W36 D14 L30) compared with 0.9 points per game without him (P18 W3 D7 L8), losing all three Premier League matches without the Englishman since the start of last season.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2018, Leicester's James Maddison has scored more goals from outside the area than any other player (11). This was his eighth league goal of the season, his best scoring campaign in the top flight.\nOnly Jamie Vardy (14) has scored more goals for Leicester this season than Harvey Barnes (13), who has now had a direct hand in nine goals in his past 11 Premier League matches (six goals, three assists).\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa travel to Leeds in the Premier League on Saturday, 27 February (17:30 GMT), while Leicester take on Slavia Prague in the second leg of their Europa League last-32 tie on Thursday, 25 February (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 0-1 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola surprised as winning run extends to 18 games\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola says he is surprised by his side's imperious run of form \"when everyone is suffering in this world\" as they extended their winning run to 18 games with victory at Arsenal.\nThe Premier League leaders have not dropped a point since 15 December and have taken control of the title race as they sit 10 points clear at the top of the table with 13 games remaining.\nLike other teams, they have had to deal with a congested fixture list as well Covid-19 cases within the club as the world continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic.\nGuardiola said: \"I'm surprised and impressed and so when everyone is suffering in this world, all the teams in the league are dropping points, we were consistent over the past two months and I did not expect [that].\n\"People talk and talk about the record and the victories but to do this you have to win these types of games many, many times.\n\"It is not always about winning by three or four because that is not possible.\"\nCity looked confident right from the outset at Arsenal, taking the lead with just two minutes on the clock as Raheem Sterling somehow managed to outjump Rob Holding to head in Riyad Mahrez's cross.\nThe visitors had four shots to Arsenal's none in the opening quarter of an hour and it looked as if the Gunners were in danger of being on the end of a heavy defeat as Guardiola's side poured forward at every opportunity.\nTo Arsenal's credit, they weathered that early storm and grew into the game as Kieran Tierney tested Ederson with a strong effort from distance, while there were glimpses of a threat on the break through the pace of Bukayo Saka.\nCity failed to kick on after the break although still looked the most likely to add to their lead as Kevin de Bruyne - making his first start in more than a month - lifted an effort just wide while Ilkay Gundogan saw a shot saved by Bernd Leno before Joao Cancelo clipped a lovely strike inches past the post late on.\nIn the end, a second goal was not needed as City took the three points to ensure they stay in control at the top of the standings.\nArsenal, meanwhile, are 10th and six points off the top six.\nReaction to Arsenal's game with Manchester City, plus the rest of Sunday's action\nImpressive City keep run going\nGuardiola surprised by Man City winning run\nCity have been back to their free-scoring best this season and had bagged 18 goals in their six previous Premier League games going into this fixture.\nIt looked like another high-scoring game was on the cards when they took a very early lead through Sterling, with Guardiola and his former assistant coach Mikel Arteta having barely finished exchanging pleasantries on the touchline when the ball was being picked out of the Arsenal net.\nBut the additional goals failed to materialise as City were uncharacteristically not at their best in the final third, with Gabriel Jesus launching well over late on after a quick counter, while Gundogan and De Bruyne could arguably have done better with their opportunities.\nWhile it was a narrow win in the end, it was one that never really looked in doubt, with Ederson making just the one save all game.\nThis was City's 23rd clean sheet of the season, more than any other team in the top five European leagues or top four divisions in England, while they have not been behind in any of their past 17 Premier League games.\nThe victory also equalled a club record 11 successive away wins in all competitions. Impressive statistics for City, worrying ones for any side hoping to somehow deny them a third league title in four seasons.\nSaka shines as Arsenal recover from worrying start\nArsenal had gone into this game having lost in their past seven league meetings with City, so a victory against Guardiola's in-form side always looked a tall order.\nTheir dreadful start, when they were completely overpowered by their opponents, suggested this was not just going to be another defeat, but also a hefty one.\nWhile Ederson was never really troubled in the City goal, Arsenal had their moments with Saka once again particularly lively.\nThe 19-year-old's pace on the counter meant City could never truly relax and perhaps accounted for why the visitors failed to go on and win by a bigger margin.\nSaka was lining up on the left, despite having got more goals and assists on the right this season, so could arguably have provided even more of a threat if he had started this game in that position.\nRegardless, while Arteta will be unhappy that his side did not threaten Ederson's goal more, he can be happy that they did not at least crumble after their poor start.\n\"When we conceded the first goal it put us in a difficult situation,\" Arteta said.\n\"It was tough. With the formation and the players they use they are really comfortable.\n\"We got something wrong. We didn't do it in the first 10 minutes. It's a cross and Raheem Sterling cannot head a ball there.\"\nTowards the end of the game, Arsenal used a concussion substitute for the first time in the Premier League when Holding went off after he had collided with Cancelo. He was replaced by David Luiz.\nSterling scores on the road again - the stats\nArsenal have now lost each of their past eight league games against Manchester City - their joint-longest run of consecutive league defeats against an opponent, along with an eight-game run versus Leeds United between 1973 and 1976.\nArsenal have lost their past four Premier League games against Manchester City without scoring a goal. This is the first time in their history they have failed to score in four consecutive home league games against an opponent.\nManchester City are unbeaten in their past 25 games across all competitions (W22 D3) - their second-longest run without defeat under Guardiola, after a 28-game spell between April and December 2017.\nThis was Manchester City's 15th clean sheet in the Premier League this season - the most by a team after 25 games of a top-flight campaign since 2008-09, when both Manchester United (19) and Chelsea (15) had as many.\nSince the start of last season, no player has scored more away goals than Sterling in the Premier League (20). Indeed, Sterling's total is twice as many as Manchester City's second-highest away scorer in this period (Gabriel Jesus, 10).\nManchester City's Sterling is the third player to score in three consecutive away games against Arsenal in the Premier League, after Nicolas Anelka (four games ending in May 2009) and Ian Harte (three games ending in May 2003).\nManchester City's opener after 75 seconds was the first time they've scored in the opening two minutes of a Premier League game since December 2019, which was also away at Arsenal (Kevin de Bruyne after 89 seconds).\nWhat next?\nManchester City switch their attention to the Champions League as they face Borussia Monchengladbach in Budapest in the last 16 on Wednesday, 24 February (20:00 GMT), while Arsenal play Benfica in Athens in the second leg of their Europa League last-32 tie (17:55 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 3-1 Newcastle United: Marcus Rashford plays key role in home win\nMarcus Rashford played a key role in a win over struggling Newcastle as Manchester United returned to second place in the Premier League.\nThe England striker helped the hosts overcome a stuttering start when he lashed in an 18th goal of the season by beating Karl Darlow at the near post after 30 minutes.\nAllan Saint-Maximin then scored a deserved equaliser with his first goal since coming back from a two-month absence caused by coronavirus symptoms, slamming in after Harry Maguire failed to clear.\nThe Newcastle winger threatened again early in the second half, but the game turned after 57 minutes when Daniel James re-established the lead.\nThat led to the visitors' confidence draining away, with Rashford then earning a penalty as he drew a foul from Joe Willock before Bruno Fernandes knocked in his 22nd goal of the season.\nDefeat for Steve Bruce's side was an eighth in 10 Premier League games, leaving them three points above the drop zone - and a relegation scrap with Fulham is now set to ensue.\nFor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, it was only a second win in six league matches, and a welcome victory after a draw at West Brom last weekend.\nBut they remain 10 points behind leaders Manchester City, who beat Arsenal earlier on Sunday.\nSolskjaer's side grind through gears\nOn the face of it, this looked as if it would be a routine win for the hosts over a team fighting for Premier League survival.\nBut although Solskjaer insisted that his team had \"found themselves a little bit\" after the 4-0 win over Real Sociedad in the Europa League on Thursday, there were still signs here of the concerns that have plagued his team for much of the season.\nManchester United were slow to start and jittery in defence. David de Gea was called into action early on and almost gifted Newcastle a goal with a poor backpass. Fernandes, normally their talisman, was quiet for much of the game before a trademark penalty.\nBut in contrast to Newcastle, Solskjaer's side have matchwinners all over the pitch. When they went ahead, it was from their first proper chance.\nRashford skipped past Emil Krafth on the touchline, before cutting inside and unleashing a fierce shot, although Darlow should have stopped his near-post effort.\nThe lead only lasted six minutes, however, as a short corner was played to Willock and his cross was half-headed away by Maguire, allowing Saint-Maximin to fire in.\nThe home side - missing the injured Scott McTominay and several coaching staff who were self-isolating - also started the second period quietly. Solskjaer's concern was evident on the touchline, before James gave them breathing space.\nThe Welsh winger, who scored in midweek, was rewarded with his first Premier League start since 26 December and lashed past Darlow at his near post again. As Newcastle retreated, the hosts moved up the gears before Fernandes sealed victory.\nIt was not a vintage display, but it did not need to be as Solskjaer's side finally found their rhythm, allowing them to hand a debut to 17-year-old Shola Shoretire as they extended their run to one defeat in 19 Premier League games.\nNewcastle confidence drains as relegation battle begins\nIf Bruce did not regard his team as being a relegation battle before this week, then they certainly are now.\nFulham's seven-point yield in the past week means the 10-point gap between Newcastle and the relegation zone - as it was two weeks ago - now stands at three.\nBruce's side have shown an upturn in form in recent weeks, with wins over Everton and Southampton, but this game underlined the value of absent top scorer Callum Wilson, who is set to be out for another month with a hamstring injury.\nIt was tempting to wonder whether Wilson would have profited from Newcastle's early chances. Joelinton looked hesitant when there were several early opportunities to go ahead. Jonjoe Shelvey also skied over.\nHaving gone behind, though, at least Newcastle showed a response. Saint-Maximin, who was struck down by coronavirus symptoms for most of December and January, looked sharp and tested De Gea before he scored.\nHis emotional celebration hinted at the difficulties he has been through this season, and he could have put the visitors ahead when he fired at De Gea following a well-worked free-kick routine.\nBut James' goal and the manner of it undermined all their hard work. When the ball was played across their box by Nemanja Matic, Jamal Lewis failed to clear as Fernandes got a vital touch and Darlow was beaten at the near post again.\nOnce Willock failed to keep his composure as Rashford danced into the penalty area, conceding a penalty, there was no way back from Bruce's side.\nPerhaps a win at Old Trafford was not to be expected, but with games against Wolves, West Brom, Aston Villa and Brighton to come, Newcastle will need to pick up points quickly.\nGoal-hungry Man Utd - the key stats\nManchester United have scored 53 goals in 25 games in the Premier League this term - their most at this stage of a top-flight campaign since the 2012-13 season (60), which was the last time they won the title.\nNewcastle have lost each of their past 21 away games against opponents starting the day in the Premier League's top three, in a run dating back to February 2012.\nMarcus Rashford's opener for Manchester United was his 40th goal in all competitions since the beginning of last season, with only Raheem Sterling (44), Harry Kane (45) and Mohamed Salah (47) managing more among all Premier League players.\nManchester United's Bruno Fernandes (15 goals, 10 assists) is the third player within Europe's top five leagues this season to reach double figures for both goals and assists in league matches, alongside Harry Kane (13 goals, 11 assists) and Thomas Muller (10 goals, 10 assists).\nDaniel James has scored five goals in 13 games for Manchester United this season, one more than he managed in 46 games across all competitions last season.\nOnly Callum Wilson (15) has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than Allan Saint-Maximin for Newcastle this season (five - two goals, three assists), despite this only being the Frenchman's 11th start in the competition this term.\nWhat next?\nManchester United face Real Sociedad in the second leg of their last 32 Europa League last-32 tie with a 4-0 lead on Thursday (20:00 GMT) before travelling to Chelsea next Sunday in the Premier League (16:30).\nNewcastle host Wolves in the Premier League next Saturday (20:00).\nEating With My Ex: Celebrity Specials: Famous exes come face to face to answer some awkward questions\nLine of Duty series 1-5: You won't be able to stop watching this nail-biting show"

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-2 Crystal Palace: Late Christian Benteke goal stuns Seagulls\nBrighton defender Joel Veltman says the manner of their Premier League defeat by Crystal Palace felt like \"a robbery\" that has pushed them towards the \"danger zone\".\nThe Netherlands international swept in an equaliser for the Seagulls after Jean-Philippe Mateta had earlier backheeled Palace in front from their first real attack.\nBut while Graham Potter's side dominated possession and had 25 shots on goal, a remarkable conclusion saw Christian Benteke volley a dramatic winner for Palace deep into added time with only their second shot on target.\nThe result sees Palace move up to 13th with Brighton in 16th, just four points above a resurgent Fulham in 18th and at risk of being drawn into a relegation battle.\n\"It is unbelievable. They are getting away with it,\" said Veltman. \"It feels like a robbery of our points. The chances we didn't finish and they had half a chance and Benteke scored. We have to score more.\n\"Because of this result we are getting in the danger zone. We have to react and West Brom away is a very important game.\"\nHow Brighton v Crystal Palace unfolded\nWasteful Brighton rue missed chances\nHaving come into this fixture on the back of a six-game unbeaten run Brighton fans could have been forgiven for looking at the second half of the season with optimism.\nHowever, they will now be concerned at the prospect of their side being dragged into a fight for top-flight survival.\nWhile Potter's side play adventurous and easy-on-the-eye football, their ability to score goals has undoubtedly contributed to their current predicament.\nTen days after frustratingly failing to convert any of their 26 shots on goal against Aston Villa, they at least went one better this time around courtesy of Veltman.\nThe 29-year-old's left-foot effort had looked like being a springboard for them to find a winner but they somehow contrived to lose a fixture in which they enjoyed 75% of the ball and forced 13 corners while conceding none.\nPotter will desperately hope that his forward players can now step up and provide the firepower that they will need to edge to safety.\nThe likes of top scorer Neal Maupay, who has scored just three goals in his last 19 Premier League appearances, endured another difficult evening, while Danny Welbeck, Lewis Dunk, Pascal Gross and Adam Lallana were all wasteful when presented with good opportunities.\nHodgson's plan works to perfection\nArriving on the south coast without the influential Wilfried Zaha, and after disappointing defeats by Leeds and Burnley, few would have expected Palace to collect maximum points from this encounter.\nBut while the manner in which they achieved it was extraordinary, manager Roy Hodgson will be delighted by the way his side persevered and soaked up sustained periods of pressure.\nHe will also feel vindicated by the five changes he made to his team from their defeat to the Clarets.\nJoel Ward and Tyrick Mitchell both completed their defensive duties diligently, while no player made more clearances than Gary Cahill (nine) at the heart of the Eagles' defence.\nOn-loan Mainz forward Mateta had the physical presence to hold off Ben White before scoring a delightful opener, while Andros Townsend, another player returning to Hodgson's starting XI, dug out a wonderful late cross for Benteke to score the winner.\n'It's sore' - what they said\nBrighton manager Graham Potter speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's sore, I'm bitterly disappointed with the result because I thought we were the team pushing all the way, trying to get the winner ourselves.\n\"We have to respond, accept it and as painful as it is we have to move forward. You are watching the game, watching the team, we are trying to find the solution to score and to get punished at the end is a painful one.\n\"That's the nature of the league, how punishing it is, we have done a lot but clearly not enough. Whoever it had come against it would be painful because we were dominant in the game. The boys were doing everything to score, it felt like it was always in their penalty box never mind their half.\n\"I don't think we played badly, but results-wise we have to be disappointed and respond.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson to BBC Sport: \"It's always great to score in the last minute, especially when we had to soak up a lot of pressure.\n\"The defending was very good, they threw their bodies on the line. We worked hard to make certain they didn't get many sights at goal. We didn't create as many chances we would like. The two we created from crosses were goals.\n\"Tonight from the very start we showed we'd make it hard for them to score. The bodies were there, headers were there, blocks were there. We took maximum advantage from the counter-attack.\n\"We get so hung up on statistics these days. The game is decided by goals. Goals are a question of how well you take your chances and defend theirs.\"\nMonday Blues for Brighton - the stats\nBrighton have never won a Premier League game on a Monday (D6 L3), with only Hull City (10) playing more games on this day of the week without ever winning in the competition's history.\nCrystal Palace have accrued their joint-best tally of points in a Premier League season after 25 games (32 pts), matching their haul at this stage in 2015/16.\nCrystal Palace's opener ended a run of 343 minutes without conceding at home in the Premier League for Brighton, since a 3-3 draw with Wolves at the Amex on January 2nd.\nCrystal Palace mustered just four shots against Brighton this season, the joint-lowest tally across two games by any side against an opponent in a Premier League season (since 03/04) but managed to score with three of them (1-1 in October and 2-1 in this game).\nCourtesy of goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta and Joel Veltman, both Crystal Palace and Brighton boast 12 different scorers in the Premier League this season - excluding own goals, only Chelsea (15), Manchester City and West Ham (14 each) have had more different scorers in the competition this campaign.\nCrystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta scored via his only touch in the Brighton box, thus becoming the 123rd French scorer in the Premier League, with only England posting more different scorers in the competition (848).\nCrystal Palace's Jordan Ayew registered his third assist in six Premier League games, just one fewer than he managed in his 72 appearances for the club in the competition before that (four).\nJoel Veltman netted his first Premier League goal for Brighton in his 19th appearance for the club, with his seventh shot and third shot on target in the competition.\nChristian Benteke's winner for Crystal Palace came on 94 minutes and eight seconds - the third latest winning goal in a Premier League game this season after Bruno Fernandes in September (Man Utd v Brighton - 99:45) and Pedro Neto in December (Wolves v Chelsea 94:42).\nBrighton's Lewis Dunk made his 132nd Premier League appearance this evening, with all of those appearances coming as a starter - only 11 outfield players have a better 100% record in the competition's history.\nNo player has started more Premier League games for Crystal Palace than Joel Ward (205, level with Wilfried Zaha).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to The Hawthorns to face West Bromwich Albion in their next Premier League match on Saturday, 27 February (15:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "Leeds 3-0 Southampton: Patrick Bamford helps Whites to victory over Saints\nPatrick Bamford scored his 13th goal of the season to help Leeds end a run of back-to-back defeats to extend Southampton's own winless run to a far more worrying eight matches.\nThe striker struck early in the second half, timing his run to perfection to beat offside and latch on to Tyler Roberts' through-ball before firing a low shot into the far corner.\nA neat Stuart Dallas finish from the edge of the box and Raphinha's superb free-kick sealed the points.\nPrior to the opener Leeds had been somewhat on the back foot, with Jan Vestegaard and Nathan Tella spurning good early chances for the Saints, who were also aggrieved at two refereeing decisions.\nThe first was a penalty awarded on the pitch after Tella went down in the box, but rightly overruled with VAR showing the forward kicked defender Diego Llorente and not the other way round.\nThey were more unhappy that a quickly taken free-kick and Che Adams finish that was ruled out, with Andre Marriner indicating that he had not blown his whistle to recommence play.\nThe home side could have all-but wrapped up the points in the five minutes after the opener, but Roberts fired inches wide before Bamford saw a shot well-saved by Alex McCarthy.\nThe Saints goalkeeper also saved brilliantly with his foot to stop Llorente scoring his first Leeds goal from close range.\nDanny Ings started on the bench for the Saints and was introduced with half an hour to play to little effect.\nTo rub salt in the visitor's wounds, Oriol Romeu, who had earlier prevented Raphinha shooting after he had broken away with a superb sliding tackle, added to his side's injury problems by limping off.\nThe win takes Leeds up to 10th in the table with 35 points from their 25 games. Southampton are five points worse off and eight clear of Fulham, whose form has been picking up as the Saints' has been crumbling.\nAction and reaction from Leeds v Southampton in the Premier League\nFirst goal crucial as Leeds underline top-flight credentials\nIf Ralph Hasenhuttl's Saints are to arrest the slide, they must now do so on the road, with each of their next three fixtures being away from St Mary's - at Everton, Sheffield United and Manchester City.\nThey came into this away fixture - billed by Hasenhuttl as their \"most intense game\" - with some confidence after taking a point off Chelsea courtesy of a battling display.\nAnd they matched fire with fire early on, pressing high and forcing Leeds into numerous errors on a slippery pitch Bamford described afterwards as more like a winter wonderland than a Premier League surface.\nHowever, as the game wore on and chances went begging, it was clear that the first goal would be crucial.\nBamford's low finish - the first truly incisive strike of the game - proved that, handing Leeds the momentum and adding further weight to the striker's England case.\nWith Saints now forced to commit more men forward in pursuit of a goal, it left Leeds the space to exploit, which they did with aplomb.\nSwitching Raphinha to the left and replacing Jack Harrison with Helder Costa gave the Saints full-backs a new problem they were unable to solve.\nIt was the substitute who set up Dallas for the second goal, which the Northern Irish international dispatched with the tip of his boot.\nAnd Raphinha added the icing with a superb whipped free-kick into the bottom corner after Costa had been dragged down on the edge of the box.\nNobody at Leeds will say so, but with 35 points on the board they must surely now be safe from making an immediate return to the Championship.\nSouthampton still have work to do.\n'First half good, second half disaster'\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa tells BBC Sport: \"The difference of the three goals is different to how it was between the two teams, even if I think the victory was deserved. Throughout the game it was difficult to establish differences between the two teams. Even if we had a good offensive game - we created double the chances they did - the dominance alternated.\n\"When the games are so close, the team that scores first gets the advantage. It is not definitive but has weight.\n\"Raphinha is a player very necessary because he can unbalance teams by himself. Our game is based on combinations and to have a player who can combine and create in individual actions, that is very important.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl tells BBC Sport: \"First half good, second half disaster.\n\"We deserved to lose today because in the second half we have not been playing what we should be against this team. In the first half we showed we can compete as a team, the second half balls in behind was causing us problems and that is too easy. No chance to get something here.\n\"They came out and played more long balls in behind but the timing for us was horrible, we got caught too many times. The closing down was difficult in the second half and nothing worked quite well. It was deserved, they killed us in the second half.\"\nNo English player has more Premier League goals than Bamford\nNo English player has scored more Premier League goals this season than Patrick Bamford (13, level with Harry Kane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin).\nPatrick Bamford has been directly involved in more goals in all competitions under Marcelo Bielsa than any other Leeds player (48 - 39 goals, 9 assists).\nTyler Roberts has registered two assists in his last three league appearances for Leeds, as many as he managed in his previous 40.\nStuart Dallas has netted five Premier League goals this season for Leeds, only once before managing more in a single league campaign (6 in 2014/15 for Brentford).\nLeeds' Stuart Dallas has scored five league goals this season, the most by a Northern Irishman in the Premier League since Gareth McAuley (six) in 2016-17.\nRaphinha's strike was Leeds' first direct free-kick goal in the Premier League March 2004, when Stephen McPhail scored against Manchester City.\nLeeds have scored 43 goals in the Premier League this season, last netting more after 25 games of a top-flight campaign in 1991-92 when they won the First Division (48).\nSouthampton have lost seven of their last eight Premier League games (D1), after suffering just two defeats in their 15 before that (W8 D5).\nLeeds have kept clean sheets in consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since February 2003 (a run of 4).\nSouthampton have failed to score in four of their last five away Premier League games, as many goalless performances as they managed in their previous 31on the road.\nWhat next?\nLeeds have the chance to overtake Aston Villa in the table when they host Dean Smith's side on Saturday, 27 February (17:30 GMT). Southampton face three more away games on the bounce, starting with the trip to Everton on Monday, 1 March (20:00).\nThat Peter Crouch Podcast: The boys are back and wondering when Peter was at 'peak Crouch'\nEvil Genius: Was Alfred Hitchcock a real life horror?"

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 West Ham United: Pep Guardiola's side claim 20th straight win\nManchester City extended their winning run to 20 matches and moved 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League as John Stones' second-half strike was enough to secure victory over a resilient West Ham United.\nStones fired home his fourth goal of the season from Riyad Mahrez's neat lay-off to keep Pep Guardiola's side in control of the title race.\nFourth-placed West Ham gave City a decent game at Etihad Stadium and fought back to level through Michail Antonio before the break, after Stones' central-defensive partner Ruben Dias had put the hosts in front.\nBut Guardiola, likened to celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal by Hammers counterpart David Moyes before Saturday's fixture, once again came up with the right ingredients as his side improved following the second-half introductions of Gabriel Jesus and Phil Foden.\nCity's unbeaten record now stretches to 27 games and they will equal their longest run without defeat if they do not lose against Wolves on Tuesday.\nFollow reaction from Man City's win, plus the rest of Saturday's live Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Dot Major from electro-pop band London Grammar\nNormal service resumed for De Bruyne\nAfter about 20 minutes, City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne lined up a free-kick, about 40 yards out, to the right of the West Ham box.\nThe execution was terrible - the ball barely got off the ground and ran straight into the wall, allowing the visitors to clear. It was a notable moment because it was so unusual.\nWhat De Bruyne did with another crossing opportunity from a similar position not long afterwards was more in keeping with the Belgian's normal standards.\nDelivered with his left foot, the ball curled towards goal, too far out for stand-in West Ham keeper Darren Randolph to come for, and begged Dias to head it home.\nIt was De Bruyne's 11th assist of the season - equal with Tottenham's Harry Kane - and proved to be a rare moment of inspiration for a City side well shackled up to that point, with the returning Sergio Aguero barely having a touch.\nThe Argentina forward has been beset by a series of setbacks since last summer.\nHe made it to the second half this time around after being replaced at the break on his last Premier League start, also against West Ham in October.\nBut the 32-year-old was off the pace and did not react quickly enough to tap home a De Bruyne cross on City's last attack before he was replaced by Jesus after an hour.\nBeaten but not broken Hammers\nThey may have been beaten but West Ham did enough to show there is substance behind their drive towards the top end of the Premier League this season.\nJesse Lingard's arrival on loan from Manchester United during the transfer window has added another attacking element to their play and restored the 28-year-old forward to the form that brought him England recognition.\nLingard had a powerful shot blocked by Stones and it was his misdirected effort that was turned home by Antonio to pull the Hammers level.\nConsidering it was the first time an opposition player had scored at the Etihad since Mohamed Salah's penalty for Liverpool on 8 November, it was no mean achievement.\nThere were moments when it appeared West Ham might take it further as the pace of Lingard and Antonio, allied to the midfield industry of Declan Rice - who Guardiola said he admired in the build-up - caused anxiety in the home defence.\nAntonio hit a post just before he scored and, in injury time, Issa Diop had goalkeeper Ederson scrambling to reach a header that bounced narrowly wide.\nCity eventually found a winner though, just as they have done every other time they have played West Ham at home with Guardiola in charge.\nMoyes' side are now relying on Manchester United avoiding defeat at Chelsea on Sunday to preserve their place in the top four.\nGuardiola brings up 500 and 200 - the stats\nManchester City's victory was former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola's 500th as a manager.\nIt was also his 200th win as City boss in his 273rd game in charge - the fewest games needed by a manager of an English top-flight side to reach that mark.\nCity are now unbeaten in 27 matches - winning 24. It is their second-longest such run in their history, after 28 games between April and December 2017.\nDias scored his first goal for City, becoming their 19th different scorer this season. Excluding own goals, they have had more different scorers than any other Premier League side in all competitions in 2020-21.\nAntonio became the first West Ham player to score home and away against Manchester City in a league season since Iain Dowie in 1995-96.\nAntonio's equaliser was the first home Premier League goal City have conceded since 15 December - a Dias own goal against West Brom - and it ended their 629-minute run.\n'We were not going to paint anything beautiful' - what the managers said\nManchester City manager Guardiola, speaking to BT Sport: \"It was really difficult. They have the physicality, they have the quality of players.\n\"After 10 or 15 minutes today we realised we were not going to paint anything beautiful. When you play a lot of games - in the league and then the Champions League - this is normal.\n\"We were lucky to get all three points. The mathematics matter at the end of the season.\"\nWest Ham boss Moyes, speaking to the BBC's Match of the Day: \"I'm really disappointed we didn't get a point. It was a terrific performance. We came here and tried to match a top side - and for long periods we did.\n\"I can't promise to deliver European football to West Ham. I've hoped that we can try and be top 10. We can't get carried away because we're up against teams who are used to being at the top of the league.\n\"We're the newcomers, for sure, but we've put on a good show and I hope this performance gives us momentum and energy for the rest of the season.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester City are next in action on Tuesday when they entertain Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League (20:00 GMT). West Ham's exit from the FA Cup means they are spared a rearranged midweek game and now have a nine-day break before the host Leeds United on 8 March (20:00).\nGordon Ramsay's Bank Balance: Can contestants beat the balance board and walk away with \u00a3100,000?\nLockdown and food: Why it causes emotional eating habits and how can we manage them?"

        "article_text": "West Brom 1-0 Brighton: Bizarre defeat for Seagulls after free-kick confusion\nBrighton lost 1-0 at West Brom - but the scoreline does not even begin to tell the story of a match in which the visitors had a goal ruled out after referee Lee Mason blew his whistle twice, and also missed two penalties.\nLewis Dunk's quick free-kick in the first half sparked a chaotic few minutes as the goal was disallowed, then allowed, then eventually ruled out for good after Mason had viewed the incident on the pitchside monitor following an intervention by the video assistant referee (VAR).\nWest Brom defender Kyle Bartley had given his side an early lead and Brighton were unable to respond, with Pascal Gross hitting the crossbar and Danny Welbeck smashing the left post from the penalty spot.\nBrighton, who dominated possession again, had numerous chances to score either side of the break - Neal Maupay skewing a shot wide and Aaron Connolly firing over the bar from close range.\nBut West Brom, who had a few chances of their own, hung on to pick up a potentially vital three points in their attempt to avoid relegation.\nReferee Mason lost control of Brighton game - 'Fact', says Dunk\nFollow Saturday's Premier League live\nFree-kick confusion and whistle chaos...\nBrighton searched for a first-half equaliser and thought they had found one - only for it to be taken away almost immediately in remarkable and bizarre circumstances.\nDunk quickly slotted a free-kick into the bottom right corner after Mason blew his whistle while West Brom were still setting up their wall.\nBut almost as soon as he had blown, Mason did so again - then Dunk and his team-mates began celebrating the goal.\nIt was ruled out by the referee - but Mason quickly overturned his decision as Brighton's players strongly appealed against it, arguing Dunk's free-kick had been taken after the first whistle was blown.\nVAR then intervened, prompting Mason to run over to the pitchside monitor to review a potential offside and also whether his second whistle had come before the ball had crossed the goalline.\nThe referee tried to communicate what was going on with the two managers. Sam Allardyce looked confused - the West Brom boss standing with his hands on his head in disbelief - while Brighton's Graham Potter responded with a blank expression.\nEventually the goal was disallowed because it was deemed Mason's second whistle had been blown before the ball crossed the line.\nThe flurry of chances from both sides in the immediate aftermath was a fitting end to a bizarre and enthralling half of football - and officiating.\nWelcome home win for Baggies\nAllardyce said before the match he felt West Brom needed to pick up two wins from their three successive home games, including this one.\nThey started on the front foot, forcing two early corners which they were unable to take advantage of.\nBut their bright opening did lead to them going in front on 11 minutes when Bartley drifted away from his marker at the back post to nod in Conor Gallagher's perfect delivery.\nThe Baggies dropped off after taking the lead, allowing Brighton to dominate possession, and on another day could easily have conceded three or four goals.\nThe two missed penalties and several other clear-cut chances not being converted was a huge slice of luck for West Brom, but they defended resiliently nonetheless - Bartley's last-ditch tackle on Jakub Moder in the 86th minute typifying this.\nThe result means the hosts are now eight points from safety in the Premier League table, after a first win at home for three months.\nMissed penalties and countless chances\nAfter last week's defeat by Crystal Palace - when Brighton had 25 shots on goal only for Christian Benteke to volley a dramatic winner deep into added time with Palace's second effort on target - it felt like a repeated nightmare for the Seagulls.\nOkay Yokuslu's handball gifted Brighton a penalty shortly after Bartley's opener, but Gross stuttered in his run-up before smacking the ball against the crossbar.\nThe confusion over Dunk's free-kick followed, before Connolly forced a save from Sam Johnstone, Maupay skewed Gross' cut-back wide and then the Frenchman was denied again by the Baggies keeper in a frantic few minutes of stoppage time at the end of the first half.\nConnolly then missed again from a few yards out when Johnstone parried Maupay's shot after the restart, and Joel Veltman nodded over from an unmarked position.\nBrighton seemed incapable of scoring and when they were awarded a second penalty, for a foul on Gross by Conor Townsend, Welbeck thumped it against the post.\nIt summed up a frustrating afternoon.\nWhat the managers said\nWest Brom boss Sam Allardyce, speaking to the BBC's Match of the Day: \"I am just laughing about how bizarre this game was. Obviously the most important thing for us was a clean sheet and a corner we converted very well.\n\"[There were] lots of chances after that for both teams - we managed to get the one and they managed to not score any of theirs.\"\nBrighton boss Potter, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It is what it is. We've not helped ourselves with the two penalties so I cannot put it all down to that [disallowed goal].\n\"We need to improve and get better at that [taking penalties]. We're never going to get two better chances.\n\"We have to stay calm.\"\nFive home wins, five different bosses - the best of the stats\nBrighton are the first team to miss two penalties by hitting the woodwork in a Premier League game.\nWest Brom have kept consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since May 2018.\nThe Baggies' past five home Premier League wins have come under a different manager - Allardyce, Slaven Bilic, Darren Moore, Alan Pardew and Tony Pulis.\nBrighton have lost their past two league matches, as many as in their previous 12 combined. They have had 40 shots in those two defeats, while facing just nine in return.\nFive of the 10 league goals scored by West Brom under Allardyce have come via set-piece situations (two corners, two penalties, one throw-in).\nJohnstone became the first goalkeeper to reach 100 or more saves in the Premier League this season.\nGross has failed to convert two of his past four penalties in the Premier League, also missing against Fulham in September 2018.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom welcome Everton to the Hawthorns on Thursday, 4 March (18:00 GMT kick-off), while Brighton host in-form Leicester City on Saturday, 6 March (20:00 GMT).\nGordon Ramsay's Bank Balance: Can contestants beat the balance board and walk away with \u00a3100,000?\nLockdown and food: Why it causes emotional eating habits and how can we manage them?"

        "article_text": "Leeds United 0-1 Aston Villa: Villa six points off top four after win\nAston Villa moved within six points of the top four with an impressive victory over Leeds United on a difficult pitch at Elland Road.\nAnwar El Ghazi scored the only goal, brilliantly controlling Ollie Watkins' cross and firing past Illan Meslier after just five minutes.\nDean Smith's side, still shorn of injured captain Jack Grealish, looked comfortable against Leeds who, despite winning their last two home games against Crystal Palace and Southampton, lacked penetration throughout.\nDespite the defeat, Marcelo Bielsa's United are still secure in 10th position with 35 points from their 26 games, just four points behind a rejuvenated Villa, who have games against Sheffield United, Wolves and Newcastle coming up as they look to strengthen their bid for European qualification.\nNo Grealish, no problem\nSmith has refuted accusations Aston Villa are a one-man team but there is no doubting they are a more dangerous outfit when Grealish is available.\nBefore this match, their win percentage in the last three seasons dropped from 42% with Grealish to 17% without and his absence played a role in their laboured defeat by Leicester City last weekend.\nAnd Smith's insistence that his team have other options was proved when their attacking players combined skilfully to secure this win.\nEl Ghazi had an impressive goal streak pre-Christmas and he rediscovered his scoring touch in fine fashion, ghosting in behind the Leeds defence to bury Watkins' strongly hit pass.\nHe showed further attacking intent shortly after, twice stinging Meslier's palms with shots from distance.\nThis victory though owed as much to their miserly defence - only Manchester City and Chelsea have conceded fewer goals in the Premier League - and this was their 13th clean sheet of the campaign.\nCredit must go to Smith as well for making changes in midfield, he brought in Marvelous Nakamba and Jacob Ramsey to form an impenetrable barrier in front of the back four.\nNow, with two games in hand on the sides above, Villa will be plotting a return to Europe for the first time since 2010.\nLeeds quietened on difficult pitch\nBielsa's team have caught the eye in the Premier League for their slick interplay and persistent goal threat.\nBoth qualities were in evidence against Southampton last Tuesday in a commanding 3-0 victory.\nHowever, on a pitch that looked increasingly threadbare, their dominance of possession did not bring many chances against Villa's stubborn backline.\nIndeed, Leeds completed more than twice as many passes as their visitors but rarely threatened, particularly in a second half that featured no shots on target.\nIn-form Raphinha was well shackled by Ahmed El Mohamady and top scorer Patrick Bamford, who hit a stunning hat-trick in the reverse fixture, was hardly involved, bar a first minute shot that failed to trouble Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez.\nTyler Roberts had a good sight of goal midway through the first half but hit his effort straight at Martinez.\nUnited's performance was summed up by Raphinha heading the ball into the ground and over the bar when well placed in the final moments.\n'Game plan worked' - what they said\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith told BBC Sport: \"Not many people would have fancied us against Leeds and they make you work hard. We got an early goal and showed lots of character.\n\"We've got the chance [to finish in the top six] but there are some top teams in there. We'll just take it game by game.\"\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa told BBC Sport: \"We dominated 80% of the game and the goal they scored was opportunism. In the first half we created enough chances to score a goal but in the second half we couldn't finalise the attacks.\"\nVilla end Elland Road hoodoo - the stats\nAston Villa picked up their first away win against Leeds since December 2000, ending a run of six without victory at Elland Road (D4 L2)\nLeeds have lost six home league games this season, the second highest number of home defeats suffered by Marcelo Bielsa in a single league campaign in his managerial career (8 with Athletic Bilbao in 2012-13)\nAston Villa have won 23 points away from home in the Premier League so far this season (W7 D2 L4), their highest in a single campaign since 2009-10 (32 pts - W9 D5 L5)\nLeeds have conceded a league-high 27 Premier League goals before half-time this season, while the Whites have also shipped a league-high 19 goals from set-piece situations (including penalties).\nAston Villa's Emiliano Mart\u00ednez has kept eight clean sheets away from home in the Premier League this season, more than any other keeper. Indeed, no Villa keeper has kept more on the road in a single campaign in the competition (Brad Friedel also eight in 2009-10)\nMan of the match - Anwar El Ghazi (Aston Villa)\nGordon Ramsay's Bank Balance: Can contestants beat the balance board and walk away with \u00a3100,000?\nLockdown and food: Why it causes emotional eating habits and how can we manage them?"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Jamaal Lascelles rues dropped points\nCaptain Jamaal Lascelles says Newcastle \"need to stop talking and put points on the board\" after missing a chance to move further clear of the Premier League relegation zone with a draw against Wolves.\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce was also concerned at losing the influential Miguel Almiron, saying he \"fears the worst\" about the Paraguayan's injury.\nAlmiron was substituted at half-time and Bruce says he will have a scan on Sunday.\nLascelles headed the hosts in front from Ryan Fraser's cross in the second half and they looked good for their lead after a confident performance.\nBut Ruben Neves, who had never scored a headed goal for Wolves before, was awarded space to guide Pedro Neto's delivery beyond Martin Dubravka to earn the visitors a point.\nDubravka, making his first Premier League appearance of the season, may have done better for Wolves' leveller but produced a superb save to deny Fabio Silva in added time.\nNewcastle were left to rue a number of missed opportunities of their own, with Almiron striking the far post after breaking the offside trap early in the first half.\nIt means 18th-placed Fulham can move within one point of Newcastle if they beat Crystal Palace on Sunday, while Wolves remain 12th.\n\"We had very good chances and we are lost for words,\" Lascelles told Match of the Day. \"We got a point but it should have been three points.\n\"A lot of positives but we need to stop talking and put the points on the board.\"\nReaction to Newcastle v Wolves and the rest of Saturday's Premier League matches\nLawro's predictions v Dot Major from electro-pop band London Grammar\nNewcastle fail to hold on to victory\nNewcastle boss Bruce dished out a personal vote of confidence during the week when he told supporters he was \"convinced\" the club would avoid the drop this season.\nHis side were 10 points clear of the relegation zone three weeks ago but that will be cut to just one if a resurgent Fulham win at Crystal Palace on Sunday.\nIf it was not for a wonderful save by Dubravka to keep out Silva's header in stoppage time, the Cottagers would head into that fixture with the chance to go above them.\nBruce will feel vindicated by his decision to drop Karl Darlow and start Dubravka, his number one before this season, having only played once in all competitions because of a heel injury.\nThe Slovakia international could arguably have done better to keep out the Neves header that brought Wolves level, but his instinctive save from Silva late on was vital.\nBruce was frustrated by the space Neves found himself in to score Wolves' goal, admitting there was confusion over his side's defensive positioning after Matt Ritchie replaced Emil Krafth.\n\"The instructions Matty didn't get on to the team quick enough on how we were doing it,\" said Bruce. \"When you look at the goal, we should have stopped the cross and when the keeper looks at it, could he have done better?\"\nNewcastle enjoyed a number of opportunities with Almiron's golden chance and Isaac Hayden heading straight at Rui Patricio, while Joelinton's scuffed effort was cleared off the line late on.\nAllan Saint-Maximin even had the ball in the net after teeing up Joe Willock before tucking in the rebound after the on-loan Arsenal midfielder's shot was saved, but he had strayed into an offside position.\nThe breakthrough did come thanks to Lascelles' first league goal since also he also scored against Wolves in October 2019.\nBut Newcastle will no doubt view this as two points dropped, especially after Brighton's 1-0 defeat at West Brom earlier.\nThey visit both of those sides in their next three matches in potentially crucial encounters.\nTraore and Neto provide Wolves' threat\nWolves had won three of their past four heading into this one after a run of eight Premier League games without a win, but were lacking their recent clinical edge in the north east.\nTheir main threats came through the direct running of Adama Traore and Neto.\nTraore only has one goal and one assist to his name in all competitions this season, but when he came to life at St James' Park, so did the visitors.\nHe struck the woodwork from a back-post header with his side's first meaningful attempt after half an hour, before Neto steered wide after a burst down the left from the Spaniard.\nBoth Isaac Hayden and Ciaran Clark were booked for bringing down Traore when in full flight and Neto fired off target from another well-weighted Traore cross.\nWolves' return to form seems to have come since the arrival of forward Willian Jose, who has started the past six games since joining on loan from Real Sociedad.\nBut the Brazilian, who is yet to open his goalscoring account, struggled to make an impact and instead it fell to Neves to get on the end of Neto's cross to beat Dubravka.\n\"I'm not looking too much at the result. I'm looking more at the performance,\" boss Nuno Espirito Santo told Match of the Day.\n\"I think we had good spells of possession and found the right spaces. We were in the game in a good way. I'm disappointed with the way we conceded but the reaction was good. We finished the game well.\n\"It's not difficult to beat our best run of this season. Our expectations are high. We expect good things from the players.\"\nNuno reaches managerial milestone - the stats\nNewcastle and Wolves have both scored in all 12 Premier League meetings between the sides, the most played fixture in the competition with neither side keeping a clean sheet.\nOf Premier League fixtures to be played at least 10 times, Newcastle v Wolves has seen the highest percentage of games finish in a draw (75% - 9/12).\nEach of the last five league meetings between the sides has finished 1-1.\nNo team has scored a higher share of their Premier League goals in the second half this season than Newcastle (67% - 18/27).\nWolves named the same starting XI in three consecutive league games for the first time since January 2020.\nJamaal Lascelles netted his first Premier League goal in 29 games, since scoring against Wolves back in October 2019 at St. James' Park.\nJoao Moutinho became the third outfielder to reach 100 Premier League appearances for Wolves (also Conor Coady and Matt Jarvis).\nNuno Espirito Santo took charge of his 102nd Premier League game at Wolves, overtaking Mick McCarthy (101) as the most matches in charge of the club in the competition.\nPedro Neto has been directly involved in 10 Premier League goals this season (five goals, five assists), four more than any other Wolves player.\nWhat's next?\nWolves head to Manchester City on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) and then Aston Villa on Saturday (17:30), while Newcastle visit West Brom a week on Sunday (12:00).\nGordon Ramsay's Bank Balance: Can contestants beat the balance board and walk away with \u00a3100,000?\nLockdown and food: Why it causes emotional eating habits and how can we manage them?"

        "article_text": "Leicester 1-3 Arsenal: Gunners going in right direction - Mikel Arteta\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta said his side are \"taking a direction I like\" after they followed up their Europa League win over Benfica with an impressive comeback victory at high-flying Leicester.\nThings started badly for a much-changed Gunners side, with poor defending allowing Youri Tielemens to run unchecked down the right before firing a low shot into the far corner with just six minutes played.\nArsenal refused to be adversely affected, though, and took control of the game with impressive attacking intent and far greater fluency than Leicester.\nDavid Luiz headed them level from a free-kick before Alexandre Lacazette levelled from the penalty spot after the video assistant referee (VAR) judged that Wilfred Ndidi had blocked Nicolas Pepe's shot in the box with an outstretched arm.\nPepe sealed the deserved win with a close-range finish to take the Gunners into the top half of the table.\n\"The way we are playing looks much closer to what we want. The way the team is evolving, we have some consistency in recent months,\" said Arteta.\n\"We are still giving things to the opposition - we did it against Benfica and we did it today. It's something we have to eradicate to give ourselves the best possible chance.\n\"It's about how we played against top-quality opposition. We have to impose ourselves - it doesn't matter who we play against, we have to have courage. I'm proud about winning but obviously [also] the way we've done it.\n\"The team is clearly improving. It's taking a direction I like.\"\nLeicester's loss comes three days after their disappointing Europa League exit to Slavia Prague and is a big blow to their increasingly forlorn-looking pursuit of Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nOn a miserable afternoon at the end of a dire week for the Foxes, they also had influential winger Harvey Barnes carried off on a stretcher with his leg in a brace to add to their already considerable injury problems.\nThe Foxes' sixth home loss of the campaign leaves them 10 points behind a Manchester City side who have won their past 20 games.\nArsenal move up to ninth, eight points off the top four but with a renewed interest in events above them in the table.\nLeicester's Barnes to have operation on knee injury\n, external\nReaction from Leicester v Arsenal, plus all of Sunday's other Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Dot Major from electro-pop band London Grammar\nArsenal's season salvation job continues\nArteta actually chose to rest a number of key players on Sunday, including Bukayo Saka and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose late winner had won their Europa League tie against Benfica.\nIn naming a stronger side on paper for Thursday's game and resting key players at the King Power, Arteta appeared to be suggesting that success in Europe represented his side's best route back into the Champions League.\nThat may still be the case, but what the Spaniard and his squad proved on Sunday is they are far more capable than they have demonstrated for much of this season.\nGranted, they got off to an appalling start, practically waving Tielemens in for his early opening goal.\nBut they did not allow the incident to alter the gameplan - one designed to sensibly take the game to Rodgers' side.\nThey fashioned the better chances over the 90 minutes as a result.\nAside from the goals, Willian fired a low shot just past the post, Luke Thomas's superb sliding tackle denied Pepe from close range and substitute Aubameyang curled a shot narrowly wide late on.\nIt also took a VAR call to overturn the on-field awarding of a penalty at 1-0 with the officials ultimately deciding the offending tackle on Pepe had taken place just outside the area.\nWith eight points and four other teams between themselves and fourth-placed West Ham, a late dart for the Champions League places remains a long shot for the Gunners, but with big players firing and talent in reserve they are in a good place to challenge for their ultimate goal.\nSunday's win did come at a potential cost, though, with Emile Smith Rowe - such a bright spark in recent months - having to leave the field injured in the first half.\nInjuries undermining Leicester challenge\nLeicester's own team selection is becoming increasingly a case of whoever is fit and available.\nHaving rested some players for the disappointing midweek defeat by Slavia Prague, the Foxes were back to the best they could muster, but this still meant the absence of Wesley Fofana, fellow defender James Justin and, most importantly, James Maddison.\nThe England midfielder's creative energy was noticeably missing on Sunday, with Kelechi Iheanacho failing replicate it as his replacement.\nWhen Barnes - the only man to really test Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno aside from Tielemens - departed on a stretcher, he stripped the Foxes of further attacking spark, making the martialling of Jamie Vardy a much easier job for the Gunners.\nLeicester have points in the bank, but Rodgers now faces a challenge to ensure his side can rediscover some momentum and avoid slipping late out of the Champions League qualification places as they did last season.\nGunners reverse recent form against Foxes - best of the stats\nArsenal ended a four-game winless run against Leicester in the Premier League, picking up their first victory against them since October 2018.\nLeicester have lost consecutive matches for the first time since December, while they last lost two in a row at home in October.\nThe Foxes have lost their last two league home games in which they have scored the opening goal.\nThis was Arsenal's first away victory against a team starting the day in the top three of the Premier League table since January 2015 - they were winless in their past 14 such games before Sunday.\nArsenal's Pepe has already equalled his league goal tally from last season of five but in 13 fewer appearances.\nLacazette has converted all five of his penalties for Arsenal, while only Aubameyang (13) has now netted more goals for the Gunners than the France forward this term.\nTielemans has scored six league goals for Leicester this season, as many as he had in his first two campaigns at the club combined.\nLuiz and Willian are just the second Arsenal duo to combine for a league goal for the Gunners and another side in the division (Chelsea), after John Hartson and Ian Wright (West Ham).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester face a tricky trip to Burnley on Wednesday for an 18:00 GMT kick-off. Coincidentally, that is also the next fixture facing Arsenal, who travel to Turf Moor next Saturday (12:30).\nSounds of the Nineties: Weezer, Green Day and more on the ultimate pop-rock mixtape\nNintendo Nostalgia and games for phones: Press X to Continue hosts Tom Grennan"

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-0 Fulham: Wasteful Cottagers frustrated in stalemate\nFulham midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek said the Cottagers \"don't feel like losing at all\" after producing another dominant, yet profligate, display in Sunday's goalless draw at Crystal Palace.\nScott Parker's side created by far the better opportunities at Selhurst Park but failed to earn a win which would have closed the gap on fellow Premier League strugglers Newcastle and Brighton to one point.\n\"It's kind of the story of our season,\" said Loftus-Cheek. \"We're playing well and dominating games but can't see it off.\"\nThe visitors came to life after a poor first half, Josh Maja curling narrowly wide from the edge of the penalty area before forcing Vicente Guaita into a one-handed save with a header from Ivan Cavaleiro's delivery.\nJoachim Andersen had a header blocked and Loftus-Cheek also went close, drilling a powerful effort wide of Guaita's left-hand post.\n\"We said before the game they are a team who sit deep and defend well,\" added the Chelsea loanee. \"We said we needed to take our chances but we couldn't.\n\"We are diligent in our defensive work and hard to break down. We don't fear conceding goals, it's just outscoring teams that we want to improve.\"\nPalace were virtually non-existent as an attacking force, registering just three attempts and failing to test Alphonse Areola in the Fulham goal.\nThe draw lifts the Cottagers to 23 points - three behind 17th-placed Newcastle - while the Eagles are 10 points above the relegation zone in 13th.\nMissed opportunity for Fulham\nFulham arrived at Selhurst Park with the wind firmly in their sails, having reduced the gap on Newcastle from 10 points to just three going into this weekend's round of fixtures.\nThe Magpies' 1-1 draw with Wolves, coupled with Brighton's 1-0 reverse at West Brom, opened the door for Fulham to pile even more pressure on the two teams directly above them but, not for the first time this season, they failed to make the most of several promising opportunities.\nParker's team pressed their opponents relentlessly and enjoyed the majority of possession in the early stages, but the closest they came to a first-half opener was when Andersen headed Ademola Lookman's free-kick over the crossbar.\nThe visitors mustered 14 efforts in the second half alone as they laid siege to the Palace goal, but a combination of wayward finishing, last-ditch defending and good goalkeeping from Guaita kept the Cottagers at bay.\nMaja signalled Fulham's intent after half-time with a speculative long-range effort that flew straight into Guaita's arms, but the 22-year-old will be disappointed not to have converted one of two golden opportunities later in the half.\nThe Bordeaux loanee failed to hit the target after cutting on to his left foot on the edge of the area before being denied by a strong left-handed save by the Palace goalkeeper.\nAndersen, Loftus-Cheek and Cavaleiro all went close for Fulham, but there was no way through for Parker's side.\n\"There were some big chances today,\" said the Fulham boss, whose side face Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City in their next three games. \"It was probably always going to be a 1-0 game and we did everything in our power to win it.\n\"We will win games if we play like that. Today we fell a little bit short but performance-wise we were there.\n\"I personally believe we can give anyone a game in this division. There's still a long way to go.\"\nToothless Palace lack spark\nPalace were accused of committing \"a robbery\" against rivals Brighton last Monday, when Christian Benteke sealed a late smash-and-grab victory with only their second effort on target.\nThe Eagles almost enjoyed another slice of luck here when Andros Townsend's teasing cross was flicked towards his own goal by Andersen, but Areola was alert to the danger.\nThat was the closest Roy Hodgson's side went to getting on the scoresheet.\nBenteke - restored to the starting line-up after scoring that late winner at Amex Stadium - cut an isolated figure in attack, despite the support of Eberechi Eze in a central role behind the Belgium striker.\nHodgson will be desperate to have Wilfried Zaha back to face former club Manchester United on Wednesday. The Ivory Coast forward has missed the past three games with a muscle injury but recently returned to first-team training.\n\"We have a lot of players to come back into the team,\" said Hodgson, who was also without James McArthur, Mamadou Sakho, Jeffrey Schlupp, James Tomkins and Nathaniel Clyne against the Cottagers.\n\"I know we have a lot more strings to our bow than we have perhaps been able to show in the last few games. We have our own stars that will be back in the team and can ask a lot of questions.\"\nCottagers extend unbeaten away run - the stats\nCrystal Palace have picked up four points from their past two Premier League games (W1 D1) despite having just six shots and facing 41.\nFulham are unbeaten in their past seven Premier League games on the road (W1 D6), their longest such run without defeat away from home in the competition.\nFulham are now winless in their past 21 London derby matches in the Premier League (D4 L17), with only Crystal Palace between 1969 and 1973 suffering a longer such winless run in top-flight history.\nAfter only one of Fulham's first 21 Premier League games under Scott Parker ended level, they have since drawn 10 of their past 15 league matches (W2 L3).\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson remains unbeaten during his managerial career against Fulham (W3 D4).\nDuring February, Crystal Palace managed just 33 attempts in their five matches - this is the lowest number of shots recorded by a team in a single Premier League month of at least five games since the start of the 2003-04 campaign.\n'I can't praise the players enough' - what they said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"I'm very satisfied. Fulham are playing very well and are a good team. We knew we would be under pressure for large parts of the game.\n\"We are realists. I still think we can do more with the ball sometimes but that's dependent on the opposition as well. They don't give you a lot of time on the ball but the way we dug in is very commendable.\n\"I can't praise the players enough for the work-rate.\"\nFulham manager Scott Parker: \"In the first half we didn't really assert ourselves and lacked a threat. We changed that at half-time.\n\"Positionally we changed it in attack a little bit. We cut through the lines and put people in positions in the second half. Of course we wanted three points, but we got one.\n\"I was very pleased defensively. We saw in their last game against Brighton that Palace are always in games. We nullified that very well. The missing part was of course the goal.\"\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace host Manchester United on Wednesday, 3 March (20:15 GMT), before Fulham welcome Tottenham Hotspur to Craven Cottage the following evening (18:00).\nSounds of the Nineties: Weezer, Green Day and more on the ultimate pop-rock mixtape\nNintendo Nostalgia and games for phones: Press X to Continue hosts Tom Grennan"

        "article_text": "Tottenham 4-0 Burnley: Gareth Bale, Harry Kane and Lucas Moura score for Spurs\nGareth Bale scored twice and made another as Tottenham cruised to an easy Premier League win over Burnley that boosted their hopes of European qualification.\nSpurs had lost five of their previous six league matches but went ahead inside two minutes when Bale converted Son Heung-min's low cross.\nBale's superb long pass released Harry Kane to net Tottenham's second, before Lucas Moura added a third from Sergio Reguilon's delivery.\nSon was the architect for the fourth as he ran at the Burnley defence before finding Bale, and the Wales forward curled a fine finish into the far corner to seal the emphatic win.\nThe victory takes Jose Mourinho's side up to eighth. They are six points behind fourth-placed West Ham, who occupy the final Champions League qualification spot, but have a game in hand on the Hammers.\nThis is the 'best Bale Tottenham have had this season' - Mourinho\nRelive Tottenham v Burnley as it happened, plus reaction, analysis and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Dot Major from electro-pop band London Grammar\nBrilliant Bale inspires Tottenham\nAfter winning the Champions League four times with Real Madrid, much was expected from Bale on his return to Tottenham, where he had twice won the Professional Footballers' Association Players' Player of the Year Award before moving to La Liga.\nHowever, after a couple of disrupted campaigns, Bale was carrying an injury when he rejoined Spurs in September on a season-long loan deal from Real and has struggled to build up a regular run of matches.\nBut his recent form has shown glimpses of what Tottenham fans would have hoped to see and, following goals in both legs of the 8-1 aggregate win over Austrian side Wolfsberger in the Europa League last 32, he was given only his third Premier League start of the season on Sunday.\nBefore the match, Mourinho said Bale \"was happier than ever\" and it took the 31-year-old only 70 seconds to score when he had got in between the Burnley central defenders and steered Son's low cross past Nick Pope in the first chance of the game.\nKane shot just wide and Moura was denied by Pope, before the England keeper was beaten again after 15 minutes.\nA brilliant long ball from Bale, 30 yards from his own goal, released Kane and the forward scored his 14th Premier League goal of the campaign, although his strike took a deflection off James Tarkowski to take it over Pope.\nTottenham won this fixture 5-0 last season and it then became a question of how many they would score.\nThe third came when Reguilon's cross was inadvertently flicked on by Tarkowski and Moura took a touch to set himself before firing into the net.\nBale, in arguably his best performance of the season, scored again with an excellent curling finish following a storming run forward from Son, before the Welshman was substituted after 69 minutes.\nAfter the match, Bale said: \"I'm delighted with the goals and the assist and whatever I can do for the team.\n\"I've been happy all season. In the dressing room I feel comfortable and I'm having fun. I'm happy and I'm sure it's showing on the pitch.\n\"I have been building up a little bit to get fully fit - I felt comfortable and my form is coming back. It's nice to help the team.\n\"It's been a while so I just continue to work hard. I know you get criticism but I am experienced enough to keep my head down, not say anything stupid and keep plugging away.\"\nOnly excellent goalkeeping from Pope denied the hosts a bigger win as he made fine saves from Kane and Son on a tough day for Burnley.\nTottenham have finished in the top six in the past 11 seasons. They started this match in 10th, although the win took them back above north London rivals Arsenal and also ahead of Aston Villa into eighth.\nDyche will need to see a reaction again\nBurnley had come into this game unbeaten in four Premier League matches, but they were completely outplayed at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nThe Clarets' total of 18 goals is the second lowest in the league and Jay Rodriguez twice had efforts that were comfortably dealt with by keeper Hugo Lloris, while Matej Vydra should have also done better but shot off target.\nThey are now only five points clear of the relegation zone and have matches against top-half sides - Leicester, Arsenal and Everton - in their three games in March.\nHowever, Sean Dyche's side have repeatedly shown their fighting spirit this season and the Burnley boss will surely now be looking to see a similar reaction to what followed heavy losses to Chelsea and Manchester City earlier this season.\nAfter a 3-0 defeat by Chelsea in October they picked up four points in their next two matches and following a 5-0 hammering against Manchester City in November, Burnley then collected two wins and two draws in their next four games.\nOne plus for Dyche was top goalscorer Chris Wood coming on for the last 18 minutes after missing six matches because of a hamstring injury he picked up against Chelsea at the end of January. The New Zealand forward will be an important player as they fight to keep hold of their top-flight status.\nKane scores against Burnley again - the stats\nTottenham registered their biggest home Premier League win since December 2019 - a 5-0 victory over Burnley.\nBurnley have lost 12 of their past 15 top-flight matches at Spurs, conceding 48 goals in total, including at least four in seven games.\nTottenham boss Mourinho has taken charge of more league matches against Burnley without losing than any other club in his managerial career.\nNo player has scored more Premier League goals against Burnley than Spurs' Kane (eight, level with Riyad Mahrez), with the England captain involved in 10 in his past six league appearances against the Clarets (seven goals, three assists).\nBale's first goal for Spurs after just 68 seconds was the fastest conceded by Burnley in a Premier League match.\nBale has been directly involved in seven goals in his past four appearances for Tottenham (four goals, three assists).\nOnly Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne (16) has more assists for a Premier League club than Spurs forward Son Heung-Min's 15 this season.\nIn his 285th Premier League appearance, Tottenham's Lloris has become the 16th goalkeeper to achieve 100 clean sheets in the competition, and the ninth quickest in terms of games.\n'The players could express themselves' - what they said\nTottenham boss Mourinho, speaking to Match of the Day, said: \"I don't think it was a performance from another galaxy but we were solid. We needed a game where the players could express themselves against a team that never gives up.\n\"Until the last minute, we had to defend two corners. We had a clean sheet because we wanted a clean sheet. It's something we've not been having.\"\nOn Gareth Bale's performance, Mourinho added: \"We know the quality he has. I don't want to say that [he is 100% back to his best].\n\"We don't need the Gareth Bale of five or six years ago. That player wouldn't be here - he'd be at Real Madrid. He is winning duels and you saw his speed and direction.\n\"I'm very happy for him, very happy for the team because the team needs his talent. When his condition is good he can do things like today - his game was very good, not just scoring, changing speeds, going inside.\"\nBurnley manager Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day, said: \"You come to a Tottenham side that have been questioned. When teams are on a tough run it very rarely lasts. [It was a] really poor start from our point of view - no-one is alive to it.\n\"You have to give credit to the opposition - they looked alive, alert. Everyone has been surprised by the run they had.\n\"Their quality showed in the right areas and we couldn't find those quality moments.\n\"When you are not quite on it, good sides find you out. But we have to make sure it doesn't happen very often. We gave it away too much.\"\nWhat's next?\nTottenham have London derbies in both their next two matches, going to Fulham on Thursday (18:00 GMT) and then hosting Crystal Palace on Sunday, 7 March (19:15).\nBurnley play at home against Leicester City on Wednesday (18:00) and then entertain Arsenal on Saturday (12:30).\nSounds of the Nineties: Weezer, Green Day and more on the ultimate pop-rock mixtape\nNintendo Nostalgia and games for phones: Press X to Continue hosts Tom Grennan"

        "article_text": "Premier League: Chelsea 0-0 Man Utd \u2013 More VAR controversy in stalemate\nManchester United lost further ground on Premier League leaders Manchester City after they played out a drab goalless deadlock with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\nOle Gunnar Solkjaer's side remain second but are now 12 points adrift of City while the result left Chelsea outside the top four a point behind West Ham United.\nManchester United - who have lost only one of their last 20 league games - thought they were about to be offered the chance to make a breakthrough in the first half, but a penalty appeal for handball against Callum Hudson-Odoi was dismissed by referee Stuart Attwell after he was instructed to consult a pitchside monitor by the video assistant referee.\nChelsea, who remain unbeaten under new manager Thomas Tuchel, had chances but United keeper David de Gea made a fine second-half save from Hakim Ziyech while opposite number Edouard Mendy saved well from Scott McTominay and Fred was narrowly off target with a long-range effort. Mendy also punched away a late effort from Bruno Fernandes.\nIn the end, however, this was another game to add to the list of meetings between the so-called top six that ended in stalemate.\nReaction to Chelsea v Man Utd, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nChelsea tough to beat under Tuchel\nChelsea will feel a sense of disappointment at not getting the victory that would have moved them into the top four, but this draw means it is now nine matches without defeat for manager Tuchel since he succeeded sacked Frank Lampard in January.\nTuchel has made Chelsea resilient and tough to beat but they lacked a cutting edge here and moments of discomfort were rare for Manchester United's defence and they can have no complaints because they did not deserve victory.\nIt has still been a promising start for Tuchel. He has toughened up Chelsea and with the attacking talent at his disposal they are in a good position to make a serious bid to move into the top four, while they still have high ambitions in the Champions League and FA Cup.\nTuchel is slowly but surely making his mark and Chelsea can feel in upbeat mood about the weeks ahead.\nManchester United fall short\nManchester United's title aspirations flickered briefly when then went top after a draw at Liverpool in January - but all logic suggests they have been snuffed out now with the Premier League crown heading back to Manchester City.\nUnited's statistics are impressive, they are now unbeaten in 20 league matches away from Old Trafford, a sequence that includes 13 wins, but they have never truly showed the belief and ruthless edge of potential champions.\nAnd here, while they certainly deserved their point, United again failed to provide the final flourish that could have turned one into three.\nSolskjaer's side are certainly on an upward curve but this uninspiring encounter was further proof that any title talk was little more than a pipe dream and a serious gulf in quality still exists between Manchester United and Manchester City.\nThe two meet in the Manchester derby at Etihad Stadium next Sunday - and with the gap between the teams now 12 points City may just view it as the opportunity to kill off any lingering questions about the destiny of the Premier League this season.\nUnited's top six woes - the stats\nThis fixture has finished goalless in both matches in a league campaign for just the second time, the other occasion coming in 1921-22.\nManchester United are now unbeaten in 20 away league matches (W13, D7), a run that started in this exact fixture last season. It is the joint-fifth-longest run without an away defeat in top-flight history, the only longer runs coming from Arsenal (27 and 23), Liverpool (21) and Nottingham Forest (21).\nChelsea have drawn 0-0 against an opponent home and away in the Premier League in a single season for the first time since 2008-09 against Everton, while Man Utd last did so against Aston Villa in 1996-97.\nManchester United have failed to score a single goal in their last six league meetings with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City or Spurs - each of their last four such matches have finished goalless.\nChelsea manager Tuchel has become just the second coach not to concede a single goal in his four home matches in the Premier League after Brendan Rodgers in 2011-12 with Swansea City. Including his final two such matches in charge of PSG, Tuchel has gone six matches without conceding at home in league competition.\n'It's a penalty, 100%' - what they said\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, speaking to Match of the Day, said: \"We had the better chances and played high up the pitch in the second half. We have to accept a draw in the end and a clean sheet. We had a very good reaction after half time. We stepped up and got better and better with higher recoveries. We went for a win but it did not happen.\n\"In this highest level, at some points, maybe two big chances have to be enough. If you don't do that then we have to be alert and aware of the counter-attacks and quality from Manchester United. We did this and defended very well. This was extraordinary effort and quality. We take it and go on.\"\nOn the VAR no-penalty decision, Tuchel added: \"I was anxious before I thought I was totally wrong. From my point of view it was totally clear that a man in red touched it. When I saw it on the iPad I could not understand what was going on as it was only the man with the red shirt who touched it. I did not understand what the check was for.\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to Match of the Day, said: \"It was a penalty, 100% nailed on. If that's a natural position for a hand to be in when the ball comes in then I must be blind.\n\"We wanted to win. Apart from the last quality or pass being not good enough, we had great pressing, desire [and] work-rate. There was a great save by David de Gea and we got the clean sheet.\n\"That's what let us down, that quality on the ball. The first half was scrappy. Poor game really. But then we played some good stuff at times. When we settled we created a few chances but we didn't have enough.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Liverpool in the Premier League on Thursday (20:15 GMT), while Manchester United are away to Crystal Palace on Wednesday (20:15 GMT).\nSounds of the Nineties: Weezer, Green Day and more on the ultimate pop-rock mixtape\nNintendo Nostalgia and games for phones: Press X to Continue hosts Tom Grennan"

That's fine,\" said Klopp, whose side are sixth and two points behind West Ham in fourth. \"With all the problems we have had we're still around the exciting places.\n\"This was about us showing we're still there. We play Chelsea on Thursday, we have to show it again. We have to win football games, we know that. There's no way into the Champions League without results.\"\nSheffield United were competitive throughout and Oliver McBurnie may have done better when he headed wide while unmarked from Oliver Norwood's cross.\nBut the bottom-placed Blades will now have to produce an unprecedented recovery if they are to remain in the Premier League this season.\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v Dot Major from electro-pop band London Grammar\nReds return to winning ways\nIt is only eight months since Liverpool clinched their first league title for 30 years but Klopp's side have had to alter their ambitions this season and now find themselves in a battle to make the top four and secure Champions League qualification.\nThe Reds have already suffered as many defeats in 2021 as they did in their previous 100 top-flight fixtures but a trip to the division's bottom side proved the perfect tonic for ending a four-match losing run.\nIt began as another frustrating evening for the Reds when they found Ramsdale in inspired form, and the visitors' failure to find the net before the break means they have only scored one first-half goal in their past 11 Premier League games.\nBut Klopp insisted this week his squad does not require a \"massive rebuild\" this summer and the German will therefore be looking towards the younger players to show they can be counted on.\nMidfielder Jones did just that during another competent display when he picked out the bottom corner after Sheffield United failed to clear Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross to open the scoring.\nFirmino then engineered a shot on goal after some smart footwork and the ball found its way in off Bryan to wrap-up the three points for Liverpool with 26 minutes to go.\nKlopp will also be delighted with his side's first clean sheet away from home in eight league matches, despite having to make more changes at the back.\nHe named a 14th different centre-back partnership in the league in Ozan Kabak and Nat Phillips, and Adrian replaced Alisson in goal following the death of the Brazilian's father this week, but the visitors dealt with the Blades' threat comfortably.\nRamsdale shines despite Blades' loss\nChris Wilder said before this fixture that the \"most optimistic\" of Blades fans may believe his side can deliver the required results to keep them in the Premier League, though the boss himself remains more realistic.\nNo side in Premier League history has been 15 points from safety with 12 games to go and stayed up, but that is the task facing Wilder's outfit after their 21st defeat of the campaign.\nThe hosts did their best to contain the champions and it proved successful until 48 minutes, largely due to a superb performance from goalkeeper Ramsdale.\nThe former Bournemouth stopper, who signed for \u00a318.5m in the summer, has only kept one clean sheet in the Premier League this season but made five excellent stops before the break - the most saves he has ever made in the first half of a top-flight game.\nThe 22-year-old kept out Firmino when one on one and also denied Mohamed Salah from a narrow angle, before palming over a fierce Alexander-Arnold effort and saving Georginio Wijnaldum's strike from distance.\nSheffield United had the ball in the net themselves when Kabak deflected a looping pass beyond Adrian and into his own goal, but McBurnie was flagged offside.\nAdrian made a smart save from David McGoldrick early on and McBurnie also headed wide in the second half after Jones had finally found a way past Ramsdale.\nBut defeat means the Blades are the first side since Newport County in the fourth tier in 1970-71 to lose at least 21 of their first 26 matches in an English Football League season.\n'Robertson could have had a hat-trick'\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We had a right go but lacked quality and strength in depth. You need your best players to be at the top of their game. You need a bit more in this division because it's brutal and it exposes you.\n\"Liverpool have got some world-class players because not only have they been successful on the European stage but also the world stage.\n\"The two goals we conceded were really disappointing. You have to be perfect out of possession and perfect in possession against Liverpool and we weren't.\n\"We haven't taken chances that have come to us. There in a nutshell is our season. We're not defending anywhere near as well as we did last season.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp on Match of the Day: \"Everyone who sees Sheffield United playing knows you have to work really hard against them.\n\"We created an awful lot and should have been 3-0 up. Andy Robertson could have had a hat-trick.\n\"The clean sheet is very important. Adrian showed pure class and character. I'm really happy for him. He was very front-footed. That was a really good game.\"\nJones on target for Reds - the stats\nLiverpool registered their first win since beating West Ham United 3-1 at the end of January.\nThis was Sheffield United's 10th home league defeat of the season, their most in a single campaign since losing 11 in 2010-11 in the Championship.\nCurtis Jones netted only his second Premier League goal for Liverpool, with his other coming in July 2020 against Aston Villa.\nAt 20 years and 29 days, Jones is the youngest Liverpool player to score an away Premier League goal since Raheem Sterling in December 2014 against Burnley (20 years, 18 days).\nAdrian has ended on the winning side in 10 of his 12 Premier League starts for Liverpool (83%) but this was only his third clean sheets for the Reds.\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United welcome Aston Villa on Wednesday (18:00 GMT), before Liverpool host Chelsea on Thursday (20:15 GMT).\nSounds of the Nineties: Weezer, Green Day and more on the ultimate pop-rock mixtape\nNintendo Nostalgia and games for phones: Press X to Continue hosts Tom Grennan"

        "article_text": "Everton 1-0 Southampton: Richarlison hits winner for hosts\nCarlo Ancelotti says he wants Everton to experience the feeling of \"touching\" the top four after a win over Southampton that sets up a chance to overtake their rivals on Thursday.\nRicharlison rounded Fraser Forster to score the only goal of the game against the struggling Saints as Ancelotti's side moved level on points with Liverpool and two points behind fourth-placed West Ham with a game in hand.\nIf they beat West Bromwich Albion on Thursday they will move into fourth ahead of Liverpool and Chelsea, who play each other later the same evening.\n\"We have a great opportunity,\" said Ancelotti after a first league win at home since 19 December. \"I don't know for how long it will be, maybe for one day, or two or three, but we would like to touch the position, so we have to put all our fight into the game on Thursday.\n\"We have to try to see how we feel if we are there.\"\nRicharlison's goal, which came from Gylfi Sigurdsson's pass, was one of two shots on target in a game where both sides failed to find any consistent rhythm.\nMichael Keane's effort was ruled out for offside while Dominic Calvert-Lewin did well to head James Ward-Prowse's free-kick clear.\nThe best chances for the visitors came at the end when Moussa Djenepo fired just wide of the far post after a promising move before Jordan Pickford saved from Jannik Vestergaard, leaving Danny Ings kicking a post in frustration.\nDefeat for the injury-hit Saints was an eighth in nine games as they remain seven points clear of the relegation zone.\nShould Southampton fear relegation?\nRelive the action at Goodison Park\nAllan return helps Everton end poor home run\nEverton's season has been an inconsistent affair, with their home form proving their biggest hindrance in an otherwise enterprising campaign.\nBut key to ending a run of three consecutive league losses at Goodison Park was the return of Brazilian Allan, who added extra protection in a midfield that has often left the defence exposed.\nHis first start since 16 December allowed Abdoulaye Doucoure and Andre Gomes to support Sigurdsson at the tip of a midfield diamond, and it was the Iceland international's through ball that sliced Southampton's defence to open the scoring.\nThe goal came from a Pickford long ball won in the air by the irrepressible Calvert-Lewin. The England striker was a thorn in Southampton's side and combined well up top in the absence of the injured James Rodriguez, who missed the game with a \"really light problem\", according to Ancelotti.\nBoth Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison also helped in defence as Everton thwarted dangerous set-pieces from Ward-Prowse.\nRicharlison, who has scored in three successive Premier League games for the first time since December 2019, could have added to his 11th of the season when he almost poked in Sigurdsson's free-kick.\nBut as Southampton pressed for an equaliser, it was Everton's defence that held firm as Ancelotti avoided suffering a fourth successive home league defeat for the first time in his career.\nIt was not a pretty victory, but it came amid huge relief as Everton assistant Duncan Ferguson punched the air at the final whistle.\nCalvert-Lewin said it was a result that underlined the squad's European ambitions.\nHe said: \"You have to believe, absolutely. Our aspiration has to be top four until it's not possible. Nights like tonight - that consistency - is what will get us up there.\n\"Everyone wants to play Champions League football. It's where we belong. It's important I keep scoring goals, Richarlison keeps scoring, we defend well and we'll see where that takes us.\"\nSaints' struggle continues\nSaints' alarming slump since the turn of the year was summed up by Ings' frustration towards the end of this hard-fought game.\nAfter beating Everton's Merseyside rivals at Anfield on 4 January, Hasenhuttl's side were sixth, equal on points with fourth-placed Tottenham.\nSince then, however, a single point from nine games has engineered a slide to seven points above the drop zone. While relegation looks unlikely, they look a shadow of their former selves, especially with Oriol Romeu being ruled out for the rest of the season, joining the likes of Takumi Minamino, Kyle Walker-Peters and Theo Walcott on the sidelines.\nRenowned for their unrelenting press, the visitors retreated to a deeper position on a chilly night at Goodison Park, and were picked off by the hosts' more direct approach.\nForster was preferred in goal to Alex McCarthy in an attempt to reverse their slide, but one of the first actions for the England goalkeeper was to pick the ball out of the net.\nThe visitors improved midway through the first half, but lacked a punch up front even though Ings was restored to the attack alongside Che Adams.\nYet it was not until the final stages where they truly caused problems for Everton as Djenepo had Hasenhuttl holding his head in his hands as the winger missed the target after good play from Stuart Armstrong.\nIt looked as if they might finally eke out a leveller when Djenepo's shot was blocked by Mason Holgate and fell to Vestergaard, but he slipped at a vital moment and a tame shot - Southampton's first on target after 90 minutes - was pushed aside by Pickford.\nRicharlison among best Brazilians in Europe\nSince the start of last season, Joao Pedro (30) and Neymar (19) are the only Brazilians to score more goals in the top five European leagues than Everton's Richarlison (18, level with Gabriel Jesus).\nOnly against Manchester Utd (9) has Everton's Gylfi Sigurdsson been involved in more Premier League goals than against Southampton (7 - 5 goals, 2 assists).\nEverton scored with the first shot of the game, the fourth time they have done this in a Premier League match this season (also v Fulham in November, v Wolves in January and v Liverpool last time out) with no side doing so on more occasions in the competition this campaign (level with Man City).\nWith 43 points, Everton have their highest points tally after 25 games in a Premier League season since 2013-14 (45 pts), going on to finish fifth that campaign.\nSouthampton have won just one point from the last 27 on offer in the Premier League (P9 W0 D1 L8), losing five consecutive away matches in the competition for the first time since May 2015 under Ronald Koeman.\nSouthampton's James Ward-Prowse made his 83rd consecutive Premier League appearance, the longest current run of any outfield player in the competition and bettered only by Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel (102). He last missed a Saints league game in December 2018 (v West Ham).\nWhat next?\nEverton travel to West Brom on Thursday, 4 March (18:00 GMT) while Southampton face a trip to Sheffield United on Saturday, 6 March (15:00).\nSounds of the Nineties: Weezer, Green Day and more on the ultimate pop-rock mixtape\nNintendo Nostalgia and games for phones: Press X to Continue hosts Tom Grennan"

        "article_text": "Man City 4-1 Wolves: Pep Guardiola says side 'came through hell'\nPep Guardiola believes Manchester City have \"come through hell and done something more than remarkable\" by overcoming a tough winter schedule to extend their winning run to 21 games in all competitions by beating Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nTheir 4-1 victory courtesy of three goals inside the final 10 minutes means City have not dropped points in the league since drawing with West Bromwich Albion on 15 December and are now 15 points clear at the top of the table.\nDuring that time they have played 21 games in all competitions, reached the final of the League Cup, the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and taken control of their last-16 Champions League tie against Borussia Monchengladbach.\n\"In winter time in England it's hell and in that time we did something incredible,\" Guardiola told BBC Radio 5 Live Sport. \"It's more than remarkable.\n\"The players have all my compliments but Liverpool have the crown. To win the Premier League we need those points.\"\nAn unlikely second-half equaliser from Conor Coady - cancelling out Leander Dendoncker's first-half own goal - had threatened to thwart City's pursuit of a 15th consecutive Premier League win.\nIn what was an otherwise one-side encounter, Coady's 61st-minute header - his first Premier League goal and his team's first touch in their opponents' penalty area - gave the visitors hope of earning at least a point.\nHowever, Gabriel Jesus put City back in front at Etihad Stadium with a shot on the turn from Kyle Walker's deflected cross.\nWith Wolves' spirit broken, in-form Riyad Mahrez fired in his seventh league goal of the season before Brazil striker Jesus got his second with virtually the final kick as VAR ruled his effort onside.\nThe leaders face second-placed Manchester United on Sunday with the chance to move another step closer to the title.\n\"We have one or two days to rest and I realise how strong they are,\" Guardiola said of United \"It's an incredible opportunity to make a huge step and we are going to try.\"\nReaction to Manchester City's win against Wolves\nSlick City stroll on\nThere were so many pre-game statistics that pointed to a 21st consecutive victory for the league leaders and they included one that dates back more than a decade.\nNot since Peter Crouch scored Tottenham's goal in May 2010 to earn victory in what was effectively a shootout for a Champions League place had City lost a midweek Premier League game.\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo certainly recognised their threat and likely dominance, selecting a team with two right-backs and no striker.\nIt was a measure of Nuno's caution that when Adama Traore was fouled at the start of the second-half and referee Chris Kavanagh played advantage as the ball ran on to Nelson Semedo, he complained because he knew there was more chance of joy from the set piece than open play.\nThe fact that after 28 minutes City midfielder Rodri had completed more passes than the entire Wolves team demonstrated the home side's dominance.\nOne of those passes was important too, delivered over 40 yards from the centre of the pitch over the Wolves defence to the feet of Mahrez, whose cross led to the opening goal.\nDendoncker knew he had to go for the ball otherwise Raheem Sterling would have had a tap-in.\nCoady's equaliser was an unexpected setback for Guardiola's side but as was the case with West Ham United on Saturday, Wolves were unable to cling on to a point as City equalled a club-record 28 games without defeat.\nCity have also equalled Arsenal's Premier League record of 19 games without trailing at any point.\nPatricio's defensive barrier\nThat Wolves got as late into the game with a chance of taking something from it was largely down to goalkeeper Rui Patricio.\nIn the seconds before half-time, the Portugal Euro 2016 winner produced a superb full-length save to turn away Bernardo Silva's header.\nThe second period was then only minutes old when Patricio pushed a Kevin de Bruyne shot wide as it appeared certain to find the bottom corner. Then he blocked a powerful Jesus effort that was also heading in.\nHe earned the luck he enjoyed when Silva fired a rebound from his own effort over the bar and when Sterling's blind back-flick at the near post fizzed just wide of the far post rather than just inside it.\nIn the end, not even the combination of Patricio and good fortune could save Wolves and there was to be no repeat of their victory last season.\n\"We must look at the game because we made a couple of mistakes under the pressure of City and they are very dangerous and they will punish you,\" said Wolves boss Nuno.\n\"City are very talented; amazing players, amazing manager. All the other teams that come here find it difficult because they are a good opponent.\"\nPortuguese players make history - the stats\nManchester City have won their last 21 games in all competitions, scoring 55 goals and conceding just eight. City are one of just three teams from the big-five European leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain) to record more than 20 consecutive victories, after Bayern Munich (23 in 2020) and Real Madrid (22 in 2014).\nRiyad Mahrez has been directly involved in 30 goals in 38 starts in all competitions for Man City at the Etihad (15 goals, 15 assists).\nOnly Conor Coady (three) has scored more own-goals for Wolves in the Premier League than Leander Dendoncker (two).\nThere were more Portuguese players starting Tuesday's match between Manchester City and Wolves (eight) than in any other Premier League game in history.\nManchester City have made more changes to their starting XI than any other any side in the Premier League this season (79).\nWhat next?\nManchester City's next game is at home to Manchester United in the Premier League at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, 7 March (16:30 GMT).

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 Leicester: Kelechi Iheanacho earns Foxes' a draw\nKelechi Iheanacho stepped up superbly in the absence of a number of injured team-mates to earn Champions League-chasing Leicester a potentially important draw at Burnley.\nWith Harvey Barnes having joined James Maddison on the Foxes' injury list and Jamie Vardy having only just returned from his own lay-off, Iheanacho gave his side the attacking edge they required courtesy of a volleyed equaliser midway through the first half.\nCity had earlier gifted the home side the lead, with Hamza Choudhury's under-hit pass near his own box allowing Matej Vydra to nip in, beat a man and then fire a shot into the roof of the net.\nThere were chances to win the game for both sides, but goalkeepers Nick Pope and Kasper Schmeichel each produced a typically excellent display.\nFoxes keeper Schmeichel was particularly impressive, diving to superbly save headers from James Tarkowski and Chris Wood.\nBoth teams also hit the post in the second half - Ashley Westwood for Burnley with a volleyed effort from a tight angle and Youri Tielemens for Leicester with a shot from the edge of the box.\nIt is a useful point for Burnley, who extend the gap between themselves and 18th-placed Fulham to six points.\nFor Leicester, the comeback and resulting confidence it may inspire is as important as the reward it yields. and they now have a six-point advantage of their own over fifth-placed Chelsea.\nAction and reaction from Wednesday's Premier League games\nLawro's predictions v DJ & producer Majestic\nIheanacho provides hope in the gloom\nHaving earned a reputation as a predatory finisher during a series of cameo appearances for Manchester City in the early stages of his career, Iheanacho has never fully justified a regular starting spot at Leicester since joining the club for \u00a325m in 2017.\nNow would be a fine time to start fully living up to his considerable promise, with the Foxes deprived of top-drawer attacking talent and desperate not to allow Champions League football to elude them again.\nMaddison and Barnes have either scored or assisted 15 of Leicester's past 20 Premier League goals.\nBut in allowing Ndidi's lofted pass to float over his shoulder before volleying the ball past Pope, Iheanacho demonstrated he has the skills to take over from the England pair.\nHis goal on Wednesday was not only brilliant but timely, with the early concession rocking a Foxes side that came into the fixture off the back of two defeats and had a number of square pegs in round holes.\nWhile understandably not at their best, they visibly lifted after the goal, though, and stepped up again when defender Wesley Fofana came on and Wilfred Ndidi was restored to his preferred spot in the middle of midfield.\nBefore that, Choudhury had a chance to make amends for his error but fired over with just Pope to beat from a central position. After the equaliser, Tielemens saw one shot hit the woodwork and another saved by Pope, who also denied Marc Albrighton from long range.\nA point is not ideal, but it is a necessary check on a potentially demoralising run of results in dire circumstances.\nWood return lifts Clarets\nThe same could be said of Burnley.\nA win would have provided that extra bit of breathing space at the bottom, but they should take heart from a better result and much-improved performance from Sunday's 4-0 surrender at Tottenham.\nBen Mee almost gave them an early lead with a header that went over the bar before Vydra did put them in front.\nTarkowski and Wood were both unfortunate not to restore the Clarets' advantage with headed efforts, as was Westwood when he drove against the woodwork.\nWood in particular made Sean Dyche's side a far more potent attacking weapon with his hold-up play, neat link-ups and ability to find space to test Schmeichel.\nThere were certainly more positives than negatives for Dyche, who is likely to welcome some more absentees back soon and clearly has enough in his squad to avoid getting dragged back into the bottom three.\n'Performance was super pleasing' - what they said\nBurnley boss Dyche: \"We get a point, which is pleasing. We may have taken more but the reaction and the performance was super pleasing.\n\"You don't want their keeper to be man of the match but it does imply you've been an attacking force - and I thought we were, especially in the second half.\n\"We went 1-0 up and we looked just a little bit hesitant, almost waiting for the game. I think in the second half, we really took it on with a mentality to go and win the game. I was really pleased with that and the performance.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"We made an awful start in the game to concede so early. That always tests your mentality and spirit, but I thought we came into the game, showed good moments of quality in the first half.\n\"When we were playing and breaking through we looked a real threat and we were unfortunate not to have won the game, with Youri hitting a post. But if you can't win it you take your point and move on.\"\nOn Schmeichel: \"His concentration and his desire to stop the ball going in the net is so good.\n\"He always produces for us - he's absolutely outstanding when he had to be here. That's why he's one of the top keepers at this level.\"\nBurnley making draws a habit - the best of the stats\nBurnley have drawn four of their past six Premier League games, as many stalemates as they had in their previous 23 league games combined.\nThis was the Clarets' fourth consecutive Premier League draw at Turf Moor; the first time they've drawn four in a row at the stadium in league competition since August 2011.\nLeicester manager Rodgers has only lost one of his seven Premier League games against Burnley's Dyche, with that defeat coming at Turf Moor in January 2020.\nBurnley's Vydra ended a run of 1,212 minutes without a Premier League goal, scoring his first since February 2020 against Bournemouth.\nIheanacho has scored two goals in his past three Leicester starts away from home in the Premier League, just one fewer than he managed in his first 15 away starts for the club in the competition.\nBurnley striker Wood had three shots on target without scoring in Wednesday's game - his most attempts on target in a Premier League match he failed to score in since November 2018.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides play on Saturday. Burnley host Arsenal in a 12:30 GMT kick-off before Leicester take on Brighton at the Amex Stadium at 20:00.\nFrom OJ Simpson to the LA riots: How the helicopter changed the news\nZapped: Office drone Brian is transported to a strange new world..."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 1-0 Aston Villa: David McGoldrick scores winner for bottom club\nBottom club Sheffield United survived for more than 30 minutes with 10 men to claim only the fourth Premier League win of their disappointing season and dent Aston Villa's European ambitions.\nDavid McGoldrick gave his side a first-half lead from inside the six-yard area after being picked out by George Baldock following a lovely move that started inside the Blades' half.\nUnited defender Phil Jagielka was sent off after half-time for a foul on Anwar El Ghazi after referee Robert Jones viewed the incident on a pitchside monitor and changed the yellow card he had initially given him to a red.\nVilla's Ollie Watkins headed against the post shortly before Jagielka's red card but the visitors were unable to take advantage of the 38-year-old former Everton player's dismissal.\nThe result ended a four-match losing run for Chris Wilder's spirited side who, despite victory, remain 12 points from safety in the Premier League with 11 matches to play.\n\"Any result in this division is a huge result for Sheffield United,\" said Wilder after only a second clean sheet league win of the season.\nVilla could have moved three points from a Champions League place with a win but were disappointing, and missed the guile of Jack Grealish as they tried to break down a stubborn Blades side.\nWilder unsure of future at Sheffield United\nBlades show appetite for fight\nDespite his side's seemingly hopeless position at the foot of the table, Wilder said before the game his players would not be waving the white flag between now and the end of a wretched season that has produced 21 league defeats.\nHis players responded to their manager's words with a gutsy performance that was even more impressive given they lost their most experienced player in the 57th minute.\nJagielka sent El Ghazi crashing as he was about to race clear, although it required a check on the monitor before the yellow card was upgraded to red.\n\"Obviously it was made a little more difficult going down to 10 men, but we showed good character - as I've spoken about all season regarding my team,\" added Wilder.\nFormer England centre-back Jagielka had earlier made a superb block to deny Bertrand Traore an equaliser as the Blades defended with the kind of vigour and organisation which characterised their fine 2019-20 season.\nThey remained resolute in the closing stages when Villa were desperately searching for an equaliser, Oliver Norwood throwing himself at Ezri Konsa's shot during a frantic finish.\nEight months after finishing ninth in the table with 19 more points than Villa, despite this result it will require an extraordinary set of circumstances for Sheffield United to stay up.\nAt least they showed an appetite for a fight in spite of their position as Villa joined Manchester United, Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion as the sides to lose to the Blades, who have now won three of their six home league games in 2021, this season.\nA performance to forget\nVilla's transformation since surviving relegation on the final day of last season has been startling - but this was a performance to forget from a team that has been turning heads this campaign.\nThey started the season with four straight wins and although they have thrown in some surprise defeats - this loss coming four days after winning at Leeds - it has been a positive campaign for Dean Smith's side.\nThey struggled to impose themselves in front of goal at Bramall Lane, although Watkins was unfortunate with his header that struck the woodwork, while Traore went close after showing great foot work inside the penalty area.\nKeeper Emiliano Martinez has impressed all season but there was little he could do to keep out McGoldrick from close range after the defence was undone by Baldock's pass.\nVilla have been excellent on the road this season, with victories at Leicester, Arsenal and Wolves among seven they have managed away from Villa Park.\nBut this performance left Smith \"annoyed\" and \"frustrated\" and the Villa boss will not want to dwell on the result - particularly as his side face a tough run-in that includes home matches against Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea as well as Liverpool away.\n\"We shouldn't be leaving with nothing, we threw points away tonight,\" said Smith.\n'They give everything to get a result' - what they said\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder: \"We've not got enough results in these kind of tight games. My team has shown tonight that the majority of the time, if not all the time, they give everything to get a result.\n\"I was disappointed with the decision [red card]. Oli McBurnie at the end was playing as a centre-half because we had to see the game out and thankfully we did. I thought we defended well.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"I'm a little bit annoyed. We lacked a bit of quality in the final third and I thought we became a little bit too frantic trying to find the goal.\n\"Our build-up until the 18-yard box was pretty good. We had big chances in the first half which we should have taken. That's the disappointing thing about it.\"\nSecond-oldest red card - the stats\nPhil Jagielka, at 38 years and 198 days, is the second-oldest player to be sent off in the Premier League, behind only Stuart Pearce in March 2001 for West Ham against Everton, at the age of 38 years and 341 days.\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith has only beaten Chris Wilder once in their seven meetings in all competitions.\nFor the first time in the Premier League, Sheffield United managed to win a match in which they received a red card - although Jagielka's red was the first time they had been reduced to 10 men while already winning.\nDavid McGoldrick (6) has scored twice the number of Premier League goals of any other Sheffield United player this season.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are at home on Saturday with Southampton visiting Sheffield United (15:00 GMT) before Aston Villa host a West Midlands derby with Wolves (17:30).\nFrom OJ Simpson to the LA riots: How the helicopter changed the news\nZapped: Office drone Brian is transported to a strange new world..."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-0 Manchester United: We need to find our spark again - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer says his Manchester United side need to find their \"spark\" again after they were held at Crystal Palace - a third goalless draw in a row for the visitors.\nThe Red Devils never really looked like scoring in a drab encounter at Selhurst Park, with their failure to win a blow to their already slim Premier League title hopes.\nThe result means Manchester United are 14 points behind leaders Manchester City, with the two sides meeting on Sunday.\nAsked about his side's recent form, Solskjaer told BBC Sport: \"Of course it's a concern.\n\"When you have three clean sheets in a row, that will help you win games - but we haven't produced the quality.\n\"We just have to find a spark again, the quality again and try to win the games.\"\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville accused the team of \"sleepwalking\" and putting in performances that will give their top-four rivals a boost.\n\"It wasn't a good night for United,\" the Sky Sports pundit said. \"It doesn't matter who's in charge, you can't be boring and that was boring.\n\"They are sleepwalking in games. They are going to end up in a top-four race if they are not careful.\"\nThe visitors dominated possession but struggled to create many meaningful chances, with Nemanja Matic going closest in the first half when he forced Vicente Guaita into a decent save.\nPalace did not manage a shot on target until early in the second half when Jordan Ayew fired straight at keeper Dean Henderson after a good one-two with Christian Benteke.\nHowever, the hosts almost pinched it right at the end when Patrick van Aanholt was put in on goal, but he was denied by Henderson.\nThe point for Crystal Palace moved them on to 34 points and 11 points clear of the relegation zone as Roy Hodgson's side edge closer to securing another season of Premier League football.\nRelive Crystal Palace's game against Manchester United, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v DJ & producer Majestic\nA poor result before crucial period for Red Devils\nThis is the start of a potentially season-defining month for Manchester United. After facing their city rivals on Sunday, they have games against AC Milan in the Europa League, as well as an FA Cup quarter-final at Leicester.\nIt was, therefore, important they made a strong start to March. Solskjaer's side have only lost once in the Premier League since 1 November, but too many of their recent games have ended in draws.\nThis was a match they really needed to win to keep up the pressure on Manchester City, but they were far from their best as they displayed a severe lack of creativity.\nEven Bruno Fernandes, so often their attacking spark having contributed to 25 goals this season, was below par as he struggled to make an impact on Wednesday's game.\nIndeed, for large periods of this fixture the increasing thickness of the fog that had descended over Selhurst Park was the most exciting thing to develop, as Manchester United played out their third goalless draw in a row.\nIt could have been worse but for Henderson's late save. The goalkeeper was playing instead of David de Gea, who missed out for personal reasons.\nWhen pressed for what those reasons were, Solskjaer said: \"That's a private matter. It'll take the time it takes.\"\nPalace grind out an important point\nIt is well documented that Crystal Palace struggle to pose much of an attacking threat without Wilfried Zaha in their side, and they had managed just six attempts on goal over their past two matches before Wednesday.\nHowever, despite their lack of bite, they are well organised and difficult to break down under Hodgson and rarely looked in danger of losing to United.\nThe Eagles successfully nullified any threat the visitors could pose and, while chances were also few and far between for themselves, they did come closest to taking all three points with Van Aanholt's late opportunity.\nDespite the absence of Zaha, Palace have ground out five points from their past three games and that has them well on the way to a mid-table finish, avoiding any late concerns of being dragged into a relegation battle.\n\"I can't fault the players. There were a few times where we got the ball down in midfield and I thought we looked like we could score ourselves,\" said Hodgson.\n\"These guys have spent four years together doing their best to keep the team in the league. I'm so proud of them and so grateful to them for what they've done for the club.\"\nGoalless again - the stats\nThis was Manchester United's sixth goalless Premier League draw of the season, their joint most in a campaign, along with 2004-05 and 2016-17.\nCrystal Palace have now drawn back-to-back Premier League games 0-0 for the first time since December 2017.\nUnited have drawn three consecutive matches 0-0 for the first time since October 2015 under Louis van Gaal, with the third game in that run a goalless draw at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace.\nManchester United are the fifth English top-flight team to remain unbeaten in their first 14 away league matches of a season, after Leeds United in 1973-74, Liverpool in 1987-88 and Arsenal in both 2001-02 and 2003-04.\nThis was United attacking midfielder Fernandes' 21st away Premier League match - and he is yet to lose one. Only Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus (26) and former Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann (23) have had a longer unbeaten away starts in the competition.\nCrystal Palace had more shots in Wednesday's match (eight) than they had managed in their previous two league games combined (six).\nWhat next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday (19:15 GMT), while Manchester United are at Manchester City earlier on the same day (16:30).\nFrom OJ Simpson to the LA riots: How the helicopter changed the news\nZapped: Office drone Brian is transported to a strange new world..."

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Spurs win back-to-back Premier League games for first time since November\nTottenham recorded consecutive Premier League victories for the first time since November as Jose Mourinho's side survived late Fulham pressure at Craven Cottage.\nNot since beating Manchester City to move top of the table on 21 November had Spurs won back-to-back games, but a Tosin Adarabioyo own goal ensured the visitors backed up Sunday's impressive 4-0 victory over Burnley with a hard-fought three points.\nMaking a first league start since the opening day, Dele Alli played a key role in the visitors' 19th-minute opener as he fed the ball wide to Son Heung-min before meeting the South Korean's low cross - though Adarabioyo inadvertently got the decisive touch.\nSpurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris produced a fine save to tip Joachim Andersen's header on to the crossbar and was again called upon to deny Adarabioyo from the resulting corner as Fulham pushed for an equaliser after half-time.\nFulham - who remain three points from safety - were ultimately left aggrieved by a controversial video assistant referee decision to disallow Josh Maja's deserved equaliser just after the hour, as Mario Lemina was penalised for handball in the build-up despite his arm being by his side.\nHarry Kane was denied from a diving header by Alphonse Areola in the closing stages, but Mourinho's side held firm under intense pressure from the hosts to move to within four points of the top four.\nReaction to Fulham v Tottenham, plus coverage of Thursday's Premier League games\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nThird win in a week for Spurs\nAlli had not started in the Premier League since being removed at half-time against Everton almost six months ago, but the England international replaced Lucas Moura in an exciting Spurs front four behind Gareth Bale, Son and Kane.\nMourinho said it was \"amazing\" to have Alli back firing following his performance against Austrian side Wolfsberger in the Europa League last week, when he scored a superb overhead kick in a promising all-round performance.\nThe 24-year-old impressed with an energetic display during a first half which saw the Spurs attack gradually click into gear, then ignite as Kane missed a glorious opportunity to put his side ahead but headed Son's cross too close to Areola.\nBale, also given a start despite Mourinho suggesting the Welshman might not be ready four days after his standout performance against Burnley, was the catalyst for the opener, turning quickly in midfield to set Alli away.\nAlli drove confidently at the retreating Fulham defence and continued his run into the box to meet Son's cross, though the playmaker's flick was heading wide before Adarabioyo's unfortunate touch.\nIt was a rather different tale in the second half, which saw Alli and Bale removed after 67 minutes and Moussa Sissoko introduced in response to Fulham's growing dominance. It was far from convincing in the end, but a third win in a week makes for happy reading for Mourinho.\nFulham unfortunate to finish empty-handed\nFulham earned a point with a second-half goal in January's reverse fixture, and Scott Parker will undoubtedly feel his side deserved at least as much from this encounter.\nDespite their precarious position in the table, this was the first time in six Premier League games Fulham conceded the opening goal and they responded admirably in their push for parity.\nThey believed they had achieved just that when on-loan Bordeaux striker Maja finished coolly into the bottom corner, but VAR had other ideas.\nLemina was stood a couple of metres away, with his arms by his side, as Davinson Sanchez attempted to clear the ball. Instead, it struck Lemina and bounced kindly for Maja to finish before the hosts' celebrations were cut short.\nThe game epitomised Fulham's recent displays - they are defensively sound, conceding one goal in five games prior to this match, and comfortable in possession, but they remain profligate in attack. By full-time, they had managed 11 shots to Spurs' nine.\nHowever, Parker's side now have every chance of avoiding relegation following their recent five-game unbeaten run - a remarkable turnaround considering they were 10 points adrift of 17th-placed Newcastle only 19 days ago.\nFulham are dealing in fine margins, and will need those key moments to go in their favour as a tough run continues against Liverpool and Manchester City in their next two games.\n'That's the rule' - what they said\nFulham boss Scott Parker speaking to BBC Sport: \"We fully deserved something out of it. The endeavour was there for all to see.\"\nOn the disallowed goal: \"I'm not going to complain - that's the rule. If it hits your arm it gets disallowed. I don't know what he can physically do. Probably a bit of common sense needs to prevail in that rule but I'm not saying it's not the right decision because by the rule it is [correct].\"\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho: \"It was a tough game. They play very well, they don't score many but they don't concede many either.\n\"We had chances to kill it and we didn't and then the game becomes very similar to what we have had in other games. Hugo [Lloris] is the best French goalkeeper and made a couple of saves to show it.\"\nFulham's London derby woes - the stats\nTottenham have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since winning four in a row in November. They had lost five of their previous six league games before this.\nThis was only Spurs' fourth 1-0 win in the Premier League where the only goal was an own goal, but the second to come under Jose Mourinho.\nTottenham have won each of their past six away Premier League games against Fulham, stretching back to the 2010-11 season.\nFulham are without a win in 22 Premier League London derbies and have failed to score in each of their past four.\nFulham have failed to score in eight home Premier League games this season - the joint most of any side.\nWhat's next?\nFulham travel to Anfield to face Liverpool on Sunday (14:00 GMT), before Tottenham host Crystal Palace later that day (19:15).\nSupporting your immune system: Can eating certain foods help?\nRadio 1's Screen Time: Daniel Radcliffe on his tense new prison-break thriller"

It's a step in the career of everyone.\n\"We're in the fight but you need to sacrifice until the end. There's more pressure because we're in the fight for Europe, we want to be there and we've worked really hard to be there.\n\"This is our step and our target. We have to step up a bit, there's more to sacrifice.\n\"If I look at the table I'm really happy because the position is good but it's not the end of the season and we have to fight.\"\nWest Brom had been the better team in the first half at The Hawthorns but England keeper Jordan Pickford made an excellent save to keep out Mbaye Diagne's second-minute header.\nDiagne thought he had grabbed a 93rd-minute equaliser when he controlled a pass and shot into the net, but he was denied because he was narrowly offside, with the video assistant referee (VAR) confirming the on-field decision.\nWest Brom are 19th, in the relegation zone and nine points behind 17th-placed Newcastle United, who they host on Sunday.\nWest Brom v Everton as it happened, plus reaction, analysis and the rest of Thursday's Premier League action\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nLawro's predictions v DJ & producer Majestic\nAncelotti's Everton continue to get results\nEverton have been English champions on nine occasions but since the launch of the Premier League for the 1992-93 season, have only finished in the top four once - in 2004-05.\nIndeed, they have never played in the group stage of the Champions League, missing out in 2005-06 after a 4-2 aggregate loss to Spanish side Villarreal in the third qualifying round.\nHowever, with 12 league games to go, Ancelotti's team have a great chance to be playing alongside the continent's elite next season.\nThursday's win continues a remarkable turnaround for the Toffees, who were in the Premier League relegation zone under Marco Silva in December 2019, before he was sacked and caretaker boss Duncan Ferguson lifted them out of the bottom three, with Ancelotti then continuing that progress.\nInstrumental in Everton's revival has been Dominic Calvert-Lewin and the England striker, who scored a hat-trick in the Toffees' 5-2 win over West Brom at Goodison Park in September, had their best chance of the first half.\nA fortunate deflection took the ball into his path but he shot against goalkeeper Sam Johnstone's legs from 12 yards with only the keeper to beat.\nRicharlison also had a first-half chance but a superb challenge from Darnell Furlong denied the Brazilian, as the deflection took the shot narrowly over the top.\nBut the forward was not to be denied later on when he got in front of Johnstone to meet Sigurdsson's cross from the left and powerfully head home from close range.\nThe result also continues Everton's fine away record - they have now won nine of 13 league games on the road this season.\nBaggies perform well, but fail to pick up a point\nWest Brom had come into this game on an unbeaten run of three games, with clean sheets in their past two, and they will surely feel they deserved something from this game.\nThey thought they had got a point in injury time, when Diagne superbly controlled the ball and fired past Pickford - but the assistant referee raised his flag and the VAR footage showed he was offside by under a foot.\nManager Sam Allardyce has managed seven other clubs in the Premier League - including Everton - but never been relegated from the top flight, although this will surely be one of the best achievements of his career if he can keep the Baggies up.\nHe replaced the sacked Slaven Bilic after West Brom had picked up seven points from their opening 13 games, but they have now only gained an additional 10 points in Allardyce's 14 matches in charge.\nHowever, he should be pleased with his side's performance on Thursday.\nDiagne was their main threat but he was denied by Pickford in the second minute, then later shot over on the turn and also headed just off target following Furlong's long throw.\nThose missed chances proved costly as Richarlison's goal proved the difference and gave Everton the three points.\nAllardyce was unhappy a penalty was not awarded for Mason Holgate's challenge on Diagne, a decision which referee Darren England was not asked to review on the pitchside monitor.\n\"I've seen 50 or 60 penalties given for less than that and I don't know why it wasn't given,\" Allardyce told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Holgate went straight across his standing leg and when you slow it down it looks even worse.\n\"Why [video assistant referee] Michael Oliver has not asked him to have a look at it and just dismissed it, I don't know.\"\nEverton do the double over West Brom again - the stats\nThis was Everton's fifth Premier League double over West Brom - more than they have managed against any other side.\nThe Toffees have won nine away league games this season, their joint-most on the road in a campaign in the competition (also 2008-09).\nEverton have scored more headed goals than any other Premier League side this season, with Richarlison's winner their 11th.\nNo team has failed to score in more different home Premier League games this season than West Brom (eight), with the Baggies also conceding a league-high 33 goals in home games.\nRicharlison scored in his fourth consecutive Premier League game for Everton, becoming the first Brazilian player to score in four matches in a row in the competition.\n'Best 90 minutes since I've been here' - what they said\nWest Brom manager Allardyce, speaking to Match of the Day, said: \"When you start well and play as well as we did, we only have ourselves to blame.\n\"We got a good finish at the end but it was probably two millimetres offside.\n\"I thought we had the better opportunities and am very satisfied with the performance, but it does not mean a lot when you don't get the points.\n\"You have to defend crosses and Richarlison made it his own. I would've been satisfied with a point - but that's the best 90 minutes since I've been here.\"\nEverton boss Ancelotti told Match of the Day: \"It was really hard, really difficult, but the Premier League is like this. West Brom has a lot of strength, fight, long balls and a lot of spirit. We needed to be ready and we were ready.\n\"Defensively we are strong and we have quality at set-pieces and on the counter-attack.\n\"We're doing well and now we're in the fight at the top of the table. The season is still long but we are there and pleased to be there.\n\"I would like to say the season has been a fantastic one at the end of the season.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom face a big match next as they entertain 17th-placed Newcastle on Sunday (12:00 GMT) before an away game at Crystal Palace on Saturday, 13 March (15:00).\nEverton travel to Chelsea on Monday (18:00) and then host Burnley on 13 March (17:30).\nSupporting your immune system: Can eating certain foods help?\nRadio 1's Screen Time: Daniel Radcliffe on his tense new prison-break thriller"

        "article_text": "Liverpool 0-1 Chelsea: Reds 'cannot rely on the past' - Andy Robertson\nLiverpool defender Andy Robertson says they cannot \"rely on the past\" after Chelsea inflicted a fifth successive competitive home defeat on the reigning Premier League champions for the first time in their history to leave them battling to make the top four.\nMason Mount's superb individual strike three minutes before half-time gave the visitors a deserved win and extend their unbeaten run under boss Thomas Tuchel to 10 games.\nIt moved them into the top four, while Liverpool are now in seventh place and in a serious dogfight for the Champions League places.\nThe Reds, who won the title last season by 18 points, had gone 68 home league matches unbeaten before their current run started with a loss to Burnley in January.\n\"Last season is over with, it is done,\" Robertson told Sky Sports. \"We have nowhere near been good enough to what a Liverpool team should be. We are dropping further and it is not good enough.\n\"Games are running out and we need to put the pressure on the teams below us. People will think we are down and out and we need to get the results to show them we are not. At the moment we are not doing that.\n\"We can't rely on the past.\"\nMount scored brilliantly when he cut inside to fire a low shot past Liverpool keeper Alisson, reward for a first half dominated by the Blues, who also had a Timo Werner effort ruled out for offside.\nLiverpool, for whom a visibly angry Mohamed Salah was substituted just after the hour, barely threatened but were furious when penalty claims were rejected by the video assistant referee after Roberto Firmino's cross clearly struck N'Golo Kante's hand.\nAlisson had to save well from the lively Werner, but one goal was enough to give Chelsea and Tuchel another fine victory as they move four points ahead of the Reds.\n\"You saw the game - it was a tight one, it was a close one, it was an intense one,\" Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport. \"We forced them to make mistakes, they forced us to make mistakes. They used one, we didn't use ours.\n\"Against Chelsea, it would be surprising to play them off the pitch - but we were in the game. It is just annoying to talk about the same things again and again. It is tough.

We did this, we were very brave with the ball and never lost intensity with the ball.\n\"We were always aggressive and very brave. This was the key. It was a top team performance and a deserved win.\n\"Both teams started in a high level of speed and intensity. We knew that. We told the team we don't want to give too much information. When you arrive in a match like this you cannot overthink it.\n\"We managed all situations very, very good. Very, very encouraging.\"\nLiverpool and Klopp plunge further into crisis\nThe statistics surrounding Liverpool's slump are stacking around them like rubble as they suffered another defeat in this truly desperate Premier League title defence.\nJurgen Klopp's side have created unwanted history with those five defeats, they have not scored from open play in more than 10 hours at Anfield - a shocking run emphasised by the fact they only lost four matches here in the first five years and three months of the German's tenure.\nNothing summed up their current condition better than the sight of the clearly infuriated and mystified Salah reacting in very discontented fashion after his substitution in the 62nd minute.\nLiverpool will plead their case for that penalty but this cannot disguise yet another stale, limp Anfield display in the arena where they carried such a fear factor for years.\nIt has disappeared, as Burnley - who ended that 68-match unbeaten home league run - Brighton, Manchester City, Everton and now Chelsea have proved.\nLiverpool face a serious fight to finish in the top four, with neighbours Everton three points ahead of the champions in fifth with a game in hand.\nThese are statements that would have been barely believable at the start of the season, but this is Liverpool's brutal new reality.\nLiverpool's unwanted history - the best of the stats\nLiverpool have become the first English top-flight reigning champions to lose five consecutive home league games.\nSince Tuchel took charge of his first league game as Chelsea boss on 27 January, only Manchester City (24) have picked up more points than the Blues during his eight games as manager (18).

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 Arsenal: Grant Xhaka mistake proves costly for Gunners\nArsenal were denied victory by the woodwork, some heroic Burnley defending and the video assistant referee amid a dramatic late onslaught as Granit Xhaka's error ultimately cost the Gunners dear.\nAfter Xhaka's errant pass struck Chris Wood for a bizarre equaliser to cancel out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's opener, Arsenal piled on relentless pressure in the closing stages.\nThe Gunners thought they had been awarded a penalty against Erik Pieters but the spot-kick and the defender's red card for deliberate handball were overturned by VAR after replays showed he had diverted Nicolas Pepe's shot onto the bar with his shoulder.\nThat was not the end of the late drama as Ben Mee's block denied Aubameyang a sure-fire winner in stoppage time before Dani Ceballos crashed an effort against the post with almost the last kick of the game.\nUltimately, however, the blame for the dropped points will be laid at the door of Xhaka, who was sent off in the Gunners' December defeat by Burnley and had another day to forget against the Clarets.\nReceiving an ill-advised short pass facing his own goal from keeper Bernd Leno, he tried to clip a square ball to David Luiz across the penalty area but succeeded only in hitting Wood in the midriff and the ball bounced into an empty net for the softest of levellers.\nBuoyed by the unexpected gift, Burnley controlled a scrappy second half before Arsenal's late siege but Leno first produced a fine save to keep out Erik Pieters' dipping 30-yard volley, and then used his leg to deny Wood in a one-on-one.\nA fifth successive home draw inches 15th-placed Burnley seven points clear of the Premier League bottom three, while Arsenal remain 10th, their hopes of a late push for European qualification hindered by two dropped points.\nFollow reaction to Burnley v Arsenal plus live text of Saturday's other Premier League games\nA tale of two handballs\nWhile VAR reached the correct decision in reversing Andre Marriner's call to penalise and dismiss Pieters, Arsenal will have felt the technology should earlier have been used in their favour against the same player.\nPieters' arm appeared to have been outstretched when he handled Nicolas Pepe's cross midway through the second half but VAR official Kevin Friend saw no reason to bring the incident to Marriner's attention.\n\"If the first one is not a penalty honestly someone has to come to the training ground and explain what a handball is. It cannot be any clearer,\" said frustrated Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta.\n\"We hit the bar and the post, they cleared the ball off the line but they defend those situations well - and it is down to us not getting the three points.\"\nXhaka was far from Arsenal's only culprit, even though the scale of his error outweighed the Gunners' other individual failings.\nHe has made more errors, eight, leading to goals than any other outfield Premier League player since the start of 2016-17 and few, if any, will have been as glaring as his ill-judged and ill-executed miscue here.\nBut Arsenal should have been further ahead by that stage, Bukayo Saka guilty of prodding wide when clean through on Nick Pope, while Aubameyang also hooked wide after a mistake by Matthew Lowton.\nThe Gabon striker had fooled Lowton with a stepover in the build-up to giving Arsenal an early lead, his shot squeezing under the glove of Pope at his near post in front of watching England boss Gareth Southgate.\nArsenal's most glaring miss, however, came from Pepe who completely missed his kick, unmarked eight yards out, from Kieran Tierney's second-half cross before Aubameyang and Ceballos were both unlucky in time added on.\nHectic half-hour for Pieters\nIt would take some players a month to experience the sort of excitement Pieters managed to cram into half an hour, after coming on as a 63rd-minute replacement for the injured Charlie Taylor.\nThe handball shouts he survived - one correctly, the other far more up for debate - were drama enough, but in-between the former Netherlands defender unleashed a superb first-time volley that had Leno desperately backpedalling to tip over.\nPieters' positioning to, legally, divert Pepe's effort onto the woodwork was typical of a host of last-ditch defensive efforts from Burnley's back-line as the visitors threw the proverbial kitchen sink at them in the dying moments.\nChief among those was Mee flinging himself in front of Aubameyang's goal-bound strike when it seemed sure the Arsenal striker would register a fourth double, and ninth goal, in only seven appearances against the Clarets.\nWhile they were left clinging on for a point, Burnley could conceivably have collected all three, had Leno not smartly stuck out a leg to deny Wood after a classy exchange of passes with Matej Vydra.\nInstead, given the proceedings of the final few minutes, they were content with another draw to widen the gap to the relegation zone to seven points, although 18th-placed Fulham do have a game in hand.\n'Today we got the right use of VAR' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche speaking to BBC Sport: \"We had to work very hard against a decent Arsenal side but the mentality of the players was outstanding.\n\"It is a third game in a week and the physical side of the game was tremendous. During the end of the game, the mentality to block and make sure we didn't concede was fantastic.\"\nOn the VAR incident: \"I don't think he [Erik Pieters] has thrown his arm up and I do not believe it was deliberate. The referee had his red card out in a millisecond but that is what VAR is for. I know it needs streamlining but that is what it's there for.\n\"People know our history against Arsenal with last-minute goals and handballs but today we got the right use of VAR.\"\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"If you don't score your big chances, if you give a goal to the opponent and you don't get the referee's decision when you need to, it is very complicated in the Premier League to win a lot of games.\n\"The top teams sustain results and level through 10 months in this competition and you have to come here and win the game comfortably in my opinion.\n\"When you have those moments in the game when you are so dominant you have to go two or three goals up and the game is over.\n\"We gave them a goal, it can happen in football and I demand that we play the way we do. It can happen when you play long.\"\nAuba loves a sip of Claret - the stats\nBurnley have enjoyed only one win in their past 10 games in all competitions (D5 L4), after winning three in a row directly before that.\nArsenal have kept only one clean sheet in their past 11 games in all competitions (0-0 v Man Utd in January), after keeping five in a row directly before that.\nBurnley have drawn five consecutive home league games for the third time in their history, after a run of six games ending in April 1936 and a run of five ending in October 1997.\nArsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored more Premier League goals against Burnley (8) than against any other club, while only against Hamburger SV (9) has he netted more often in the top five European leagues.\nChris Wood became the eighth player to start 100 Premier League games for Burnley and marked it with his 40th goal in the competition.\nOnly Cesc Fabregas (18y & 236d) reached 50 Premier League appearances for Arsenal at a younger age than Bukayo Saka (19y & 182d), who played his 50th game today.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley visit Everton in the Premier League next Saturday, 13 March at 17:30 GMT.\nArsenal travel to Olympiakos in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday (20:00 GMT) before hosting Tottenham Hotspur in a north London derby in the Premier League next Sunday (16:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 0-2 Southampton: Saints end winless run at Bramall Lane\nSouthampton won for the first time in 10 Premier League matches as Che Adams' spectacular strike helped Ralph Hasenhuttl's side claim all three points at Sheffield United, whose slim survival hopes took another blow at Bramall Lane.\nAdams rifled a half-volley into the top corner four minutes into the second half, ending a run of 16 games without a goal in all competitions.\nSaints, who lost Danny Ings to an early injury, had broken the deadlock when James Ward-Prowse sent Aaron Ramsdale the wrong way from the penalty spot following Ethan Ampadu's clumsy challenge on Nathan Tella.\nTakumi Minamino should have added a third for Southampton when he fired wide from Ryan Bertrand's low cross, while Adams, Nathan Redmond and Stuart Armstrong all went close late on.\n'A couple of players need to go' - Wilder says Sheff Utd squad needs shake-up\n\"The first win after such a long time is always the most difficult one, now we have to keep on improving,\" Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport afterwards.\n\"We are looking in every direction and we still had some moments today in the game where we were not that controlled. But it's normal after such a long run without a win.\"\nOn Ings' injury, Hasenhuttl added: \"I do not know yet [how serious it is]. It doesn't look that good and it is a muscle injury.\"\nThe Blades had opportunities of their own but only tested Fraser Forster twice throughout the 90 minutes.\nThe win lifts Saints 10 points clear of the relegation zone, while Chris Wilder's side remain rooted to the foot of the table - 12 points from safety.\nSaints back to winning ways as Hasenhuttl reaches 100 not out\nSouthampton fans could have been forgiven for casting nervous glances towards the bottom three following their 1-0 defeat at Everton on Monday, but this win - their first in the league since beating Liverpool on 4 January - will go some way towards easing their relegation fears.\nThe visitors were able to call upon Kyle Walker-Peters, Ibrahima Diallo and Minamino following injury but were dealt a blow when Ings was forced off with what appeared to be a groin problem inside the opening 15 minutes.\nSaints, driven on by the impressive Tella, soon recovered from that early setback and took a deserved lead when Ward-Prowse sent Ramsdale the wrong way from 12 yards after Ampadu's lunge on the Southampton youngster.\nWard-Prowse has now been directly involved in 26 Premier League goals under Hasenhuttl, twice as many as under any other Saints manager.\nAdams, who last made the scoresheet against Sheffield United back in December, ended his goal drought in spectacular fashion early in the second half, thumping Armstrong's knock-down into the top corner.\nHasenhuttl's side could have won by a more handsome margin, but Minamino spurned a glorious chance to register his third goal in five league appearances for the club when he somehow failed to hit the target from Bertrand's cut-back.\nRamsdale did well to stop Tella's low strike from nestling in the far corner before thwarting Adams and Redmond from similar positions inside the area, but Hasenhuttl will gladly settle for a 2-0 victory on his 100th game in charge of the club.\nTime running out for beleaguered Blades\nBlades manager Wilder had called on his players to reproduce the \"desire, spirit and commitment\" they showed in their 1-0 win over Aston Villa, in which they survived more than 30 minutes with 10 men.\nWhile there was no questioning United's character against Saints, the closest Wilder's side came to getting on the scoresheet in the first half was when David McGoldrick shot tamely into Forster's arms after Diallo had given the ball away in midfield.\nKean Bryan directed a close-range header over the crossbar not long afterwards - although the defender may have strayed just offside from John Fleck's free-kick.\nUnited enjoyed over 60% possession in the second half but failed to test Forster again until half-time substitute Oliver McBurnie headed straight at the keeper eight minutes from time.\nWilder has always insisted his side will fight tooth and nail in their battle to avoid relegation, but time is running out for the Blades in their bid to secure a third successive season of Premier League football.\nMost defeats in 15 years - the stats\nSheffield United have become only the second English top-flight team to lose 22 of their first 28 games in a season after Sunderland in 2005-06.\nThe Blades have shipped the first goal in 21 Premier League games this season - more than any other side.\nSouthampton have won four consecutive league encounters with Sheffield United for the first time since 1950 in the second tier.\nSouthampton ended a seven-match winless run away from home in the Premier League (D2 L5). Saints also scored as many goals at Sheffield United as they did in their previous six on the road (2).\nSouthampton striker Adams has scored four goals in his four Premier League appearances against former side Sheffield United, accounting for 44% of his total goals in the competition.\nWard-Prowse has scored seven goals in all competitions this season, his joint best return in a single campaign for Southampton. Six of these seven goals have come from dead-ball situations (5 direct free-kicks, 1 penalty).\n'We have to keep improving' - what the managers said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We made finishing drills in the final session yesterday and I think it helped [Adams]. It's what you are here for as a substitute that you come on and show your qualities. He played well last year as well.\n\"Both strikers did a good job. Nathan Tella was the man of the match today because he was hard to defend against and always hungry for every second ball.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We didn't deserve anything from the game. They [Southampton] were better. It was a great opportunity but it's been a tough week, playing Liverpool on Sunday and then down to 10 men after 60 minutes in midweek.\n\"We didn't show the quality we needed to hurt them. There was nothing in the game and then it was one great ball.\n\"It's a brilliant finish for Che [Adams]. I'm delighted for him and I've just spoken to him. He was here as a kid and was a bit of a loose cannon then, but he has got himself forward and he is a proper centre-forward.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City on Wednesday 10 March (18:00 GMT), while Sheffield United visit top-four hopefuls Leicester City in their next league game the following Sunday (14:00 GMT)."

They were good second half and created chances as well and they should've gone ahead. It was the proverbial game of two halves.\n\"Wolves upped their tempo and I couldn't work out if it was us being poor or them being better. I think it was a bit of both. We've created chances in the first half with some of our best play this season. We wanted to replicate it in the second half but unfortunately didn't.\n\"It probably is a point game but I was sitting at half-time thinking how are we not in front but I think it's a fair result.\"\nOn Jack Grealish: \"He was back running on the anti-gravity treadmill a few days ago so once he's pain free he should be ready to go.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"The first half we didn't play well but everything changed in the second half. We improved and I thought we were good.\n\"With the honesty I have with Conor [Coady], I think he should have done better [scored]. We were much better with the pressing in the second half. We played much better.\"\nVilla keep another clean sheet - the stats\nWolves remain unbeaten in their last five away Premier League games against Aston Villa (W2 & D3), having lost on six of their previous seven trips to Villa Park in the top-flight before this (W1).\nAston Villa have failed to score in each of their last four home Premier League games against Wolves - only against Chelsea (a run of five between October 1995 - January 2000) and Man Utd (a run of five between March 2003 - December 2006) have they had a longer run of games without scoring against a specific opponent at Villa Park in the competition.\nAston Villa have kept 14 clean sheets in the Premier League this season, their highest tally in a single top-flight campaign since 2009-10 under Martin O'Neill (15), whilst only league leaders Man City (15) have kept more shut outs in the competition in 2020-21.\nWolves (P6 W0 D3 L3) are one of only two sides that remain winless in Premier League games played on a Saturday this season alongside Sheffield United (P9 W0 D0 L9).\nUnder Dean Smith, Aston Villa have won just two of their 12 home league games without Jack Grealish (D5 L5) and remain winless in such matches since a 2-1 victory against Bristol City in the Championship in April 2019 (P4 W0 D1 L3 since then).\nWolves have won just one of their last 10 away Premier League games (D4 L5), with that victory coming at Southampton in February.\nNo Argentine goalkeeper has more Premier League clean sheets than Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez (20, level with Julian Speroni).\nWolves captain Conor Coady has had a shot on target in his last two Premier League games, after not registering a single one in his first 102 appearances in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa travel to Newcastle in their next Premier League fixture on Friday, 12 March (20:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "West Brom 0-0 Newcastle: Baggies held to goalless draw by Magpies\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce praised his side for claiming an \"important\" point in Sunday's goalless draw at West Brom after a week dominated by off-field rows and a mounting injury list.\nMagpies midfielder Matt Ritchie apologised to Bruce in midweek following a training ground bust-up between the pair.\nBruce, during a fractious news conference on Friday, then denied reports the players were unhappy with the team's training schedule and pledged to find the person responsible for leaking details about the club to the press.\nHe also went to the Hawthorns without his three first-choice attacking players, but saw his side earn a battling point that lifts them above Brighton into 16th and briefly put them four points clear of the relegation zone, before Fulham's victory at Liverpool reduced the deficit to one.\n\"I was delighted with their attitude and spirit,\" Bruce told BBC Match of the Day. \"We showed a real desire to get something out of the game. In terms of the problems we have had, in terms of injuries not rows, it was important.\"We have been hamstrung a bit with [injuries to] big players at the top end of the pitch. For their effort and attitude I could not ask for anything more.\"With Newcastle things seem to get blown out of proportion. Rows happen every other day at every other club up and down the country.\"\nThe Magpies had the better opportunities in a game lacking attacking fluency, but West Brom goalkeeper Sam Johnstone was alert to deny Jonjo Shelvey and Joe Willock either side of half-time.\nMbaye Diagne had the best chance for the Baggies when his header was tipped behind by Martin Dubravka, while Matt Phillips fired over when well placed early in the second half.The draw means West Brom stay 19th and are now eight points from safety.\nLive reaction West Brom v Newcastle and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nMagpies edging towards safety\nBruce may have been happy to claim a point but this was far from an inspiring performance.\nHis cause has not been helped by injuries to key players and the Magpies went to the Hawthorns without leading scorer Callum Wilson, Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin - a trio responsible for 16 of their 27 league goals so far.\nIn their absence Bruce sent out a makeshift forward line of Ryan Fraser, Joelinton and Willock, who have scored two goals between them this campaign.\nJoelinton did have an early sight of goal when he was played in by Willock down the right, but he opted to pass instead of shoot and his square ball towards Fraser was cut out.\nBruce introduced Dwight Gayle, who scored 23 goals for West Brom in the Championship two seasons ago, early in the second half to try and boost his side's attacking threat.\nAnd he made an impact within minutes of coming on, with his run and layoff teeing up Willock, whose drive from a tight angle was pushed behind by Johnstone.\nJoelinton also saw a timid effort comfortably saved by the Baggies goalkeeper as Newcastle's attacking threat slowly fizzled out.\n\"That little bit of quality at times we lacked a bit, but that is what you pay money for,\" said Bruce. \"Where we have invested over the last few months, unfortunately they are all injured.\"\nBruce has regularly talked about 'accumulation of points' when plotting Newcastle's survival and this draw helps that cause.\nBut with seven of the current top 10 lying in wait in their final 11 matches they will likely need to offer a greater attacking threat than they showed here if they are to avoid a nervous end to the season.\nBaggies let down by lack of cutting edge\nSam Allardyce has succeeded in making West Brom tougher to beat, but like Sunday's opponents, goalscoring is becoming a problem.\nThe Baggies have kept three clean sheets and earned six points in their past five games, one more than they earned in Allardyce's first 10 matches in charge, but have only scored two goals in that time.\nThey would have moved to within six points of Newcastle with a win and while a draw is not a disastrous result, they are running out of games if they are to bridge the now eight-point gap between themselves and safety.\nFull-back Conor Townsend was their biggest attacking threat as they looked to build patiently down the left, with the five chances he created more than any West Brom player has managed from open play for seven years.\nHowever, the Baggies failed to truly test Dubravka in the Newcastle goal, with Matheus Pereira scuffing an early opportunity straight at the Slovak.\nA long throw then produced a chance for Diagne when Kyle Bartley flicked the ball into his path, but he could only fire over while off-balance.\nTheir best opportunity fell to Phillips early in the second half when Pereira worked the ball low into the box, but the winger's effort was indicative of the match in general as it flew wildly over the bar.\n'So close yet so far' - what they said\nWest Brom boss Sam Allardyce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"[The result is] not enough obviously but we have to carry on trying to win games of football when they come round.\n\"The players need to keep their chins up and play like they are playing. The only thing missing is converting the chances we create - we have got the defensive side of it spot on now.\n\"We certainly had enough chances to accumulate 12 points in the last few games and not just four.\n\"We have been so close yet so far. That is the story of everything.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We are disappointed that we didn't win, whether we did enough to win it, who knows?\n\"Eleven games to go, we've done OK. The last five or six games there's only been Chelsea and Manchester United that have beaten us. We will take a point and move on.\"\nNewcastle still cannot win without Wilson - the stats\nWest Brom are unbeaten in three home league games against Newcastle (W1 D2) for the first time since January 2005 (3 draws in a row).\nOnly Southampton (7) have gained fewer Premier League points in 2021 than West Brom (10) and Newcastle (8).\nWest Brom have amassed six points in their last five Premier League games (W1 D3 L1), keeping three clean sheets, more points than they gained (5) in their first 10 such games under Sam Alladyce (W1 D2 L7).\nNewcastle have won only one of their past nine Premier League away games (D1 L7), failing to score in six of those matches.\nWest Brom had 13 shots at goal in the match, their joint-most attempts without scoring in a Premier League game this season (also 13 v Burnley in October).\nConor Townsend created five chances in the match, the most from open play by a West Brom player in the Premier League since April 2014 (Morgan Amalfitano vs West Ham - 5).\nNewcastle have failed to win any of their past four Premier League games since Callum Wilson was injured during their win over Southampton in February (D2 L2). Since the start of last season, the Magpies are winless in their four Premier League matches when both Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin have failed to feature (D1 L3).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle are at home to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Friday (20:00 GMT), while West Brom travel to another of Sam Allardyce's former clubs Crystal Palace the following day (15:00)."

There's a lot of emotion and I am very proud,\" said Parker. \"I am happy for the players and the team because they got nothing short of what they deserved. There was a resilience and real attitude to keep the ball out of the net and defend.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp made seven changes following the defeat to Chelsea in attempt to freshen things up, but Fulham were the better side and carved out four chances in the opening half an hour alone.\nAdemola Lookman, who was given the freedom of Anfield, twice got behind the inexperienced Reds defence but could not finish while Josh Maja was denied by a brave save by Alisson.\nThe winner came after Liverpool thought they had cleared a free-kick but Salah was caught on the ball by Lemina who produced an arrowed finish, his first goal since joining on loan from Southampton.\nDiogo Jota, making his first start since 28 November, was denied an equaliser by an acrobatic save from Alphonse Areola early in the second half before substitute Sadio Mane hit the post with a looping header.\nBut Liverpool were poor and have now failed to win their last eight home games.\nWeary Liverpool look broken\nIt was this time last year that Liverpool went 25 points clear at the top of the table after a win over Bournemouth in front of a raucous Anfield crowd.\nTwelve months on and Premier League games at Anfield have become an uncomfortable watch for Klopp and this was another stodgy repeat of recent performances.\nThe Liverpool manager's attempts to shake things up by making wholesale changes backfired as Fulham, who have spent most of the season in the bottom three, took advantage of another inexperienced centre-back partnership in the shape of Nathaniel Phillips and Rhys Williams.\nLookman and Maja were a constant source of worry as they exploited huge pockets of space before Salah, the Premier League's leading scorer, was dispossessed by Lemina for the goal.\nKlopp sent on Mane, Fabinho and Trent Alexander-Arnold in an attempt to rescue the game but, despite an improved second-half showing, this was another woeful performance which extended an inexcusable run of home losses.\nLiverpool, who finished the day eighth in the table, have yet to score a goal in open play at home in 2021.\nA plane circled above Anfield during the game towing a banner which read: 'Unity in Strength - Let's Go Reds YNWA'.\nBut Liverpool, who are in Champions League action on Wednesday, have the weary look of a team who cannot wait for the season to finish.\nFrom 10 points from safety to fighting chance\nFulham boss Parker let out a huge scream of delight at the final whistle after this momentous win.\nAs recently as 13 February the Cottagers were 10 points from safety, but this result will give them huge belief for the final 10 games of the season.\nA performance full of character and spirit was characterised by Joachim Andersen's clearance right at the end, the Fulham skipper saving his side with Mane poised to turn home Andy Robertson's centre.\nToo many times this season Fulham have struggled to turn draws into wins but there was a dogged resilience about they way they went about their work.\nThey are now unbeaten in eight games away from home, their longest without defeat on the road in their top-flight history.\nFulham still have work to do but two wins on Merseyside - this result coming three weeks after a 2-0 win at Everton - has helped transform their campaign.\nIt's runaway leaders Manchester City up next, but it will be home results against Wolves, Burnley and, on the final day, Newcastle that will determine whether Fulham will be in the Premier League next season.\n'We're missing a goal and a clean sheet' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"The obvious thing was missing a goal and a clean sheet. It was always clear that Fulham would cause us big problems with the situation they are in and the one we are in.\n\"It was clear we had to adapt. We started quite well, we were direct and Mo Salah caused them problems but we didn't finish the situations off. Then Fulham were good.\n\"Our last line was completely new. We had balls in behind where we had to run a lot because we were not high enough or just not in the right position and we conceded the goal.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker: \"In the first half I thought we were fantastic. We created numerous chances and we stuck to the plan in terms of how we wanted to cause them problems.\n\"The main thing coming into the game was 'can we put our stamp on it?' - easier said than done of course.\n\"We deserved this result and we have deserved better results over the last few weeks.\"\nFirst since Huddersfield - the stats\nLiverpool are the first side to lose six in a row on home soil in the Premier League since Huddersfield Town in February 2019 (seven).\nFulham are the first newly-promoted side to win away at Liverpool in the Premier League since Blackpool beat Roy Hodgson's Reds in October 2010.\nExcluding penalties and own goals, Liverpool have failed to score with each of their last 115 shots at Anfield in the Premier League (including 16 on Sunday).\nHaving kept just four clean sheets in their first 21 Premier League games of the season, Fulham have since kept five in their last seven in the competition, conceding just two goals in this run.\nLiverpool's six league defeats at Anfield in 2020-21 is their most in a single campaign since 1953-54 (also six), when the Reds finished bottom of the top flight.\nAll three of Fulham midfielder Mario Lemina's Premier League goals have been scored away from home, each also coming in a different season (in 2017-18 v West Brom, 2018-19 v Newcastle and this season v Liverpool).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool turn their attention to the Champions League on Wednesday (20:00 GMT) as they look to see off RB Leipzig after establishing a 2-0 first leg lead in the last-16 tie.

        "article_text": "Man City 0-2 Man Utd: Bruno Fernandes & Luke Shaw seal derby win\nManager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United are not thinking about chasing down Manchester City despite bringing the Premier League leaders' sequence of 21 successive victories to a crashing halt with an impressive derby victory at Etihad Stadium.\nPep Guardiola's side still have what looks to be an unassailable 11-point lead at the top of the table, but the manner in which United subdued a previously unstoppable City and enhanced their own top-four chances will be a huge confidence boost to Solskjaer and his players.\nUnited, who have now gone 22 league away games unbeaten - including 14 wins - stunned City with a fast start and were ahead after a penalty was awarded inside the first 30 seconds when Gabriel Jesus fouled the impressive Antony Martial.\nBruno Fernandes scored from the spot despite City keeper Ederson getting a strong hand on the ball, then United fashioned the win with a mixture of solid defence and constant menace on the break.\nNot lack of ability that has cost Man Utd title - Shearer analysis\nRodri almost equalised just after the break when his shot glanced off the angle of post and bar, but United effectively sealed the win - condemning City to their first loss since a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham on 21 November - when the outstanding Luke Shaw, who had earlier missed a chance to double United's lead, led a counter-attack, exchanging passes with Marcus Rashford before beating Ederson with a low shot.\nSolskjaer's team, who had not scored in their previous three games, moved back into second place, a point ahead of Leicester City in the increasingly tight fight for a place in the top four.\n\"They [Manchester City] are so far ahead you can't really think about anything but making sure we win our games and be better than last year,\" Solskjaer told BBC Sport.\n\"We were third so we want to move up the table of course.\"\nUnited show their best side\nUnited's recent performances were greeted with frustration, particularly after they played out unambitious, goalless stalemates at Chelsea and Crystal Palace.\nIt cemented the impression that this was a very talented side that had arguably under-achieved this season.\nThis was the other face of United, the one they need to show more often if they are to find the sort of consistency that leads to serious title challenges.\nThey struck early to grab the initiative, then retained impressive composure and control even as City, inevitably, threatened to work their way back into contention.\nAnd the symbol of what United could be perhaps came in the shape of Anthony Martial, so often inconsistent but outstanding here as they looked a constant threat on the break.\nMartial missed a couple of second-half opportunities but fully deserved the applause he received from the United bench when he was replaced by Nemanja Matic late on.\nMartial was not the only significant contributor. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson looked secure and confident as he kept another clean sheet, pressing his claims to be United's number one with David de Gea away in Spain after the birth of his daughter.\nShaw will have impressed watching England manager Gareth Southgate, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka won his personal battle with Raheem Sterling.\nThis, above all, was a tight-knit team effort from United and great credit must go to Solskjaer for another impressive game plan and victory at City.\nUnited did the double over City last season and Solskjaer is the first United manager to win three successive away games against their arch-rivals since a run of four between November 1993 and November 2000.\nHe is also the first manager in United's history to win his first three away meetings against City in all competitions.\nAll in all, a good day's work for United and their manager.\nCity finally fall short\nCity and Guardiola will be bitterly disappointed that it was United who finally brought their winning run to an end, but it is hardly a wound that is likely to prove fatal to their title aspirations.\nCity had to fall eventually and it came against a United side that seem to have the formula to subdue them at Etihad Stadium. And so it proved once more.\nCity paid the price for a dreadfully sluggish start in which they conceded the penalty and offered up other opportunities which they were fortunate United did not take.\nNot even the finest teams can maintain winning streaks forever and this was a day when City could not hit their rhythm, were guilty of over-elaboration in and around the penalty area and their best performers could not hit the heights.\nKevin de Bruyne's touch deserted him, even if his willingness to demand the ball and determination to influence events did not, while Sterling could not get the better of Wan-Bissaka.\nJesus' only contribution of significance was to give away the penalty, and it was surprise that when City needed a goal and penalty box skirmishes were increasing, Guardiola chose to leave his master marksman Sergio Aguero on the bench.\nThis was not City's day but the bigger picture is still bright as they chase four trophies. One defeat will not derail them from that and it is impossible to see anyone else ending as Premier League champions despite this painful loss to their neighbours.\n'What a performance' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport: \"Congratulations Manchester United first of all.\n\"Ten games left - now we arrive at the important part of the season. The last 10 games are important and we start next Wednesday. We will try to win as many games as possible to be champions.\n\"Against West Ham we played much, much worse than today. Against West Ham we didn't deserve to win and maybe today we didn't deserve to lose. We were not good in front of goal - our strikers were not brilliant today - but it happens.\"\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told BBC Sport: \"I'm delighted. We were on the front foot for 10-15 minutes but then the last half hour of the first half we played too much on the result. We had to get to half-time to get hold of everyone again.\n\"The second goal was magnificent. Luke just showed what he is about. He was a massive doubt this morning and had to go through a fitness test to play. What a performance.\n\"We defended really well. We were more like ourselves with the ball attacking-wise.\n\"Anthony Martial was man of the match and he was an even bigger doubt than Luke. That was the Anthony we know - strong, positive and taking players on. I'm delighted for him.\"\nCity's run comes to an end - the stats\nManchester City were beaten for the first time since November 2020 (2-0 by Tottenham), ending a run of 28 games without defeat across all competitions.\nAmong managers Pep Guardiola has faced more than three times across all competitions as a top-flight boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the only one to have won (four) more often than he has lost (three).\nSince the start of the 2019-20 season, three of City's five home defeats in all competitions have come against United.\nUnited are unbeaten in their past 103 Premier League games when leading at half-time (W91 D12).\nMarcus Rashford's assist for United's second goal was his 10th in all competitions this season - the first time he has reached double figures.\nSince his Premier League debut in February 2020, United's Bruno Fernandes has scored 12 of his 13 penalties.\nWhat's next?\nCity are back in league action against Southampton on Wednesday (18:00 GMT) before travelling to Fulham on Saturday (20:00).\nUnited take on AC Milan in the Europa League last 16 first leg on Thursday (17:55), and host David Moyes' West Ham in the league on Sunday (19:15).\nOur lives online: What happens when being a troll becomes the new normal?\nThe iconic Daft Punk: Another chance to hear their legendary Essential Mix"

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 4-1 Crystal Palace: Gareth Bale and Harry Kane both score twice for Spurs in comfortable win\nGareth Bale and Harry Kane both scored twice to inspire Tottenham to a third consecutive Premier League win at the expense of Crystal Palace.\nOn-loan Real Madrid forward Bale had Kane to thank for both of his goals, opening the scoring with a tap-in from Kane's cross and heading in a superb second from another assist from the England forward.\nIn between, Christian Benteke had drawn Palace level with their first effort on target with a fine header from Luka Milivojevic's cross.\nHowever, while the returning Wilfried Zaha hit the post for Roy Hodgson's side after being introduced as a substitute they were unable to cope with the firepower at the hosts' disposal.\nKane, who had played the role of provider, opened his account for the evening with a curling 20-yard effort into the top left corner and then dispatched Son Heung-min's cut-back to register his 24th goal of the campaign in all competitions.\nThe goal rounded off a fine Spurs display and brought up a notable landmark, with Kane and Son now having combined for more goals in a single season than any other duo in Premier League history.\nThe result lifts Tottenham up to sixth in the table and they are now just two points off a top-four place, with Palace remaining in 13th.\nFollow Tottenham v Crystal Palace plus reaction from the Manchester derby\nLawro's full predictions v singer-songwriter Ben Howard\nImpressive Tottenham on the march?\nTottenham had topped the Premier League table when these sides met in the reverse fixture on 13 December.\nBut while they faltered with seven defeats in a 12-game spell either side of Christmas, the manner of this performance will have delivered a stark warning to their competitors for the European places that they appear to have rediscovered a winning formula.\nMuch of that can be attributed to the attacking players that Jose Mourinho is able to call upon. And Lucas Moura, Son, Kane and Bale were all influential over the course of this victory.\nWhile Moura will not grab the headlines, the only home player to cover more ground than the Brazilian was full-back Matt Doherty.\nIt was Moura's persistence and energy that caught out Milivojevic, allowing Kane to tee up an easy opener for Bale.\nThe Welshman, who now has six goals in his last six appearances for Spurs looks rejuvenated and was excellent until his withdrawal in the 70th minute.\nThe 31-year-old may be approaching the twilight years of his career but he again exhibited his enduring quality - with glorious switches of play and shows of athleticism, most notably when he towered above Cheikhou Kouyate to score his second goal of the game.\nMeanwhile, Kane's selfless display and exhibition of clinical finishing ensured he became the first Spurs player to deliver two or more goals and assists in the same Premier League game for the club since Jurgen Klinsmann against Wimbledon in May 1998.\nPalace punished\nHaving frustrated Tottenham with their regimented approach early on, Hodgson would have been angered by the manner in which his side fell behind.\nIt did not arrive from a moment of magic from Kane, Son or Bale.\nNor did it come from particularly incisive play to carve open the two banks of four visiting players patrolling the space in front of goalkeeper Vicente Guaita.\nInstead, it came from their own ill-judged attempt to play out from the back, with captain Milivojevic losing possession to Moura and Kane and Bale doing the rest.\nHowever, while the Eagles boss appeared satisfied by their response, and Milivojevic atoning for his error, they were unable to muster a single effort on target after equalising.\nWhile Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jeffrey Schlupp were both introduced to inject pace and threat alongside Zaha, it proved a difficult evening on which to make an impact.\nPalace's passing in the final third of the pitch was lacking precision on too many occasions, and it ensured an end to a three-game unbeaten run which has left them in a strong position to retain their Premier League status.\n'We are in a positive moment' - what they said\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho to BBC Sport: \"They were good goals. Harry Kane's first one was magnificent. We played good football.\n\"It looks silly to say but I'm happy with the goal we conceded. My feeling in the 10 minutes of the first half was that if we finished 1-0 then maybe we would start the second half the same way.\n\"We lost a little bit of the hunger and desire to attack. We were too passive, we were in control. We made one mistake and conceded a goal. So I had a positive feeling when we conceded.\n\"In the second half we had to go with everything. Then it was the feeling that a one-goal difference is not enough, and then we made it 2-1 and went for 3-1 immediately after.\n\"I was happy with the attitude, the feeling and naughty smile of scoring 100 goals in the season and we are a defensive team. It was a good week for us - three matches, nine points, no injuries and everyone is coming back. We are in a positive moment.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm not good at taking positives from a game when I have seen the team lose by four goals to one. I thought we were heavily punished by the quality of the goals and some of the quality of play in the final third.\n\"I think on another day we may not have been punished quite as harshly. And also with some of the play in the second half we might have added to the goal we scored, which was a good goal.\n\"I thought we came across a Tottenham team tonight that is in fine form. They had all their star players and their really good quality players firing on all cylinders. As a result they overwhelmed us at times and won the game as a result of it.\"\nTottenham's home fortress\nOnly league leaders Manchester City (35) have earned more points at home in this season's Premier League than Tottenham Hotspur (24).\nTottenham's fourth goal was their 100th in all competitions this season, becoming the second club in Europe's big-five leagues to reach that tally in 2020-21, after Bayern Munich (106).\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has failed to win all six of his Premier League meetings with Spurs' Jose Mourinho (D3 L3), the joint-most he's faced a particular manager in the competition without yet winning (level with Jurgen Klopp).\nCrystal Palace's goal was from their very first shot of the match, and their only shot on target.\nTottenham's Gareth Bale has scored in each of his last three home appearances in all competitions, the first time he has done so since September 2018 for Real Madrid (four in a row), and first time for Spurs since May 2013.\nHarry Kane has been directly involved in 40 goals in 36 games in all competitions for Tottenham this season (24 goals and 16 assists), the most of any player for a Premier League club.\nTottenham duo Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min have now assisted one another for 14 Premier League goals this season, breaking Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton's all-time competition record of 13 set in 1994-95 for Blackburn.\nSince the Belgian's first Premier League season (2012-13), only Olivier Giroud (32) has more headed goals in the competition than Crystal Palace's Christian Benteke (29).\nWhat's next?\nTottenham face Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb in the first leg of their last-16 tie in the Europa League on Thursday, 11 March (20:00 GMT).

It was the trust we gave him and he used that trust,\" said Tuchel, who has not lost in 11 games in charge since replacing the sacked Frank Lampard in January.\n\"He has all the ability to be a dominant figure in [attack] and he stepped up.\n\"He showed up between the lines to accelerate our game, increase the touches in the box, be responsible for assists and through-balls, and take responsibility to finish himself.\n\"There is no doubt about his quality, his talent and his character.\"\nHavertz also had a goal disallowed for a handball and Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who had conceded the penalty, made a number of saves to deny Chelsea a bigger winning margin.\nTuchel's side remain fourth and in the last Champions League qualifying spot. With 10 league games of the season left, they are now only three points behind third-placed Leicester and four adrift of Manchester United in second.\nChelsea are two points ahead of West Ham, although the Hammers, up to fifth and above Everton following a 2-0 win over Leeds, have a game in hand.\nChelsea v Everton, plus West Ham v Leeds as it happened\nLawro's predictions v singer-songwriter Ben Howard\nListen to BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast\nChelsea revival continues with routine win\nChelsea have played in the Champions League in 15 of the past 17 campaigns, but were ninth in the Premier League, and five points off the top four, when they sacked Lampard in January.\nTuchel has transformed their fortunes. This victory means they have won six and drawn three of his nine league matches in charge, as well as winning games in the FA Cup and Champions League.\nThe German, who guided Paris St-Germain to the Champions League final in 2019-20, made five changes from the side that won 1-0 at Liverpool on Thursday and saw his team dominate possession.\nJorginho twice volleyed wide from outside the area before they went ahead on 31 minutes.\nAlonso fired in a low cross from the left and Havertz flicked the ball on, but it took a big deflection off Godfrey to leave Pickford with no chance.\nHavertz thought he had scored only his second Premier League goal when he collected Callum Hudson-Odoi's chipped pass and fired past Pickford early in the second half.\nHowever, the goal was ruled out as referee David Coote judged the German had handled the ball, with video assistant referee Michael Oliver confirming the on-field decision.\nBut it became 2-0 soon after when Jorginho scored his seventh goal of the season with a calmly taken penalty as Chelsea completed a routine win.\nReality check for Ancelotti's Everton\nAfter Thursday's 1-0 win at West Brom, Ancelotti, who guided Chelsea to the Premier League and FA Cup double in 2009-10, said he was \"dreaming\" of taking the Toffees into the Champions League.\nBut this performance brought them back to reality and showed they will need further improvement if they are to break into the top four.\nThey had to wait until first-half injury time before they could test home goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and he saved a 25-yard low strike from Andre Gomes - the visitors' only shot on target.\nRicharlison had scored in Everton's past four games and had a good chance but, off balance and from a tight angle, could only shoot wide.\nEngland striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin also had a quiet evening as the Blues kept a clean sheet for the ninth time in 11 matches under Tuchel.\nEverton never looked like getting back into the match and Pickford made a number of saves to keep out efforts from Timo Werner, Kurt Zouma, N'Golo Kante and Mason Mount.\nA rare away loss for Everton this season - the stats\nChelsea are unbeaten in their past 26 Premier League home games against Everton (won 15). Only against Spurs have the Blues had a longer unbeaten home run in top-flight history (27 from 1990-2016).\nOnly against Leeds (35 from 1946-2001) have Everton had a longer winless away run in the top flight than they have at Chelsea.\nOnly Maurizio Sarri (12 with Chelsea in 2018-19) and Frank Clark (11 with Nottingham Forest in 1994-95) have begun their Premier League managerial careers with a longer unbeaten run than Chelsea's Thomas Tuchel (currently played nine, won six, drawn three).\nEverton suffered their first away Premier League defeat since losing at Newcastle in November, ending their nine-game unbeaten run on the road in the competition.\nTuchel has become the first manager in Premier League history to see his side keep a clean sheet in each of his first five home games in charge in the competition.\nEverton have scored 53 own goals in the Premier League, seven more than any other side in the competition's history.\nOnly Liverpool's James Milner in 2016-17 (seven out of seven) has scored more goals in a single Premier League season with all of them coming from the penalty spot than Chelsea's Jorginho this term (six out of six).\n'We controlled it completely' - what they said\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, talking to BT Sport, said: \"We deserved to win. It was a very difficult first half but we controlled it completely. Second half, we increased our level and had a lot of dangerous attacks.\n\"You see the quality of the players and the club. It is a pleasure to be on the sideline and work with the team. Everybody in the club is doing everything to compete at this level.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti, speaking to BT Sport, said: \"They played better than us. They deserved to win. We were good defensively for 30 minutes. When they scored, the game became difficult for us. They are a good team.\n\"Jordan did well. For the penalty he can do better but it doesn't change the performance. I think it was a penalty.\n\"The game that we planned was what we got for 30 minutes. But we have to be honest, we are not at the same level. We cannot play an open game against this kind of team. It was the plan to play the same way as we played against Liverpool, but against Liverpool we scored early.\n\"We are looking to fight for Europe. This is good for us. We will be there until the last game. We are disappointed for this defeat but no tragedy. We look to the next game.\"\nWhat's next?\nChelsea face Leeds away on Saturday (12:30 GMT), then play the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at home against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday, 17 March (20:00 GMT), followed by a home match versus Sheffield United in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday, 21 March (13:30 GMT).\nEverton play Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday (17:30 GMT) before another home game a week later when they entertain Manchester City in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Saturday, 20 March (17:30 GMT).\nDeLorean: Back from the Future: How a fairytale went horribly wrong\nSnowfall: A new drug hits the streets of LA and changes the game forever..."

        "article_text": "West Ham 2-0 Leeds United: Hammers up to fifth in table\nMidfielder Declan Rice said West Ham is a \"special place to be\" as they maintained their unlikely push for a place in next season's Champions League with victory over Leeds United.\nDavid Moyes' side climbed to fifth in the Premier League - two points behind Chelsea, who beat Everton 2-0 earlier on Monday - and have a game in hand on their London rivals.\nJesse Lingard sparked West Ham into life at London Stadium when his menacing run into the penalty area drew a foul from Luke Ayling. Lingard, on loan from Manchester United, converted the rebound after his spot-kick was saved by Illan Meslier.\nLeeds had found the net twice in a blistering opening spell, but Tyler Roberts' finish was ruled out for a marginal offside against Helder Costa, and Raphinha ran the ball out of play before crossing to Patrick Bamford.\nBut they were two goals down before half-time when the unmarked Craig Dawson headed in Aaron Cresswell's corner.\nMarcelo Bielsa's Leeds went close to a response five minutes after the restart when Raphinha's sensational overhead attempt was tipped over by Lukasz Fabianski, while Bamford blazed over from Raphinha's cut-back and Dawson cleared off the line as Leeds chased a late lifeline.\nPablo Fornals struck the crossbar for the hosts with a dipping second-half shot, but the Hammers ultimately held firm at the back to see out the three points.\n\"I'm disappointed with the performance,\" England international Rice told Sky Sports. \"We won but Leeds caused us a problems. Now we are starting to learn how to win ugly.\n\"This is the best squad I have been a part of. You look forward to training and seeing the lads and that shows on the pitch. We are fighting for each other. It is real special place to be at the moment. The place has a real buzz about it.\n\"It is hard to say we are going to be [in the] Champions League - there are so many games left. It will be a real tough test, but look where we are now and it is a massive upgrade. It is in our hands. If we want to believe we can be a European team we need to win the big games\".\nReaction to Monday's Premier League action\nRice and Soucek at heart of West Ham efforts\nMoyes said on Sunday that he would not sell Rice for \u00a3100m, which was reported to be the club's valuation.\nThis match was the latest reminder of why Moyes is keen to ward off potential suitors as Rice, alongside the equally dependable Tomas Soucek, proved the antidote to Leeds' incessant pressing, particularly in a second half which the visitors dominated for large periods.\nIn 22-year-old Rice and \u00a319m summer signing Soucek, former Everton and Manchester United boss Moyes has a holding midfield combination he can trust, allowing West Ham's attacking players to flourish.\nSuch solid foundations enable Lingard to shine. This was his fourth goal in six league appearances since his January move - as many as he had managed in his previous 38 in the competition for United.\nDawson, on loan from Watford, continues to prove as shrewd a signing as any. This was his 11th successive league start at the heart of West Ham's defence and his fourth goal in all competitions this term.\nMoyes claimed the experienced centre-back was \"worthy\" of a permanent deal after a match in which Dawson was involved at both ends, having hit a post with another header before half-time and somehow prevented Rodrigo's shot creeping over the line in the closing stages.\nA European place in any form would mark significant progress for a West Ham side that finished only five points clear of the relegation zone last season. With 11 games to play, a Champions League place remains a real possibility.\n\"We were resilient. We didn't play well tonight but I don't think Leeds help you play well - you have got to earn it,\" Moyes told BBC Sport.\nOn West Ham's top-four hopes, he said: \"We've always had belief we can do something special. When you get near the top it gives you a big incentive.\n\"I was gutted when we dropped out of the top four last week. There are a lot of good teams around us and if we don't make it it's because they were better than us.\"\nWasteful Leeds fall short\nA first season back in the Premier League after a 16-year absence was first and foremost about safety for Leeds, and that objective appears almost guaranteed with a nine-point cushion separating Bielsa's side from the bottom three.\nThere is no denying that Bielsa's all-or-nothing approach has paid off, with Leeds in 11th and in contention for a top-half finish. They have drawn only two league games this season and none of their past 18.\nAided perhaps by a nine-day break since their 1-0 defeat by Aston Villa, Leeds played in typically relentless style, and on another occasion the result could have been different.\nWelcoming back midfield stalwart Kalvin Phillips from injury, they dominated possession and had 15 attempts at goal in the second half, but poor finishing consigned them to a fourth defeat in five league games.\nStriker Bamford, with five shots, was as guilty as any of profligacy and was visibly frustrated when he failed to even find the target from Raphinha's cut-back.\nThat Rodrigo's shot from close range failed to find its way over the line before Dawson could clear suggested it was simply not Leeds' night.\n\"The first 15 minutes in the first half was the best for us in the game,\" Bielsa told BBC Sport. \"In the second half the dominance was continuous. In that hour of play we had sufficient chances for a different result, but when they dominated for 30 minutes they scored twice.\"\nOn conceding from a set-piece, he added: \"Disappointed is not the word. I know it is a problem that exists. I am the one in charge of finding a solution.\"\nA first top-flight double since 1930 - the stats\nWest Ham completed their first league double over Leeds since 1953-54 and their first in the top flight since 1929-30.\nLeeds have lost 13 of their past 14 games in London in all competitions, losing all five in the capital in the league this season.\nWest Ham manager David Moyes registered three victories in a row at home in the Premier League for the first time since winning his last six at Everton in 2013.\nNo Premier League defender has scored more goals in all competitions this season than West Ham's Craig Dawson (four).\nWest Ham full-back Aaron Cresswell has seven assists this season (in 27 games), his joint-best return in a Premier League season (seven in 36 games in 2017-18).\nNo side has faced more penalties in the Premier League this season than Leeds (eight, level with Liverpool).\nWhat's next?\nLeeds host Chelsea on Saturday at 12:30 GMT, while West Ham travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Sunday at 19:15.\nDeLorean: Back from the Future: How a fairytale went horribly wrong\nSnowfall: A new drug hits the streets of LA and changes the game forever..."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 5-2 Southampton: City bounce back in style to beat Saints\nManchester City returned to winning ways in style with a thumping win over Southampton that moves them 14 points clear at the top of the Premier League table.\nRiyad Mahrez and Kevin de Bruyne both scored twice as City delivered an emphatic and instant response to their defeat in Sunday's Manchester derby, which had ended a 21-game winning run.\nThis was not the disciplined display typical of many of City's victories this season but their incisive attacking, aided by some helter-skelter Saints defending, meant they still ended up convincing winners.\nA strong Southampton start counted for nothing when Ryan Bertrand switched off and, from Oleksandr Zinchenko's cross, De Bruyne swept home from close range after Alex McCarthy had kept out Phil Foden's initial effort.\n'No one has given us anything' - Guardiola unhappy with VAR\nSaints, who had conceded nine goals at Old Trafford on their previous visit to Manchester at the start of February, quickly hit back through James Ward-Prowse's spot-kick after Aymeric Laporte fouled Jannik Vestergaard from a corner.\nAt that stage it appeared City would not have things all their own way, especially when they were denied what appeared a clear penalty when McCarthy challenged Foden after mis-controlling a back-pass.\nFoden seemed to pay the price for trying to stay on his feet as McCarthy lunged in - referee Jon Moss felt the Saints keeper got a touch on the ball, with VAR apparently not seeing anything to disprove that, although the City bench and players clearly felt otherwise.\nIn the end that decision did not affect the outcome, with Mahrez taking centre stage to put the home side in control before half-time.\nThe Algerian international restored City's lead with a fine finish after intercepting a wayward crossfield pass from Che Adams and although the post denied him a second goal moments later, Ilkay Gundogan was on hand to follow up.\nMahrez picked up where he left off after the break, meeting a Foden pass to turn inside a crowded area and fire home City's fourth.\nWard-Prowse briefly reduced the deficit after a defensive mistake but Southampton were guilty of far more lapses at the back and De Bruyne punished them when he burst clear from another Foden through-ball to complete the scoring.\nReaction from Etihad Stadium\nCity bounce back despite poor start\nWith nine league games to go, City know six more wins will make them mathematically sure of their third title in four seasons.\nThe way this latest success was achieved was a throwback to earlier in Guardiola's reign when they seemed happy to outscore the opposition, but the end result was the same - three points.\nThey had to work hard for them - a sluggish start had cost City dear in the derby and they were similarly slow out of the blocks here, only suffering far less damage.\nGuardiola's side sleepwalked through the first 10 minutes with the visitors enjoying 77% of possession in that opening period - but failing to land a meaningful blow.\nBetter teams would have punished City, but once De Bruyne scored on their first foray forward after 15 minutes, normal service was resumed.\nSaints struggling at the back\nSouthampton still have a cushion of seven points above the relegation zone but their defending must be a major concern for boss Ralph Hasenhuttl as he plots his side's survival.\nWest Brom are the only top-flight team to have conceded more goals than the 49 Saints have shipped this season and, if not for McCarthy and some sloppy finishing, City might have matched the tally their neighbours managed against them last month.\nOf the goals City did score, Saints should have done better with four of them, paying the price for either blatant errors - such as the one Adams made for City's second goal, or switching off when they had sufficient numbers back.\nAll of that undermined some enterprising attacking play. Southampton's high press was effective, especially early on, but when City got past that, they did not encounter enough resistance.\nWhat next? City head for Fulham\nCity head for Craven Cottage to face Fulham in the Premier League on Saturday (20:00 BST) and a win will send them 17 points clear - nearest rivals United and Leicester do not play until Sunday.\nSouthampton play south coast rivals Brighton on Sunday (12:00), looking for their first home league win since they beat Liverpool at St Mary's Stadium on 4 January.\nCity score five again - the stats\nManchester City have scored 5+ goals in 23 Premier League games since Pep Guardiola took charge in 2016-17, doing so in 12 games more than any other side in the competition during this period (Liverpool & Tottenham next on 11 each).\nSouthampton conceded 5+ goals in a Premier League game for the 18th time - only Newcastle (21) have done so on more occasions in the competition's history.\nManchester City have followed up each of their last nine Premier League defeats at the Etihad with a victory in their very next home game in the competition.\nManchester City's Kevin De Bruyne has been directly involved in more Premier League goals against Southampton than against any other side (11 - 4 goals, 7 assists).\nJames Ward-Prowse's equaliser for Southampton (1-1) was the sixth penalty goal Manchester City have conceded at the Etihad this season, becoming only the third side in the competition's history to concede six home penalty goals in a season, after Newcastle in 2004-05 and Brighton in 2018-19.\nManchester City's Riyad Mahrez (51) became the seventh player to score 50+ left footed goals in the Premier League (also Fowler, van Persie, Giggs, Salah, Lukaku and Giroud).\nSince Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl's first game in charge of Southampton in December 2018, only Newcastle (20) have seen their players make more combined errors leading to Premier League goals than the Saints (18).\nManchester City's Ilkay G\u00fcndogan scored his 10th league goal of 2021, one of four players in Europe's top five leagues to reach double figures this year, after Robert Lewandowski (14), Lionel Messi (12) and Andr\u00e9 Silva (10)."

We are going to need it, every single ounce of it.\"\nFootball Daily podcast: Lascelles' late leveller\nRelive the action at St James' Park\nHow you predicted the Premier League table will look at the end of the season\nNewcastle finally show fight\nA lack of goals has played a large part in Newcastle's slide down the table, with Bruce's side having won just two of their 16 games prior to the visit of Villa.\nA dull, goalless draw with relegation rivals West Brom last time out did little to provide hope that Newcastle had the fight to move back up the table, particularly with a much-improved Fulham side clawing back a 10-point deficit to give them hope of survival.\nAgainst Villa, they again lacked a spark in the final third and a last-minute equaliser will not erase concerns over how little they troubled the opposition goalkeeper for much of the game.\nBut there were elements of the performance that will provide some hope. Joelinton had his best game in a while, tormenting Tyrone Mings much of the time but just missing the belief in himself to put away the couple of good opportunities he created, while Paul Dummett provided some excellent deliveries into the box.\nMost pleasing of all for Newcastle fans, however, is that their side showed some fight in the final few minutes that many perhaps feared was absent from their players. Supporters will now hope they can show more of that spirit in the remaining games.\n\"We missed the final cross but we had so many good opportunities in the game,\" added Bruce.\n\"That little bit of quality at times is something we talk about but for the effort, the desire and the way they went about their job there was nothing between the two teams.\"\nVilla continue to struggle without Grealish\nThis time last season Aston Villa were very much in Newcastle's position as they found themselves fighting for Premier League survival.\nA superb first half of this campaign ensured they would not be in the same situation this time and instead they are looking up the table, with securing a place in Europe next term a very real possibility.\nBut their recent form risks seeing their season drift towards a mid-table finish as they continue to struggle in the absence of injured captain Jack Grealish.\nVilla have won just one of their five games since Grealish picked up a leg injury, but while the talismanic forward is undoubtedly a big loss, their inability to finish the chances they do create will be of frustration to boss Dean Smith.\nAgainst Newcastle they had 15 attempts on goal but only managed to score when Watkins' header took a sizeable deflection.\nIn their first 13 games of the season Villa scored 27 goals but they have managed just 12 in their last 14 and Smith needs to find a way to get his side firing again if they are to finish in the top six.\n\"When you're a goal up with four minutes to go you're disappointed naturally,\" said Smith.\n\"We didn't deserve to win the game.

        "article_text": "Leeds United 0-0 Chelsea: Thomas Tuchel's unbeaten run stretches to 12 games\nThomas Tuchel said Chelsea need to be \"more clinical\" after being held by Leeds in a high-tempo goalless encounter.\nThe Blues stretched their unbeaten run under the German manager to 12 games, but wasted several good chances including two for \u00a371m forward Kai Havertz, who started in attack.\nDespite lacking fans to add edge to the clubs' long-standing rivalry, both sides were unlucky not to score as they both hit the woodwork and tested their opposition keepers.\nLeeds almost went behind when Luke Ayling's clearance hit team-mate Diego Llorente and looped over keeper Illan Meslier to hit the bar before Edouard Mendy tipped Tyler Roberts' chip onto the same part of his goal.\nMendy also saved well from Raphinha's effort to deny Leeds, who avoided a third straight defeat.\n\"We have enough quality to use the chances better and to be more clinical,\" said Tuchel, who played a back four and picked Mason Mount, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic behind Havertz.\n\"It is our responsibility, my responsibility to create more and to maybe have more big chances.\"\nIn failing to beat Leeds, Chelsea missed out a chance to move above third-placed Leicester.\nBut Tuchel's run of 10 Premier League games unbeaten since the start of a new manager's reign is second only to Nottingham Forest's Frank Clark and Chelsea's Maurizio Sarri.\nLeeds, who have only won one of their last six games, were dealt a blow in the first half when they lost top scorer Patrick Bamford, on his 100th appearance for the club, to injury in front of the watching England boss Gareth Southgate.\nChelsea weather Leeds storm to earn point\nWithout fans, Tuchel might have expected a gentle introduction to the traditional Leeds-Chelsea rivalry, which stretches back to the 1970s.\nBut the German seemed unsettled by Leeds' director of football Victor Orta, who was a vocal presence throughout the game. The two had a heated debate over fair play even though Chelsea kicked the ball out once they realised Bamford was injured.\nDespite those distractions, the visiting side still created the best chances in a robust first half as the returning Mount, Pulisic and Ziyech combined well behind Havertz, who played in a false-nine role.\nThe German, who has had a tough start to life at Chelsea after contracting coronavirus, showed some confident touches and went close to opening the scoring in either half.\nHis chance after half-time was the most wasteful when he had time and space in the box, but his right-footed shot was tipped over.\nTuchel said of the 21-year-old: \"Unfortunately he could not finish like he finishes in training and like his talent allows him to finish, because we had enough chances.\n\"But in general, this is a position where he feels comfortable and I trust him in this position.\"\nMount, who pulled the strings on the left, also set up a chance for Pulisic, who fired at Meslier, and tested the Leeds keeper from range. Ben Chilwell and N'Golo Kante were also wasteful from the left.\nThe fact a first-half mix-up in the Leeds defence was the closest Chelsea came to scoring would have been disappointing for the visitors as victory would have strengthened their grip on a top four-place and put them a point behind second-placed Manchester United.\nBut with Mendy on form against a Leeds side who continually posed questions, it means Tuchel's side have only conceded two goals since he replaced Frank Lampard in January.\nLeeds impress but Bamford injury causes worries\nThis was another example of how Leeds can entertain and frustrate in equal measure.\nRoared on by Orta from the directors' box and from Bielsa in the technical area, they had the Chelsea players huffing and puffing from the start in what was only their third Premier League draw of the season.\nAlthough Llorente almost scored what would have been a comical own goal, they recovered quickly with Bamford and Roberts linking up well to engineer a chip that brought out the best in Chelsea keeper Mendy.\nHe was also inspired in saving Raphinha's close-range effort as he was moving the other way when he got a hand to it, and substitute Reece James did well to stop a late Llorente shot.\nHad that gone in, Leeds would have been well-placed to say they deserved victory.\nBut a point against an in-form Chelsea team will also be of comfort on a wet and windy day which did no favours for their quick passing game on a sticky pitch.\nThe biggest worry, however, would have been watching Bamford go off during the first half. The striker came off worse in a challenge with Antonio Rudiger and left the field clutching his hip after trying to struggle on.\nRodrigo replaced Bamford after 35 minutes and with the Spanish forward taken off after 79 minutes, but Bielsa said it was because he lacked match fitness.\nIn mid-table and 10 points above the drop zone, Leeds are in no danger of relegation but their hopes of reaching the top 10 will be hampered without main striker Bamford.\nTuchel matches Chelsea record\nThomas Tuchel is unbeaten in all 12 of his games in charge of Chelsea in all competitions, the joint-longest unbeaten start by a manager in the club's history (Felipe Scolari also 12).\nChelsea have drawn three of their 10 Premier League games under Tuchel 0-0, more than they did in 57 under previous manager Frank Lampard (2).\nLeeds' total possession figure of 38.1% is their lowest recorded in any of their 120 league games under Marcelo Bielsa.\nThis was Leeds' first draw in 19 Premier League games (W8 L10), since a goalless draw against Arsenal in November. All three of Leeds' league draws this season have been at Elland Road.\nChelsea have conceded just two goals in their 10 Premier League games under Thomas Tuchel - no manager has conceded fewer in their first 10 games in charge in the competition's history (level with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2004-05).\nOnly Ederson (15) has kept more Premier League sheets among goalkeepers than Chelsea's Edouard Mendy so far this season (14).\nWhat next?\nLeeds face a trip to Fulham on Friday 19 March in the Premier League (kick-off 20:00 GMT), while Chelsea are at home to Atletico Madrid in the second leg of their Champions League tie on 17 March (20:00), before hosting Sheffield United in the FA Cup on 21 March (13:30).\nRadio 1's Motivate Me Mix: Dermot Kennedy's favourite feel good tracks\nCompleting an epic challenge: 'My lowest point?

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-0 West Bromwich Albion: Eagles dent Baggies' survival hopes\nSam Allardyce said West Brom have a \"massive mountain to climb\" after defeat at Crystal Palace left the 66-year-old staring at the prospect of a first top-flight relegation of his managerial career.\nPalace captain Luka Milivojevic scored the game's only goal from the spot after Darnell Furlong was adjudged to have handled Wilfried Zaha's cross, leaving the second-bottom Baggies eight points clear of safety with nine matches left to play.\n\"There's 27 points available and 20 needed,\" Allardyce told Sky Sports. \"We can only really afford to drop seven points.\n\"I'm left frustrated because of the players' efforts not being rewarded, and that's a consistent analysis from me.\"\nThe Baggies rarely looked like salvaging a point at Selhurst Park, their only shot on target coming courtesy of Mbaye Diagne 18 minutes from time.\n\"That shows where our problems have been,\" Allardyce added. \"We had 12 shots and only one on target.\n\"At the end of the day you need a natural goalscorer. When you have one, he finds a way to be in the right areas and he doesn't need more than one opportunity to score.\n\"We're defending superbly well and our football leading up to the final third is excellent. We need more responsibility to not only score, but to hit them on target.\"\nRoy Hodgson's side went close to doubling their lead in the second half but West Brom goalkeeper Sam Johnstone did magnificently to tip Christian Benteke's powerful effort over the crossbar.\nThe Belgian striker was played through by Zaha not long afterwards but was denied by Kyle Bartley's last-ditch tackle.\nThe win lifts Palace above Leeds and Wolves into 11th place.\nReturning Zaha 'stands tall'\nAlthough well-positioned to retain their Premier League status, Palace have struggled to pose much of an attacking threat at Selhurst Park of late.\nIndeed, Hodgson's side had failed to score a home goal since Eberechi Eze's thumping finish in a 1-0 win over Wolves on 30 January.\nThe Eagles were boosted by the inclusion of their talisman Zaha, making his first start since 2 February after recovering from a hamstring injury.\nZaha became the first Premier League player not to take a knee before kick-off, having recently described the gesture - adopted amid the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in response to the killing of black American George Floyd - as \"degrading\" and \"something we just do\", while urging his fellow players to \"stand tall\".\nThe Ivory Coast international played a key role in the game's only goal, his in-swinging cross deflecting off Furlong's arm and prompting referee Simon Hooper to point to the penalty spot after consulting his pitch-side monitor.\nMilivojevic sent Baggies goalkeeper Johnstone the wrong way for his first goal since last June. Twenty-two of the midfielder's 28 Premier League goals for the club have come from the spot.\nBenteke could have added to Palace's slender advantage in the second half but Hodgson will be more than satisfied with a result that takes his team to 37 points with nine league games remaining.\nTime running out for Baggies\nThe Baggies, who have collected just three wins all season, could find themselves 10 points adrift of 17th place if other results go against them this weekend.\nThe visitors were tidy on the ball at Selhurst Park but lacked incision in the final third and failed to test Vicente Guaita until midway through the second half.\nDiagne lost his footing while attempting to steer Okay Yokuslu's lofted through-ball past the onrushing Palace goalkeeper, but the forward's appeals for a penalty were waved away by Hooper.\nMatheus Pereira and Matt Phillips had both wasted promising opportunities earlier in the half, while Hal Robson-Kanu only just prevented Conor Townsend's late effort from going out of play for a Palace throw-in.\nPortsmouth and West Ham went on to secure Premier League survival from similar positions in 2006 and 2007 respectively, but it is hard to see the Baggies scoring enough goals to haul themselves out of trouble.\nWest Brom draw yet another blank - the stats\nCrystal Palace are unbeaten in their past seven Premier League home games against sides starting the day in the bottom two (W5 D2), keeping six clean sheets and conceding just once.\nWest Brom have won just one of their past 20 Premier League games in London (D5 L14), a 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace in August 2016.\nCrystal Palace registered their first ever top-flight double over West Brom, with this the 13th season in which they've met the Baggies.\nWest Brom have failed to score in 15 league games this season - only in 2008-09 (17) and 2005-06 (18) have they drawn a blank in more games in a single Premier League campaign.\n11.5% of Crystal Palace's Premier League goals have been penalties (56/487), the highest ratio of any club with 200+ goals in the competition.\nMatt Phillips became the 32nd player to play a Premier League game on his birthday this season, and the fifth to do so for West Brom this term (also Romaine Sawyers, Callum Robinson, Conor Townsend and Dara O'Shea).\n'There's not a natural goalscorer' - what the managers said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We knew what a difficult game this was going to be. West Brom have improved enormously over the last few weeks.\n\"Thirty-seven points from 29 games is an awful lot more than the club is used to having so that's very satisfactory. If we show the commitment that we showed tonight then I am confident we will get ourselves over the line again and Palace will have another season in the Premier League.\n\"Wilfried Zaha has put out a statement which is very self-explanatory and the reason he feels the need to make this particular gesture. He personally feels that taking the knee has lost its strength because it has become part of our routine. We felt it was absolutely his right to do so.\"\nWest Brom manager Sam Allardyce, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We used to concede that many that it didn't matter what we did at the other end. We've solved half of the equation. Our shots were far greater than Palace's today but we only had one on target and that's why we're not winning football matches.\n\"You need a natural there who can turn a game on its head even if you're not playing great.\n\"Time has been running out game by game. It's a great shame that we are still on 18 points given the players' consistent performance. Down to our failings in front of goal we're finding it difficult to get those three points.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams return to action on 3 April, with Palace travelling to top-four hopefuls Everton (15:00 BST) and West Brom facing Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea away from home (15:00 BST).\nRadio 1's Motivate Me Mix: Dermot Kennedy's favourite feel good tracks\nCompleting an epic challenge: 'My lowest point?

        "article_text": "Everton 1-2 Burnley: Dwight McNeil hits stunning winner for visitors\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said Dwight McNeil is \"an exceptional talent\" after the England U21 winger's stunning strike helped Burnley boost their Premier League survival hopes at the expense of top four-hopefuls Everton at Goodison Park.\nMcNeil turned sharply to beat Allan before curling expertly into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-0, after Chris Wood's fine finish with Burnley's first shot gave the visitors a 13th-minute lead.\nThe visitors had a penalty claim dismissed after the ball struck Ben Godfrey's arm in an aerial challenge with Ben Mee prior to McNeil's goal, and they were almost out of sight before half-time but Johann Gudmundsson's low effort hit the post.\nAn entertaining first half took another twist as Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed in Tom Davies' cross to halve the deficit.\nThere was, however, a further setback for manager Carlo Ancelotti when England number one Jordan Pickford eventually had to be replaced after sustaining an injury in attempting to save Gudmundsson's earlier attempt.\nEverton emerged from half-time determined to quickly restore parity, but Calvert-Lewin mistimed his header from Lucas Digne's cross, while Burnley's Matej Vydra was unable to capitalise on a couple of good opportunities to seal the points.\nDyche's side remain 15th but they are now seven points clear of the bottom three, while defeat leaves Everton five points adrift of the Champions League positions.\n\"I was really pleased. The defensive shape was good against tricky opposition,\" said Dyche. \"Every time we pressed them properly and nicked the ball I thought we looked a threat.\n\"I thought virtually every time we went forward we could score.\"\nFollow live text coverage of Saturday's Premier League action\nJordan Pickford doubt for England World Cup qualifiers\nMcNeil delivers as Burnley near safety\nBurnley had failed to score in a league-high eight away games this season, and prior to kick-off at Goodison only bottom side Sheffield United had scored fewer goals than Sean Dyche's side.\nBut the Clarets made a sensational start against Everton, with McNeil's sublime finish the obvious highlight of an impressive first half for the visitors on Merseyside.\nMcNeil's instinctive change of direction caught Allan flat-footed, before the 21-year curled his left-foot shot spectacularly into the corner.\nIt was only his second goal of the season - matching his tally from 2019-20 - and such a display of quality in an all-round impressive performance raises questions as to why his output is not greater.\nIt was no less than Burnley deserved for an uncharacteristically front-foot approach against top-four chasing opposition, and it was helped in no small part by the industry of midfield pair Josh Brownhill and Ashley Westwood.\nBrownhill robbed Davies of possession to set his side away for Wood's opener and the former Bristol City player won the ball back for his side more times than any player from either side.\nDyche's side increasingly relied on the defensive solidity that has been the backbone of their current five-year stay in the top-flight in the second half, but the Clarets will believe they have more than enough to avoid a relegation scrap following this excellent result.\nEverton's home woes continue\nHad Everton's home form come close to matching their away returns this season, Carlo Ancelotti's side would have their Champions League aspirations firmly in their own hands.\nInstead, in the absence of their home support, only the bottom five sides have fared worse at home than the Toffees, who have suffered seven of their 10 league defeats at Goodison this campaign.\nThe two goals conceded on Saturday also saw Everton eclipse their total goals conceded at home in the past two seasons, with five home games and 10 in total still to play.\nWith fourth-placed Chelsea held by Leeds earlier on Saturday, the hosts began determined to capitalise, as Richarlison forced Nick Pope into action with a stinging shot after three minutes.\nThe in-form Brazilian, who had scored in four successive matches prior to Monday's 2-0 defeat by Chelsea, continued to prove the catalyst for Everton in the final third, though it was Davies' inviting ball that allowed Calvert-Lewin to net his 14th league goal of the season - eclipsing his best previous top-flight tally.\nBut in the absence of James Rodriguez and the benched Gylfi Sigurdsson, Everton struggled to create clear-cut chances and managed just one shot on target in their pursuit of a second-half equaliser.\n\"We had a bad start, we made mistakes and were punished,\" Everton boss Ancelotti told BBC Sport. \"After that it was difficult to get back in the game because we didn't show the quality that was necessary.\n\"It's a big disappointment but we don't have to give up. There are still 10 games in the Premier League and we have to fight until the end. It's difficult to explain [our home record], but of course it's not good enough. We've got a lot of points away and that's a reason we're still in the fight [for Europe], but we have to do better at home.\"\nBurnley's rare Merseyside double - the stats\nOnly Liverpool (six) have lost more home Premier League games since the turn of the year than Everton (five), indeed the Toffees have lost five of their last seven at Goodison Park - as many defeats as in their previous 23 home league matches.\nBurnley won away games against both Everton and Liverpool in a single league season for the first time.\nChris Wood's opener was his 40th Premier League goal for Burnley. He's the second player to reach that tally for the club in the competition, after Ashley Barnes.\nDwight McNeil has scored four Premier League goals from outside the box - the most of any Burnley player in the competition.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin's 14 Premier League goals this season are the most by an Englishman for the Toffees in a Premier League campaign since Tony Cottee in 1993-94 (16).\nCalvert-Lewin has scored more headed goals than any other player in the Premier League this season (six).\nWhat's next?\nEverton face Manchester City in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday at 17:30 GMT.\nBurnley return to action against Southampton following the international break, on Saturday, 3 April.\nRadio 1's Motivate Me Mix: Dermot Kennedy's favourite feel good tracks\nCompleting an epic challenge: 'My lowest point?

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-3 Manchester City: Sergio Aguero scores first league goal in over year\nSergio Aguero scored his first Premier League goal since January 2020 as Manchester City extended their lead at the top of the Premier League with a win at struggling Fulham.\nThe result sees Pep Guardiola's side move 17 points clear at the summit, with second-placed Manchester United having two games in hand.\nFor the Cottagers it represents a dent to their survival hopes after they missed the opportunity to move out of the bottom three, which is compounded by the fact they have played more games than both Brighton and Newcastle - the sides directly above them.\nIt had looked like being a tight affair, with Fulham testing a much-changed City side during a relatively even first period.\nHowever, John Stones tapped in Joao Cancelo's free-kick two minutes after the break before Gabriel Jesus benefited from some shoddy defending to round home goalkeeper Alphonse Areola for the second.\nAnd with the game under control, Aguero rounded off the scoring with a penalty after Tosin Adarabioyo had fouled Ferran Torres.\nRelive Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's full predictions v Bend it like Beckham actor Frank Harper\nCity roll on\nWhile Fulham manager Scott Parker chose to begin without a recognised centre-forward, there were also surprises in the City starting XI.\nGuardiola elected to field a three-man defence while Jesus and Aguero were deployed in tandem up front for the first time since February 2020.\nIf it was designed to give a City side missing the creativity of Raheem Sterling, Kevin de Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan some incisiveness in attack, it did not initially seem to have worked.\nA Torres snapshot and Bernardo Silva's low effort after a jinking run were the highlights of a first-half performance lacking cohesion.\nAguero, the fourth-highest scorer in Premier League history, also had an inauspicious start to the evening, touching the ball on fewer occasions than both goalkeepers in the first half.\nBut after the break it all changed, as much by good fortune as design.\nCancelo's curling free-kick saw Stones dart through a static Fulham defence to prod home, before Joachim Andersen's clearance ricocheted off Ivan Cavaleiro to send Jesus through for a simple second and Aguero had the final word.\n\"For him goals are everything, Gabriel [Jesus] too,\" Guardiola said of Aguero.\n\"Everybody wants to jump on the bus - he is more than welcome! It was so important his goal - he played 90 minutes for the first time in a long time.\"\nFulham architects of their own downfall\nPrior to the game Guardiola had spoken glowingly of opposite number Parker, and for the first 45 minutes it was easy to understand why.\nRejuvenated by recent results, including a superb win at champions Liverpool, the Cottagers appeared to have the measure of a side that had won their past six meetings by an aggregate score of 18-0.\nAssured in their defensive work, Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa, Harrison Reed, Kenny Tete and Ola Aina all showed up well at the other end of the pitch, although there was a noticeable void at the apex of their attack.\nBut in just 15 second-half minutes the game was gone, primarily from the sort of errors that Parker and his players have worked hard to eradicate.\nTosin's failure to react to Cancelo's free-kick and Andersen's error for the second goal were particularly out of character for players who have laid the defensive platform for Fulham's recent improvement.\nAnother concern for Parker is that his side have now lost five of their past seven Premier League games at Craven Cottage, an issue that needs to be resolved if they are to retain their top-flight status, starting with the visit of Leeds on Friday.\n'We are in a good place' - what they said\nFulham boss Scott Parker told BBC Match of the Day: \"Disappointing. There's no denying the mistakes we gave away for the goals were sloppy.\n\"You are playing against a team that in any moment of the game can hurt you. You have to be switched on. That's probably the deciding factor of the game.\n\"The season is not going to be defined by a team we have played tonight and the quality they have. Individually, I wanted to leave an imprint and individually we did that. We will dust ourselves down and move on.\n\"This is the part of the season when trophies are won and rewards are won. It's the nitty-gritty of it. It's the defining moment. We understand that. It's the home stretch for us. We are in a good place and we will continue.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We knew it [would be difficult]. You just look at Fulham's last results they don't concede goals. We do well. In 90 minutes generally we were so solid and, yeah, we won again.\n\"They defended really well man-to-man. In the right moment we did it and I'm very pleased for all the players and the commitment from the players in the locker room before the game. We travel to Budapest now and prepare for another final before we get ready for the quarter-final of the FA Cup.\n\"I will arrive well [with a fit squad] in Budapest through rotating. Sometimes the players don't believe me, I want everyone involved. Sometimes it is difficult but everyone has to make a contribution to win games and we will arrive at the end of the season fighting as best as possible.\"\nCity's spark against promoted clubs\nManchester City have won each of their last eight away league games, scoring 22 goals while conceding only three in this run.\nFulham have lost five of their last seven Premier League games at Craven Cottage (W1 D1), while they have also failed to score in seven of their last nine home league matches.\nManchester City have won their last seven meetings with Fulham in all competitions by an aggregate score of 21-0. This is now their joint-longest ever run of wins against a single opponent without conceding a goal (also 7 v Wigan between 2010-2013).\nManchester City have only lost one of their last 36 Premier League meetings with promoted clubs (W28 D7), a 2-3 defeat at Norwich in September 2019.\nThis was Fulham's 20th Premier League defeat under Scott Parker, meaning the Cottagers have now lost 51% of their games under him in the competition (P39 W8 D11 L20).\nHaving scored just one goal in his first 170 Premier League appearances, Man City defender John Stones has since netted four in his last 10 games in the competition.\nGabriel Jesus has been directly involved in 95 goals in his 114 starts in all competitions for Manchester City (73 goals, 22 assists), scoring eight and assisting one more in his last 10 starts.\nSergio Aguero has ended a run of 13 appearances, 641 minutes of play and 24 shots without scoring in the Premier League for Man City, with his penalty against Fulham his first league goal since January 2020 v Sheff Utd, 417 days ago.\nIn their 13 Premier League starts alongside one another for Manchester City, Sergio Aguero (15) and Gabriel Jesus (nine) have scored a combined 24 goals. The Citizens have won 11 and lost none of those 13 league matches when the pair have both been in the starting XI (D2).\nWhat's next?\nFulham welcome Leeds United to Craven Cottage for their next Premier League game on Friday, 19 March (20:00 GMT).\nManchester City play the home leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Borussia Monchengladbach at the Puskas Arena in Budapest on Tuesday, 16 March (20:00). City then travel to Everton on Saturday, 20 March (17:30) to play in the FA Cup quarter-finals.\nRadio 1's Motivate Me Mix: Dermot Kennedy's favourite feel good tracks\nCompleting an epic challenge: 'My lowest point?

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-2 Brighton & Hove Albion: Leandro Trossard strike settles south coast derby\nBrighton boss Graham Potter says Sunday's victory over Southampton has given the Seagulls \"renewed belief\" they can retain their Premier League status.\nLeandro Trossard's emphatic finish settled an entertaining south-coast contest, Danny Welbeck's deft touch freeing the Belgium winger to stride into the box and lash home.\nVictory halted a three-game losing streak for Potter's Seagulls, who climb a place to 16th above Newcastle, three points clear of 18th-placed Fulham and with a game in hand.\n\"We've had to suffer recently but we got the reward for the performance,\" said Potter, whose side have lost 17 points from winning positions this season.\n\"This three points gives us confidence and renewed belief. It's a fantastic reward for the players and will help them keep going.\n\"We have belief in ourselves and believe that if we keep performing like we have been we can get results. It's nice to have that reinforced.\"\nThe Seagulls had taken an early lead through skipper Lewis Dunk's powerful header from a corner before Che Adams' close-range volley ensured the Saints headed in level at the break.\nAdams came closest to a second equaliser for Southampton, still without injured leading scorer Danny Ings, but he was brilliantly denied by the outstretched leg of Brighton keeper Robert Sanchez.\nA 10th defeat in 12 league games keeps Southampton in 14th, very much in the relegation mix, although they still have a seven-point cushion over Fulham.\nReaction from Southampton v Brighton plus live text coverage of three Premier League games\nSeagulls finally take their chances\nThree successive defeats in a five-game winless run had dragged Brighton back into relegation trouble after back-to-back victories over Tottenham and Liverpool had seemed to move them clear.\nTwo of those defeats - by West Brom and Crystal Palace - came in games the Seagulls dominated, recording an aggregate shot count of 29-8 in a microcosm of a season in which they should surely be several places higher.\nThey were nowhere near as superior at St Mary's but, for once, made their better chances count, particularly Trossard's as he kept his cool to send Fraser Forster the wrong way one-on-one after Welbeck touched on Adam Lallana's clever pass.\nLallana was influential throughout against his former club, drawing particular praise from Potter, who said: \"I thought he was fantastic today.\n\"He takes the ball in tight areas, links the play up really well and uses his voice to organise the team. He's a really important player and person for us.\"\nSaints keeper Forster had produced fine saves to thwart Neal Maupay shortly before Dunk's opener and Pascal Gross, with his leg, at the end of the first half as Brighton carved out the game's better openings.\nThis was the first time in 11 Premier League games that Brighton had scored more than once and the fact centre-half Dunk, now on four goals for the season, is their second leading scorer behind Maupay, tells its own tale.\nThe Brighton skipper was more than 12 yards out when he met Gross' corner but superbly guided his header out of Forster's reach into the bottom corner as Southampton paid the price for not having a man on the post.\nAfter Trossard restored their lead, Brighton saw the game out comfortably, their only scare a late penalty appeal after Kyle Walker-Peters went to ground but, unlike December's reverse fixture when Saints won via a late spot-kick, the video assistant referee ruled there was no foul.\nAnother setback for sorry Saints\nSouthampton have not won at home since 4 January when they beat reigning champions Liverpool to much fanfare, although the Reds' subsequent struggles have arguably cast that victory in a different light.\nMuch has been made of their rotten recent run but they have had a tough sequence of fixtures against top-half sides, with both Manchester clubs, Leicester, Arsenal, Aston Villa and Everton among their conquerors.\nNonetheless, they have collected just four points from the past 36 available which is relegation form in anyone's book and Ralph Hasenhuttl will be concerned by how devoid of ideas they looked after falling behind for a second time against Brighton.\nTheir only real chance of a response came three minutes after Trossard's winner, Sanchez superbly denying Adams after referee Stuart Attwell had played advantage for a foul on the edge of the box.\nThe continual improvement of Adams was Saints' biggest chink of light - he scored for a third successive game and is beginning to look like he belongs at the top level after a slow start to his Saints career.\nHowever, their troubles continue at the other end - Saints have now conceded 32 goals in 2021, more than any other Premier League side and that is something Hasenhuttl must remedy if his side are to avoid being dragged further into danger.\n'One of our worst games' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"In the second half the opponent wanted it more and we have to be self-critical about it because it was by far one of the worst games we have played this season.\n\"It is time to work on a few basic fundamentals in the next weeks. The second goal gave them a lift. Afterwards, we did not have a solution, only one chance at the end.\n\"We see that our game is far away from what is has been this season. I can remember we were one of the best home teams at the beginning of the season. What has happened in the second half, we have to ask the question ourselves.\n\"We are not hungry enough and the basics are missing at the moment which makes it very difficult to win games.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"I thought it was a deserved victory. Second half we got a really good goal and when we had to defend we defended against a really good side that plays with huge intensity.\n\"I felt quite comfortable second half, even though when the scoreline is that close you are never comfortable, so there were still a few butterflies.\"We have to not worry about anyone else. We have to focus on ourselves and getting the points. We haven't got enough points as it is so we have to keep working.\"It's a fantastic result from a performance that deserved three points. We have said that a lot [about our performance in matches] when we haven't got the points.\"\nDunk is Brighton's head boy - the stats\nBrighton have beaten Southampton at St Mary's for the first time since November 2009 - Brighton's Adam Lallana started for Southampton that day.\nSouthampton have lost 10 of their past 12 games in the Premier League (W1 D1) - their previous 10 defeats in the competition were spread across 38 matches.\nBrighton scored twice in a Premier League game for the first time since a 3-3 draw with Wolves in their first game of 2021, with this their 11th match since.\nLewis Dunk has now scored 20 league goals for Brighton, with 15 of those headers.\nBrighton's Pascal Gross has become the fourth German to record 20 assists in the Premier League, after Mesut Ozil (54), Leroy Sane (28) and Dietmar Hamann (22).\nSouthampton's Che Adams has scored in three consecutive appearances for the first time in the Premier League - this is his longest league scoring streak since February 2019 (six for Birmingham).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton visit another of their south coast rivals, Championship side Bournemouth, in an FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday (12:15 GMT).\nBrighton host fellow strugglers Newcastle United in the Premier League, also on Saturday (20:00 GMT).\nThe Terror: Ridley Scott's tale of an isolated and murderous expedition\nLet's Talk About Race: Understanding what it means in the UK today"

We didn't give them many chances. When we had the ball we had to be patient, it took a little bit of time but once we got the breakthrough we were outstanding with the speed of our game.\n\"Kelechi Iheanacho is a great guy and when he has been asked to come in he has performed. Absolutely delighted for him to have got a hat-trick in the Premier League. It's a great achievement and all were very good team goals.\"\nSheffield United interim manager Paul Heckingbottom to BBC Sport: \"We know the circumstances behind it. It's been a tough week in losing Chris [Wilder]. He is a mate of mine. I've been in touch with him a few times. The players and the staff have lost their leader. It's taken its toll. It's an emotional dressing room.\n\"There were lots of habits in that performance which haven't been there before. The standards have been slipping. I'm here to help between now and the end of the season.\"\nA heaviest league defeat in 21 years - the stats\nSince Brendan Rodgers' first Premier League game in charge of Leicester, only Manchester City (57) and Liverpool (53) have won more matches in the competition than the Foxes (40).\nSheffield United suffered their worst league defeat since April 2000, when they lost 5-0 to Blackburn Rovers in the second tier.\nUnited only shipped five goals in a match once in 227 matches under Chris Wilder in all competitions and never lost by more than a three-goal margin.\nBlades manager Paul Heckingbottom is the third manager in Premier League history to lose by five or more goals in his first game in charge, after Alan Smith in 1994 and Roberto Di Matteo in 2010.\nIn 76 starts in all competitions for Manchester City and Leicester, Kelechi Iheanacho has been directly involved in 51 goals (37 goals, 14 assists).\nWith two assists, Jamie Vardy became the sixth player to register 100 goal involvements in the Premier League after turning 30 (81 goals, 20 assists), after Teddy Sheringham (127), Frank Lampard (118), Ian Wright (110), Alan Shearer (102) and Gianfranco Zola (101).\nAyoze Perez has scored three goals in his last 29 Premier League games for Leicester and all have come in matches against Sheffield United.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are in FA Cup quarter-final action next Sunday.\nSheffield United travel to face Chelsea at 13:30 GMT, before Leicester host Manchester United at 17:00.\nThe Terror: Ridley Scott's tale of an isolated and murderous expedition\nLet's Talk About Race: Understanding what it means in the UK today"

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Erik Lamela scores rabona but is later red-carded in derby\nArsenal came from behind to secure a fully deserved north London derby win and inflict damage on Tottenham's hopes of a place in the Premier League's top four.\nThe Gunners were vastly superior until a Spurs rally in the closing stages but fell behind to a piece of genius from Erik Lamela - on for the injured Son Heung-min - when he curved a magnificent 'rabona' finish beyond Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno in the 33rd minute.\nArsenal, who had seen Emile Smith Rowe's long-range shot smack against the bar, then suffered more ill-luck when Cedric Soares hit the post, but were level on the stroke of half-time when Martin Odegaard's effort was deflected out of the reach of Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris.\nMikel Arteta's side continued to dominate a largely dreadful Spurs and took the lead from the penalty spot after 64 minutes when Alexandre Lacazette missed his kick but was fouled by Davinson Sanchez.\nLacazette recovered to send Lloris the wrong way for his 12th goal of the season.\nSpurs' day got worse when Lamela was sent off for a second yellow card, shown by referee Michael Oliver for a hand-off into the face of Kieran Tierney with 14 minutes left.\nBut they almost snatched a point in the closing moments when Harry Kane's free-kick bounced off the post, with Arsenal defender Gabriel heading Sanchez's goal-bound shot off the line from the rebound.\nArsenal, who dropped captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for the game for disciplinary reasons, stay in 10th place but Spurs are now six points adrift of Chelsea in fourth, although with a game in hand.\nFollow reaction from Arsenal v Tottenham and live text coverage of Man Utd v West Ham\nArsenal drop Aubameyang for \"disciplinary reasons\"\nSpurs suffer Son injury worry\nArteta rewarded for brave selection call\nArteta showed discipline is paramount - and no one is above his law - by dropping skipper and main striker Aubameyang to the bench for what Arsenal described as \"a breach of pre-match protocol\".\nIt was a big game to have to make this choice but Arteta demonstrated who was boss and was rewarded not just with an important derby victory but also a fine performance, watched from the sidelines by the solemn figure of the chastened Aubameyang.\nArsenal, even without their captain and most prolific marksman, were by far the more dangerous side, taking control from the start and only showing signs of nerves when Spurs mounted a belated late surge which almost brought them a point they did not merit.\nSmith Rowe was outstanding for Arsenal while Odegaard got his first Premier League goal and Lacazette won and scored the decisive penalty.\nArsenal remain a team in transition but they played some fine football here and this will surely boost confidence and self-belief as they try to navigate a route into Europe next season, the three points tasting even sweeter as they were taken at the expense of their arch-rivals.\nAubameyang will no doubt return in due course, punishment served, but Arteta showed the courage of his convictions and this turned out to be a highly satisfactory day for Arsenal's manager.\nSpurs pay price for negative approach\nJose Mourinho has been subjected to criticism this season for a perceived negativity in big games - and this was another when he deserves to have his approach questioned.\nThis was a miserable day all round for Mourinho and Spurs as they lost Son early on to a hamstring injury, goalscorer Lamela was sent off and they wasted the opportunity to make up ground on the top four with a performance that was, for the most part, abject and negative.\nLamela's moment of genius, his rabona finish, a rare shaft of light for Spurs, ultimately counted for nothing as the visitors left it far too late to raise the tempo.\nIndeed, it was only after Lamela was sent off and they were at a numerical disadvantage that Spurs applied any serious pressure, although that almost brought a point as Kane hit the post and Sanchez's shot was cleared off the line by Gabriel.\nWhy Spurs waited until their backs were against the wall and their cause desperate to show any urgency is a mystery. They must see this as a missed opportunity.\nGareth Bale's long cross in the build-up to Lamela's goal was his only serious contribution before he was substituted in the second half and Spurs failed to get any meaningful service to Kane.\nSpurs have now lost six and drawn four of their past 10 Premier League games at Arsenal and have now been beaten in nine league games this season, the joint most Mourinho has lost in a campaign in his managerial career.\nThis was a day that did not contain much good news for either Mourinho or Spurs.\n'I draw the line' - what they said\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"We had a really strong performance right from the beginning, we created many chances and went a goal down with their first shot.\n\"But I love the reaction of the team, we stayed composed and in the end we won the game. Scoring before half-time was really important as it put us in a good position for the second half.\n\"We scored the second goal, we got a bit nervy in the final 10 minutes and that is one of the things we need to improve as a team.\"\nOn Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang: \"As I said before the game, I draw the line, it's done, we move on and enjoy this victory.\"\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"First half we were poor, 1-1 is not a reflection of what happened on the pitch. They were more intense, aggressive, moving the ball better than us.\n\"In the second half we recovered control of the game. In our good moments we made changes to try to win the game and when the game was there to be played, the referee made a wrong decision [awarding the Arsenal penalty], the VAR confirmed the wrong decision from the referee.\n\"And then at 2-1 it was time for the team to step up and show a good reaction to get an equaliser, but I cannot say much more than this.\"\nOn Lamela's goal: \"The goal was sensational no doubt. But the most important thing is the result and we lost the game.\n\"Trying to be honest and pragmatic: the first half was their half. The second half: Michael Oliver and Paul Tierney, the VAR. They decided the game.\"\nGunners continue home derby dominance - the stats\nArsenal are unbeaten in their past 10 Premier League home games against Spurs (W6 D4).\nSpurs have dropped 45 points from winning positions against Arsenal in the Premier League - the most of any team against a specific opponent in the competition.\nSince losing his first London derby at the Emirates in the Premier League (2-1 v Chelsea in December 2019), Mikel Arteta is unbeaten in his past five such games, picking up four victories (D1).\nAlexandre Lacazette is the first Arsenal player to score in three consecutive home league games against Spurs since Emmanuel Adebayor in October 2008.\nMartin Odegaard is the fourth player to score his first Premier League goal in a north London derby for Arsenal, after Nicklas Bendtner (2007), Per Mertesacker (2012) and Lucas Torreira (2018).\nErik Lamela became just the fifth substitute in Premier League history to score and be sent off in the same game, after David Lee (1993), Bobby Zamora (2007), Ivan Klasnic (2010) and Hal Robson-Kanu (2017).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal will bid to protect a 3-1 lead when they welcome Olympiakos to The Emirates for a Europa League last-16 second-leg tie on Thursday (17:55 GMT), while Tottenham will kick off in Dinamo Zagreb at the same time, taking a 2-0 advantage to Croatia.\nThe Gunners' next Premier League assignment is a trip to West Ham United on Sunday (15:00 GMT) with Tottenham travelling to Aston Villa later that same evening (19:30 GMT).\nThe Terror: Ridley Scott's tale of an isolated and murderous expedition\nLet's Talk About Race: Understanding what it means in the UK today"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-0 West Ham: Own goal separates sides\nManchester United needed a Craig Dawson own goal to overcome West Ham and strengthen their grip on a Champions League place.\nOn loan from Watford, Dawson has been outstanding in the Hammers' push for a top-four slot but settled the contest in the wrong way at the start of the second half as he turned Bruno Fernandes' corner into his own net under pressure from Scott McTominay at the near post.\nMarcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood also went close in a one-sided contest as West Ham failed to threaten until Said Benrahma's introduction after an hour.\nWhen the visitors finally pushed forward, Luke Shaw got in the way of Tomas Soucek's goalbound shot as United kept a fourth successive clean sheet for the first time under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nThe result kept United in second but with the teams from fourth to seventh all failing to win this weekend, they now have a nine-point advantage over West Ham, who remain fifth, but do have a match in hand.\nCavini and Martial set to return for Man Utd in Milan\nReaction to Manchester United's win over West Ham\nSolskjaer's men get the job done\nSolskjaer will have been relieved to get the victory after conceding injury-time equalisers against Everton and AC Milan at Old Trafford in recent weeks.\nIt was not the greatest performance and United's first-half frustrations were summed up when skipper Harry Maguire bellowed an instruction to his team-mates that they needed to \"liven up\" and \"stop giving the ball away\".\nWith David Moyes setting up his side with wing-backs and three holding midfielders, West Ham provided a puzzle United struggled to solve.\nAside from Rashford glancing a header wide and Greenwood having an effort tipped on to a post and out for a corner by Lukasz Fabianski, United's passing lacked both the accuracy and crispness to move the visitors out of their containment structure.\nIn addition, as Rashford kept pulling wide and Fernandes tended to drop deep, neither McTominay nor Fred made runs into the box that might have allowed them to threaten the visitors' goal.\nUnited were better after the break and Fabianski produced another excellent low save to deny Fernandes before Greenwood struck a post with a powerful shot at the end of a burst into the box.\nMoyes' wait for Old Trafford win continues\nThe result means Moyes remains without a win as an away manager at Old Trafford, a sequence that now extends to 11 defeats in 15 attempts in all competitions.\nIt is now 17 games since West Ham last beat Manchester United away from home, going right the way back to the famous Carlos Tevez winner that kept the Hammers up in 2007.\nThe win marks the first time United have done double over the Londoners since 2013-14, when Moyes took over from Sir Alex Ferguson.\nWest Ham never really looked capable of winning the game. The absence of Pablo Fornals through injury cost them an element of creativity they did not introduce until Benrahma came on, while Maguire and Victor Lindelof were assured on the rare occasions West Ham had a chance to create any aerial problems.\nShot-shy West Ham - the stats\nManchester United have only lost one of their past 23 Premier League games (W14 D8), after suffering three defeats in their opening six games of the season.\nWest Ham have lost 50% of their 12 Premier League games this season against sides starting the day above them in the league (W4, D2, L6), compared to just 7% of their other 15 matches (W10, D4, L1).\nManchester United have kept four straight clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, last doing so in January 2018 when Jose Mourinho was at the helm.\nOnly Leicester (4) have benefited from more own goals in the Premier League in 2020-21 than Manchester United (3, same as Liverpool), with Lewis Dunk and Jan Bednarek the other two players to do so against the Red Devils this season, alongside Craig Dawson.\nOnly Harry Redknapp (15) has managed more away Premier League games at Old Trafford without winning than West Ham boss David Moyes (D4, L10), with this defeat his 14th such trip in the top flight (11 with Everton, 1 with Sunderland, 2 with West Ham).\nWest Ham failed to manage a single shot on target despite seven attempts, the highest number of shots the Hammers have had in a Premier League game without any hitting the target since August 2013 vs Stoke City (9 shots).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United's next game is against AC Milan at the San Siro on Thursday, 18 March (20:00 GMT) in the second leg of their Europa League last-16 tie. Then they visit Leicester in the FA Cup sixth round on Sunday, 21 March (17:00).\nWest Ham's next game is a Premier League derby against Arsenal at London Stadium, also on 21 March (15:00).\nThe Terror: Ridley Scott's tale of an isolated and murderous expedition\nLet's Talk About Race: Understanding what it means in the UK today"

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-1 Liverpool: Diogo Jota scores winner before worrying Rui Patricio injury\nDiogo Jota rekindled Liverpool's Premier League top-four hopes with the winning goal on his return to Molineux in a game that ended with a worrying head injury to Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio.\nJota, who joined Liverpool from Wolves in September, drilled a low first-time shot under Patricio to settle a tight contest.\nIt was a fine way for the Portugal forward to mark his first appearance back at his former employers and it sees the Reds climb to sixth, two points behind West Ham in fifth and five off Chelsea in fourth.\nIn a game of few clear-cut chances, Mohamed Salah saw a late effort ruled out for offside.\nHowever, more distressing for the hosts was the sight of Patricio leaving the pitch on a stretcher after a lengthy delay following a collision with his captain Conor Coady, while trying to prevent the Egyptian from scoring.\nPatricio conscious and going to be OK after head injury, says Wolves boss Nuno\nFootball Daily podcast - MNC: Birthday presents, rabonas and absent Aubameyang\nPatricio injury echoes Jimenez\nThe evening started brightly for Wolves who were hoping to win back-to-back games at Molineux for the first time this season.\nAnd while they generally acquitted themselves well, all thoughts of their performance and the result faded late on with Patricio's injury.\nSat in the stands, Wolves forward Raul Jimenez provided a painful reminder of the dangers that footballers can face, with the Mexico international still to return from the fractured skull he sustained against Arsenal in November.\nThere was a 15-minute delay until John Ruddy was brought on as a concussion substitute to replace the Portugal goalkeeper.\nThe referee's assistant did not raise his flag for offside immediately, as is the guidance when the video assistant referee is in use, although it is unclear if an earlier decision would have averted the collision because of the speed at which it unfolded.\nWhile the scenes on the pitch had echoes of Jimenez's injury, thankfully Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo was able allay fears over the health of his goalkeeper in his post-match interviews.\n\"Rui Patricio is OK. He's conscious, he's aware,\" said Nuno. \"He remembers what happened. The assessment is positive, he is going to be OK.\n\"When it's something so serious, you always get worried. It can happen in football. The law is clear. The referees keep the flag down and play to the whistle. Situations will happen. This won't be the only time.\"\n'A dirty three points'\nThe champions arrived at Molineux after an alarming run of six defeats in their past seven Premier League games.\nBut this result shows they cannot be discounted from being involved in the final reckoning when it comes to the Champions League places.\nAs the first half developed so too did Liverpool's confidence.\nAnd there were plenty of flickers of quality from the Reds, who so resoundingly won the reverse fixture 4-0 at Anfield in December.\nMany of their best moments arrived courtesy of Sadio Mane's intelligent movement, with the Senegal forward having three good opportunities to score before teeing up Jota's opener.\nThat gave Jurgen Klopp's side a welcome half-time lead for the first time in nine top-flight matches.\nYet while it was an improvement there were also plenty of signs that more must follow.\nFabinho and Thiago Alcantara's partnership in midfield is a work in progress and despite all their neat interchanges there are still problems in attack which need to be resolved over the remaining weeks of the season.\nThat was underlined by Jota, Salah, Ozan Kabak and Mane all failing to add to their tally when presented with reasonable opportunities to make life more comfortable for the Reds.\n\"It's all about the result,\" Klopp told Sky Sports. \"A big fight. If we want three dirty points, I'm fine with that. We had very good moments where we should have done better. Defensively the whole game was really good.\"\n'We wanted the result' - what they said\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Sport: \"It was a very competitive game. We were able to control most of Liverpool's situations.\n\"There are positives and things we have to improve - better passing and finishing. We must be accurate in the final touch. We know the players can do much better.\"\nOn when Raul Jimenez may return: \"We don't have a date. We cannot rush things. He's training, not too involved - he must avoid contact. He will join Mexico [to train]. Hopefully we'll still have him this season but we have to be patient.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: \"It's unfortunate [on Patricio's injury]. In contact sport it happens time to time. I'm more relaxed because the first impression is it's not serious. We wish him all the best. It should not happen, but it can happen.\n\"We had good moments but the final touch, final pass was not exactly there. We wanted the result.\"\nPerennial substitute Milner - the stats\nWolves have lost their past nine Premier League games against Liverpool, their joint-longest losing run versus a side in their league history alongside nine consecutive defeats by Brighton from 1979-1989.\nLiverpool have only lost two of their past 100 Premier League games in which they've scored first (W84 D14).\nLiverpool have won four of their past five away Premier League games (L1), as many as they'd won in their previous 15 on the road in the competition (D6 L5).\nOnly Sheffield United (22) have conceded the first goal in more Premier League games this season than Wolves (19 - level with West Brom).\nOnly Raul Jimenez (18) has scored more Premier League goals at Molineux than Diogo Jota (11 - level with Steven Fletcher).\nLiverpool's Jota became just the second player to score both for and against Wolves in the Premier League after Stephen Hunt.\nLiverpool's James Milner made his 158th Premier League appearance as a substitute, the joint most in the competition's history alongside Peter Crouch.\nWhat's next?\nWith the international break looming Wolves are next in Premier League action on Monday, 5 April (20:15 BST) when they welcome West Ham to Molineux. Liverpool travel to Arsenal for their next top-flight fixture on Sunday, 4 April (16:30)."

If you told me at the start of the season I'd be linked with England, I'd say you were bonkers.\n\"If it comes, it comes. If not, I'll know I've done my best. It was in the back of my mind a little bit I guess. It gives you a bit of an extra fire in your belly.\"\nThe result takes Marcelo Bielsa's Leeds up to 11th in the table on 39 points.\nReaction to Leeds' win at Fulham\nBamford helps Leeds ease scoring problems\nBamford, 27, had only scored one Premier League goal before this season. Two years ago, while in the Championship with Leeds, he looked close to declaring for the Republic of Ireland.\nBut he has scored 14 top-flight goals this season now - Harry Kane is the only English striker to score more.\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate said Bamford was \"very close\" to his squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers.\nFormer England defender Matt Upson, watching the game for BBC Radio 5 Live, said he was unlucky not to be in the squad.\n\"He's shown he's at a good level. He's pushing and in real contention,\" said Upson.\nHe was ultimately the difference between the teams in a high-tempo encounter.\nLeeds had failed to score in four of their previous five games, as many as in their first 23 league games this season.\nBut, after two team-mates had goals ruled out for offside, Bamford gave them the lead as he showed good movement to lose a defender before hammering in Harrison's cross.\nFulham created plenty of chances after equalising but Bamford kept his cool to feed Raphinha for a cleverly finished winner.\nIn an eventful game, he was booked for a foul, went close to an own goal and avoided a penalty shout for a handball after a ricochet in the box.\nThere was a bit of a downside to Leeds' night as Bamford, who had been a doubt with a hip injury, hobbled off after 77 minutes.\nFulham miss big chance in relegation fight\nThe Cottagers appeared doomed early in the season but a recent revival gave them the opportunity to move out of the relegation zone for the first time since December.\nThey had several chances, most notably in the first half, and could only take one of them when Andersen smashed home.\nThe defeat keeps them two points below Newcastle and three off Brighton. Those two sides play on Saturday and will still have a game in hand on Fulham.\nThis third defeat in four games means the momentum of their previous five-game unbeaten run may have gone.\n\"The better team won,\" boss Scott Parker told BBC Sport after the game.\n\"We couldn't cope with their intensity at times. We didn't want it to become a basketball match because that falls into Leeds' hands. We have to move on.\"\nIvan Cavaleiro had a shot blocked in the opening 15 seconds to set the tone for a high-energy game.\nJosh Maja was denied by a sensational Illan Meslier save, with Ayling clearing the loose ball off the line.\nThe keeper then denied Cavaleiro from getting on to a poor header back and saved a Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa strike moments later.\nAleksandar Mitrovic replaced Maja at half-time and had to wait until the 89th minute for an effort on target, a header which Meslier saved.\nMatch stats - Leeds' struggles from corners continue\nLeeds have won away in London for the first time in 17 games in all competitions, with the previous occasion being a 3-1 win at QPR in December 2017.\nFulham have lost 10 league games at Craven Cottage this season, with only Sheffield United (11) losing more home games in the Premier League this season. The last season in which Fulham lost more home league games was 2013-14 (11).\nThis was Leeds' seventh away win in the Premier League this season, the most by a newly promoted side since 2005-06, when Wigan Athletic won eight and West Ham won seven.\nLeeds have completed a league double over Fulham for the first time since 1984-85 in the second tier, last doing so in the top flight in 1967-68.\nUnited have conceded 11 Premier League goals from corners this season, at least three more than any other side.\nJack Harrison became the fourth Leeds player to reach five league assists this season after Mateusz Klich, Raphinha and Bamford. Around Europe's top five leagues, only Bayern Munich (six) and Inter Milan (five) have more players with five or more assists.\nAdemola Lookman has been directly involved in Fulham's past five Premier League goals at Craven Cottage (two goals and three assists).\nWhat's next?\nIt is more than two weeks until either side play again in the Premier League because of the international break. Fulham visit Aston Villa (20:00 BST) and Leeds host Sheffield United (15:00) in a Yorkshire derby on Saturday, 3 April.\nWooden keys and prison breaks: Radio 1's Screen Time chats to Daniel Radcliffe\nThe Fight of the Century - Ali v Frazier: 'From a friendly rivalry to an almost pathological hatred'"

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 3-0 Newcastle United: Seagulls boost survival hopes\nNewcastle winger Ryan Fraser said \"we need to save our season\" after Steve Bruce's side were convincingly beaten by fellow Premier League strugglers Brighton at Amex Stadium.\nGoals from Leandro Trossard, Danny Welbeck and Neal Maupay ensured Brighton eased their own relegation concerns as they moved six points clear of the Premier League's bottom three and four above the Magpies.\nBruce's faltering side remain in serious trouble, with just two points separating them from 18th-placed Fulham - though they do have a game in hand on the Cottagers.\n\"The mood is the lowest it's been,\" Fraser said. \"We just weren't good enough. It was a must-win game after doing all right in the last couple of weeks. It didn't happen for us tonight.\n\"We need to save our season now. We want to try and work on how we're going to stay in the league. We're not in the bottom three yet and we've still got games remaining. If we go and win our next game it looks rosy again. We've still got to play Fulham too.\"\nReaction to Brighton v Newcastle\nTrossard's curled finish into the bottom corner in first-half stoppage time was the least Brighton's early dominance deserved, and Welbeck's sublime strike from outside the box doubled the advantage six minutes after the restart.\nMaupay then put the result beyond any doubt as he met Pascal Gross' cross for his first goal in 10 league games midway through the second half.\nThe visitors were second best throughout and rarely threatened a comeback - they had only one shot on target - though Fraser was inches away from an equaliser when he fired against the post shortly after the break.\nBruce takes 'full responsibility' as Newcastle teeter above trouble\nBruce reiterated prior to Saturday's game that he will \"never walk away\" from his role as Newcastle manager, though he admitted he had \"not been good enough\" over the past few months.\nWhile Fulham's defeat by Leeds on Friday at least ensured Newcastle were not in danger of spending the international break in the bottom three, they are perilously close to suffering a third Premier League relegation in 12 years after two wins in their past 18 league games.\nThat dismal run has seen their buffer to the relegation places reduced from 10 points in early February, and there were few positives for the under-fire Magpies boss to take here.\nWith nine games remaining, Newcastle rank bottom in the top flight for big chances created and passes in the opposition half, while only West Brom have recorded a lower average possession and fewer touches in the opposition box.\n\"I'll take full responsibility,\" Bruce told Sky Sports. \"We were nowhere near the levels we need to be. That's a concern.\n\"I've been in [the game] a long time. It's very difficult. We're still confident we can get out of the situation. I'll never give up the fight.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Newcastle, former Magpies defender John Anderson said: \"The manager is under severe pressure. If he sees the international break out he'll do well. Tonight it was hard to put into words how bad that was.\"\nThe return of forward Miguel Almiron after a two-match absence through injury was a welcome boost for Newcastle, but the Paraguayan was unable to have an impact as his side recorded just 25% possession in a largely passive first-half display, which ended with the loss of midfielder Isaac Hayden to a serious looking knee injury and Trossard's fine strike.\nAnd though Fraser's strike against the woodwork suggested Newcastle may offer the necessary response after half-time, Welbeck's moment of quality ultimately ended any faint hopes of a point.\nNewcastle have two weeks to dust themselves down, as they look to prevent their final-day meeting with Fulham becoming a desperate winner-takes-all encounter.\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Leon Osman said: \"It seemed tonight that they're going through the motions and not too sure how to get out of the situation that they're in. Something has to change. I'm sure they're working as hard as they can, but if they want to stay in the Premier League they need to start getting results.\"\nBrighton's quality shines through\nBrighton manager Potter said victory over Southampton last weekend had given his side \"renewed belief\" of retaining their Premier League status.\nThe manner of this comprehensive win against a club directly below them in the table should convince his side that they are more than capable of securing a fifth consecutive season in the top flight.\nBattling for survival has become familiar territory for the Seagulls, whose largest final margin to the bottom three since their 2017 promotion is seven points, and there was little sign of pressure in their play as they took command of a crucial game.\nAn inability to capitalise in front of goal and convert impressive performances into points has kept Brighton from mid-table security - a trait evident in the opening exchanges when 21-year-old Poland midfielder Jakub Moder failed to convert two early chances in his first Premier League start.\nHowever, two expert finishes from Trossard and Welbeck either side of the interval left the visitors dejected, before Maupay added the gloss from close range to secure a second 3-0 win over Newcastle this season.\nHaving impressed against Saints with arguably his best performance since joining on a free transfer last summer, Adam Lallana also shone in a central midfield role with incisive passing through the Newcastle lines.\nBrighton's fate is now firmly in their own hands, but tough games against Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea await after the international break.\n\"Scoring goals is the name of the game,\" Potter told BBC Sport. \"Our performances in between the boxes have been really good, we've just been a bit short in the boxes. The second and third goals were really important for us.\"\nThe Seagulls boss added: \"We just have to recover, analyse the game and see where we can improve. Our performances here have been quite good but we haven't got the results. The margins in the league are so small that you have to keep looking at how you're going to get over the line.\"\nBrighton's unbeaten record - the stats\nBrighton have beaten Newcastle home and away in a league season for the first time since 1978-79.\nThe Seagulls have played more Premier League games against Newcastle (eight) without losing than against anyone else in the competition.\nNewcastle have scored just one goal in their eight Premier League meetings with Brighton. Only Sheffield United have faced a side more often and netted as few as one goal in the competition (one in 10 games against Manchester City).\nBrighton have won two of their past five Premier League home games, which is as many as in their previous 23.\nNewcastle have won just one of their past 10 Premier League away games and have failed to score in seven of those matches.\nBrighton scored two goals from outside the box in a Premier League game for the first time, last doing so in league competition in April 2017 against QPR in the Championship.\nWhat's next?\nFollowing the international break, Newcastle host Tottenham on Sunday, 4 April at 14:05 BST.\nBrighton are away to Manchester United later that day (19:30).\nYour Film Night: A talented young drummer is pushed to his limits in this psychological drama\nMOTDx: Football, music and culture from the Premier League with Jermaine Jenas"

We had the belief we could do something.\"\nA defeat would have opened up a 10-point gap between the two sides and arguably ended Arsenal's hopes of qualifying for a European competition through a top-six finish.\nAnd while questions will be asked about their poor first-half performance, Arteta will take heart from his side's superb reaction against a disciplined West Ham.\n'Still a good point'\nWhen they led 3-0, David Moyes' West Ham looked certain to finish the day level on points with Chelsea.\n\"It's still a good point,\" Moyes told BBC Sport. \"It would have been nice to take another two points but we haven't lost too much ground today.\"\nManchester United loanee Lingard opened the scoring with a stunning volley and just 98 seconds later set up Bowen with a quick free-kick, as the winger's strike went through Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno.\nSoucek seemed to have given West Ham total control but even as Arsenal's comeback picked up steam, the hosts created regular openings.\nAntonio diverted Said Benrahma's cross on to the base of the post and Arsenal defender Kieran Tierney blocked a goal-bound effort from Bowen with the score at 3-2.\n\"We were playing a really good team,\" added Moyes. \"Sometimes people forget what we're up against. We had chances to move out of sight but we weren't able to take them.\"\nWest Ham have not finished above Arsenal in the league since 1985-86, but remain seven points ahead of the Gunners.\nA European place in any form would be a significant achievement for a club that finished only five points clear of the relegation zone last season. Despite the disappointment of dropping two points on Sunday, a top-four finish remains a possibility with nine games to go.\nAnother own goal double benefits Arsenal - the stats\nWest Ham failed to win after being three goals ahead in a Premier League game for the first time since September 1998 (4-3 defeat against Wimbledon).\nThis was the third time in the Premier League this season a team has led by three goals and failed to win (also West Brom 3-3 Chelsea and Spurs 3-3 West Ham) - the most instances in a single Premier League campaign since 2010-11 (also three).\nWest Ham have only won one of their past 11 games against Arsenal in the league (D3 L7), failing to win any of their four meetings in the past two campaigns (D1 L3).\nThis match against Arsenal (32 minutes) was the earliest from the start of a Premier League match that West Ham have scored three goals since May 2007 against Bolton (29 minutes).\nJesse Lingard scored his fifth goal against Arsenal in all competitions - the most he has netted against any opponent in his professional career.\nWest Ham are the first team to score two own goals in a single Premier League game since Swansea in January 2017, which was also against Arsenal.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to Wolves on Monday, 5 April (20:15 BST) after the international break in the Premier League, while Arsenal host Liverpool on Sunday, 4 April (16:30 BST).\nYour Film Night: A talented young drummer is pushed to his limits in this psychological drama\nMOTDx: Football, music and culture from the Premier League with Jermaine Jenas"

I think that is our next challenge - to have this standard in terms of effort, commitment, sacrifice.\n\"Independent of results, this has to be always there to dignify our jobs, the people that love us, the club and the fans. I am a bit sad by realising we can have this soul and we haven't in the last couple of matches.\n\"I opened my heart as a guy with more than 20 years in football and lots of experiences, I just care that they did it and the next challenge as a group is we do it every match.\"\nAn interchange of slick passes between Lucas Moura and Kane following a poor clearance by Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez allowed Vinicius to put Spurs ahead from close range after 30 minutes.\nAnd Kane avoided a potentially nervous finish to the game for his side, sending Martinez the wrong way with his penalty after being fouled by Matty Cash.\nVilla, who are 10th and seven points behind Spurs in the Europa League positions, failed to register a shot until the 58th minute in the continued absence of skipper Jack Grealish - and substitute Anwar el Ghazi's powerful drive into the side-netting was as close as they came.\nReaction to Aston Villa v Tottenham\nSpurs respond to keep top four hopes alive\nFollowing an abject display in the north London derby last weekend, Tottenham's season sunk to a fresh low in their humiliating Europa League exit, which led to Mourinho once again questioning the attitude and commitment of his players.\nThe Portuguese, reportedly fighting to keep his job\n, external\n, responded accordingly by naming seven changes which he hoped would bring \"positivity\" and \"fresh minds\" at Villa Park, while Gareth Bale once again started on the bench despite the absence of injured forward Son Heung-min.\nClaiming the club's first trophy in 13 years in the League Cup final against Manchester City next month, or securing a top-four league finish, appear the only possible routes by which Mourinho can claim to have brought success this season - and achieving the latter required an immediate response on Sunday.\nHaving played all 120 minutes on Thursday, Kane was deployed slightly behind Vinicius and was successful in finding space between the Villa lines as Spurs probed for an opening during a cagey start.\nThe England captain played a key role in Vinicius' opener, threading the ball neatly through to Moura before the Brazilian teed up his compatriot for his ninth goal in as many starts for Spurs in all competitions.\nMoura injected energy and directness into his side's attacking play, but a defensively-uncertain Spurs struggled to find a much-needed second goal until Cash's reckless tackle gifted Kane the opportunity to seal the points.\nThat offered a confidence boost to Mourinho's side, who ended the game on the front foot and will return after the two-week international break with much still to play for despite an otherwise painful week.\nVilla begin to fade in race for Europe\nA top-half position heading into April marks significant progress for an Aston Villa side which survived by a single point last season, but following a magnificent start to this campaign their season is threatening to peter out.\nOnce again sorely missing the creativity and intuition of Grealish in the final third, Villa lacked the necessary penetration to seriously trouble a vulnerable Tottenham back-line despite a much-improved second half display.\nSmith's side have won only one of their past six games in Grealish's absence with a leg injury, and the manager's pre-match promise that the midfielder will \"definitely\" return after the international break on 3 April will offer encouragement his side can improve in their final 10 games.\nUltimately it was two errors which cost the hosts, as Villa never recovered once Moura pounced on Martinez' poor clearance, while Cash needlessly felled Kane at the byline.\nWith their hopes of securing an unlikely European place beginning to look faint after a run of four wins in 15 matches since Boxing Day, Grealish's return simply cannot come soon enough.\n\"If you make mistakes like we did for their goals and don't create or show much quality in the final third, you are going to lose games,\" Villa boss Smith told BBC Sport.\n\"They got numbers behind the ball but we got into the box a number of times and either hit the first man or didn't show the quality needed. That's what's probably lacking with us at the moment.\"\nKane's 30th goal involvement of the season - the stats\nTottenham have won six consecutive Premier League away games against Aston Villa.\nSpurs have won four of their past five league games - as many as in their 15 games beforehand.\nAston Villa's four-game winless run is their longest of the season. They have scored just one goal during those games.\nVilla failed to have a single shot in the opening 45 minutes against Spurs. It's the first time they have failed to do so in a home league game since April 2014.\nDean Smith's side have won only 17% of Premier League games in which Jack Grealish has not featured this season, compared to a 50% win rate with him in the team.\nTottenham's Harry Kane is the first player to be directly involved in as many as 30 goals in the Premier League this season.\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa return to action after the international break with a home meeting with Fulham on Saturday, 3 April at 20:00 GMT.\nTottenham are away to struggling Newcastle a day later (14:05)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-5 West Brom: Baggies thump five past 10-man Blues\nMatheus Pereira and Callum Robinson scored twice as struggling West Brom overwhelmed 10-man Chelsea and emphatically ended the 14-match unbeaten start to Thomas Tuchel's tenure at Stamford Bridge.\nThe Baggies were as brilliant as the Blues, who had Thiago Silva sent off in the 29th minute, were abject.\nThe result moves the 19th-placed side to within seven points of 17th-placed Newcastle, and even if they do not manage the improbable and escape relegation, they will look back on this day with great pride.\nTuchel said he \"did not see the second half coming\". His side took the lead through Christian Pulisic in the 27th minute, but then lost Thiago and conceded twice in first-half stoppage time before West Brom inflicted further damage after the break.\n\"There is no need to concede five goals when you have our quality,\" he told BBC Sport. \"We are all in on that - myself included.\n\"We could not adapt to the situation, which is a surprise as we were leading. We are normally confident enough to defend, but we were sloppy and kept making big mistakes. It's tough to digest.\n\"I did not see that second half coming. We tried to give a bit of security with a back three, but we were never in a flow. We had some chances but we didn't defend well.\"\nWest Brom report racist abuse of Robinson to police\nTwo minutes after Pulisic was quickest to react when Marcos Alonso's free-kick came off the post, Thiago was shown a second yellow for a rash challenge on Okay Yokuslu.\nThat was followed by a horror show in first-half stoppage time as Pereira took centre stage. The Brazilian's first effort was a cute finish over Edouard Mendy before he finished off a gorgeous move with a low strike between three defenders. In between those goals, Matt Phillips produced a strike that came off the woodwork.\nWest Brom then went for the jugular after the break as substitute Robinson made it 3-1 with a sensational side-foot volley before Mbaye Diagne finished off a sweet move with an even sweeter strike.\nEngland midfielder Mason Mount, brought on at half-time, tapped in to reduce the deficit but the Baggies resisted other Chelsea threats before Robinson capped off a great day for the visitors with a clipped finish.\n\"I am delighted - not only with the win, but the style,\" Allardyce said.\n\"It has been coming for a while, but our lack of finishing has cost us. What we saw today is what we have been missing. The quality of our goals and our football brought us a fantastic result. We were desperate for it.\n\"We started really well, we pressed and didn't sit back. I had three weeks to think about this game and sort the tactics. We said, 'Let's go, let's go challenge them' and it worked extremely well.\"\nReaction to the match at Stamford Bridge\nSluggish Chelsea severely punished\nWas this Thomas Tuchel's first major tactical misjudgement?\nHis reasons for leaving some first-team regulars from the first XI, including Mount and Kai Havertz, was because he wanted the freshest legs on the pitch because of the extra exertions of his benched players during the international break.\nThose who started might have been sharper physically, but they were mentally sluggish at times with Thiago paying the biggest price.\nIt was a risk to start the 36-year-old Brazilian, who had just returned from two months out with an injury. He took 'one for the team' when he pulled back Pereira on the edge of the area, but his second booking was inexcusable for a player of his stature.\nDane Andreas Christensen, who had deputised for Thiago, came on as midfielder Hakim Ziyech made way.\nStriker Timo Werner came into the match short of confidence and having missed a 'sitter' for Germany against North Macedonia. He probably wished he reacted as quickly as Pulisic did for the Blues goal, although he did set up Mount's goal.\nBy that stage, both he and his team-mates were probably wishing they were still on international duty.\nA side who had conceded only two goals in Tuchel's previous 14 games were outwitted and embarrassed by one who had struggled to score this season.\nChelsea have four days to recover before they face Porto in the Champions League quarter-finals.\nWest Brom attack dazzle at Stamford Bridge\nThis was the perfect storm for West Brom - a day when their players were on song in contrast to their counterparts.\nPereira has been one of the shining lights for the Baggies during this difficult season, and even though he only signed a permanent deal last summer it might prove difficult to hang on to him if they go down.\nThe timing of his run for the first goal from goalkeeper Sam Johnstone's punt downfield was perfection, as was his clinical finish for the second.\nRobinson, who only came on in the 37th minute for the injured Branislav Ivanovic, immediately adapted to the momentum of his team. His finish for West Brom's third was the pick of the bunch.\nAllardyce has never experienced relegation from the Premier League during his long managerial career - if he maintains that record this season then it will arguably be his greatest feat.\nHat-trick for Allardyce - stats\nChelsea have conceded eight goals in their two games against West Brom in the Premier League this season, the most they have shipped against one side in a single campaign in the competition.\nChelsea conceded five-plus goals in a home Premier League game for only the second time, last doing so against Arsenal in October 2011 (3-5).\nAllardyce is the first manager to win away at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League with three different clubs (Bolton Wanderers, Crystal Palace, West Brom).\nChelsea conceded at home under Tuchel for the first time in all competitions, in the Blues' eighth game at Stamford Bridge with the German coach in charge.\nPulisic's opener for Chelsea was his first for the Blues in his last 21 appearances in all competitions, since netting against Leeds in December in the Premier League.\nThiago's red card on 29 minutes was Chelsea's earliest in the Premier League since August 2017 when Gary Cahill was sent off against Burnley after just 14 minutes.\nJohnstone is the first goalkeeper to provide a Premier League assist for West Brom and just the second to do so this season, after Ederson for Manchester City v Tottenham in February.\nPereira's two goals for West Brom came just two minutes and 46 seconds apart, with these the Brazilian's first goals in nine league games.\nRobinson is the first player in Premier League history to score at least twice in home and away games against Chelsea within a single season.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea are at Porto on Wednesday in their Champions League quarter-final first leg (20:00 BST) before they travel to Crystal Palace next Saturday (17:30).

        "article_text": "Leeds United 2-1 Sheffield United: Leeds move into top half of Premier League\nLeeds United scored early in each half to beat Yorkshire rivals Sheffield United and move into the top half of the Premier League.\nLeeds were firmly on top at a sunny Elland Road and took an early lead as Raphinha squared for Jack Harrison to tap in his seventh goal of the season.\nThe hosts were made to rue their missed chances in first-half stoppage time as Ben Osborn forced the ball over the line after Oli McBurnie's shot deflected into his path.\nBut Leeds were back in front inside four minutes of the second half, Phil Jagielka turning Harrison's low cross into his own net with Raphinha lurking.\nSubstitutes Rhian Brewster and Oliver Burke went close to a late equaliser for the relegation-threatened visitors, who are now 14 points from safety with eight games left.\nBut Leeds were worthy winners on a day they remembered fans Chris Loftus and Kevin Speight, who were killed in Turkey before their Uefa Cup game against Galatasaray in April 2000, and the club's record goalscorer and former captain Peter Lorimer who died last month.\nLeeds' only change to the side which won at Fulham before the international break saw current captain Liam Cooper return in defence, but Raphinha and fellow midfielders Tyler Roberts and Stuart Dallas shone as Leeds edged above Aston Villa into 10th place.\nLeeds boost bid for top-half finish\nSheffield United's interim manager Paul Heckingbottom returned to Elland Road for the first time since having four eventful months in charge of Leeds at the end of the 2017-18 season, and he found a club revitalised under his successor.\nThe appointment of Marcelo Bielsa in June 2018 was a statement of intent and marked an end to the managerial revolving door at Leeds as they fought to earn a return to the Premier League.\nThe Argentine transformed the team's playing style and led them back to the promised land at the second time of asking. Now they're targeting their first top-10 finish in the Premier League since 2001-02 and continue to play the free-flowing, high-pressing football Bielsa demands.\nHis team swarmed around the visitors from the outset, earning a free-kick inside 10 seconds which Raphinha curled over. Kalvin Phillips caught John Lundstram napping to test Aaron Ramsdale, who also parried a Dallas shot from outside the box.\nDallas then won back possession from Enda Stevens deep inside the Sheffield United half, Roberts found Raphinha and the Brazilian winger ghosted past George Baldock before gifting Harrison an open goal.\nAnother flowing move resulted in Luke Ayling having a shot blocked and Harrison fired wide from Roberts' slide-rule pass, before Roberts fired wide himself.\nAnd although their Yorkshire rivals drew level on the stroke of half-time, Leeds regained the lead shortly after the break. Roberts hit a superb cross-field ball to Harrison on the left and the on-loan Manchester City winger's ball behind Jagielka forced an own goal from the veteran defender.\nMoments later, Dallas curled towards the top corner, only to see his shot clip the angle of crossbar and post. The Northern Ireland midfielder also dragged a shot wide as Leeds spurned several chances to snuff out Sheffield United's hopes of a late leveller.\nBlades almost snatch vital point\nWith Sheffield United well adrift at the bottom of the table, Heckingbottom was not expected to keep them up when he was handed the reins after Chris Wilder's departure last month.\nBut the Blades were given some encouragement before kick-off as second-bottom West Brom earned an unexpected survival boost with victory in the lunchtime kick-off at Chelsea.\nIt would be some feat of escapology if Sheffield United can survive, and they almost snatched a point from a game that Leeds seemed in control of.\nThey equalised with their only shot on target as captain David McGoldrick swept John Fleck's pass on to strike partner McBurnie. His shot across goal was deflected towards Osborn and although his effort was blocked by Ayling, the Leeds defender was well behind the goalline.\nThere was some confusion in the first half as Baldock had treatment after suffering a blow to the head yet played on for 11 minutes before being replaced by Ethan Ampadu. However, the visitors immediately substituted Jayden Bogle when he suffered a head injury in the second half.\nBogle had gone close as Leeds failed to kill the game off, having a shot blocked after being found by Fleck. And Brewster's powerful volley from outside the box swerved wide before Burke's low shot on the break was turned past the post by Leeds keeper Illan Meslier.\n'It left a sensation that we were hanging on' - what they said\nLeeds head coach Marcelo Bielsa: \"We think we managed to dominate large parts of the game. We had chances to score more goals and there were a lot of dangerous actions that didn't finish in shots that would have increased the number of chances we had.\n\"But as we didn't establish more than a one-goal difference and as we didn't convert any more of these chances, the final part of the game left a sensation that we were hanging on.\"\nSheffield United interim boss Paul Heckingbottom: \"When the players give everything, when they leave everything on the pitch, you can't be too critical, and I've said that from the moment I started working with them.\n\"But the story of the game was we gave Leeds their best chances through giving the ball away and our lack of quality in key moments. That meant we couldn't capitalise when we were in good areas and gave Leeds too many chances on the break to open us up.\n\"It's been a tough season, but we have to look forward. We can't dwell on it, and that's the focus with me and my staff. Everyone's got a responsibility to finish the season with their heads held high and try to give as much as possible for this club.\"\nAnother own goal for veteran Jagielka - the stats\nLeeds have completed the league double over Sheffield United for the first time since 1991-92, when they won the top-flight title.\nLeeds registered at least 20 shots in a Premier League game for the fifth time this season (23 in total), with only Manchester City doing so more often this term (6).\nRaphinha's assist for Jack Harrison's opener was his sixth in the Premier League this season - no Leeds player has more in the competition this term.\nSheffield United suffered their 24th league defeat of the season in just 30 games - in their league history they've only ever lost more in 1975-76 (26/42) and 2010-11 (26/46).\nSheffield United's goal was just their seventh away in the Premier League all season, with this their first in five away league games (since 2-1 win at Manchester United in January).\nOnly Richard Dunne (10) has scored more Premier League own goals than Phil Jagielka (7). Jagielka is the second-oldest outfield player (38y 229d) to score an own goal in the competition, after Stuart Pearce against Manchester United in January 2001 (38y 252d).\nWhat's next?\nLeeds visit Premier League leaders Manchester City next Saturday (12:30 BST) before Sheffield United host Arsenal next Sunday (19:00)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-2 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola's leaders close in on title\nPep Guardiola says he will \"never forget this season\" as runaway leaders Manchester City closed in on the Premier League title with victory at third-placed Leicester.\nSecond-half goals by Benjamin Mendy and Gabriel Jesus left City requiring 11 points from seven matches to seal a third league crown in four seasons.\n\"I love the Premier League more than any other competition. We are close, very close,\" added Guardiola after his team moved 17 points clear at the top.\n\"The champions are Liverpool, they have the crown - but we are close to taking it.\"\nGuardiola said City's efforts were \"incredible\" given most matches this season have been played without spectators because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"In lockdown without spectators - every game we were there,\" he added. \"I will never forget this season.\"\nIn their first match since announcing club-record scorer Sergio Aguero is to leave at the end of the season, Guardiola's free-scoring side were frustrated before Benjamin Mendy broke the deadlock.\nFernandinho had a goal disallowed, Kevin de Bruyne's free-kick hit the bar and Riyad Mahrez was denied against his former club by Kasper Schmeichel's save.\nHowever, France defender Mendy produced a lovely curling finish after stepping inside a challenge from Marc Albrighton before Gabriel Jesus sealed the points for the visitors from close range.\nLeicester thought they had taken the lead on the stroke of half-time through Jamie Vardy but his celebrations were cut short by an offside flag.\nReaction as Man City close in on title plus Premier League latest\nLeicester defender Soyuncu tests positive for Covid-19\nHow Man City are battling history to land the quadruple\nPerfect start to a huge month\nThis was the perfect start to a huge month for Guardiola and his players as they attempt to close in on a historic quadruple.\nHaving started April with a controlled, disciplined and impressive win against a team that had taken 16 points off the supposed big six this season, they could end it with the Carabao Cup, and a place in both the FA Cup final and the semi-finals of the Champions League.\nIt is no longer a question of if they win the Premier League for the third time in four seasons, but when.\nRaheem Sterling, Ilkay Gundogan, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva started on the bench at the King Power Stadium yet the visitors never looked back once Mendy took advantage of a weak challenge by Albrighton to curl his side ahead.\nThe second goal was a joy to watch.\nFollowing De Bruyne's defence-splitting pass, Sterling and Jesus played a one-two before the latter poked the ball over the line for his side's 105th goal in 47 matches in all competitions this season.\nGuardiola's side have kept more clean sheets (28) and conceded fewer goals (26) in all competitions than any other side in Europe's top five leagues in 2020-21.\nThey now turn their attention back to the Champions League, a competition they have yet to win, and the visit of Borussia Dortmund to the Etihad on Tuesday.\nOn this evidence, it has hard to see City losing again this season.\nTop four hopes still in Leicester's hands\nLeicester were unable to recycle the counterattacking masterplan that earned Brendan Rodgers' side a thrilling 5-2 win at the Etihad last September.\nThey managed just two attempts on target against the best team in the country but ultimately came up short in their first match after the international break.\nChelsea's surprise home defeat by struggling West Brom earlier on Saturday means Leicester's hopes of playing in the Champions League for the second time in six seasons remain very much in their own hands.\nThey have responded well to setbacks in the past.\nAfter going out of the Europa League in February, the Foxes took seven points from four games and beat Manchester United to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1982.\nLeicester continue to flourish under Rodgers but will want to learn the lessons from this defeat and quickly move on, with West Brom, Crystal Palace and Newcastle among the clubs still to visit the King Power before the end of the season.\n'We got disorganised' - what they said\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers: \"For the first hour, we were solid and defensively strong but not as efficient with the ball. We're disappointed with the goals, we got disorganised.\n\"We lost to the better team. The players kept going and we had some good chances but we can have no complaints.\n\"They are a fantastic team, you see the likes of Raheem [Sterling] coming into the game and he's a world-class player.\n\"There's no shame, we won a great game up at their place, we lost today. We'll look at it and we'll have a good week next week.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"We had the goal disallowed, we hit the crossbar, it was quite a similar game to Everton.\n\"We had to be patient, don't concede and don't give them chances. We are not going to win in five or 10 minutes, it was important to have patience.\"\nHappy travellers - the stats\nManchester City have won each of their past 15 away games in all competitions and are unbeaten in 18 on the road (W16 D2), last losing an away fixture in November 2020 against Tottenham (2-0 in the Premier League).\nLeicester failed to muster a single shot in the first half for the first time in a Premier League game since December 2019 against Liverpool.\nJamie Vardy made his 300th league appearance for Leicester since his debut in August 2012, with the striker scoring 135 goals in those games, 93 more than any other Foxes player in that time.\nBenjamin Mendy netted just his second Premier League goal for Manchester City, with those two coming in his past six appearances in the competition, after failing to find the back of the net in his first 39.\nGabriel Jesus has scored in five of his six Premier League appearances against Leicester (5 goals) - only scoring more against Everton (7) in the top flight.\nRaheem Sterling registered his 50th Premier League assist.\nWhat's next?\nWhile Leicester have a full week to prepare for next Sunday's match at fellow top-four hopefuls West Ham (14:05 BST), Manchester City now turn their thoughts to Europe and a Champions League quarter-final first-leg home tie with Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday (20:00).\nDragons' Den returns: A new series of eager entrepreneurs hoping to strike the deal of a lifetime\nYour film night sorted: Epic films for you to choose from this Easter weekend"

        "article_text": "Arsenal 0-3 Liverpool: Diogo Jota scores twice in Premier League win\nLiverpool thrust themselves firmly back into the battle for a place in the Premier League's top four as they outclassed abject Arsenal at Emirates Stadium.\nChelsea's shock thrashing at home to West Brom earlier in the day opened the door for Liverpool - and Jurgen Klopp's men burst straight through it in style with a victory that leaves them in fifth, only two points behind Thomas Tuchel's side.\nThe only surprise was that it took dominant Liverpool so long to make their superiority count.\nThey finally got the breakthrough they deserved after 64 minutes when Diogo Jota headed Trent Alexander-Arnold's brilliant delivery past Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno moments after he replaced Andy Robertson.\nIt was not only the decisive moment of the contest but also a timely reminder of the quality Alexander-Arnold possesses at a time when England manager Gareth Southgate feels he can do without him.\n'A top-four dogfight is not a success - but things look brighter for Liverpool'\n'Unacceptable' Arsenal anger Arteta\nLiverpool doubled their lead four minutes later when Mohamed Salah took advantage of poor defending by Arsenal's Gabriel then slid a cool finish through Leno's legs.\nJota was the beneficiary of more good work from Alexander-Arnold when he slammed home his second from close range with eight minutes left - by then, though, the game had become a formality.\nKlopp said Liverpool \"have to show we are really fighting for it\" when asked about getting back in the running for a Champions League place.\n\"It was a very important statement. In our position it is clear, everything that has happened to us this season means we don't have it in our hands,\" he added.\n\"We have to win our games and others have to lose but we have to [put] pressure on them. That is what we did with the result but we are still not in. We have to fight and we will fight and that is the statement for us and nobody else.\"\n'Alexander-Arnold showed his class'\nEngland manager Southgate's exclusion of Alexander-Arnold for the opening World Cup qualifiers shocked Klopp - and the defender's performance in north London showed why.\nSouthgate currently prefers Chelsea's 21-year-old Reece James, who he seems to regard as the more complete defensive and attacking package, Manchester City's Kyle Walker and Atletico Madrid's Kieran Trippier, believing Alexander-Arnold needs to improve his club form to merit inclusion amid a relatively indifferent season for the Premier League champions as a team.\nKlopp is clearly satisfied with Alexander-Arnold, though, and that is hardly surprising after the right-back showed what a threat he offers as Liverpool overpowered Arsenal.\nHe showcased his sublime delivery for Jota's opener then demonstrated his energy and awareness to steal back possession high up the pitch in the build-up to the prolific Portugal forward's second goal.\nKlopp said afterwards he did not want to \"make another discussion\" but added that \"Alexander-Arnold had showed his class again\".\n\"If somebody says Trent is not [in good shape] then I have to say they are wrong, that is all. I am not responsible for [Southgate's] decisions,\" Klopp added.\nIt was a display that responded to Southgate's decision to drop him in the perfect manner and suggested England must have serious quality at right-back if Alexander-Arnold is in serious danger of missing Euro 2020.\nLiverpool and Klopp had a hugely satisfying night all round. Brazil's Fabinho gave a masterclass in the midfield anchor role, demonstrating what the side missed when he was deputising in central defence to cover for injuries to Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip.\nKlopp's side may be in a miserable run of six successive home defeats but their away form is sustaining them and this comfortable three points, on the back of the previous victory at Wolves, gives them real hope of Champions League qualification.\nWith a Champions League quarter-final first leg away to Real Madrid on Tuesday, Liverpool suddenly look like a team with renewed purpose and momentum.\nLacklustre Arsenal get what they deserve\nThe only positive about this Arsenal performance was the fact they kept Liverpool out for 64 minutes - although that was more down to the Premier League champions' lack of cutting edge up than especially good work by the Gunners.\nThe hosts were dreadful and fortunate not to be beaten far more heavily. This was miserable stuff from Arsenal.\nThe only work Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson, complete with extravagant new moustache, had to do all night was clutch a straightforward shot from substitute Cedric Soares in the second half.\nYes, Arsenal lost influential left-back Kieran Tierney right on half-time, but that was no excuse for what Mikel Arteta's side served up. They offered no punch in attack, no fight in midfield and were eventually overwhelmed in defence.\nArsenal saved themselves by coming from three goals down to earn a point in their last league game at West Ham but there was never the slightest hope of a comeback against Liverpool.\nThey sit in ninth place, four points adrift of Everton having played two games more, and much now rests on their Europa League quarter-final against Slavia Prague.\nThey will have to produce much better than they did here, their night summed up by the anonymous performance of main striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who spent much of his game as an auxiliary left-back before being substituted.\n'I take the blame, it's my responsibility' - what they said\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta: \"They were better in every department. I take the blame, it's my responsibility. They were the best team by far. They won by three goals and it could have been more.\n\"They won every duel, every second ball, every challenge. To be fair, I'm in shock. I didn't expect that one coming. It's my job to make things better. Today we hit a really low level. It was not acceptable.\n\"For sure we cannot hit that level again. When you represent this club you have to stand up and take the challenge.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"As a package it was a good performance. We finished our situations off. Arsenal were not really in the game for the whole 95 minutes. That was down to us.\n\"We had to keep going and keep the momentum. I wasn't frustrated at half-time. We had to work hard and when you do that you have a good chance of winning.\n\"When people talk about you in the wrong way, you want to react. It was a sensational cross by Trent for the [first] goal.\"\nReds continue fine form on the road - the stats\nEach of Liverpool's last six Premier League victories have come away from home. In their league history, this is only the second time they've had such a run, with each of their six wins between February and August 1955 all coming on the road.\nMohamed Salah has been directly involved in nine goals in nine Premier League appearances against Arsenal, scoring seven and assisting two more.\nLiverpool registered their biggest margin of victory in an away top-flight match against Arsenal.\nPremier League matches between Arsenal and Liverpool have now produced 169 goals, more than any other fixture in the competition's history.\nArsenal have only picked up one victory from their last 12 Premier League matches against Liverpool (D4 L7).\nThis was Mikel Arteta's 50th Premier League game in charge of Arsenal (W21 D12 L17), with the Spaniard losing four more games in that period than his predecessor Unai Emery.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool play the away leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid on Tuesday (20:00 BST) before hosting Aston Villa in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00).\nArsenal's Europa League home leg against Slavia Prague takes place on Thursday (20:00), after which they visit Sheffield United in the Premier League on Sunday (19:00).\nDragons' Den returns: A new series of eager entrepreneurs hoping to strike the deal of a lifetime\nYour film night sorted: Epic films for you to choose from this Easter weekend"

        "article_text": "Southampton 3-2 Burnley: Danny Ings scores as Saints fight back to win\nSouthampton fought back from 2-0 down to beat Burnley and claim a crucial three points in the battle for Premier League survival.\nThe two sides came into the game level on 33 points and Burnley charged in front in a thrilling first half at a sunny St Mary's Stadium.\nChris Wood fired in an early penalty, awarded after the video assistant referee advised Andre Marriner to check the pitchside monitor, before knocking down Ben Mee's long ball for Matej Vydra to volley in a fine second goal.\nBut Southampton, who welcomed back Danny Ings and Theo Walcott from injury, hit straight back with midfielder Stuart Armstrong sweeping in the ball after a neat flick by Ings.\nThe ex-Burnley striker coolly slotted in his 10th goal of the season to equalise just before half-time, scoring in his fourth successive game against his former club.\nAnd although Burnley's Nick Pope pulled off some fine saves after the break, Saints broke the England goalkeeper's resistance as Nathan Redmond volleyed them in front.\nThe hosts then needed some goalkeeping heroics from former England keeper Fraser Forster, who twice denied Wood late on, before clinching just their second win in 13 Premier League games.\nThat lifted Ralph Hasenhuttl's men up to 13th in the table, 10 points clear of the relegation zone with eight games left.\nIngs again shows his worth for Saints\nSouthampton were briefly top of the table in November but an alarming run of form this year forced Hasenhuttl to admit before Sunday's game that both teams needed a win to give them breathing space above the bottom three.\nHe watched West Brom boost their survival hopes with a stunning win at Chelsea on Saturday, while his side had earned just seven points in 2021 before facing Burnley. But Saints showed the spirit needed to avoid being dragged into a relegation scrap.\nThe hosts had threatened before going 2-0 down, Redmond forcing Pope to turn a shot wide, but Vydra's volley seemed to stun them into action.\nDespite returning from international duty because of a minor calf issue, James Ward-Prowse was able to keep up his record of playing every single minute in the Premier League this season and the England midfielder fed Ings to set up Armstrong's goal from the edge of the box.\nAnd after more Southampton pressure, Kyle Walker-Peters' ball down the line was allowed to run through to Ings and the England striker made Mee pay, racing clear of the Burnley centre-half before cutting inside James Tarkowski and slotting the ball between Pope's legs.\nWard-Prowse thought he had put Saints in front in the second half when his 20-yard strike crashed down off the crossbar but replays showed it bounced off the goalline, and Armstrong's deflected strike forced a fine reaction save from Pope.\nPope then denied Ings but Walcott, the on-loan Everton forward, latched on to the rebound and lifted the ball back for Redmond to volley home his third goal in two games, having scored twice in the FA Cup win at Bournemouth.\nHasenhuttl is confident the club can agree an extension with Ings, who enters the final year of his contract this summer. The 28-year-old has been a key man in his three seasons with Saints, but he needs help from his supporting cast - as he got today - if they are to challenge for silverware and a top-half finish.\nThey have the chance to do both in the coming weeks as they face Leicester in the FA Cup semi-finals and are back within six points of the top 10.\nClarets left looking over their shoulders\nALK Capital completed its takeover of Burnley three months ago and a run of five points from three games before the international break - against Leicester, Arsenal and Everton - suggested the club can look forward to a sixth successive season in the Premier League.\nManager Sean Dyche called for the Clarets to keep that consistency going and, after winning 2-1 at Everton last time out, Southampton picked up from where they left off.\nWood tested Forster before Erik Pieters outmuscled Walker-Peters in the home box and the Saints' right-back made a desperate lunge as Pieters crossed, chopping down the former Netherlands international with his trailing leg.\nAlthough Marriner waved play on, he gave the penalty after viewing the pitchside monitor and Wood thumped the spot-kick right down the middle for his seventh goal of the season, joining Ashley Barnes on a club-record 41 Premier League goals for Burnley.\nWood nodded down for Vydra to volley in just his fifth Premier League goal in three seasons with the Clarets, before the hosts stormed back to take the lead shortly after the hour mark.\nBurnley regrouped and Wood had a curling effort turned wide by Forster, who then made a point-blank save to keep out Wood's diving header, but they could not salvage a point.\nDyche has had \"healthy and open\" talks about the club's future with new chairman Alan Pace, who has already backed Dyche to take the Clarets forward.\nBeing edged out by a resurgent Southampton should not change his opinion, especially when Dyche's side have the chance to make amends against relegation rivals Newcastle next week.\n'Good for TV, not so good for managers' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"When you see five goals in one game it's always good for television - not so good for the hearts of the managers.\n\"They don't normally give you a lot of chances but our game in the final third was fantastic. We created a lot of chances. It's exactly what we have been working on. We could have scored even more goals.\n\"I'm very happy we could turn it around against a team that was equal with us. When you are 2-0 up it is a safe place but we put pressure on them.\n\"We spoke about two games to the FA Cup semi-final and we want to give ourselves some confidence. These three points are important.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"We had a lot of control in the first half an hour and did the simple things well. Then we flat-lined for 15 minutes. You cannot do that in the Premier League.\n\"Without being disrespectful to Southampton, we presented them with a chance to win the game and were a little bit naive.\n\"The second half was a ding-dong. We've gone from having game after game to having three weeks off. It's tricky and we didn't react like we normally do.\n\"That said, we do know how to see games off. It was a strange game because there were a lot of good things about it.\"\nSaints finally enjoy home comforts - the stats\nSouthampton picked up their first Premier League home win since their first game in 2021 (1-0 v Liverpool), ending a run of five league games at St. Mary's without a victory (drawn one, lost four).\nSouthampton won a Premier League game in which they trailed by two goals for the first time since March 2016, when they won 3-2 against Liverpool under Ronald Koeman - a game in which Sadio Mane netted a double for the Saints.\nBurnley lost after leading 2-0 in a Premier League game for the first time since January 2015, when they were also beaten 3-2 by Crystal Palace.\nThis was only the second Premier League game this season where both teams scored twice in the first half, following the 4-3 win for Liverpool against Leeds on the opening day.\nChris Wood's penalty was the 100th taken in the Premier League this season, and the 83rd to be converted - this is only the seventh Premier League campaign to see a century of penalties awarded.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host Newcastle next Sunday (12:00 BST) before Southampton visit second-bottom West Brom the following day (18:00).\nBeing: How are different faiths celebrated in modern Britain?\nEaster around the globe: Test your knowledge of how different countries celebrate the holiday"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Late Joe Willock goal earns Newcastle point\nNewcastle earned a vital point in their fight for Premier League survival thanks to a late equaliser against Tottenham from on-loan Arsenal midfielder Joe Willock at St James' Park.\nThe 21-year-old reacted quickest, after Miguel Almiron's effort was cleared off the line, to fire into the roof of the net and deny Spurs a place in the top four for the first time since 2 January.\nIn an entertaining game Newcastle took the lead when Joelinton slotted home a lovely threaded pass from Sean Longstaff after Spurs were guilty of overplaying at the back.\nJose Mourinho's side responded within 90 seconds as the hosts, and in particular Emil Krafth, failed to clear in the area, and an alert Kane prodded home for his 18th goal of the campaign.\nThe visitors were leading four minutes later when Kane, fed by a brilliant reverse pass from Tanguy Ndombele, clinically fired across Martin Dubravka from the right-hand corner of the penalty area.\nThe 27-year-old almost got a third, moments before Willock's goal, but his effort cannoned into the base of the post and behind.\nNewcastle - who have now only won two of their past 19 Premier League games - remain 17th, but have a three-point advantage over Fulham who occupy the final relegation spot after the Cottagers lost 3-1 at Aston Villa.\nTottenham, who conceded a 97th-minute equaliser against Newcastle earlier in the season, move up to fifth - above Liverpool and West Ham - but remain two points behind Chelsea who are in the final Champions League spot.\nMourinho the 'same coach' and blames players for dropped points\nReaction to Newcastle v Tottenham, and follow the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nJoelinton stands up for Bruce\nIn their final game before the international break Newcastle were well below par in a 3-0 defeat at Brighton, and Bruce would have have spent much of the two weeks wondering about his future, with 95% of fans in a local newspaper poll\n, external\ncalling for him to be sacked.\nHowever, the former Birmingham and Hull boss will be happy with the desire and application shown by his side.\nThey made five changes from that defeat - with Matt Ritchie, Jacob Murphy and Longstaff all making their first starts since January - and started positively with Joelinton having an effort saved from distance, before Hugo Lloris made a brilliant double save to deny Dwight Gayle.\nThey pressed high throughout the first period, and got their rewards when sloppy Tottenham passing and a weak Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg tackle saw the ball break free for Longstaff who stayed calm to find Joelinton, who passed into the bottom corner for just his second league goal of the season.\nNewcastle were suspect defensively throughout, and Bruce will be fuming with the soft nature of the first goal, where Krafth should have just cleared for a corner rather than trying to play in his own six-yard box.\nThey had chances to equalise earlier with Joelinton firing wide with a volley, but the striker, who now has four league goals since his \u00a340m transfer in July 2019, did well to nod down for the equaliser with Willock adjusting his feet well to fire into the roof of the net.\nThe point could prove crucial with West Ham, Liverpool, Arsenal, Leicester and Manchester City still to play in their final eight games.\nKane proves his worth\nSpeculation about Kane's long-term future at Tottenham was rife during the international break, with reports suggesting he is becoming disillusioned at the fact he is yet to win a trophy at Spurs, and those rumours only intensified when he was mentioned as a possible replacement for the departing Sergio Aguero at Manchester City.\nKane, however, has done his talking on the pitch. He scored in both appearances for England, and was once again in deadly form as he moved level with former Spurs striker Jermain Defoe in eighth place on the all-time Premier League goalscoring charts with 162.\nHe was in the right place at the right time for the first goal, as he capitalised on a woeful piece of Newcastle defending to equal his goalscoring exploits last season.\nIf his first was slightly fortunate, then his second was absolutely clinical. He timed his run to perfection and drilled superbly across Dubravka to bring up his 45-goal involvement this season in all competitions - with 29 goals and 16 assists - matching his best tally in 2017-18.\nPre-game, Spurs boss Mourinho said Chelsea's defeat on Saturday \"didn't change our perspective\" but he will know that this was a missed opportunity in what could be a defining month in his reign in north London.\nTepid exits from the FA Cup and Europa League have again led to speculation about his long-term future, and Mourinho - whose side have now lost 15 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season - will know upcoming games against Manchester United, Everton and the Carabao Cup final against Manchester City on 25 April are likely to influence whether he is in charge next campaign.\n'We always gave Newcastle a chance' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce told BBC Sport: \"I was delighted with the performance. I think we needed that. We needed to show what we're about. We had an awful five minutes where we gave an awful goal then they produced a good bit of quality to open us up.\n\"The way the players responded and played throughout... I thought we were the better team and had an edge and energy about us.\n\"I was determined I would pick a team who hadn't been away half way around the world and would be fresh. They deserved to win the game and it was the performance I was delighted with.\"\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I am frustrated. We needed to win the match and we came to win. We were not far from winning it but, at the same time, we created some instability on the game with so many individual defensive mistakes that we made. We always gave Newcastle a chance to be in the game.\n\"Of course, we had the biggest chance of the game to make it 3-1 and kill it, then we concede a goal the next minute.\n\"Looking at the second goal, it's easy to understand because there's three different moments - the cross, the ball at the far post where they won it, and then the ball in the face of the goal where our two centre-backs were in position. You can analyse it easily.\"\nGenerous Spurs - the stats\nTottenham Hotspur have dropped four points from winning positions against Newcastle this season, their most in a season against a single side since also dropping four versus Arsenal and West Brom in 2015-16.\nNewcastle have drawn three consecutive Premier League games at St James' Park for the first time since another three-game run in December 2017-January 2018.\nTottenham have failed to win six Premier League games this season in which they led at half-time, the most of any side.\nThey have also have dropped 11 points because of goals conceded in the final 10 minutes of games this season, the most of any Premier League side.\nNewcastle had 17 shots from inside the box, their most in a Premier League game since recording 23 such efforts against Huddersfield Town in February 2019 under Rafael Benitez.\nSpurs boss Jose Mourinho has faced Newcastle's Steve Bruce as a manager 13 times in all competitions and has never lost against him (W9 D4). In his career, he has faced no other manager more times without defeat (P13 W10 D3 L0 against Sam Allardyce).\nNewcastle's Joelinton has scored four goals in 62 Premier League appearances, with two of those goals coming in four matches against Spurs - two in 58 versus every other side.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Burnley in the Premier League on Sunday, 11 April (12:00 BST), before Tottenham host Mourinho's former side Manchester United at 16:30 on the same day."

After the first goal, we dropped our intensity and it affected us too much and we weren't streetwise enough.\"\nFulham were good value for their lead before capitulating.\nMings, captaining Villa in Jack Grealish's absence, messed up attempting a back pass to Emiliano Martinez, allowing Mitrovic to sneak in, go round the goalkeeper and score.\nHowever, Mings atoned for his error to provide the cross for Trezeguet to equalise with a first-time shot before the Egypt midfielder scored the second three minutes later from an assist by fellow substitute Keinan Davis.\nEngland forward Ollie Watkins added the third from inside the six-yard area.\nOn the stroke of half-time, with the game at 0-0, Villa thought they had won a penalty when Watkins went down under Mario Lemina's challenge.\nHowever, referee Andy Madley overruled himself after viewing a replay on the pitchside monitor.\nReaction from Villa Park plus Sunday's Premier League latest\nKonsa agrees new long-term Villa deal\nTrezeguet inspires late Villa flourish\nWithout inspirational captain Grealish for the seventh straight game, Villa looked in a rut when they went behind just after the hour mark.\nDean Smith was hoping to welcome back Grealish from a shin injury but a setback in training on the eve of the game dashed the Villa manager's plans.\nVilla have struggled without the England midfielder, winning just one of their previous six matches, and they looked on course for another disappointing result until Trezeguet was sent on shortly after Mitrovic put Fulham ahead.\nHe scored twice in the space of three minutes to turn the game on its head before playing a part in the third goal by laying it off to Bertrand Traore, who crossed for Watkins to score.\nWith a trip to Liverpool and a home game against Manchester City coming up, this was a welcome return to winning ways.\nHaving moved onto 44 points after 29 games - 18 more than they had at the same stage last season - Villa are just five points off a European spot.\nThey will hope to have Grealish back in time for next weekend's visit to Anfield but they at least proved against Fulham that they can win without their prized asset.\nHuge blow for Fulham\nWith Newcastle again failing to win earlier on Sunday, this game represented Fulham's best chance yet of climbing out of the bottom three, where they have been anchored since 20 December 2020.\nIt appeared to be going to plan for the visitors when Mitrovic scored.\nElevated to the starting line-up after scoring five goals in three World Cup qualifiers for Serbia, the former Newcastle player justified his inclusion with his goal.\nBut Fulham, not for the first time this season, failed to see the game out, Villa scoring three times in the space of nine minutes to take the match away from them.\nOnly Southampton (18) and Brighton (17) have dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than Parker's side.\nThree points from a position of safety with seven matches left, including a home game against Manchester United, as well as trips to Arsenal and Chelsea, Fulham are in big trouble.\nTheir last match of the season, at home to Newcastle on 23 May, already looks as if it could be highly significant, but Parker has to make sure Fulham are still in with a chance of staying up by then.\n'The subs changed it for us' - what they said\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"It's a big win - a win full of character in the end. We believe we've got a quality squad.\n\"It was certainly a very good last 20 minutes or so. Sometimes you need players to make an impact from the bench and the three who came on certainly did that and lifted our performance.\n\"The subs changed the game for us. Trezeguet came on and did what I asked of him - made an impact. He has been a little unfortunate at times this season and I am really pleased for him.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker: \"I thought we were pretty solid for much of the game but the last 15 minutes I didn't like at all and it is something we will need to address.\n\"We need to be brutally honest, the last 15 minutes is not one we can brush under the carpet. If we do that again, we will not win football matches.\n\"The games are coming thick and fast with only seven remaining now.\"\nSuper-sub Trezeguet - the key stats\nTrezeguet is only the third Aston Villa substitute to score twice in a single Premier League match, after Julian Joachim, against Derby in September 2000, and Dwight Yorke, against Liverpool in May 1994.\nThis was the first game in Premier League history in which every player in the starting line-ups for both sides was born after the first-ever Premier League game, played on 15 August, 1992.\nAfter 159 days without a goal for club and country (23 apps), Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored six goals in the past 12 days - with five goals in three games for Serbia, plus one for Fulham.\nBefore his two goals against Fulham, which came just 160 seconds apart, Trezeguet had attempted more shots without scoring than any other player in this season's Premier League (29).\nWhat's next?\nWhile Aston Villa will hope to have Grealish back for next Saturday's league game at Liverpool (15:00 BST), Fulham are back in action on Friday when Wolves visit Craven Cottage (20:00).\nDragons' Den returns: A new series of eager entrepreneurs hoping to strike the deal of a lifetime\nYour film night sorted: Epic films for you to choose from this Easter weekend"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-1 Brighton & Hove Albion: Mason Greenwood scores winner\nMason Greenwood should not be judged purely on his goal scoring, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said after the teenager's effort completed a comeback victory over Brighton.\nThe 19-year-old headed in his first Premier League goal at Old Trafford this season after Paul Pogba's volley had bounced into the ground.\nIt was his first in the league since May 2020 and his sixth goal in 40 appearances in all competitions this season, a campaign which started with him being sent home from an England camp after breaching Covid guidelines.\n\"When he gets those goals, we know he's going to add another dimension to his game,\" said Solskjaer, who could be without forward Anthony Martial for the rest of the season through injury.\n\"The world nowadays is so on to stats and this and that.\n\"The boy has played fantastically [during] the last two or three months and has really come on. If he keeps learning and improving he will score more - he's a lethal finisher.\"\nBrighton took an early lead when former United striker Danny Welbeck reacted quickest after his initial header had been saved, nodding in from close range.\nHowever, not for the first time this season, United improved from a lethargic opening period to sweep to victory in the second.\nMarcus Rashford levelled when he opened up his body and rolled an excellent shot into the corner from Bruno Fernandes' lay-off, before Greenwood's winner eight minutes from the end.\nThe result gives United an 11-point cushion in the battle for a top-four place, although West Ham and Everton could reduce that to eight if they both win their matches in hand.\nReaction to Manchester United v Brighton\nMartial could miss rest of season\nHenderson gets the nod over De Gea\nEventually, this game may be viewed as being more significant for what happened before it, rather than what occurred in it.\nIn the build-up, Solskjaer said both his goalkeepers would play matches before the end of the season.\nHowever, the choice of Dean Henderson over David de Gea seemed significant.\nHenderson played in six consecutive games immediately prior to the international break after De Gea returned to Spain for the birth of his first child.\nAgainst Brighton, though, there was no reason why De Gea should have been sidelined for any reason other than manager Solskjaer's preference.\nIt has been obvious for some time the present situation was untenable heading into next season and now United could have the tricky problem of trying to sell their highest earner when every club's finances are being stretched.\nThat said, Henderson has to justify his place.\nNo blame could be attached to the England man for Welbeck's goal as he did remarkably well to keep the first effort out.\nSpilling a routine cross not long afterwards - requiring the intervention of Harry Maguire to clear the danger - was a worry though.\nHenderson was a bystander when Lewis Dunk clipped the bar as Brighton tried to increase their lead but the calm way he dealt with the reduced work he was provided with after the interval offers no obvious reason why Solskjaer should regret his decision.\nWelbeck hurts his old club again\nIt is nearly seven years since Welbeck left Old Trafford for Arsenal in a \u00a316m transfer.\nA succession of injuries prevented the 30-year-old from fulfilling the promise he showed in his formative years at United but he has been a regular nuisance to his old club.\nToday's effort was his fourth goal against them, all but one of which have come on this ground.\nHis reaction to score - the first time Brighton had been in front at Old Trafford since 1983 - was impressive and Welbeck was convinced he should have had a penalty in the second half when he was nudged by Maguire as he tried to put Brighton in front again, the ball rolling agonisingly across goal.\nClearly, time moves on. Now it is Greenwood trying to carve out a future for Manchester United and England.\nWith Martial out, Rashford battling shoulder and knee injuries and Edinson Cavani struggling for form, Greenwood may have to carry United's attack over the final weeks of the season.\nHe fired a first-time shot against the post early in this contest and while his six goals this season is a long way adrift of last years' tally of 17, the confidence he will gain from this contribution will be welcomed by Solskjaer.\n'De Gea will definitely play for us again' - what they said\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told BBC Sport: \"It's always difficult to play Brighton. We have had good results and we've had to earn them the hard way - we managed to find a way in the second half.\n\"Mason [Greenwood] was mature. Today he was one of our brightest players. He was clean, he was tidy and he got the goal. It's a header inside the six-yard box and that's what we need more from Mason.\"\nOn picking Henderson over De Gea: \"I've got two great keepers, two number ones. David de Gea spent a while back home and then he had internationals so he hadn't played for about a month. He'll definitely play football for us again.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter told BBC Sport: \"We contributed well in the game. We took the lead and were probably the team which carried the most threat in the first half - we just missed that final pass.\n\"Manchester United responded in the second half without creating too many chances. They scored from not too much.\n\"When it was live, I thought it was a penalty [on Welbeck] then I suppose it's the clear and obvious debate.\n\"If Mike Dean had given it, I don't think VAR would have overruled it. There's nothing we can do in the end. We're disappointed to come away with nothing.\"\nComeback kings - the stats\nManchester United have beaten Brighton twice in the Premier League this season despite conceding first in both games, only the second time they have done so against an opponent in a season, also achieving this against Southampton in 2012-13.\nBrighton remain winless away from home against Manchester United in 13 attempts in all competitions (D2 L11).\nManchester United have won 25 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, nine more than any other side. Brighton have dropped 20 points from winning positions, three more than anyone else.\nManchester United have won eight Premier League games after conceding first this season - only Newcastle United in 2001-02 and Manchester United themselves in 2012-13 have won more such games in a single season (nine each).\nBrighton's Danny Welbeck became the first player to score three Premier League goals against Manchester United after having appeared for the club in the competition. His other two goals against them came for Arsenal, in February 2016 and May 2017.\nOnly Wayne Rooney (15) and Marcus Rashford (13) have scored more Premier League goals as a teenager for Manchester United than Mason Greenwood (12).\nThe 2020-21 season is only the second season to see two players who have previously appeared for Manchester United in the Premier League score against them (Wilfried Zaha and Danny Welbeck), along with the 1997-98 campaign, when Dion Dublin and Mark Hughes did so.\nManchester United's Bruno Fernandes has been involved in more Premier League goals since his debut than anyone else (42 - 24 goals, 18 assists).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United play the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final against Spanish side Granada on Thursday (20:00 BST) before travelling to Tottenham on Sunday (16:30).\nBrighton host Everton a week on Monday (20:15).\nBeing: How are different faiths celebrated in modern Britain?\nEaster around the globe: Test your knowledge of how different countries celebrate the holiday"

We have to get those two points back in other games.\"\nThe result leaves Everton eighth, five points off fourth-placed West Ham having played one game fewer.\nPalace's safety is all but guaranteed, the draw leaving them 12 points clear of the bottom three with eight games remaining.\nRelive Everton's draw with Crystal Palace\n'We fight until the end'\nAfter top-four rivals Chelsea, Leicester and Tottenham all dropped points over the weekend, the door was open for Everton to continue their push for Champions League qualification.\nVictory would have taken the Toffees to within three points of fourth place, but a lapse in concentration allowed Batshuayi to race through and net the leveller.\n\"There is a fantastic battle for the European positions,\" added Ancelotti.\n\"A lot of teams are involved [and there are] a lot of unpredictable results.\n\"We have to fight until the end. This competition will be decided in the last minute of the last game.\"\nEverton had started the brighter as Palace keeper Vicente Guaita made a flurry of fine stops, standing tall to keep out Dominic Calvert-Lewin and denying Richarlison with two excellent first-half saves.\nRodriguez, who had been sidelined with a calf injury for the past six weeks, showed a calmness in front of goal, squeezing in the game's opener at the near post.\nAnd in the closing stages Richarlison forced Guaita into another good save, but Palace held on to frustrate the hosts who have now won just one of their past nine league games at Goodison Park.\n'This is how we play'\nHaving now collected 38 points this season, only the most pessimistic of supporters will argue that Palace don't already have enough to stay in the Premier League for a ninth successive season.\nManager Roy Hodgson has always seen survival as his primary target, but with the 73-year-old yet to extend his contract beyond the end of the season, the Eagles' substance over style approach has been well reported.\n\"The major aspiration is to win football matches, that's always been our goal,\" Hodgson told BBC Sport.\n\"Unfortunately supporters don't give you much credit for entertaining if you get beat every week.\"\nHodgson named an unchanged starting XI, with his side sitting back, looking to hit their hosts on the break.\nEberechi Eze and Wilfried Zaha - who again opted to stand rather than take a knee - had half chances in the second period, before Batshuayi came on for Christian Benteke in the 84th minute.\nTwo minutes later he netted the equaliser, latching on to a Jeffrey Schlupp pass.\n\"I think it was a point that we deserved,\" added Hodgson. \"There were never any occasions where we were inferior to our opponents.\n\"With 38 points we've got a tremendous base with eight games to go.\n\"The way we've played tonight that's basically the way we've tried to play football and will always try to play football.\"\nEverton's home woes - the stats\nEverton have registered just one win in their past eight home league games (D2 L5), after winning four of the seven before that.\nCrystal Palace have suffered just one defeat in their past six Premier League games (W2 D3) after losing four of the preceding six.\nEverton mustered 15 shots in the game, only managing more in a league game this season once before, 17 against West Brom in September.\nJames Rodriguez has been directly involved in 12 goals in 14 home games in all competitions for Everton this season - five goals and seven assists.\nRodriguez is the fifth Colombian to hit 10 or more Premier League goal involvements in a single season, after Faustino Asprilla, Hamilton Ricard, Juan Pablo Angel and Hugo Rodallega.\nOf all players to have scored at least 15 Premier League goals, Crystal Palace striker Michy Batshuayi has netted the highest proportion of them as a substitute with nine out of 15.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace host Chelsea in a London derby on Saturday (17:30 BST), before Everton travel to Brighton in the Premier League next Monday (20:15)."

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-3 West Ham: Jesse Lingard stunner helps Hammers to win\nWest Ham captain Mark Noble says the Hammers have nothing to lose in the race to secure Champions League football after victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers moved them into the Premier League's top four.\nAfter racing into a three-goal lead during a brilliant opening 40 minutes, the Hammers held off a Wolves fightback to secure a win that moves them above Chelsea with eight games remaining.\nThe only negative for David Moyes' side was the early withdrawal of Michail Antonio through injury, with the striker to be assessed in the coming days.\nBut the Hammers showed real character following his departure to secure the win, and Noble says the squad are determined to fight for a top-four finish.\n\"We said two or three weeks ago that when we get to single figures in games left we can have a right go, because we have nothing to lose and we can go for it,\" he said.\n\"Let's hope it's a great [season]. We have eight games to go and we're in fourth We're mixing it with the top teams.\"\nOn-loan Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard was in inspired form as the Hammers tore Wolves apart in the first half, scoring a fine solo goal and playing a part in the other two as the visitors raced into a 3-0 lead.\nAfter running from inside his own half for the opener, he produced a brilliant flick on the byline to find Arthur Masuaku, whose low cross was turned in first time by Pablo Fornals, before then leading a quick counter to tee up substitute Jarrod Bowen to drive in the third.\nMoyes' side had let slip a 3-0 lead in their previous game against Arsenal to draw 3-3 and they looked in danger of a repeat when Leander Dendoncker headed home just before half-time and substitute Fabio Silva rolled in a fine strike midway through the second half to reduce the deficit to one goal.\nWest Ham dropped deep as they tried to hold on to their slender advantage, and although Wolves dominated the closing stages they could not find a way through for a third time.\nMoyes, like Noble, believes there is no reason why West Ham cannot stay in the fight for a top-four finish.\n\"I am hearing pundits talking about West Ham having a chance of Champions League,\" he said.\n\"Nobody would have envisaged or mentioned that last season. Can we keep it going? We are going to try and compete with the big teams right until the end.\"\nRelive West Ham's win at Wolves\nHammers' Declan Rice out for four weeks with injury\nLingard shines as West Ham eye Champions League\nFew would likely have expected Lingard, who had fallen out of form and out of favour at Manchester United, to prove to be one of the signings of the January transfer window when he made the switch to the Hammers.\nBut since the move he has not just developed into an integral part of Moyes' side but also into one of the most in-form players in the Premier League.\nHe scored two goals on his West Ham debut and now has six in eight league appearances, with his form having propelled him back into the England set-up at just the right time with the European Championships coming up this summer.\nHis latest strike was undoubtedly a goal of the season contender as he picked the ball up from halfway and slalomed his way past stunned Wolves players before finishing clinically.\nSince he joined West Ham only Harry Kane (nine) has been involved in as many goals as Lingard and his arrival has undoubtedly played a key role in ensuring the Hammers are very much in the conversation for a finish in the Champions League places.\n\"I was telling him how well he has played,\" Moyes said of speaking to Lingard at full-time.\n\"I'm probably a manager who doesn't say that very often, but he deserved that after his performance.\"\nWolves left with too much to do\nSince returning to the Premier League Wolves have often found themselves in the battle for the European places, but a disappointing and inconsistent campaign this time round means that their campaign is spluttering towards a mid-table finish.\nInjuries have certainly not helped Nuno Espirito Santo's side, with Raul Jimenez having been ruled out for much of the season with a fractured skull while they were dealt another blow before this game with the news that wing-back Jonny is out for the rest of the campaign with an ACL injury.\nJimenez's absence has been particularly telling as Wolves have struggled for goals without him - only Burnley had scored fewer than Wolves' 29 in the Premier League prior to this fixture.\nThe three conceded in the first half against West Ham ultimately left them with too much to do but there were some positives for Wolves in the second half, none more so than performance of Fabio Silva.\nThe 18-year-old has only scored three goals this season but his latest was his best and a reminder of the exciting talent he possesses as he produced a great first touch to control an excellent Pedro Neto pass before finishing clinically.\n\"When you don't have the same players everything is not the same and it becomes harder,\" said Nuno.\n\"The reaction was good but we started very bad. Conceding three goals against a top team like West Ham makes it very difficult to reverse the result.\"\nA first for West Ham - the stats\nWest Ham have won seven away Premier League games this season, their joint-best return in a single campaign in the competition (also seven in 1993-94, 2005-06 and 2015-16).\nWolves have lost six home Premier League games this season, their most in a single campaign since their return to the competition in 2018.\nThis was West Ham's first ever top-flight double over Wolves, and the first in any league season since the 1922-23 Second Division.\nWest Ham scored 3+ goals in the first half of consecutive Premier League games for the first time ever.\nJesse Lingard has been involved in nine goals in his eight Premier League appearances for West Ham (six goals, three assists) - since his debut for the Hammers in February, no player has been involved in more Premier League goals than Lingard.\nOnly Leeds (six) have scored more goals from fast breaks than West Ham in the Premier League this season (five), while Jesse Lingard has scored more such goals than any other player this term (three).\nLeander Dendoncker's goal for Wolves was his first in the Premier League this season from his 28th attempt at goal - before this game, he'd had more shots without scoring than any other player this term.\nWolves' Adama Traore has now had more shots without scoring than any other player in the Premier League this season (26), with the Spaniard having two unsuccessful attempts tonight.\nJarrod Bowen's goal for West Ham came just two minutes and 34 seconds after coming off the bench - it was his seventh Premier League goal this season, with only Tomas Soucek netting more for the Hammers this term (nine).\nWhat next?\nWolves are back in Premier League action on Friday, 9 April (20:00 BST) when they travel to Fulham while West Ham host Leicester on Sunday, 11 April (14:05 BST)."

When the game ends like it does, it's not a good feeling.\n\"We have had punches that should have knocked us out this season but they haven't done that. We have gone and beat some big teams and Arsenal is going to be a must-win, other games will be must-win but we will keep our resolve.\n\"You may think I am mad but I honestly believe in this team. What is ingrained in me is a desire, an effort and fight and my team showed that tonight. It's been fine margins all season, what's key is you get back up fighting.\n\"There's only one way we come back from this and that's come back fighting with your hands up, jabbing away. Never let anything sink us. I'm as low as the players tonight but I can guarantee you on Monday we'll be back in and I'll give everything.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"Fulham caused us numerous problems and the game broke in the very last minute. It is difficult for Adama Traore to find spaces because the opponents foul him a lot.\n\"Half-time was disturbed because of the disallowed goal, the players were out of focus. I told them to forget about VAR and we will analyse later. Our priority was to defend and then break.\n\"The win was very important. This is what we want for the rest of the season, there are a lot of games to be played and we have a lot of things to improve.\"\nWolves snatch first Premier League away win against Fulham\nIn the 12th Premier League meeting between Fulham and Wolves, this was the first away victory, and the first away top-flight victory in this fixture since August 1967.\nWolves registered only their second away Premier League win in their past 11 matches (D4 L5), also beating Southampton in February.\nWith his 28th shot in the Premier League this season, Wolves winger Adama Traore netted his first goal of the season.\nFulham have lost four consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since losing their first four games of this season.\nThis was the second 90th-minute winning goal scored against Fulham this season, with Tomas Soucek scoring one for West Ham in November.\nWhat's next?\nFulham face a trip to Arsenal for a 13:30 BST kick-off on Sunday, 18 April.

City must take 11 points from their remaining six games to guarantee a third league title in four seasons.\nHe's led Leeds' 'transformation' - but will 'enigma' Bielsa still be there next season?\nReaction from Etihad Stadium, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nLeeds' day to remember\nIt is a measure of how long Leeds have been outside the top flight that this was only their second league game at Etihad Stadium.\nBut, as on so many occasions this season, Marcelo Bielsa's men made a positive impression, even though they were unable to control possession as they did when these sides drew 1-1 at Elland Road earlier in October.\nHelder Costa and Tyler Roberts were a threat down the flanks though, so it was not entirely out of the blue when Leeds took the lead.\nJoao Cancelo was unusually hesitant having been deployed at right-back and Costa took advantage, providing the pass for Patrick Bamford, who set Dallas up for his precise finish.\nIt was a shame for Leeds that their captain spoiled all the good work almost immediately with a two-footed lunge.\nCooper was still pleading his innocence as he slowly made his way off the pitch, even though referee Andre Marriner had gone to the monitor before changing his initial yellow card to a red for a tackle that left Jesus needing treatment.\nWinning the game at that point seemed a distant prospect for Leeds, even against a City team with seven changes from the one that beat Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday.\nRaheem Sterling had already wasted a couple of decent chances for the hosts and, after the break, the contest was more like a game of attack and defence as City piled forward, frequently having all 10 outfield players within 30 yards of the visitors' goal.\nOleksandr Zinchenko brought a full-length save out of Illan Meslier, Bernardo Silva had a goalbound shot deflected wide and substitute Ilkay Gundogan fired a good chance over before Torres struck.\nCity did have a warning of what Leeds were capable of when Raphinha broke clear, only to be denied by Ederson's perfectly executed slide tackle.\nHowever, Leeds had one more attack left in them - and Dallas provided the perfect finish to give his side a third successive Premier League win for the first time since 2002-03, when Terry Venables was in charge.\n'We didn't stop them from running' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola told BBC Match of the Day: \"We did not create enough for the forwards. It is part of the game.\n\"In the last 10 minutes they had other chances, they are fast and can do it. When they defend in the way they were doing you have to stop them running and we did not do that.\n\"We are going to rest and prepare two days for the game in Dortmund and decide on how we are going to play.\"\nLeeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa told BBC Match of the Day: \"The value of the victory increases because it was achieved in a game where we were dominated and demanded character, effort and personality.\n\"I think we have to link the victory to the spirit of the players. The spirit of all the players added together creates a uniform effort. It's very difficult to win games like today. I think we deserved it but the fair thing would have been for City to win it because they had the dominance and the chances.\n\"I value a lot the English refereeing and with the added factor of VAR all the decisions are justified.\"\nMore goals outside the box than anyone else - the stats\nManchester City suffered their first home defeat against a promoted side in 42 Premier League games, since losing 2-0 against Reading in February 2007.\nLeeds have become just the fourth promoted side to win away against the Premier League leaders in the competition's history, after Ipswich at Norwich in December 1992, Derby at Manchester United in April 1997 and Hull City at Arsenal in September 2008.\nStuart Dallas became the first player to score a 90th-minute winner for Leeds in a Premier League game since Ian Harte vs Derby County in December 1999.\nLeeds have scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League side this season (12).\nLiam Cooper became the first Leeds player to be sent off in a Premier League match since Mark Viduka against Bolton in May 2004.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City are next in action in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, 14 April (20:00 BST). Leeds host Liverpool at Elland Road in the Premier League on Monday, 19 April (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-1 Aston Villa: Reds end six-game Anfield losing run with comeback win\nTrent Alexander-Arnold scored an injury-time winner as Liverpool came from behind to beat Aston Villa and end a run of six consecutive defeats at Anfield.\nOllie Watkins - who scored a hat-trick in Villa's 7-2 win in the reverse game - fired the visitors ahead with a shot which squirmed through Alisson.\nLiverpool were denied an equaliser by an extremely tight video assistant referee offside decision. Roberto Firmino fired home from close range but a long VAR review ruled that Diogo Jota was just offside in the build-up.\nThey did eventually equalise when Mohamed Salah headed into an empty net after Emiliano Martinez parried Andy Robertson's cross.\nThat was their first goal in open play at Anfield since 27 December - a run of 12 hours and 45 minutes and 132 shots since Sadio Mane scored against West Brom. They netted one penalty at their home ground in that time.\nVilla went close to a winner as Trezeguet's spinning effort hit the post.\nBut the Reds kept persisting and Alexander-Arnold curled home from the edge of the box after Villa failed to clear the ball.\nLiverpool are fifth, above West Ham on goal difference, after Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 4-1 in Saturday's evening game.\nLiverpool finally rediscover winning touch\nAlexander-Arnold's first home goal in the league since July 2020 ended not only a six-game losing run at Anfield, but also a run of eight games without a win at home - the second worst top-flight record in their history.\nThe comeback win means another VAR offside invisible to the naked eye might avoid the headlines.\nAlexander-Arnold found Jota with a long pass over the top as Matty Cash failed to clear. Jota picked out Mohamed Salah, who passed to Andy Robertson. His shot was blocked and landed to Firmino, who scored.\nBut a long VAR check ruled that Cash did not touch the ball and Jota was just offside.\nAt that stage it felt Liverpool's luck was out but they ended up rediscovering their winning touch.\nSalah headed in and then Alexander-Arnold pounced after Thiago's shot was well saved by Emiliano Martinez before the ball reached him.\nLiverpool had plenty of chances either side of their goals - 23 shots in total - with Salah rolling a shot wide after a Tyrone Mings error one of the more notable misses.\nThe win will give Liverpool extra confidence going into Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Real Madrid at Anfield. They lost 3-1 in Spain.\nAlexander-Arnold has nothing to prove - Klopp\nIs Europe gone for Villa now?\nVilla were hoping to complete a double over Liverpool, having stunned them 7-2 earlier in the season in one of the Premier League's most famous scorelines.\nAnd things were looking good when John McGinn found Watkins, who cut inside Ozan Kabak before shooting straight at Alisson, who should have done better but let the ball in.\nThat made Watkins the first player to score four goals against Liverpool in a single Premier League season since Andrey Arshavin for Arsenal in 2008-09.\nAfter the break and Liverpool's equaliser they struggled to create too many clear-cut chances, except for Trezeguet's effort off the woodwork from Watkins' pass.\nTheir failure to hold on to a point means they are now five points below Tottenham Hotspur in seventh place, which is the lowest position that could be a European place.\nMatch stats - Liverpool are late goal experts\nLiverpool have won a Premier League game with a 90th-minute winning goal for the 37th time, 12 more than any other side.\nAston Villa have lost 22 Premier League games in such a manner. Only Spurs (23) have lost more in the competition's history.\nSalah has scored 28 goals in all competitions this season, his best return in a campaign for Liverpool since 2017-18 (44).\nNo player has scored more goals against reigning Premier League champions in a single season than Ollie Watkins vs Liverpool this season (four - also Sergio Aguero v Chelsea in 2015-16 and Harry Kane v Leicester in 2016-17).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool host Real Madrid on Wednesday (20:00 BST). The Reds play twice before Villa's next game - visiting Leeds the following Monday in the league (also 20:00).\nVilla do not play another game for 11 days. They host Manchester City on Wednesday, 21 April (20:15)."

He's not the leader of this team and he doesn't have to be. He had excellent runs and he could've scored more.\"\nThe win takes Chelsea back into the Premier League top four, two points above Liverpool and West Ham.\nAction and reaction from Crystal Palace v Chelsea, along with the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nLawro's full predictions v Police Academy actor Steve Guttenberg\nA redemptive week for Chelsea\nChelsea suffered the first bump in the road of Tuchel's managerial tenure last weekend, with West Brom's shock win.\nWednesday's 2-0 victory over Porto in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final washed away some of the negativity from that result, putting them in a great position to reach the last four.\nAnd they completed the job with this one-sided display that puts them back in the English top-flight top four, ahead of Liverpool and West Ham, who will replace them if they win their game in hand at home to Leicester on Sunday.\nThey had full control of the game before the 11th minute and sealed the win through a display packed with neat, precision passing, effective high pressing and clinical finishing.\nKeeping up such a relentless display throughout the game was always unlikely, but even when Palace were able to muster something to hurt them, the Blues always had a higher gear to click into.\n\"It was very good. We started very well, very aggressive and we had a high percentage of possession,\" added Tuchel. \"We also had a good switch of play and we had a lot of touches in the box - so a very good performance.\n\"We have the feeling we could've scored more but we deserved that and that's a nice feeling for our self-confidence.\"\nPalace started the game aiming for a fourth successive top-flight clean sheet at home for the first time since 1992. They spent the majority of the game simply trying to keep the scoreline respectable.\nWith 38 points, 12 more than 18th-placed Fulham, Roy Hodgson's side will not be going down this season but the ex-England boss will want to see his side compete better over their remaining fixtures.\n\"We know they are a good side, everybody knows that, but we can't afford to play the way we did in the first half,\" said Hodgson.\n\"Both of the first two goals came about through balls lost near our own goal. Suddenly they find themselves 2-0 up after 10-11 minutes. We needed to defend well and make good decisions.\n\"How many teams can come back from 3-0 down against this Chelsea team? To give some credit the players did better in the second half and showed some fight in them but the bottom line is we played against a Chelsea team that we believed we could stretch and we're on the back end of a 4-1 defeat and needed to do some last-ditch defending to keep it down to four.\"\nChelsea's dominance over Palace continues\nCrystal Palace have lost each of their past seven Premier League games against Chelsea - only against Tottenham (nine consecutive matches between September 2015 - September 2019) have the Eagles lost more games consecutively versus a specific opponent in their Football League history.\nChelsea are yet to lose on the road under Thomas Tuchel in the Premier League (P6 W4 D2) - the only Blues manager to avoid defeat in his first six away games in the competition was Felipe Scolari (unbeaten in first 10).\nNone of the last 20 Premier League meetings between Crystal Palace and Chelsea have ended as a draw - only Newcastle v Spurs between August 1999 and December 2010 has had a longer run of games without a drawn game in the competition (21).\nChelsea scored two goals within the opening 10 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time since January 2018 against Brighton (6 minutes), while there were just 102 seconds separating Kai Havertz's opener and Christian Pulisic's strike for the Blues.\nKai Havertz scored and assisted in a single league game for the first time as a Chelsea player, last doing so for Bayer Leverkusen against Cologne in the Bundesliga in June 2020.\nChelsea's Christian Pulisic has scored more Premier League goals against Crystal Palace than against any other side (four), while the only Americans to score more than Pulisic (13) in the competition are Clint Dempsey (57) and Brian McBride (36).\nAll four of Mason Mount's Premier League assists this season for Chelsea have been for headed goals from set-piece situations, with three of those being scored by Kurt Zouma.\nChelsea's Kurt Zouma has scored five goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other defender. His five league goals this campaign have come from 19 appearances having scored just four goals in his first 141 Premier League games for Chelsea, Stoke and Everton combined.\nCrystal Palace striker Christian Benteke has been directly involved in nine goals in his past 11 Premier League appearances against Chelsea (seven goals, two assists). He has scored in four home games against them and is yet to end on the winning side (D1 L3) with only Matt le Tissier v Nottingham Forest (five) scoring in more home Premier League matches against a specific opponent without ending on the winning side.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace have a bit of time off, playing next at Leicester in the Premier League (in a 20:00 BST kick-off on 26 April).\nChelsea also have a little gap now until their next league game, against Brighton on Tuesday, 20 April (20:00). Before then, they have the second leg of their Champions League tie with Porto (this coming Tuesday at 20:00) and an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City next Saturday (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-2 Newcastle United: Saint-Maximin inspires Magpies turnaround at Turf Moor\nAllan Saint-Maximin inspired a brilliant turnaround as he came off the bench to earn Newcastle a vital win at Burnley with a goal and assist in the space of seven minutes.\nSteve Bruce's side were second best to a well-drilled Burnley, who took a first-half lead through Matej Vydra following excellent work by Chris Wood.\nBut after the visitors had a penalty appeal for James Tarkowski's high foot on Sean Longstaff rejected via the video assistant referee, the game turned their way with Saint-Maximin's second-half introduction.\nBurnley were threatening to add to their lead when the French winger and forward Callum Wilson came off the bench after 57 minutes.\nHas Bruce stopped the rot and does he deserve a second chance?\nBut Saint-Maximin set up Jacob Murphy for the equaliser following a twisting run, and then scored a brilliant second goal with his left foot to earn a much-needed victory, which lifts Newcastle six points clear of the relegation zone.\nThere were further chances for Burnley, who pressed aggressively for an equaliser, and are now just a point above their opponents as their own relegation concerns increased.\nBut Bruce's side held on, earning a first win in eight games to their evident relief at the final whistle.\nTurning point in Newcastle's season?\nThe significance of a third win in 20 Premier League games for Bruce and his team cannot be overstated.\nHaving drawn against Tottenham last Sunday and watched Fulham suffer an injury-time defeat by Wolves on Friday that left the Cottagers three points behind Newcastle, there was a huge opportunity to take advantage against a Burnley side who have slipped into danger after a run of five successive home draws.\nFor much of the first half, the visitors, who were without the injured Jamaal Lascelles, struggled to deal with Burnley's direct approach. Wood and Vydra caused all sorts of bother with Dwight McNeil also dangerous.\nTheir problems were exemplified by the opening goal as Ciaran Clark failed to stop Wood's run and Vydra was left alone to slot in.\nBut there was hope for Bruce's side from the flanks, especially through Miguel Almiron on the right. Dwight Gayle, making his 100th Premier League appearance for Newcastle, had the ball in the net after Joelinton's effort fell to him but was flagged offside.\nGayle should then have scored from point-blank range but Burnley goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell, who replaced the injured Nick Hope, somehow kept his effort out.\nThat led directly to the VAR controversy, Longstaff trying to head in the rebound only for Tarkowski's high foot to catch the Newcastle midfielder's head.\nReferee Anthony Taylor stopped the game while a review took place, ultimately deciding not to award the foul.\nFortunately for the visitors, any injustice was rendered moot when Saint-Maximin came off the bench to turn the game their way.\nHis impact was felt after just two minutes as he turned Erik Pieters twice and laid the ball back to Murphy, who fired into the far corner.\nThe Frenchman then proved his undoubted value five minutes later by storming through the Burnley defence to give Newcastle the lead with his third goal of a season badly affected by injury and illness.\nSaint-Maximin almost set up Almiron for a third late on but the Paraguayan's shot was cleared off the line.\nOverall, though, the victory was a massive moment in Newcastle's season and backed up Bruce's claim that when his key players returned from injury they would be safe.\nThere is still a difficult run-in for the Magpies, but after losing only one of their past six games, with four draws in that run, this felt like a turning point.\nBurnley dragged into danger\nThe Clarets started this game with clear intent to improve on their unimpressive recent home form, and their speed at getting into the Newcastle box caused immediate problems for the visitors.\nKey to that was the partnership of Wood and Vydra, who make a classic combination up front. Newcastle's five-man defence struggled with the Kiwi international's aerial threat and the pace of his Czech team-mate.\nBut it was Wood's dexterity on the ground that led to the opener. Having twisted Clark inside out, he then made it to the byeline before pulling a smart cross back for Vydra to score his sixth goal of the season.\nSean Dyche's side continued to cause problems through the excellent McNeil. His forward passing and dangerous corners were a concern for Magpies keeper Martin Dubravka, who was also forced into a brilliant stop to prevent a Paul Dummett own goal after the defender almost sliced into his own net.\nMatt Lowton also tested Dubravka with a rising effort and once Saint-Maximin turned the game Newcastle's way, Burnley were almost camped in the visitors' half.\nBut they could not find a way through and one win in eight Premier League games means they are not out of danger yet, even if they are seven points above 18th-placed Fulham with a game in hand.\n\"It was a very dominant performance and it's disappointing that you don't get anything from the game, but that's football,\" Dyche said.\n\"You've got to turn the key moments in your favour, which we sort of nearly did but didn't quite see it off. I'm disappointed with the result I'm not disappointed in the performance.\"\nBruce ends eight-year record - the stats\nThis was the first time Newcastle boss Steve Bruce had seen his team win a Premier League game in which they trailed at half-time since September 2013, when his Hull side beat Newcastle 3-2, ending a run of 44 winless such matches since (D5 L39).\nSaint-Maximin was only the fifth player to both score and assist a goal as a substitute in a Premier League match for Newcastle, and the first since Rolando Aarons against Tottenham in May 2016.\nJacob Murphy ended a run of 16 Premier League appearances without a goal for Newcastle; all three of his goals in the competition have come away from home.\nBurnley have lost back-to-back Premier League games despite scoring the first goal in both of them; it's the first time the Clarets have lost consecutive Premier League matches in which they opened the scoring since October 2009, when they lost to Blackburn and Wigan.\nEach of Burnley's past seven Premier League goals have come in the first half of games, with Chris Wood scoring (three) or assisting (two) five of those.\nBurnley have lost as many Premier League games this season as they did in the entirety of last term (14), while their points tally of 33 this season is nine fewer than they had from their opening 31 league matches of 2019-20 (42).\nBurnley's Matej Vydra has scored three goals in his past five Premier League games, as many as he had across his previous 53 appearances in the competition beforehand. Vydra has scored in back-to-back Premier League appearances for the first time since February 2020.\nWhat next?\nBurnley travel to Manchester United for their next Premier League game on Sunday 18 April (16:00 BST). Newcastle host West Ham on Saturday 17 April (12:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 3-2 Leicester City: Jesse Lingard continues his stunning form\nJesse Lingard continued his stunning form with West Ham by scoring twice in the first half to set the Hammers on course for a crucial victory over fellow Champions League hopefuls Leicester City.\nThe two sides came into the weekend occupying the last two Champions League spots, before wins for Chelsea and Liverpool on Saturday nudged West Ham down to sixth place.\nBut David Moyes' men showed they are up for the challenge of qualifying for Europe's top club competition for the first time, going 3-0 up and holding on during a late Leicester rally to climb back into fourth.\nThe Hammers took the lead as Arthur Masuaku's cross went through to right-back Vladimir Coufal, who cut back for Lingard to sweep the ball inside Kasper Schmeichel's near post from the edge of the box.\nJarrod Bowen then beat the offside trap to race on to Issa Diop's long ball and square for Lingard to tap into an empty net for his eighth goal in nine Premier League games since arriving on loan from Manchester United.\nThe 28-year-old forward, whose recent form earned him an England recall, then played a part in West Ham's third goal right after half-time as Bowen poked in from Tomas Soucek's pass to round off a clinical team move.\nKelechi Iheanacho pulled a goal back to give the visitors hope, before grabbing his 11th goal in 11 games in stoppage time, but the Hammers ensured they did not surrender a 3-0 lead for the second straight home game and move within a point of third-placed Leicester.\nLeicester's preparations had been disrupted with James Maddison, Hamza Choudhury and Ayoze Perez left out for breaching Covid-19 protocols.\nForgotten man to England starter? How Lingard is driving West Ham towards the Champions League\nIt would have been easy for me to give up - Lingard\nNoble reaches another milestone\nWith Declan Rice set to be out until May, club captain Mark Noble has returned to the Hammers' midfield at a pivotal stage of the season.\nThe 33-year-old led by example during Monday's 3-2 win at Wolves and did so again during his 400th Premier League game for West Ham - and 524th in all competitions - before going off after injuring his wrist making a desperate block late on.\nThe Hammers were a Championship side when Noble made his league debut in January 2005. Now they could finish in the top four of English football's top flight for the first time since 1985-86.\nThe man known as 'Mr West Ham' signed a one-year extension in March, saying he will leave at the end of 2021-22, and said before Sunday's game that he is relishing the prospect of playing Champions League football in his 18th and final season with the club.\nAlong with the graft of a long-serving club servant, the guile of short-term signing Lingard has helped cement West Ham's status as genuine top-four contenders.\nA poor lay-off by Coufal denied him the chance of scoring another goal in the first half, while Lingard crossed for Diop to head home after the break, only to see it disallowed for offside.\nIt seems it is no longer a question of whether Lingard will make England's European Championship squad this summer, but whether he will start.\nLingard's only league goal last season came as Manchester United dashed Leicester's Champions League hopes on the final day. Helping West Ham make the top four this time round would surely make up the mind of England manager Gareth Southgate, who was watching at London Stadium.\nLacklustre Leicester almost pull off late fightback\nThe Foxes were possibly affected by the absence of Maddison, Choudhury and Perez and were lacklustre for the first hour.\nWest Ham's opener was the result of some patient build-up play, but then Leicester only had themselves to blame as they were made to pay for playing a high line for the second goal and being dispossessed in their own half for the third.\nRicardo Pereira caught Masuaku in possession to give Iheanacho the chance to fire in from the edge of the box and, shortly after six minutes of stoppage time was indicated, the Nigeria striker scored again following a low cross by substitute Marc Albrighton.\nLeicester almost salvaged a point as Wesley Fofana headed wide at the death but it was another quiet afternoon for Jamie Vardy. After a blistering start to the season, he has now scored once in his past 18 games.\nThe Foxes are eager to avoid another late-season collapse and their next three home games are against West Brom, Crystal Palace and Newcastle, but they will need Vardy to help ease the burden on Iheanacho, 24, who is enjoying the longest run of Premier League starts in his career and is now Leicester's joint-top scorer with Vardy.\nManager Brendan Rodgers told BBC Sport: \"We mentioned about starting quickly and we did anything but. It was a tough one to watch.\n\"It's always easy to play when you're 3-0 down, I don't take much from getting back into the game. We were too passive to win an important game.\"\nHammers keep on scoring - the stats\nIn only his ninth Premier League appearance for West Ham, Jesse Lingard reached double figures for goals and assists combined with eight goals and three assists. It is the quickest a Hammers player has ever done so - Paul Kitson reached double figures in 12 games in 1997.\nMark Noble became only the eighth player to make 400 Premier League appearances for a single club.\nWest Ham have recorded their first Premier League double over Leicester since the 1999-2000 season.\nThis was David Moyes' 50th Premier League game in charge during his second spell at West Ham - the Hammers have won 75 points in those 50 games (W21 D12 L17), their most over a 50-game period in the top flight since winning 76 points between March 2007 and September 2008.\nSince Moyes returned, only Manchester City (19) and Manchester United (16) have had more Premier League games in which they've scored three or more goals than West Ham (15).\nIn 2021, only Manchester City (16) have won more Premier League matches than West Ham (10), who have picked up 32 points from a possible 45 this calendar year.\nKelechi Iheanacho has scored 14 goals in all competitions this season, equalling his best tally in a single campaign - for Manchester City in 2015-16.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham are away at Newcastle next Saturday (12:30 BST) before Leicester play Southampton in the FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday (18:30)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-3 Man Utd: Edinson Cavani scores as visitors fight back\nManchester United inflicted further damage on Tottenham's hopes of making the Premier League's top four as they came from behind to secure a fully deserved victory.\nSpurs went into this game knowing victory would keep them in touch with the Champions League places but another colourless performance led to what could be an expensive defeat.\nEdinson Cavani thought he had given United a first-half lead with a smooth finish from Paul Pogba's pass but the goal was controversially ruled out by referee Chris Kavanagh following a video assistant referee consultation after Scott McTominay caught Son Heung-min with his trailing arm.\nUnited's sense of injustice was increased when Son put Spurs ahead before the break but the visitors recovered impressively for a win that leaves them 11 points behind leaders Manchester City with a game in hand.\nFred was involved in the build-up and conclusion of the equaliser after 57 minutes, pouncing after Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris had saved well from Cavani.\nAnd Cavani finally got the goal his superb movement and constant menace deserved with 11 minutes left when he launched himself to head beyond Lloris from substitute Mason Greenwood's cross. Greenwood completed the formalities with virtually the last kick of the game as he provided a finish that was too powerful for Lloris at his near post.\n'If that was my son he doesn't get food' - Solskjaer angers Mourinho with 'embarrassing' Son claims\n'Spurs' lack of ambition does not suit Kane' - is it time for him to leave?\nReaction to Man Utd's win and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nSolskjaer delight as Man Utd fire back\nManchester United ended the first half feeling as if the world was against them, wounded by the decision to rule out Cavani's goal and then hit by Son's opener.\nAnd yet, as they have done so often this season, they bounced back from going behind to win and did so in very satisfying fashion for manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nKeeper Dean Henderson, now seemingly first choice ahead of David de Gea, made a couple of saves with his legs and Cavani was fortunate when a header bounced off his own post but United were by far the better team and had plenty of chances of their own at the other end.\nThe Uruguayan may be 34 and surrounded by speculation that he could leave Old Trafford at the end of the season but the timeless instincts of the great striker remains. He was a permanent threat, fully meriting the goal that gave United the lead.\nPogba and Fred were also outstanding contributors in midfield for United, who have now opened up a seven-point gap between themselves and Leicester City, who lost at West Ham United, in third.\nUnited are an enigmatic side, clearly full of talent and danger and yet often not at their best, but no-one could deny their quality here and no-one could begrudge them a very fine victory.\nSpurs get what they deserved: nothing\nGreenwood's late goal may have extended Manchester United's victory margin more than Spurs manager Jose Mourinho would feel was justified but he can have no serious complaints about the final outcome.\nSpurs led at the interval but it was United who came out after the break with real purpose and intent, Fred's equaliser the inevitable result of the pressure that built up.\nFor a side containing the attacking threat of Son and Harry Kane, Spurs lie dormant for long periods, dragged down by the stodgy gameplan that seems far too conservative for a team boasting two such elite attackers.\nSpurs - who won the reverse meeting 6-1 in October - had their moments in the second half but they were fleeting and there was never a sense they were taking control. This loss leaves them six points behind fourth-placed West Ham in seventh and they will have to improve markedly if they are to turn their top-four aspirations into reality.\nMatch stats - Mourinho's worst league season for defeats\nSpurs boss Jose Mourinho is winless in his past five home matches against sides he has previously managed (D2 L3), having won 12 in a row between 2002 and 2018.\nHe has suffered 10 league defeats in a single season for the first time in his entire managerial career.\nIn English top-flight history, Manchester United's current 23-game unbeaten run away from home in the league (W15 D8) is bettered only by a 27-game run from Arsenal between April 2003 and September 2004.\nSpurs have dropped 18 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, second only to Brighton (20). It is the most points a Mourinho side has dropped from winning positions in a single Premier League campaign.\nManchester United have gained 28 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season - in the competition's history, only Newcastle in 2001-02 (34) and Manchester United themselves in 2012-13 (29) have earned more points from such positions.\nSon Heung-min became the first player to score three or more goals against Manchester United in a single Premier League campaign since Sergio Aguero in 2014-15.\nManchester United's Fred scored just the second goal of his career in the Premier League, with his previous one coming against Wolves in September 2018; his equaliser ended a run of 73 shots without scoring in the competition.\nOnly Wayne Rooney (15) has scored more Premier League goals for Manchester United as a teenager than Mason Greenwood (13).\nWhat's next?\nUnited host Granada on Thursday in the Europa League quarter-final second leg, holding a 2-0 lead (20:00 BST). They then play Burnley at home in the Premier League on Sunday, 18 April (16:00).\nSpurs visit Everton in the Premier League on Friday (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 0-3 Arsenal: Gabriel Martinelli scores in deserved Gunners win\nGabriel Martinelli scored in his first start since January as Arsenal ended a run of four games without a win with victory over the Premier League's bottom club Sheffield United.\nThe Brazilian has endured an injury-plagued season, but was on hand to net his side's second with a finish into an unguarded goal after Aaron Ramsdale had pushed out Nicolas Pepe's shot.\nIt was the 19-year-old's first goal since January 2020.\nIt came between two Alexandre Lacazette goals - the first a neat first-half finish after Dani Ceballos' back-heel and the second a clinical effort in the closing stages after he was put clear by Thomas Partey.\nSheffield United have won only four games this season and none since Paul Heckingbottom took caretaker charge a month ago and they had little answer to their opponents' increased efficiency.\nAt 1-0 there was always a chance that this generous Arsenal side may provide the Blades with a way back in, but Martinelli's strike ended such home hopes, with Lacazette adding the final flourish.\nThe win - complete with a first clean sheet in 15 games - lifts Arsenal above Leeds and Aston Villa and up to ninth in the table, with 45 points.\nIt did come at a potential cost, though, with Bukayo Saka limping off in the second half with a thigh injury, making him a possible doubt for the second leg of the Europa League last-eight tie with Slavia Prague on Thursday.\nSheffield United remain rooted to the bottom, 18 points from safety with just 21 left to play for. With their woeful goal difference, a loss at Wolves next Saturday will all but confirm their relegation.\nLive text commentary of Sheff Utd v Arsenal, plus Sunday's other Premier League games\nLawro's full predictions v Police Academy actor Steve Guttenberg\nMorale-boosting win for Arsenal ahead of big European game\nArsenal endured a chastening eight days in the lead up to this fixture, suffering a humbling 3-0 loss to Liverpool in the Premier League before drawing the home leg of their Europa League quarter-final tie with Slavia Prague.\nTheir hopes of attaining a Champions League spot via a top-four finish are long gone, leaving success in Europe's secondary competition as their last remaining route back into its more lucrative big brother.\nThis game, then, was as much about getting Slavia's late equaliser at the Emirates out of their system with a more composed, confidence-boosting win.\nIt took them a bit of time to warm up to the task, but ultimately they found their stride, with Lacazette's opener coming during a period that saw Aaron Ramsdale tested and the side-netting struck.\nEncouragingly, Martinelli, starting only his sixth game of an injury-plagued season, was at the heart of much of their attacking threat.\nIf he can stay fit for the remainder of the campaign, his excellent close control, direct running and eagerness to test an opposition goalkeeper could well make a big difference to a season currently finely balanced between success and disaster.\nHis re-appearance as a partner for the in-form Lacazette, who has five goals in his last six games, is timely in the absence of Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang.\nOf some concern, though, will be the early departure of Saka from the game, with the talented young winger limping off after a challenge with Rhian Brewster.\nThe verdict on the Blades' season is already more or less set in stone.\nThey fleetingly offered the threat of creating something to worry the Gunners but ended with only wayward efforts from David McGoldrick and Brewster to really show for their efforts.\nAfter 31 games that have highlighted that much of their squad is not equipped for the Premier League, the next seven will help them decide which players they want with them in the Championship next season.\n'Ideal preparation for Prague'\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta to BT Sport: \"I am really happy with the way we played, we scored some really nice goals and controlled the game the way we wanted. We played at a high level. From the start I felt the boys were at it, we were efficient.\n\"Bukayo Saka, the last thing we need is another injury but he felt something in his thigh.\n\"Gabriel Martinelli twisted his ankle but he's a tough boy. Against Prague, Lacazette missed two big chances and he needed those goals. He has been playing well.\n\"This is ideal preparation for Thursday. It has been a long run without a clean sheet.\"\nSheffield United interim boss Paul Heckingbottom to BBC Sport: \"We didn't have control without the ball in the first half so we had to make changes.\n\"We'll keep fighting and pushing to make sure we get more points before the end of the season.\n\"We have a varied group, some young boys just starting their journey and some older players who have been on a journey with this club over the last five years.\n\"You have to learn from the tough moments and come back stronger.\"\nArsenal punish the bottom side again\nIn Premier League history, only Chelsea (42) have beaten the side starting the day bottom of the table more than Arsenal, with this win the Gunners' 37th such victory (alongside Spurs).\nSheffield United have suffered their 25th league defeat of the season, the most by a non-newly promoted side since Huddersfield in 2018-19 (28). Indeed, each of the previous 12 Premier League sides to lose 25+ matches in a season have been relegated, with 10 of those finishing rock bottom.\nArsenal have secured their first ever Premier League victory at Bramall Lane at the fifth attempt of asking (D2 L2), with this their first league win there since April 1991.\nArsenal are now unbeaten in their last four away games in the Premier League (W2 D2), their longest such run of the season. Indeed, the Gunners have earned more victories on the road (7) than they have at the Emirates this season (6).\nArsenal have won 66.6% of their six Premier League games this season without Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (W4 D1 L1), compared to 36% of those with him in the team (9/25).\nPaul Heckingbottom has seen his Sheffield United side concede 10 goals during his three Premier League games in charge, the joint-most after a manager's first three games in the competition, alongside David Moyes (2002, Everton) and Christian Gross (1997, Spurs).\nAlexandre Lacazette has now scored 13 Premier League goals this season, 10 of which have come away from home - only Mohamed Salah (11) has scored more often on the road this term.\nLacazette is the sixth Frenchman to score 50 Premier League goals for a single club, with four of the six doing so for Arsenal (also Thierry Henry, Olivier Giroud and Robert Pires).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal take on Slavia Prague in that all-important Europa League second leg on Thursday (20:00 BST), while Sheffield United are next in action on Saturday in a league game at Wolves (15:00)."

        "article_text": "West Brom 3-0 Southampton: Baggies beat Saints for second straight win\nSam Allardyce said West Brom are \"pricking up people's ears\" after they made it back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time this season with victory over Southampton.\nTwo goals in three first-half minutes through Matheus Pereira and Matt Phillips put Allardyce's men in control at the Hawthorns before Callum Robinson's fine finish completed the Baggies' biggest home win in the Premier League since November 2016.\n\"It is one of many top quality performances over the past eight or 10 games but we haven't received the credit because we didn't win,\" Allardyce said. \"We have missed out on many points due to our poor finishing.\n\"We have had two very important wins but unfortunately we have to rely on other people losing.\n\"But we are still fighting.\"\nThe victory was made more admirable by the fact West Brom needed to rally after having what would have been an opening goal for Mbaye Diagne controversially ruled out for offside after video assistant referee Kevin Friend decided there was insufficient evidence to overturn the on-pitch decision, even though TV replays suggested otherwise.\nSam Johnstone completed an excellent evening for West Brom when he turned away James Ward-Prowse's injury-time penalty.\nWest Brom are still in deep trouble, eight points adrift of fourth-bottom Newcastle with seven games remaining.\nHowever, if they meet many more sides as accommodating as Ralph Hasenhuttl's Southampton were in a dismal opening period, another of Allardyce's great escapes cannot be discounted.\n\"It gives the players hope and belief,\" added the former England boss.\n\"We have slipped up in front of goal too much. We would be on the 30-point mark now if we had taken our chances.\n\"We have got it down to eight points but games are running out.\"\nBaggies' bounce\nWhen they trailed 1-0 at Chelsea on 3 April, West Brom looked certain to complete a swift return to the Championship.\nBut after their incredible five goals at Stamford Bridge, Allardyce's side continued their offensive bombardment at the Hawthorns.\nWest Brom had 13 of the first half's 18 shots and with Pereira scheming and Diagne a major threat, they attacked with a conviction absent for most of the season.\nPereira earned the right to take the spot-kick after he had been brought down by Fraser Forster as he tried to step round the former England keeper.\nDiagne may be having little fortune when it comes to scoring himself - but his cross for Phillips' second, curling low to the far post after Danny Ings had gifted possession deep in the Southampton half - invited the first-time finish.\nAlthough West Brom were more cautious after the interval, they still created chances and Robinson made it three goals in two games when he strode onto Okay Yokuslu's pass midway through the second half.\nAmazingly, of the 17 league goals West Brom have scored in 2021, eight of them have come in their last two games.\nAllardyce added: \"Now they are winning they are getting the praise they deserve but they have deserved that for many, many games.\n\"It's not a big chance [of survival], just a hope that we keep winning and hope the other teams lose, that's all we can do.\"\nIn his programme notes, Allardyce mentioned that he said before the Chelsea game that his team needed six wins from their last nine games to have a chance of staying up. They have reduced that to four from seven.\nIf anyone knows how to attain survival from this position, it is Allardyce.\nMore VAR controversy\nIt has not been the greatest round of matches for VAR when it comes to trust.\nBy now, we are used to the way lines are used to determine who is onside and who is not. It is also commonplace for ultra-fine margins to decide whether goals should be given or not.\nBut after controversies involving Wolves, Liverpool and Manchester United over the past three days, on this occasion, the technology was condemned for not being able to allow the officials to reach a conclusion.\nWith Kevin Friend and assistant Simon Beck trying and failing to decide whether Diagne's upper body was offside, they went for the footballing equivalent of cricket's 'umpire's call', which felt unsatisfactory given the investment that has been made in the technology.\nDisappointing Southampton\nRecent wins over Sheffield United and Burnley have provided Southampton with an element of breathing space in their slide down the table.\nEven with this result they are 10 points clear of the relegation zone, which should allow them to prepare for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Leicester at Wembley with clear heads, although Ralph Hasenhuttl said his side will have \"no chance\" against the Foxes if they perform like they did at the Hawthorns.\n\"We missed everything that is normally part of our game,\" he said. \"When you make it that easy for your opponent it is not a surprise you are 2-0 down.\n\"We are all responsible for performances like this. If we play like this we have no chance on Sunday.\n\"This was a chance to get some self confidence ahead of the weekend. We didn't take it.\"\nThey did threaten in the first half, with Kyle Walker-Peters drawing a save out of Johnstone with a decent angled effort to the near-post.\nJohnstone was tested more by Stuart Armstrong's effort from the edge of the area and the West Brom keeper's reactions were up to the task when the corner ended up hitting Ings and flying towards goal from close range.\nSouthampton did have far more of the ball after half-time as their hosts adopted a more conservative approach.\nBut they never looked capable of emulating their Burnley win by recovering from a two-goal deficit, and when Ward-Prowse had his stoppage-time penalty saved, it set the seal on another disappointing performance.\nWe weren't sharp enough - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Sport: \"When the first duel was lost you could see we weren't sharp enough to compete with a team like West Brom.\n\"Our best 25 minutes were at the start of the second half but it was not enough. We made changes but we were gone by that point.\n\"The message is clear, when you want to be successful you have to show a different face.\"\nOn the early VAR offside decision: \"Normally the offside decisions are the easiest, it is yes or no. Maybe they did not have enough cameras. I don't know. It is easy to solve.\"\nWest Brom boss Allardyce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The performance in the first half probably warranted more than 2-0. I warned them about the changes Southampton would make and I think they did better, but probably on the back of a lot of our sloppy passes giving the ball away.\n\"Our defensive unit has been good for a long time and that shows why we are winning football matches. It's resilient, won't give much away and that's been a long time coming for this club from when I first started when five, three and four were going in.\n\"That gives us the platform to break away and score the third goal to finish the game off.\"\nSouthampton's poor 2021 continues - the stats\nSouthampton have picked up just 10 points in 15 Premier League games in 2021 (W3 D1 L11), fewer than any other side in this period.\nNo manager has beaten Southampton with more teams in the Premier League than West Brom's Sam Allardyce (three clubs - level with Claudio Ranieri, George Graham, Graeme Souness, Harry Redknapp, Joe Royle, Jose Mourinho).\nWest Brom have scored three or more goals in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since February 2012 (5-1 v Wolves & 4-0 v Sunderland).\nWest Brom registered 13 shots in the first half against Southampton, last attempting more in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game in February 2012 against Wolves (16).\nNo side has conceded more goals via the penalty spot in the Premier League this season than Southampton (seven).\nSince joining the club in 2016-17, Matt Phillips has scored more league goals than any other player currently at the West Brom (20).\nWest Brom's Callum Robinson has scored three goals in his last two Premier League appearances, as many as he had scored in his previous 41 in the competition - this was his first Premier League goal not scored against Chelsea, against whom he has scored five times.\nOnly Peter Odemwingie (22 in 2010-11), Romelu Lukaku (21 in 2012-13) and Saido Berahino (15 in 2014-15) have had a hand in more goals in a Premier League campaign for West Brom than Matheus Pereira in 2020-21 (13 - 8 goals, 5 assists).\nSam Johnstone became the first West Brom goalkeeper to save a penalty in the Premier League since Boaz Myhill against Manchester United in May 2015.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom are next in action at Leicester on Thursday, 22 April (20:00 BST). Southampton's next match is also against Leicester, on Sunday, 18 April at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final (18:30). Saints' next league game is at Tottenham on Wednesday, 21 April (18:00)."

Had he shown more composure with a first-half effort that was deflected wide or later in the second half the three points would have gone to Graham Potter's side.\n\"In terms of the performance I'm really happy,\" Potter said. \"We were the team closest to winning.\n\"We missed the last pass of that bit of quality in the final third but we are happy with what we have done. It's a hard-earned point and a decent performance.\"\nSeven points from their past four games have moved Brighton clear of trouble. One more win and they will surely be safe. That said, Potter was keen not to take anything for granted.\n\"Everyone is fighting, there's lots of good teams down there,\" he added.\n\"None of them are going to give up, we just have to keep fighting.\n\"You have to be wary of everybody [at the bottom] until it is mathematically possible.\"\nInjury-hit Everton's season is stalling\nEverton started bright enough but regressed, severely lacking the focal point of their top scorer Calvert-Lewin, who was ruled out with an abductor issue.\nThey lacked creativity and were sloppy, with manager Ancelotti looking increasingly frustrated as the ball was repeatedly given away.\nAlex Iwobi flashed a shot over in stoppage time but it would have been an unjust victory had the ball crept below the crossbar.\nA lengthening injury list, worsened when Yerry Mina limped off in the second half, saw defender Mason Holgate start in central midfield and seven members of an eight-man substitutes bench having just two Premier League appearances between them.\nThe loss of important players is a clear factor in a season that is stalling badly.\nA Champions League place looked a real possibility a five weeks ago - the Toffees were fifth, a point behind fourth-placed Chelsea with a game in hand - but Everton have now gone five games without a win in all competitions for the first time since December 2018 under Marco Silva.\n\"I think the attitude of the team was good, the quality of the play was not so good,\" Ancelotti told BBC Sport.\n\"We were affected by the absences. In midfield we only had one attacking player available so we had difficulty building up and reaching our strikers with efficiency.\n\"The attitude and the spirit was good. We defended well, we tried to build-up from the back, but we had difficulty creating chances.\"\n50 up for Ancelotti at Goodison - the best stats\nAgainst no side have Brighton played more home Premier League games without ever losing than against Everton (P4 W2 D2).\nOnly Manchester United (6) have drawn more Premier League matches 0-0 than Brighton (5) this season, while this was Everton's first goalless draw of the campaign, leaving Sheffield United as the only side still yet to play out a 0-0 draw.\nBrighton have kept a clean sheet in five of their eight home Premier League matches in 2021 - no side has kept more home shutouts in the competition since the turn of the year.\nCarlo Ancelotti became the seventh manager to take charge of 50 Premier League games for Everton, with none of those seven bosses losing their 50th league match in charge of the Toffees (W4 D3). Indeed, only Roberto Martinez (89 pts) has won more points from his first 50 Premier League games in charge of Everton than Carlo Ancelotti (78 pts).\nAncelotti has picked up 78 points from his 50 Premier League games in charge of Everton, his lowest return after 50 league matches in charge of a side during his managerial career (previously 89 with AC Milan).\nEverton have won just 25% of their games without Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the Premier League this season (P4 W1 D1 L2), compared to a 50% win rate when he has been involved (P26 W13 D5 L8).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton's next game is on Tuesday, 20 April against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge (20:00 BST), while Everton host Tottenham on Friday (20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-2 Tottenham: Harry Kane scores twice to cancel out Gylfi Sigurdsson's two goals\nHarry Kane suffered a late injury after scoring twice to rescue a point for Tottenham against Everton at Goodison Park.\nNine days before the Carabao Cup final and 58 days before England's European Championship opener, Kane limped off in stoppage time with an apparent ankle problem.\nThe striker seemed to land awkwardly after jumping for a header when defending a corner late on.\nManager Jose Mourinho said he did not know how serious the injury was.\n\"That's also a question I want an answer to as soon as possible but it's too early,\" Mourinho said.\n\"For him to come out it is not because it's nothing, it's something.\n\"We all felt the same fears of something that stops him playing Wednesday [against Southampton in the Premier League] and especially Sunday [the Carabao Cup final] but we will see.\"\nKane had earlier been at his clinical best, capitalising on two mistakes in the Everton defence to put Spurs ahead in the first half and grab a second-half equaliser.\nIn between Kane's strikes Gylfi Sigurdsson levelled from the penalty spot and gave Everton the lead by finishing off a fine team goal.\nEverton pushed hardest for a winner and had the best chance to win it but Joshua King's effort was saved by Hugo Lloris and Richarlison fired the rebound over from 12 yards.\nA draw suited neither side's pursuit of European football, with Tottenham staying seventh, five points behind fourth-placed West Ham and Everton a point and a place worse off, though they do have a game in hand.\nReaction from Everton v Tottenham at Goodison Park\nKane to the rescue but at what cost?\nKane walking gingerly before bending down and holding his right ankle will strike fear into every Tottenham and England fan.\nHe left the field of his own accord but did so immediately and shaking his head.\nKane has suffered a series of ankle injuries in the past which only adds to the concern.\nIn 2018-19 he had two significant spells out with a left ankle injury and in 2017-18 he missed a month with an injury to the right ankle. He also endured separate absences of six and four weeks during the 2016-17 campaign.\nEarlier this season he injured both ankles earlier but ultimately returned sooner than expected.\n\"Obviously it's always worrying when you see him limping because he doesn't fall over easily,\" team-mate Eric Dier told Sky Sports.\n\"He takes a lot of knocks. It's early days to say how bad it is but I'm sure he's a tough boy so will do what he can to be ready.\"\nKane had earlier shown his massive importance to his team once more, slamming home two sharp finishes from his only opportunities in an otherwise underwhelming Spurs performance. He has been involved in 62 goals in 62 appearances under Jose Mourinho.\nHis latest strikes were his 20th and 21st of this season, taking him two clear in the race for the golden boot. They also lifted him into seventh on the all-time Premier League scorers chart, clear of Robbie Fowler and Jermain Defoe.\nMistakes cost improved Everton\nEverton were much improved from their toothless performance in a goalless draw with Brighton on Monday. It was two mix-ups at the back that cost them three points.\nFor Kane's opener Michael Keane misjudged a header and flicked a cross into the Spurs striker's path and the England defender was involved again for Kane's second goal.\nAs a tame cross came in, he headed the ball into his fellow centre-back Mason Holgate and it deflected to Kane in the box. For a second time Kane gave the returning Jordan Pickford no chance.\nThere were positive signs in the rest of Everton's performance, however. They created opportunities despite the continued absence of their top scorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin because of injury.\nSigurdsson's second was a delightful left-footed guide into the far corner from Seamus Coleman's cross after the Ireland international had played a slick one-two with Richarlison.\nEverton also benefited from clumsiness by Sergio Reguilon, who rushed into the back of James Rodriguez to foul the Colombian for Everton's penalty. There was not much contact but enough for the spot-kick to be awarded.\nThe Toffees are now five games without a win in the league but this was a much more promising display.\n\"If we made less mistakes in the box we can win the game,\" manager Carlo Ancelotti said.\n\"It was one of the best performances we have played here at home.

Indeed, Sigurdsson is the third player to score a Premier League double against Spurs having played for them in the competition, after Darren Bent (April 2010, Sunderland) and Matthew Etherington (December 2011, Stoke).\nOnly Alan Shearer (7) and Sergio Aguero (6) have scored 20+ goals in more different Premier League seasons than Spurs' Harry Kane (5 - level with Thierry Henry).\nHarry Kane has been directly involved in 62 goals in 62 appearances in all competitions for Spurs under Jose Mourinho (45 goals, 17 assists) - no Premier League player has more goal involvements in this period (since 23 November 2019).\nWhat's next?\nSpurs play Southampton on Wednesday (18:00 BST kick-off) in the Premier League before their Carabao Cup final against Manchester City at Wembley a week on Sunday.\nEverton's next match is away at Arsenal on Friday, 23 April (20:00 BST).\nShould we eat bacteria?: One simple thing that could improve your life!\nThe Exiles: Why are Hong Kong citizens having to decide whether to move to the UK?"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 3-2 West Ham United: Hosts win to boost hopes of avoiding relegation\nNewcastle took a big step towards securing their Premier League status with a dramatic win against 10-man West Ham.\nIssa Diop's own goal and a Joelinton tap-in had put the hosts in a commanding position at the break.\nHowever, West Ham, who had Craig Dawson sent off for two first-half bookings, drew level from a Diop header and a Jesse Lingard penalty that was awarded after a VAR review.\nBut with the visitors seemingly on top, Newcastle had the final say, substitute Joe Willock heading an important winning goal that lifts Steve Bruce's side up to 15th in the table, with a nine-point cushion to the bottom three.\nWest Ham remain fourth but have now played a game more than fellow Champions League hopefuls Chelsea and Liverpool, who will have the opportunity to leapfrog the Hammers before they play again.\nDavid Moyes' side had arrived in the north-east of England looking for a third consecutive win but were ultimately punished for a sluggish first half in which they conceded twice and had Dawson sent off.\nPrior to his dismissal Dawson's heavy touch saw him clatter Joelinton, allowing the impressive Allan Saint-Maximin to race clear and fire in a shot that Hammers goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and defender Diop contrived to turn into their own goal.\nDawson, who had been booked earlier for a foul on Joelinton, received his second yellow card in the aftermath and was dismissed.\nTo compound matters Fabianski dropped a simple catch from a corner five minutes later to present Joelinton with a tap-in for Newcastle's second.\nHowever, the visitors improved after the break and were unfortunate not to claim a share of the spoils in a thrilling finale.\nSaint-Maximin inspires Newcastle\nSteve Bruce has repeatedly claimed that Newcastle's season may have been on a different trajectory if he had been able to field Miguel Almiron, Saint-Maximin and Callum Wilson on a regular basis.\nAnd while Wilson started on the bench against the Hammers, Almiron and Saint-Maximin were both excellent as the hosts took control of the contest.\nSaint-Maximin in particular provided the thrust to Newcastle's early attacking play, beating opponents at will to create several excellent openings after cutting in from the left flank.\nAnd it was entirely predictable that he would contribute as Newcastle made the breakthrough, accelerating away from Mark Noble, albeit benefiting from some calamitous play from Fabianski and Diop in the process.\nHaving just returned to full fitness Newcastle's biggest concern will be that the Frenchman hobbled off after 64 minutes.\nIn his absence they retreated further and further into their own half, handing West Ham the ascendancy before securing back-to-back league wins for only the second time this season.\nMoyes influences Hammers show of character\nIn the build-up to this encounter Bruce had suggested that Moyes' accomplishments this season were worthy of the manager of the year award.\nAnd when Lingard levelled matters after home defender Ciaran Clark had been penalised for a handball his claim appeared to be gaining yet more weight.\nThe Scot has set West Ham on course for their best Premier League finish ever and whatever he said at the interval clearly inspired a side that had toiled during the first period.\nMaking light of their numerical disadvantage, they displayed excellent character and on another day might have come away with an unlikely point.\nJarrod Bowen, Lingard and Vladimir Coufal all had good sights at goal before Diop headed in to give them further impetus.\nAnd when on-loan Manchester United midfielder Lingard registered his seventh goal in as many games for the Hammers, it seemed as though there would be some reward for their second-half dominance.\nMoyes will now hope they can carry that level of performance forward to next Saturday's potentially pivotal fixture against Chelsea in the race for a top-four spot.\n'There always seems to be a drama' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I couldn't be more pleased with the way we played first half. We had threat, were dangerous every time, we got men forward.\n\"All of the stuff in the first half, we didn't do in the second. It is understandable, you go too deep and we made it comfortable for West Ham.\n\"I had seen the referee running over to have a look and I couldn't understand why. By all accounts it is a penalty. If it is we have to accept it. We tried to change instantly and put two strikers up the pitch. It has paid off.\n\"It was terrific from Saint-Maximin - it is important that he stays well. He has a badly swollen ankle. He is a very very good player.\"\nOn being safe? \"I can't say that. With this club there is always a sting in the tail. There is no disputing it has been a difficult last few weeks but we have lost one of our last seven games and are starting to show that bit of consistency.\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was costly mistakes that can happen in football. We weren't playing badly - a couple of big mistakes gave Newcastle a leg up. We showed great character in the second half, the sad part was the last 10 minutes.\n\"Maybe when it went 2-2 they had no choice but to come out and do something else. At 2-2 I was hoping we would be able to see it out. I thought we played well - we made individual mistakes, got a sending off. It wasn't because we played badly.\"\nNewcastle reach goals landmark\nNewcastle became the eighth side to hit the 800-goal milestone at home in the Premier League (801 goals).\nWest Ham lost for the first time in their 23 Premier League encounters with teams in the bottom half of the table since David Moyes returned to the club (W14 D8).\nNewcastle enjoyed their fifth Premier League double over West Ham (also 1993-94, 1994-95, 2010-11 and 2017-18), something they've done as many times in the competition only against Spurs.\nWest Ham have scored four own-goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other side and the Hammers' joint-most ever in a single campaign in the competition (also four in 2000-01).\nWest Ham's Craig Dawson was sent off for the first time ever in his 345th appearance in English league football.\nThe two occasions in the Premier League this season to see a player score at both ends have come courtesy of West Ham - Issa Diop v Newcastle and Tomas Soucek v Arsenal in March.\nWest Ham's Jesse Lingard has posted his best-ever goal tally in a single Premier League season (nine goals in 10 games).\nJoe Willock has scored three goals in nine Premier League appearances for Newcastle after netting just one in 40 for Arsenal.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Anfield to face Liverpool in their next Premier League fixture on Saturday, 24 April (12:30 BST).\nWest Ham host Chelsea later the same day also in the Premier League (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-0 Sheffield United: Blades relegated after defeat\nSheffield United were relegated to the Championship after Willian Jose's first goal for Wolves secured victory.\nThe visitors knew, following Newcastle's win over West Ham earlier on Saturday, that they had to avoid defeat at Molineux to delay their inevitable demotion for a few days.\nBut it was Wolves who edged a poor game of few chances, when they broke downfield after Enda Stevens' shot had been blocked. Adama Traore created room close to the goalline and delivered a low cross into the six-yard box, which Jose swept home.\nIt broke the Brazilian's Wolves duck in his 11th game for the club, having signed on loan from Real Sociedad in January.\nThe Blades tried to respond and Stevens brought an excellent save from Rui Patricio with a powerful shot from an angle.\nHowever, there was no preventing a relegation that has seemed certain since an abysmal start to the season brought just one point from their opening 13 games.\nAnd at the final whistle, a number of Blades players dropped to their haunches.\nSheffield United's relegation came on the same day that Norwich's immediate return to the Premier League was confirmed.\nInterim Blades boss Paul Heckingbottom believes the club should follow the Canaries' example and keep as much of the squad together as possible.\n\"It has to be the goal to come straight back,\" he said.\n\"This incredible journey started in League One. Look at Norwich, Watford, Bournemouth, who are doing well after they got relegated last season. Keeping the group together has to be a priority.\"\nSad but inevitable end for Blades\nIf it was a night to celebrate for the Wolves goalscorer, there was only more frustration for Rhian Brewster.\nThe 21-year-old arrived amid much expectation from Liverpool at the start of the season but the \u00a323.5m striker is yet to score for the Blades.\nHe never looked like doing so in this game, although in fairness to Brewster, the service he received was inadequate.\nIt can only be hoped his and Sheffield United's confidence can be restored by dropping down a level. Norwich's promotion back to the top flight on Saturday - a year after they were relegated - underlines the potential for clubs going down to return at the first opportunity.\nEvidently, there are issues that need to be addressed at Bramall Lane.\nHeckingbottom has presided over four successive Premier League defeats since replacing Chris Wilder last month. His team have only scored once in that time.\nIndeed, Sheffield United are still one goal short of matching the all-time lowest tally in an English league season - with Loughborough scoring just 18 times in the second tier in 1899-1900.\nThey are also still three short of matching Derby's total of 20 goals from their 2007-08 campaign, which is the fewest in Premier League history.\nOn Friday, chairman Prince Musaad Bin Khalid Al Saud announced he was standing down, leaving another key role needing to be filled. The resolve of owner Prince Abdullah bin Mosa'ad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to drive the rebuild will be tested over the coming months.\nIf there is any consolation from a chronic campaign for Sheffield United fans, it can be found in the difficulties of their great rivals from across the city.\nSheffield Wednesday are also mired in relegation trouble and the Steel City is bracing itself for both senior clubs going down in the same season for the first time.\n\"There's a lot of hurt in that dressing room,\" added Heckingbottom. \"That game encapsulates our season.\n\"Everyone knows and we have to look forward. We have to behave in the correct way, on and off the pitch. Careers are at stake. The fight is there but we have come up short.\"\nJimenez a big miss for Wolves\nBetween them, Wolves and Sheffield United had failed to score in the first half of 47 league games before this meeting, so perhaps it was no surprise the opening period ended goalless.\nThere was an element of fortune about the only time either side even threatened to break the deadlock before half-time.\nWilly Boly seemed to get the ball trapped between his legs following Willian Jose's neat chest control and backheeled it to clear it away. By chance, the manoeuvre sent the ball looping towards goal and had Oliver Norwood not dropped back to the goalline and been perfectly placed to head away, it would have gone in.\nThe lack of goal threat from Wolves merely underlined how badly Mexican forward Raul Jimenez has been missed since he fractured his skull at Arsenal in November.\nWillian Jose received a slap on the back from his manager when he was replaced 12 minutes from time but the 29-year-old is no replacement for Jimenez, who was inspirational in successive seventh-placed finishes for Wolves.\n\"Willian works very hard for the team,\" said Nuno.\n\"He works a lot between the lines. The goal was missing, but today he got the goal and we go from there. The obligation of goalscoring is not just with the strikers.\"\nA top-half finish is the only target they have to aim for now and even that will take some work given Wolves are four points adrift of Arsenal and Leeds, having played a game more.\nStill, there were a couple of milestones to cheer for Wolves, who have achieved back-to-back wins for the third time this season and achieved a top-flight double over their opponents for the first time since 1964-65.\nAnd strangely, all Wolves' six home wins this season have come against teams from London and Yorkshire.\nA record-equalling defeat - the stats\nWith six games remaining, Sheffield United have suffered the joint-earliest relegation in Premier League history, alongside Ipswich Town (1994-95), Derby County (2007-08) and Huddersfield Town (2018-19).\nOnly Sunderland in 2005-06 and Derby in 2007-08 (11 points each) have had fewer points on the board after 32 games in a Premier League season than Sheffield United this term (14).\nWolves have secured their first league double over Sheffield United since the 2013-14 League One campaign.\nSheffield United have equalled their record number of league defeats in a single season (26 - also in 1975-76 and 2010-11), while the Blades have lost 16 Premier League games by a single goal this season, the most one-goal defeats in a single top-flight campaign since Ipswich Town in 1985-86 (also 16).\nAfter a run of 35 Premier League games without a goal or assist, Adama Traore has now scored (one) or assisted (two) a goal in each of his last three games in the competition.\nWhat next?\nWolves are next in action on Sunday, 25 April, when they entertain Burnley (12:00 BST). Sheffield United entertain Brighton on Saturday, 24 April (20:00 BST)."

I don't understand it. I am a little bit confused but we are all confused of late.\n\"We all scratch our heads a bit, people who have played the game for a long time. Whether he [Holding] attempts to go for the ball or not the ramifications of his position affect my goalkeeper.\n\"What is factual for us is we've come to another place and the difference between one point and three points is a decision with the last kick of the game.\"\nThe result leaves Fulham six points from safety but they have played one game more than Burnley - the side directly above them - and two more games than Brighton in 16th.\nOn-loan Bordeaux forward Maja opened the scoring with Fulham's only effort on target after Mario Lemina was fouled by Arsenal's Brazilian defender Gabriel.\nHowever, in a game of few clear-cut chances Arsenal, who remain ninth, merited their point.\nMikel Arteta's side had Ceballos' first-half goal disallowed after Bukayo Saka had strayed fractionally offside, while Gabriel Martinelli also found the back of the visitors' net after the whistle had gone for offside against Emile Smith Rowe.\nSubstitute Nicolas Pepe and Saka also both went close to levelling the score before Nketiah's late intervention.\nReaction from Arsenal v Fulham plus Man Utd v Burnley\nUnpredictable Arsenal\nAfter dismantling Slavia Prague in the Europa League on Thursday, Arsenal did little to dispel the feeling of unpredictability that surrounds them as they faced a team battling the drop.\nOn paper, Arteta would have expected his side to dispatch their struggling opponents with few difficulties.\nBut their up-tempo start, which saw Martinelli twice go close to scoring, soon fizzled out.\nThat allowed the visitors to gain a foothold in the match, although VAR contributed to Arsenal's failure to break the deadlock with Ceballos seeing a header ruled out after Saka was judged to be centimetres offside in the build-up.\nTo their credit, Arsenal persevered after going behind despite seeing Alexandre Lacazette limp off with 20 minutes left.\nAnd a late siege saw Nketiah, Saka, Gabriel and Martinelli all have efforts on goal before their dominance finally told.\nFulham's fading hopes\nWhile Arsenal will be hoping to finish their season with a flourish, Fulham's hopes of survival look more forlorn with each week that passes.\nOrdinarily, a point against opponents they have historically struggled against - losing each of their previous six meetings and conceding 18 goals in the process - might have been viewed as a good return.\nBut their need for maximum points was apparent from the outset, with Fulham arriving at Emirates Stadium on the back of four consecutive defeats.\nWhile Parker's players defended gallantly under some early pressure and then continued until virtually the last kick of the game, they will be frustrated by the way a valuable victory slipped away.\nAnd just as worryingly, they are yet to show they have the firepower to make a real fight of it in their final five games, a run that includes trips to Chelsea and Manchester United.\nMaja's penalty was their only effort on target in a game that saw them muster three shots in total.\nGiven their inability to score, it was all the more mystifying that Aleksander Mitrovic remained on the bench throughout.\nThe Serbia forward has shown in previous campaigns that he has the capabilities to score in the top flight but has started just 12 games this term.\n'It's been painful' - what they said\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We started really well, controlling the game and creating chances, scoring a goal that was disallowed, in a very disappointing way, we kept going and didn't allow any shots on target and suddenly we concede a penalty and the game changes completely.\n\"We took risks in the right way, we could have scored three or four, we totally deserved to win the match but put ourselves in a difficult position.\n\"We have to just focus on the boys playing away in Europe and arriving here with the desire to go all the way to the 97th, 98th minute.\"\nOn Alexandre Lacazette's injury: \"He felt his hamstring so we don't know. We have to rotate players, we have players who didn't recover from the game on Thursday. That is the risk. You cannot change those players every game.\"\nFulham boss Scott Parker, speaking to BBC Sport: \"My team were relentless today with passion and desire. Of course we understand that sometimes you need a bit more than that. We've come to a very good place where they play good stuff and got our noses in front.\n\"I understand that [Saka offside] one. It is factual. I don't agree with it but it is either offside or not offside.\n\"The one that does us I just don't understand. Holding is standing in an offside position. He is two yards away from my goalkeeper and three yards away from the goalline.\n\"We were so close today, so it's been painful. As disappointed as I am now and the team are, we'll wake up tomorrow and we will fight again and keep going. You see a team with effort, desire, with spirit and with that we've got a fighting chance.\"\nFulham's London derby woes - the stats\nArsenal have never lost at home against Fulham in 30 previous competitive meetings (W24 D6), more than they've faced any other side at home without defeat in all competitions.\nFulham have dropped 13 points from winning positions away from home in this season's Premier League, more than any other side.\nFulham remain winless in 23 Premier League London derby matches (D5 L18), although four of their five draws in this run have come this season.\nArsenal's late equaliser means that the Gunners have recorded the exact same points tally after 32 games this season as they had at the same stage last term (46); they last had fewer from their first 32 matches of a league season in 1994-95 (40).\nOnly against Liverpool (seven) have Fulham conceded more 90th-minute goals in the Premier League than they have against Arsenal (six).\nJosh Maja's opener for Fulham was the 87th penalty to be scored in this season's Premier League; no campaign has ever had more penalty goals in the competition's history (level with 2006-07).\nAged 22 years and 112 days, Fulham's Josh Maja was the second-youngest player to score a Premier League penalty against Arsenal, after Daniel Sturridge for Manchester City in November 2008 (19y 82d).\nEddie Nketiah's equaliser (96:09) was Arsenal's latest Premier League goal since January 2017 against Burnley (Alexis S\u00e1nchez in 97:14).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host Everton in their next Premier League game on Friday, 23 April (20:00 BST).\nFulham travel to Chelsea in their next top-flight match on Saturday, 1 May (15:00 BST)."

Bigger leads have been given away.\"\nThe Norwegian first arrived at Old Trafford the summer after Sir Alex Ferguson's outfit had overturned a 12-point deficit to pip Newcastle to the title in 1996.\nSolskjaer's own side trailed leaders Manchester City by 14 points last month but have now reduced that to eight with six games to play - the same advantage United boasted when City fought back to win the title on a dramatic final day in 2012.\nHad United started the season better the title race may have been even closer, with the Red Devils having lost just once in their past 26 league games after slipping to three defeats in their first six.\nThey showed the perseverance and patience needed if they are to mount an unlikely title charge after leaving it late to beat Burnley on Sunday.\nThe club changed the seat coverings at Old Trafford from red to black this week to give a greater contrast to the players' shirts on the pitch but that could not help the hosts in the first half as they lacked fluidity going forward.\nSolskjaer turned to Cavani, in place of Fred, at the break and that extra attacking impetus immediately paid off as Marcus Rashford squared the ball to Bruno Fernandes and the Portugal international cleverly dummied the pass to allow Greenwood to fire beyond Peacock-Farrell.\nThat lead lasted all of 114 seconds as Tarkowski levelled for Sean Dyche's side from a corner and it looked as if United may be frustrated once again by the Clarets.\nBut on 84 minutes Greenwood's deflected effort squeezed into the bottom corner, making him the club's joint-top scoring teenager in the Premier League with 15 goals, alongside Wayne Rooney, and earning praise from boss Solskjaer.\n\"He's mixing up his game. He goes inside and outside, he's maturing all the time,\" said Solskjaer. \"It's lovely to see. He's put the work in on the training ground and reaps the rewards.\n\"I've seen how mature he is on the training ground and he plays with maturity and understanding.\"\nIt was a player at the other end of his career who added gloss to the win, with the experienced Cavani tapping in Donny van de Beek's low pass to seal a victory that sees United match their points tally from last season.\nClarets looking over their shoulder?\nBurnley ended a winless run of 20 matches at Old Trafford with victory in this fixture last season and arrived in Manchester looking to become only the second Premier League side to go unbeaten in five away games there, after Chelsea's run of six between 1994 and 1998.\nDyche's side stifled the hosts in the first half and posed their own threat with Wood, having already had a goal disallowed, heading Matt Lowton's smart delivery wide and then almost turning a dropping ball in at the far post.\nThe visitors produced a superb response to going behind when Tarkowski met Ashley Westwood's corner to head past Henderson as Manchester United conceded their 1,000th goal in the Premier League era.\nBut two late goals mean the Clarets have now picked up just one win in their last nine top-flight games and have lost three in a row, dragging them towards the bottom three.\nFulham's draw at Arsenal means the gap between Burnley and a relegation spot is six points and Dyche will hope that has not narrowed further by the time his side visit Craven Cottage next month.\n'The mentality is strong at Burnley'\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to BBC Sport: \"You never know, anything can happen in either box. Any time they get a cross in with their quality you've got your heart in your mouth. We built some pressure, especially down the left, wanted to do the right things and we got the goals we wanted.\n\"We knew there'd be long balls, win the first one, win the second one and stop the ball into the box. The delivery was great and we had to work hard again.\n\"We will keep concentrating on what we're doing and keep winning. Keep the momentum going.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"The energy and shape of our side was good. You have to get that right at these places. We were pretty tidy with our defending apart from a couple of moments.\n\"I thought we asked questions and created some really good moments. We were in the game and threatening on the break. We were chasing the game after that and left ourselves exposed.\n\"The mentality is strong here, you can see that from the players.\"\nOn their relegation battle: \"Brighton are there as well - it seems like you never mention them. We've worked hard for everything we've had in the Premier League.\"\nThe stats - Cavani the super sub\nManchester United have won 19 of their 32 Premier League games this season, one more than they managed last season.\nThey have won five league games on the spin for the first time since Solskjaer's first six league matches in charge.\nBurnley have lost three Premier League games in a row for only the second time this season, and for the first time since their opening three games of the season.\nSince the start of last season, Greenwood has scored more top-flight goals as a teenager than any other player within the top five European leagues.\nTarkowski's goal for Burnley was the 1000th Premier League goal Manchester United have conceded, the 11th different team to ship as many since the competition formed in 1992.\nSince his maiden Premier League campaign in 2012-13, Burnley's Ashley Westwood has assisted 16 Premier League goals from set-plays, the fourth-most over this period behind Christian Eriksen (24), Chris Brunt (24) and Gylfi Sigurdsson (20).\nOnly Javier Hernandez (five in 2010-11) and Ole Gunnar Solskaer (five in 1998-99) have scored more Premier League goals as a substitute in a season for Manchester United than Edinson Cavani's four this campaign.\nWhat next?\nBurnley visit Wolves next Sunday at 12:00 BST, with Manchester United travelling to Elland Road to face Leeds United on the same day at 14:00."

Even if it does not start next season, Uefa has said it could ban the clubs - including six English sides - from European competition for their defection.\nThere was a strange mood around the first game involving any of the 12 teams since Sunday night's announcement, with protests inside and outside the ground.\nFans of Leeds and other clubs gathered outside Elland Road to stage a protest - during which a Liverpool shirt was burned - and a plane flew over the stadium displaying an anti-Super League message.\nInside the stadium Leeds players wore T-shirts saying 'Earn it' next to the Champions League logo and 'Football is for the fans'. A banner behind one goal had the same message.\nLeeds left the shirts in Liverpool's dressing room too, in case they wanted to protest - a move that annoyed Reds boss Jurgen Klopp, who said he does not like the idea of the ESL but that he and his players had no say in it.\nLiverpool dominated the first half and went ahead when Trent Alexander-Arnold latched on to Diogo Jota's fine pass and squared it to Sadio Mane to slot into an empty net after Illan Meslier had rushed out of goal.\nThat was his first Premier League goal since January, a run of 10 games.\nLeeds improved after the break and Patrick Bamford hit the crossbar before Llorente headed in his first goal for the club.\nRelive the action at Elland Road\nReds remain outside European places\nLiverpool stay sixth after this result. Were they to occupy that position at the end of the season, they would not even finish in a European place, unless one of the domestic cup winners also finish in the top five.\nBut if the Super League does happen, the Reds would no longer need to worry about such things.\nLiverpool were the dominant force in the first half especially, with Thiago Alcantara forcing a save from distance and Roberto Firmino shooting straight at Meslier before the goal.\nLeeds battled back in the second half but Liverpool had two great chances to win it - shortly before the equaliser when substitute Mohamed Salah dragged a shot wide and then in the final minute when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was denied by Meslier.\nLiverpool's immediate future, though, is more likely to be decided off the pitch, rather than in a game at Elland Road against an English side not in the 'big six'.\nLeeds again prove a match for Europe's elite\nLeeds followed up last weekend's victory over champions-elect Manchester City with a dramatic draw against the title holders. Next up is old rivals Manchester United as they navigate a sequence of testing fixtures.\nThe hosts were not at their busy best in the first half - although Bamford was denied by Alisson after some poor goalkeeping - but they dramatically improved after the break.\nBamford clipped a clever first-time shot over Alisson that came off the crossbar, and Jack Harrison was denied by the goalkeeper at his near post.\nLeeds got the goal they deserved when Llorente nodded in Harrison's corner for a first goal in English football.\nUnited sit 10th in the Premier League, eight points behind the automatic European places. Although if six teams above them suddenly became ineligible, they would be in the Champions League spots.\nMatch stats - Leeds reach 50-50 goal mark\nLeeds have won just one of their last 12 home games against Liverpool in all competitions (D4 L7).\nLiverpool have dropped 13 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, two more than they had over the last two campaigns combined.\nLeeds have both scored and conceded 50 goals in the Premier League this season (32 games), with only Tottenham in 2007-08 doing so in fewer matches in a campaign in the competition (30).\nLiverpool's possession figure of 38.8% was their lowest in a Premier League game since November 2018 (38.2% vs Arsenal) - a game that also finished 1-1.\nSome 75% of Sadio Mane's Premier League goals this season have come away from home (6/8).\nEight of Trent Alexander-Arnold's 31 Premier League assists for Liverpool have been for Mane, at least three more than he has provided for any other player.\nDiego Llorente's equaliser was his first goal in his 10th Premier League game for Leeds, and his first goal overall since July 2020 for Real Sociedad at Villarreal.\nWith two attempts, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah became the second player to record 100 shots in the Premier League this season (101 in total), after Harry Kane (117).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool host Newcastle in the early Saturday game (12:30 BST), while Leeds' tough run continues with a home game against Manchester United at 14:00 the following day.\nFlames on the Frontline: Big Narstie explores the impact of the Brixton Riots\nIs knowingly spreading an infectious disease a crime?: Find out on the Bad People podcast"

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: Hosts held on dramatic night for European football\nChelsea shared a goalless draw with Brighton to climb into the Champions Leagues places on a night where the future of European football came to a dramatic head.\nThe fixture was almost a side note, with the news breaking before kick-off that Chelsea were preparing to pull out of the European Super League at the same time as their fans were protesting the club's inclusion outside Stamford Bridge.\nThe Blues' notice of withdrawal was followed by that of Manchester City, with the other four English clubs later joining them as the controversial new competition unravelled just 48 hours after the 12 clubs involved unveiled their proposals.\nWith the current Champions League admitting sides on merit, Chelsea will need to finish among the top four in the English top flight, or win the competition, to qualify for a spot among Europe's elite next season.\nThe Blues created little but a point was enough to see Thomas Tuchel's side take up the last of those automatic places, going above London rivals West Ham, who they face on Saturday.\nIt was in fact Brighton who enjoyed the best chances late on as first substitute Adam Lallana fired wide before Danny Welbeck struck the post from distance.\nDefender Ben White was then sent off for the visitors in stoppage time for a second booking as Chelsea looked to break away.\nThe draw moves Graham Potter's side seven points above the Premier League relegation zone with six games to play.\nFollow reaction to Chelsea v Brighton\nBlues distracted by off-field drama?\nThe drama started long before kick-off in west London as around 1,000 Chelsea fans gathered outside the stadium in protest at plans for a new European Super League that has been met with widespread condemnation.\nBlues goalkeeper Petr Cech, now the club's technical and performance advisor, could be seen pleading with the crowd to disperse so the team coaches could enter the ground, which led to the game being delayed by 15 minutes.\nIt was not long before news began filtering through that Chelsea were in fact preparing documentation to withdraw from the proposed competition and that was met with cheers by those still gathered in the area.\nIt is reported the decision was taken by owner Roman Abramovich and the Chelsea board after witnessing negative global reaction to the Super League, rather than a direct response to the protests.\nChelsea boss Tuchel said beforehand it was an \"annoying and frustrating\" distraction for his side as they looked to build on the momentum gained by reaching the Champions League semi-finals and FA Cup final in the past week.\nAnd there was no escaping it during the warm-up as Brighton players donned T-shirts reading \"Football is for the fans\" and 'Champions League: Earn it\" on them.\nThe off-field drama did not translate on to the pitch as sides with the two of the best recent defensive records in the Premier League struggled to pick holes in each other.\nA long-range Kurt Zouma effort that Robert Sanchez saved comfortably was the best Chelsea could muster before the break, while Yves Bissouma's deflected effort that looped over the crossbar was as close as Brighton came.\nTuchel's concerns appeared to be coming to fruition with Zouma's attempt one of just three in the first half for the Blues, their fewest in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game since managing only one against Liverpool in September.\nIt was a similar pattern after the interval, with a disciplined Brighton keeping their shape well and stifling any probing attacking moves from the hosts.\nTuchel introduced Callum Hudson-Odoi and Timo Werner with just over 20 minutes to go in an attempt to stretch the Seagulls, with Olivier Giroud following soon after.\nBut it was the visitors who enjoyed the best opportunities as first Lallana shot wide after Chelsea gave the ball away on the edge of their own box and then Welbeck whipped a superb effort against the post.\nTuchel's changes did have some impact as Giroud turned a Hudson-Odoi cross wide and the winger was then brought down by White, as he earned a second yellow card in the 92nd minute.\nIt was a 15th clean sheet in Tuchel's 20th game in charge of the Blues, who have lost only one of their 13 Premier League games since the German's arrival.\n\"I was affected so I think the players were affected,\" he said afterwards. \"We talk of nothing else but Super League before the match. Nobody asked about the match before.\n\"It is like this. You have to accept the distraction. We tried to create an atmosphere to win the game but could not.\"\nBrighton, meanwhile, have won just two of their past 10 league matches, but victory at Sheffield United on Saturday would all but secure their top-flight status for another year.\n'We looked mentally tired'\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We are disappointed. We wanted to have the win and know how crucial these moments are. We wanted to be in a place number three after this game.\n\"We did not make it and were lucky not to lose. We made big mistakes, looked tired, mentally tired. We did not deserve to win which is maybe for the first time since I come here.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We could have won it - we hit the post. We started well, but a couple of errors gave them some chances, but I felt we had the bigger chances in the second half. Our boys were fantastic, and it shows that we are fighting for every point.\n\"We've got so many games to play and we're not thinking about anything other than we need to fight for every point and every game. Nobody gives you anything in this league. We need to fight for it and respect it.\"\nOn the European Super League: \"It has been disturbing, sad and frustrating. It feels like the game has been attacked and the integrity of the game in this country and across Europe. It is about having your fate sorted on the pitch.\"\nThe stats - Tuchel's Chelsea proving frugal\nBrighton have kept 11 clean sheets in the Premier League this season, with eight of those coming since the turn of the year - their best return in a top-flight campaign since 1981-82 (14).\nSince winning promotion in 2017, Brighton have drawn more Premier League games 0-0 than any other side (17), including each of their last two.\nThey have also picked up 12 red cards, with only Arsenal (14) and Leicester (13) suffering more in that time.\nThe Seagulls have now registered six goalless draws this season, more than in any of their previous Premier League campaigns.\nOf managers to oversee 10+ Premier League games in charge of Chelsea, only Glenn Hoddle (1.2) and Ian Porterfield (1.1) have posted a lower goals per game rate in the competition than Thomas Tuchel (1.3 - 17 goals in 13 games).\nTuchel's Chelsea side have conceded just 0.62 goals per game in the Premier League (eight in 13), the second-best ratio of any Blues boss to oversee 10+ games after Luiz Felipe Scolari (0.6 - 15 in 25 games).\nChelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga has kept five clean sheets in a row in all competitions for the Blues, as many as he managed in his previous 18.\nWhat next?\nChelsea visit West Ham on Saturday (17:30 BST), while Brighton head to Sheffield United later that evening (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Southampton: Bale and Son score as Spurs fight back\nSon Heung-min's late penalty capped a Tottenham fightback against Southampton that handed interim head coach Ryan Mason victory in his first match in charge.\nFormer Spurs midfielder Mason, the Premier League's youngest head coach at the age of 29, succeeded Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese was sacked on Monday.\nHe made a winning start to his tenure after Gareth Bale curled in a superb equaliser and then a late VAR intervention saw Son convert after a Moussa Djenepo foul on Harry Winks was shown to be just inside the penalty area.\nUntil Bale's composed finish on the hour mark the hosts had been second best to a slick Southampton side who went in front when Danny Ings glanced in James Ward-Prowse's corner.\nWith Harry Kane missing and still a doubt for Sunday's Carabao Cup final, Spurs were flat for long periods and appeared to have been affected by their tumultuous few days, with Mourinho departing fewer than 24 hours after the club announced they were to join a new European Super League.\nChairman Daniel Levy has since expressed regret over the \"anxiety and upset\" caused by the proposal, which has now collapsed following widespread condemnation.\nSigns of that backlash were evident prior to kick-off as groups of Spurs supporters gathered outside their club's stadium calling for Levy and owners the ENIC group to leave the club.\nDespite the unrest and an unsettling start to the week, this result moves Tottenham up to sixth - two points outside the top four - while the Saints remain 14th in the table.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nSpurs bounce back\nAlready out of the Europa League and having collected just five points from the last 15 available, Spurs came into this match in acute need of a victory to boost their hopes of finishing in the top four.\nWhile they eventually got a result that suggested an immediate bounce from their managerial change, there was little urgency to their play in the first half and Mason will know a similar lethargy will be more heavily punished against Manchester City this weekend.\nIn fact, only the excellence of Hugo Lloris prevented the hosts from falling behind inside three minutes, with the France goalkeeper repelling Mohammed Salisu's header and reacting superbly to push Che Adams' follow up to safety.\nKane's absence also meant there was a distinct lack of leadership as well as cutting edge, despite Bale's reintroduction to the starting XI for the first time in over a month.\nThat lacklustre opening 45 minutes was epitomised by a wild Lucas Moura effort just before the break that flew well over the bar and ensured Spurs ended the first half without registering a shot on target in a top-flight home game for the first time this season.\nThey improved after the break and looked to have found a winner after 75 minutes when Son stroked home Sergio Reguilon's cut back.\nHowever, a VAR review concluded Moura had obscured the view of Saints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy from an offside position, but Son and Spurs were not to be denied with the South Korean making no mistake from the penalty spot in added time.\nSaints falter at the last\nWhile Southampton appeared weary in Sunday's defeat to Leicester City, they quickly dispelled any ideas they might be suffering from a post FA Cup semi-final hangover.\nBrimming with energy and benefitting from five changes made by boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, the Saints took control early on.\nNathan Tella's marauding run and cross from the left set the tone and should have been rewarded by an opening goal from either Salisu or Adams.\nJames Ward-Prowse, who drove his side forward at every opportunity, was the busiest player on the pitch as he covered nearly 12km, while Kyle Walker-Peters and Stuart Armstrong were also industrious.\nBut an evening that had started so promisingly began to go wrong after Ings appeared to tweak his hamstring attempting to curl a shot past Lloris.\nThe sight of Southampton's top goalscorer limping off was an invitation for Spurs to push forward, take control of the match and ultimately take all three points.\n'Win important for many reasons' - what they said\nTottenham interim manager Ryan Mason speaking to Sky Sports: \"Fantastic - so proud of the boys. They had so much energy and bravery, especially after the first 20 to 30 minutes. Southampton came out of the blocks - they were good. We showed belief and stuck to the plan so full credit because the energy and commitment was great.\n\"Southampton built up momentum and Hugo [Lloris] pulled out some excellent saves early on. We had full control second half and we were creating chances.\n\"At half time it was about giving the players confidence. We've only had a short amount of time but for me the biggest thing was commitment, energy and bravery to do good things and express ourselves and take risks at times.\n\"Tonight was important for many things, the change in manager, a lot has gone on at the club in the last 48 hours and it was important to get back to winning ways. The performance and energy were outstanding.\"\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hassenhuttl speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I can't say we had less energy than on Sunday. We still had a good game but were better today with the ball, we had a clearer plan and we had more movement and more chances. In the first half we had chances for three goals and scored one. It's not enough to score one goal because we always concede one - clean sheets are missing. The way we defended was not good enough.\n\"We have eight substitutes and normally should be able to replace him [Danny Ings] but today we couldn't really push our game with the subs and the opponents were stronger.\n\"If it's a foul it was a penalty. But I have seen the same thing in first half in the middle of the pitch and we didn't get a foul. It's hard to take but we have to.\"\nSaints' stuttering form - the stats\nRyan Mason (29y 312d) became the youngest manager in Premier League history, while he is only the second person since the Football League resumed in 1946-47 to manage a top-flight game while in their 20s after Frank Sibley, whose first game was in August 1977 vs Aston Villa, also at the age of 29, as QPR boss.\nAfter losing each of the previous six Premier League games in which they found themselves behind at half-time this season, Spurs have won a top-flight match from such a position for the first time since December 2019 (2-1 vs Brighton).\nSince the day following Southampton topping the Premier League table for the very first time (November 7th), only Sheffield United (13) have won fewer points in the division than the Saints (P24 W5 D5 L14 - 20 points).\nSouthampton have now dropped more points from winning positions than any other Premier League team this season (21).\nAs a Southampton player, Danny Ings has scored more goals against Tottenham than he has versus any other side (six). Since he joined the Saints in 2018-19, no player has more top-flight goals versus Spurs than the Englishman (five, alongside Roberto Firmino).\nIn Premier League history, only Matt Le Tissier (63) has more assists for Southampton than James Ward-Prowse (28) - this season alone he has delivered more assists via set-pieces than any other player (six).\nGareth Bale has had a direct hand in 11 goals in his last 11 starts in all competitions for Tottenham (nine goals, five assists), while he's scored in each of his three Premier League games against former club Southampton.\nTottenham's Son Heung-min has scored 15 Premier League goals in 2020-21, his best goalscoring season in the competition. His five goals against Southampton this season is the most by a player against a single side since Mohamed Salah v Watford in 2017-18 (also five).\nWhat's next?\nTottenham face Manchester City in the EFL Cup final on Sunday, 25 April (16:30 BST) before resuming Premier League action against Sheffield United on Sunday, 2 May (19:15 BST).\nSouthampton are next in action when they host Leicester in the Premier League on Friday, 30 April (20:00 BST)\nThe dark side of betting: Meet the man who stole millions from work to sustain his gambling habit\n'Food is more than calories': Different strategies to help you achieve a healthy weight"

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 1-2 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola's side eight points from Premier League title\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola said the failed European Super League (ESL) was a \"closed chapter\" after his side beat Aston Villa to move closer to becoming Premier League champions.\nCity were one of 12 clubs to sign up to the breakaway ESL on Sunday, but withdrew on Tuesday after widespread criticism of the proposals, which would have seen no promotion or relegation and a split in English football.\n\"As a club we accept and learn and focus on the reason why we're here,\" said Guardiola, whose side need eight points from five matches to become English champions for the third time in four seasons.\n\"It's a chapter which is over, a closed chapter. They [the owners] don't need to apologise [to me], I know them, I know how they are.\"\nCity's win leaves them 11 points clear of Manchester United with Guardiola saying his side were \"so close\" to the title.\nHowever, they had a scare when centre-half John Stones was sent off just before the break for a knee-high challenge on Jacob Ramsey.\nBut Villa wasted the man advantage when Matty Cash was dismissed 11 minutes into the second half following two bookings in the space of three minutes.\nThe hosts had earlier gone ahead after only 20 seconds as John McGinn guided a shot past Ederson following Ollie Watkins' low cross.\nThe impressive Phil Foden finished off a fine City team move to equalise before Rodri headed what proved to be the winner following Bernardo Silva's cross.\nCity led 2-1 when they went down to 10 men, but Villa could not capitalise on the extra player and then offered little threat when it was 10-a-side.\nRelive Aston Villa v Manchester City as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nA bad day for Stones, but his red does not cost City\nStones has been in fine form this season, making more Premier League appearances than he managed in 2019-20, with his performances earning an England recall after 16 months out of the national side.\nHowever, with Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate in the stands, it was an evening to forget for the 26-year-old.\nHe was caught out in the first few seconds of the match when he failed to collect a long ball from England team-mate Tyrone Mings, enabling Watkins to set up McGinn for the joint quickest Premier League goal of the season.\nStones was then shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge on Ramsey near the halfway line and in front of the two dugouts.\nAfter a check by the video assistant referee Jarred Gillett, on-field referee Peter Banks watched the incident on a pitchside monitor and showed the red card to Stones, although Guardiola was unhappy with the decision and remonstrated with the officials.\nStones will be suspended for Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley as City, who are also in the Champions League semi-finals, aim to pick up the first of a potential three trophies this season.\nWith a man advantage, Villa's Douglas Luiz curled a 25-yard effort straight at Ederson but the match swung back in City's favour following two Cash challenges on Foden, the second of which was a sliding challenge that wiped out the England midfielder close to the touchline.\nFrom then on City were able to dominate possession and now only need three more league wins to become English champions for the seventh time in their history.\nFoden shines as football returns to normal\nThe build-up to the match at Villa Park had been dominated by talk of the European Super League.\nCity were one of six English teams - along with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham - to join three sides from Spain and three from Italy in the proposed new closed competition.\nHowever, Sunday's announcement, brought widespread criticism and anger from fans, managers, other clubs and politicians, with Guardiola himself saying football \"is not a sport if success is guaranteed or if it doesn't matter when you lose\".\nCity were one of the first to announce their withdrawal from the ESL on Tuesday evening and there was no repeat of the protests that had seen angry fans demonstrating before Liverpool's match at Leeds on Monday, Chelsea's home game versus Brighton on Tuesday and Tottenham's encounter with Southampton earlier on Wednesday.\nThis was a game that again highlighted the exciting and thrilling nature of the Premier League and City's play after going a goal behind was a joy to watch.\nTheir equaliser started with goalkeeper Ederson knocking a fine 50-yard ball to the left wing where Olexandr Zinchenko played it to the superb Foden. The 20-year-old drilled a low pass to Riyad Mahrez and the Algerian released the overlapping Silva on the right flank and his pull-back was steered into the net by Foden.\nThe second goal was another well-worked one as Rodri powerfully headed in from another Silva assist.\nNot only have City scored the most goals in the Premier League, they also have the best defensive record and successfully managed to stifle Villa in the second half to take a big step towards another title.\nAfter the match, City boss Pep Guardiola said of Foden: \"This guy is growing. His influence in our games is massive. He's becoming a serious player.\n\"Phil right now is becoming such an important player. His influence in the final third is so important.\"\n'They schooled us' - what they said\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We made a great start. It was something we had spoken about. We have one of the best players in the league who can run in behind the oppositions defence in the shape of Ollie Watkins.\n\"We defended reasonably well. It was probably the manner of the goals we conceded that was most disappointing. Cashy will learn from that. The second [booking] was stupid and reckless.\n\"Some of Manchester City's play play was outstanding. They schooled us at times.\n\"I've been involved in professional football for 34 years and I haven't seen football come together like it has this week. That shows you how outraged people were at the [ESL] plans.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"Not the start I dreamt of but we reacted very well, we played so good with and without the ball. Ten against 11, we reacted well, we played so good.\"\nOn John Stones' red card: \"He's late but the intention to kick him is not there, he wouldn't go there with intention, he's not aggressive with the feet, he's just late. It's tough, playing a lot of minutes, good learning for him. Even with 10 men we played good, when we had the ball we played good.\"\nOn distraction of Super League: \"After that game it doesn't look like it did distract us, we were focused, of course everyone was concerned, but the players were focused on this game. We are so close. Cup final and Champions League and then Crystal Palace.\"\nAnother away win for Manchester City - the stats\nManchester City have won each of their last 10 Premier League away games, becoming the first team to win 10 in a row on the road in the competition on more than one occasion (won 11 in a row between May-December 2017).\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith has lost all five games against Man City during his managerial career - the most games he has managed against a single opponent losing 100% of those matches.\nVilla have lost nine of their last 11 Premier League games against the league leaders, with those defeats coming by an aggregate score of 24-6.\nCity won a Premier League game having conceded the first goal for the first time since December 2019 versus Leicester (3-1), ending a run of 10 games without a win when conceding first (drew three, lost seven).\nCity's Bernardo Silva has provided more Premier League assists in 2021 than any other player so far in this period (six - twice as many as the Portuguese assisted throughout 2020 in the top-flight (three).\nCity's John Stones was been sent off for the first time in his Premier League career, in what was his 182nd appearance in the competition. It was only the sixth foul he had conceded in the league in 20 games this season.\nNo player has scored more goals in all competitions before turning 21 for Pep Guardiola than Manchester City's Phil Foden (29 - level with Bojan).\nVilla's John McGinn's goal after 20 seconds was the second quickest goal Manchester City have conceded in Premier League history, after Alan Shearer's for Newcastle United after 10 seconds in January 2003.\nWhat's next?\nCity play Tottenham at Wembley in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday (16:30 BST), before Villa take on West Brom in a Premier League match later that day (19:00).\nThe dark side of betting: Meet the man who stole millions from work to sustain his gambling habit\n'Food is more than calories': Different strategies to help you achieve a healthy weight"

They are as good as the top boys.\"\nHow Leicester's win over West Brom unfolded\nRelentless Leicester round off memorable week\nAfter booking their place in the FA Cup final on Sunday, Leicester could not have finished the week in better fashion.\nThey looked eager to get on the front foot from the off - carving West Brom's defence apart with through balls from Youri Tielemans and driving runs from Vardy and Castagne.\nIheanacho and James Maddison both had chances in the opening 10 minutes, before Tielemans eventually played in Castagne and he put it on a plate for Vardy to thump in.\nWest Brom defender Dara O'Shea's last-ditch tackle on Iheanacho prevented an immediate second for Leicester but the reprieve was short-lived as Evans then nodded to make it 2-0 within three minutes of Vardy's opener.\nStriker Vardy turned provider when he skipped past his opponent and teed up Iheanacho for Leicester's third.\nThat goal came after West Brom's Pereira and Leicester's Castagne had both hit the woodwork, and there could have been another goal for Iheanacho before the break but he lashed it over from six yards out.\nThe relentlessness of Leicester's attack in the first half did the damage, and they still enjoyed plenty of space in the second half - Iheanacho seeing a shot blocked by O'Shea in the box and a free-kick palmed away by goalkeeper Sam Johnstone, while Vardy's long-range chip sailed wide.\nRodgers was also able to bring off Maddison, Vardy and Wesley Fofana with Monday's game against Crystal Palace in mind.\nBaggies' 'great escape' all but over\nBack-to-back victories against Chelsea and Southampton had given West Brom a glimmer of hope in their fight for safety during a week when Sheffield United's relegation was confirmed.\nAllardyce named the same side that beat Southampton, but the contrast in performance was stark.\nLeicester overwhelmed West Brom from the opening minute and they were unable to recover from a first half that could have seen more goals going the hosts' way.\nPereira's corner skimmed the crossbar, Mbaye Diagne completely fluffed a chance on the edge of the box and Matt Phillips' strike was straight at the goalkeeper in a game of few chances for West Brom.\nSubstitutes Semi Ajayi, Hal Robson-Kanu and Karlan Grant also failed to make an impact in the second half and Leicester coasted to victory.\nIt means any chance of a great escape for West Brom is all but over - they have 18 points to play for but they have only picked up 24 so far this season.\n'Leicester tore our defence apart' - what they said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers to BBC Sport: \"In the first half I wasn't happy at all. We weren't precise enough with our passing. In the second half we controlled the game.\n\"Overall, I'm really pleased as a win in the Premier League is always huge. We were good but we can be much better. It was always going to be a big test. We have to control ourselves and our own performance.\"\nWest Brom manager Sam Allardyce to BT Sport: \"Leicester were far too good for us, in the first half particularly. We tried to look after their front two and one of the main reasons for our recent results has been our defensive solidarity. Leicester tore it apart. We couldn't cope with them.\n\"It was a respectable second half but we didn't get much at the other end. In the end we thoroughly deserved to get beat. You have to get the basics right and those basics deserted us. We need to win five out of six to have a sniff [at staying in the Premier League]. We'll give it our best shot.\"\nVardy back on the score sheet - the best of the stats\nLeicester have 59 points from their 32 Premier League games this season; in their top-flight history, only in 1962-63 (63, adjusting to three points/win) and in 2015-16 (69) have they had a better tally from their opening 32 matches to a campaign.\nWest Brom have conceded 62 Premier League goals this season; across Europe's top-five leagues in 2020-21, only Crotone (80), FC Schalke 04 (76) and Parma (66) have shipped more league goals.\nLeicester have won each of their last three Premier League games against West Brom, each by a margin of at least three goals. It's only the fourth time in their top-flight history that they have won three consecutive league matches against an opponent by 3+ goals, and first since April 1966 against Fulham.\nVardy scored his first goal in 12 appearances for Leicester City in all competitions, ending his longest run without a goal for the club since December 2016 (16 apps).\nSince Vardy's Premier League debut in August 2014, only Harry Kane (193) and Sergio Aguero (157) have been directly involved in more goals in the division than the Leicester striker (153 - 116 goals, 37 assists).\nEvans' goal came 181 seconds after Vardy had opened the scoring for Leicester; it was his first Premier League goal since December 2019 against Aston Villa.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday, 26 April (20:00 BST), while West Brom travel to Aston Villa on Sunday, 25 April (19:00).\nA football club bought back from the brink: The rocky story of Derry City is streaming now\nMeet the Queens: Catch up on all of RuPaul's Drag Race on iPlayer now!"

Leno should have scooped it up, but the ball slipped through the Arsenal keeper's hands, hitting his leg on the way in.\nThat was a rare moment of goalmouth action on the night as Everton won at Arsenal in the league for the first time since 1996.\nGylfi Sigurdsson came closest before that when his 30-yard free-kick hit the bar.\n\"It was really important to stay attached to the top of the table,\" Ancelotti told BBC Sport. \"The performance was good. It's all good news tonight and this gives us confidence for the next games.\n\"Finally I can say we are back.\"\nArsenal were awarded a penalty in the second half after Richarlison nicked Dani Ceballos - but it was overturned by the video assistant referee for a Nicolas Pepe offside in the build-up.\nGunners boss Mikel Arteta said: \"We were the better team but there are certain decisions that we can't control.\n\"To disallow a penalty 15 seconds before - [we had] eight or nine touches [after Pepe was offside] - I saw it 10 times and I don't get it. It can be taken the way they want. Zero control. Somebody has to explain that.\"\nGabriel Martinelli almost saved Arsenal in injury time but Jordan Pickford kept out his shot.\nLeno also came up for a late corner but could not make amends for his costly error.\nWho can qualify for Europe this season?\nFootball Daily podcast: Super League sanctions and Mason's Wembley dream\nCan this bit of luck boost Everton's season?\nEverton's win against the team just below them in the table comes at an absolutely key time.\nThe Toffees had failed to win in their past six games in all competitions, removing any real room for error as they push for a Champions League place.\nThis win keeps them eighth in the league but they are now within three points of Chelsea and West Ham, who are fourth and fifth respectively and play each other on Saturday.\nThey only had one chance on target at Emirates Stadium - although their goal did not come from it.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin went close on his return from injury in the second minute but headed wide.\nRicharlison forced a low save from Leno, with Calvert-Lewin inches away from getting to the rebound.\nSigurdsson's fantastic free-kick off the top of the bar looked like it was going to be their best effort until Richarlison's low ball somehow slipped through Leno's grasp. A VAR check confirmed the Brazilian - who got past Granit Xhaka easily in the build-up - was onside.\nArsenal distracted by protests or Europe?\nArsenal's chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League now rely on winning this year's Europa League - they sit nine points behind the European places in the Premier League, while the first leg of their Europa League semi-final is at Villarreal on Thursday.\nThey were without forwards Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang because of injury and illness on Friday night and had to arrive at the ground early to avoid the protests.\nArteta said: \"We need to go through the disappointment and focus our energy. The semi-final is more than crucial for us. I don't want to use any excuses, I understand the protests.\n\"On the pitch performance-wise we were the better team, we controlled the game and we had some opportunities and openings.\"\nThey played some nice football against Everton but did not fashion many clear-cut chances.\nBukayo Saka shot straight at Jordan Pickford and the Everton keeper kept out Dani Ceballos' 20-yard drive.\nThey thought they had a penalty when Ceballos was felled but Pepe's arm was offside in the build-up so it was overturned.\nEven after Leno's moment to forget they had a chance to rescue a late point - as they had done against Fulham in their previous game - but substitute Martinelli was denied by Pickford.\nMatch stats - yet another Arsenal blank\nArsenal suffered their first Premier League defeat at home to Everton since January 1996 (2-1), ending a run of 24 such games in the competition.\nEverton completed their first league double over Arsenal since the 1985-86 season, having won 2-1 at Goodison Park back in December.\nThe Gunners have lost seven games at the Emirates in the Premier League this season; their most home defeats in a league campaign since 1992-93 (also seven).\nOnly Manchester City (12) have won more away games than Everton (10) in the Premier League this season, while this is the first time since 1986-87 that the Toffees have won 10 away games in a single league campaign.\nThis was the 200th top-flight meeting between Arsenal and Everton, becoming just the third fixture in top-flight history to have been played on 200 occasions (also Aston Villa v Everton and Liverpool v Everton, both 204).\nArsenal have failed to score in eight Premier League games at the Emirates Stadium this season, twice as many as in the previous four campaigns combined.\nArsenal conceded an own goal in both meetings with Everton in the Premier League this season - the third time they have done so home and away against an opponent in the same campaign (also v Liverpool in 2011-12 and Chelsea in 2008-09).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal visit Villarreal on Thursday in the Europa League semi-final first leg and go to Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday.

Surely they are safe?\nBruce has been heavily criticised for his approach throughout his time in charge and Newcastle's defensive, containing 5-4-1 shape had no immediate effect as Salah crashed in following Ciaran Clark's poor clearing header.\nBut in Allan Saint-Maximin the visitors had the game's most lively attacker and he carried a threat single-handedly for most of the match.\nJoelinton then could, maybe should have equalised but Alisson kept out his effort before Wilson scrambled in at the second attempt. But the ball did hit his arm and VAR ruled it out.\nMany teams would have crumbled at such late disappointment so all credit to Newcastle for going again, and Willock was sure in his finish as he drilled in via a deflection from 10 yards out.\nMilner's new record - the stats\nAfter a run of eight defeats in 10 league games, Newcastle have lost just one of their past eight in the Premier League (W2 D5).\nDespite conceding a 90th-minute equaliser, Liverpool extended their unbeaten home run against Newcastle in the Premier League to 25 games (W20).\nLiverpool have kept just three home clean sheets in the Premier League this season, conceding at least once in each of their past eight at Anfield in the competition.\nAt 94 minutes and 58 seconds, Joe Willock's equaliser for Newcastle was the latest goal Liverpool have conceded at Anfield in a Premier League game since exact goal times have been available (2006-07).\nNewcastle's Joe Willock became the first player to score a 90th-minute equalising or winning Premier League goal against Liverpool at Anfield since Harry Kane for Spurs in February 2018.\nMohamed Salah's strike after two minutes and 59 seconds was Liverpool's earliest home goal in a Premier League game since April 2019, when Naby Keita scored after 15 seconds against Huddersfield.\nLiverpool's James Milner made his 159th appearance as a substitute in the Premier League, overtaking Peter Crouch as the all-time record holder for sub appearances in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool have the small matter of a trip to Old Trafford next Sunday to take on Manchester United, while Newcastle welcome Arsenal on the same day.\nAre you a pub quiz whizz?

To arrive with the confidence and the trust in ourselves that we can perform in these matches is a good feeling.\"\nIn a tightly-fought contest against West Ham, Werner, who has struggled to make a significant impact since joining for \u00a347m last summer, started and finished the move that sealed the points.\nThe Germany forward fired home from Ben Chilwell's cross after a well-worked move involving Christian Pulisic, Werner's sixth Premier League goal since arriving from RB Leipzig.\nWest Ham struggled to create chances and finished the game with 10 men after Fabian Balbuena was shown a straight red card in the 81st minute after catching Chilwell's leg with his follow through while making a clearance.\nReferee Chris Kavanagh watched a replay on the pitchside monitor before dismissing the Paraguay defender for serious foul play.\nWest Ham remain fifth in the table, three points behind Chelsea, after Liverpool's failure to beat Newcastle earlier on Saturday.\nIn what was billed as a huge game in the race for the top four, West Ham were hoping to deliver a victory for the underdog at the end of a week when the so-called \"big six\" tried to break rank and join the European Super League.\nDavid Moyes' side have enjoyed a fine run of form to raise hopes they could secure a Champions League spot.\nHowever, they did not register an attempt on target until after half-time as Chelsea extended their unbeaten run away from home under Tuchel to 10 games in all competitions.\nWest Ham wanted a penalty when the game was goalless after Tomas Soucek's shot struck Cesar Azpilicueta in the torso before hitting his arm, while Werner missed a glorious chance to double the lead after Mason Mount's shot was parried into his path.\nReaction from West Ham v Chelsea plus Saturday's Premier League latest\nMoyes upset with Balbuena red card\nAbramovich 'regrets' ESL involvement\nPerfect start to a big week\nThis was the perfect start to a testing week for Tuchel's men as they opened up a three-point cushion between fourth and fifth spot in the table.\nHaving gone from the high of beating Manchester City to book an FA Cup final appearance, they were held by lowly Brighton as their fans made their feelings clear outside Stamford Bridge about Chelsea's planned participation in the European Super League.\nThey put that flat performance behind them, Chelsea doing enough to secure the points against West Ham before Tuesday's huge Champions League game.\nWerner has had his critics but he produced a big shift which he capped with a smart finish and has now been directly involved in more goals than any other Blues player in all competitions this season (11 goals, 9 assists).\nEven before his goal he was lively although he was fortunate his second-half miss, when Lukasz Fabianski palmed Mount's attempt straight to him, did not prove costly in the end.\nChelsea were ninth in the table when Tuchel took charge in January but the FA Cup finalists now have a clear advantage in the race to finish in the top four.\nTheir success under the German boss has been based on strong defensive foundations and this was their 10th top-flight clean sheet in 14 games since Tuchel arrived.\nHammers fall short\nWest Ham's charge for a place at the top table of Europe's most prestigious club competition has been one of the feel-good stories of the Premier League season.\nWith five matches to go, including games with struggling Southampton, Burnley, Brighton and West Brom, they will not give up the chase easily.\nThis was a chance to deliver a significant blow to one of their rivals but Moyes' side came up short, although their cause was not helped by the controversial decision to send Balbuena off.\nIt was checked by VAR before the referee was urged to see the replay himself, the whole episode lasting a couple of minutes before Balbuena was finally dismissed.\nAfter Craig Dawson was sent off at Newcastle last week, West Ham have had a player dismissed in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since August 2015.\nThe Hammers have played some delightful football this season and Jesse Lingard has been in exceptional form.\nThey managed just two attempts on target against the second meanest defence in the league, Lingard going close to equalising with a dipping shot which fell just wide of Edouard Mendy's post.\nDespite defeat, the Hammers, who were once again without Declan Rice, Michail Antonio and Arthur Masuaku, will go into the final month of the season with a real chance of securing a place in Europe.\nAfter last season's brush with relegation, that is a remarkable achievement.\n'It's never a red card'\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer, speaking on Match of the Day\nWhere is he meant to put his foot? What I would say about this is Chris Kavanagh, the on-field referee, he's got to get that right. Then Peter Bankes [video assistant referee] tells him he should go to the screen and have a look at it. He should say 'no, I'm not having that, I'm not accepting that it is a red card Peter Bankes.

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 1-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: David McGoldrick winner punishes wasteful Seagulls\nDavid McGoldrick said Sheffield United's players are fighting for their futures at the club after he scored a winner which earned the Blades a first victory since manager Chris Wilder's departure last month.\nMcGoldrick's seventh goal of the season gave caretaker head coach Paul Heckingbottom his first three points and kept wasteful visitors Brighton looking nervously over their shoulders.\nThe hosts, whose own relegation was confirmed by defeat at Wolves seven days earlier, handed a glimmer of hope to the other sides in the bottom three as McGoldrick punished poor Brighton defending.\n\"We are playing for Sheffield United, we can't down tools. Every game we have to make it tough, we are playing for our shirt and playing for our future,\" the Blades forward told BBC MOTD.\nFollow reaction from Sheffield United v Brighton and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\n\"We showed we are still in this as a team, even though we have been relegated.\n\"The pressure is on until the end of the season. We know there is a new manager watching somewhere, we are fighting for this club and we want to be at this club.\n\"There will be changes and, me personally, I don't want to be one of them.\"\nBrighton, meanwhile, remain seven points clear of 18th-placed Fulham and 10 above West Bromwich Albion, in 19th, with five games remaining but missed the chance to virtually seal their safety at Bramall Lane.\nAdam Webster's heavy touch triggered a swift break from the hosts and Joel Veltman compounded the error with a poor clearance from Ben Osborn's cross as a ricochet off Pascal Gross fell perfectly for McGoldrick to swivel and score.\nThe Seagulls' best openings fell to Neal Maupay, who was twice brilliantly denied by Aaron Ramsdale and hooked over a great chance from close range, while a Jakub Moder strike was ruled out for offside by the video assistant referee.\nVAR shows its value as Seagulls squander again\nWhile VAR was once again maligned in Saturday's earlier two Premier League games at Anfield and London Stadium, there were no arguments with its deployment or accuracy at Bramall Lane.\nThe officials missed that Poland midfielder Moder was coming back from an offside position as he turned home a loose ball from a corner but the movement was picked up in Stockley Park.\nIt would not have mattered had Brighton converted one of the many other chances they frittered away as they once again failed to turn pressure and domination into goals again.\nMaupay was the chief culprit, denied one-on-one by Ramsdale in the first half and shooting over the bar from inside the six-yard box after the break, even if Alireza Jahanbakhsh's cross was slightly behind him.\nAdam Lallana, Danny Welbeck and Yves Bissouma also spurned presentable chances, while Jose Izquierdo, making a first appearance in almost two years after knee problems, was thwarted by Ramsdale late on.\nThe Seagulls should have enough points to survive but their failures against the sides below them - Brighton have failed to win any of their eight games against the bottom four - leave them with a nervy run-in against teams all in the top half.\nMcGoldrick strikes gold again for Blades\nThe performances of veteran Republic of Ireland striker McGoldrick have been one of few positives for the Blades this season and the 33-year-old continues to demonstrate improvement.\nHe took 26 games to open his top-flight account last term but has increased his 2019/20 tally of two to seven this season, including Saturday's predatory strike.\nMcGoldrick's perseverance will offer encouragement to \u00a323.5m strike partner Rhian Brewster, who is yet to score for the Blades but played a part in the winner by harrying Gross into an error.\nThe victory owed chiefly, however, to a resilient rearguard display from the hosts, who recorded only a third league clean sheet of the campaign.\nThey stood firm in the face of unyielding Brighton pressure in the second half to claim just a fifth Premier League win of the season and a first on a weekend, the other four having all come in midweek.\nThe Blades still have plenty of pride to play for, hoping to avoid breaking the record of defeats in a Premier League season which stands at 29, with United on 26.\n'Justice for their attitude' - what they said\nSheffield United interim boss Paul Heckingbottom: \"The players deserve the utmost credit. We spoke before the game and for them it's justice and the right result for their attitude because its been a tough, tough season.\n\"You get what you deserve in football and we got the three points. We've said all season we have been on top in lots of games but haven't got the goal. To get the first goal was a big difference.\n\"We know we are a Championship club next season. It doesn't mean we're not going to enjoy these last few games. We might be planning for next season but we're looking to pick up points along the way.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's a frustrating result. The performance wasn't probably the level it has been recently.\n\"We didn't have the quality we can have. When that happens in the Premier League it can be hard. We had some opportunities but it is up to us to do better. It was up to us to create more.\nOn his side's seven-point safety cushion: \"It's not enough because there's a lot of points to play for. We have to just focus on one game at a time. Every opponent is fighting for something.\"\nSeagulls struggle against strugglers - the stats\nBrighton have won just four of their 25 Premier League games against sides in the relegation zone (16%) - the lowest win rate of any club in the competition.\nSince beating Tottenham and Liverpool in back-to-back Premier League games in January and February, Brighton have only won two of their past 11 league matches (D4 L5).\nSheffield United have only lost one of their past 12 league meetings with Brighton (W7 D4) and are unbeaten against them in the Premier League since they returned to the top flight in 2019 (W2 D2).\nDavid McGoldrick has scored 39% of Sheffield United's goals in the Premier League this season (7/18); the highest percentage of any player for his team in the competition.\nSheffield United's opener was McGoldrick's seventh goal in the Premier League this season - the most by a Blades player in a top-flight campaign since Rob Hulse in 2006-07 (8).\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United visit top-four hopefuls Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, 2 May (19:15 BST), while Brighton host Leeds United a day earlier on Saturday, 1 May (15:00 BST).\nAre you a pub quiz whizz?

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-4 Burnley\nBurnley took a huge step towards retaining their Premier League status as a first-half Chris Wood hat-trick saw them thrash a lifeless Wolves at Molineux.\nAn awful display from the hosts was ruthlessly exposed by the Clarets, who produced an excellent performance to end a run of three straight defeats in style.\nSean Dyche's side are now nine points clear of Fulham and the relegation zone with 15 to play for and the long-serving manager can surely start planning for a sixth consecutive season in the top flight.\nWood was superb throughout but was also gifted his chances by a Wolves display that was worryingly half-hearted and reeked of the end of a season marooned in mid-table.\nStrike partner Matej Vydra saw his effort ruled out by the video assistant referee for offside but there was still time for a fourth as Ashley Westwood thumped in from the edge of the area.\nGet reaction and follow text commentary of Sunday's games here\nBrilliant Burnley take chances\nDyche was at pains in the build-up to this match to once again point out the lack of money he has had to reinforce his squad - and that staying in the Premier League for another season would be no mean feat.\nHe looks set to achieve that goal after his settled group delivered one of their most accomplished away performances in recent years.\nFrom the first minute, the Clarets were far more aggressive than Wolves, pushing the hosts back, and it was not long before Wood had them ahead.\nCentre-back Willy Boly had already got away with one error when he inexcusably allowed a straight ball over his head, Wood twisted England defender Conor Coady inside out and arrowed a low shot across goal and in.\nSix minutes later Wolves winger Adama Traore played a sloppy pass on the edge of his own area, Dwight McNeil anticipated the error and ran through to square the ball and give Wood a tap-in in the middle.\nAnother excellent cross from the left was volleyed over by Vydra as Burnley piled on the pressure, and the third goal did come before the break when Wood was left free to powerfully head in McNeil's inswinging corner.\nThe Clarets have dropped 13 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season but that never looked likely and Vydra - who rounded Rui Patricio expertly to score but was just offside - and Matt Lowton were close to extending the lead before Westwood rounded things off.\nWood was provider this time, teeing up the former Aston Villa midfielder to hammer in from 20 yards.\n\"I've been sleeping all right,\"said Dyche. \"I don't tend to worry too much. It's a season's work.\n\"It's how you end up in the season and our focus has to be the next game. We go into the next one and work really hard to try and get more points on the board.\"\nWorrying signs for woeful Wolves\nIt might be a bit obvious to suggest that Wolves, in no danger of either relegation or competing for a European place, looked like ideal opposition for Dyche's hungry visitors. It is also true.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side were awful throughout - second to every header and tackle, slack at the back and impotent in attack.\nAfter two excellent seasons that both produced seventh-placed finishes Wolves have hit a wall this season. The losses to injury and rivals of Raul Jimenez, Diogo Jota and Matt Doherty have been seismic, with little sign yet that their replacements are up to the task.\nThat trio, after all, scored 28 Premier League goals last season. The whole team has mustered 32 so far this term. They never looked like troubling Nick Pope and will have to serve up a much better showing against local rivals West Brom next Monday night.\n\"So many things went wrong. Many, many things,\" Nuno said.\n\"There are not many explanations for such a bad performance. We defended badly, very bad. We allowed Burnley to get into the game, we were not practical, we lost second balls and we were always under pressure and never comfortable.\"\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy was damning in his post-match appraisal on BBC One.\n\"That was 90 minutes of bang average football from Wolves,\" he said.\n\"Normally you get it for 30 minutes, maybe a half where you're off it. But in the second half there was no reaction. Show some passion, show some pride.\"\nBest since 1965 - the stats\nBurnley completed their first top-flight double over Wolves since the 1956-57 campaign, although the Clarets (7th) finished below Wolves (6th) in the table that season.\nBurnley registered their second away win by a margin of three or more goals in the Premier League this season (also 3-0 Crystal Palace in February) - the first time they've recorded two such away victories in a single top-flight campaign since 1965-66.\nWolves' loss was their heaviest home Premier League defeat since March 2012, when they lost 5-0 to Manchester United.\nBurnley registered their biggest away win in the English top-flight since a 4-0 victory over Sunderland in November 1965.\n63% of Dwight McNeil's Premier League assists have been for Chris Wood goals (10/16); of all players with at least 15 assists in the competition, McNeil has the highest percentage for one team-mate.\nChris Wood became just the third player to score an away first-half Premier League hat-trick after Chris Sutton for Blackburn vs Aston Villa in August 1997 and Michael Owen for Liverpool vs Newcastle in August 1998.\nWhat next?\nWolves have the chance to put things right and push rivals West Brom closer to the drop when they meet on Monday 3 May, while Burnley host West Ham on the same evening.\nAre you a pub quiz whizz?

        "article_text": "Leeds United 0-0 Manchester United: Red Devils held to Elland Road stalemate\nMarcelo Bielsa says his Leeds side are evolving as a Premier League force by learning from past errors against the top flight's elite after holding Manchester United to a goalless draw at Elland Road.\nSunday's stalemate continued Leeds' fine run of results against teams in the top six since the turn of the year, having won at Leicester and leaders Manchester City, as well as holding Chelsea, Liverpool and, now, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United.\nThey have conceded just three times across those five games, a stark contrast to the opening months of the season when they shipped goals in thrilling but gung-ho fashion, losing 4-3 at Anfield, 4-1 to Leicester and 6-2 at Old Trafford.\n\"In the game we defended well. We couldn't attack how we wanted to. Even if we didn't dominate, we avoided the game becoming unbalanced. There are signs of evolution,\" Bielsa told BBC Sport.\nFollow reaction from Leeds v Man Utd and Sunday's other Premier League games\n\"The group of players have constructed a solid group. Throughout this time they made errors and have learned how to correct them.\n\"In the same way, they learned to avoid errors that are avoidable. I have the feeling there has been a growth in their maturity in how to manage these games.\n\"Clearly at this moment we cannot go into the games to dominate them and think we can win while dominant.\n\"But the capacity for the players to go up against these very good players has also increased. We can impose ourselves on defences and can avoid being overcome by attackers of the highest level.\"\nThe result means Manchester City will be crowned Premier League champions next weekend if Pep Guardiola's side beat Crystal Palace on Saturday and second-placed United lose at home to Liverpool on Sunday.\nUnited boss Solskjaer praised the hosts but felt his side were unfortunate not to come away with all three points after creating the game's clearer chances.\n\"I have not seen many teams dominate in the second half the way we did against Leeds - they steamroller teams but I felt we steamrollered them,\" Solskjaer told BBC Sport.\n\"Today we just didn't have the moment, didn't take them when we had them. A draw is disappointing because we wanted to put pressure on City.\"\nOff-field issues overshadow on-pitch action\nIn a game of few chances, Marcus Rashford came closest with a free-kick just before half-time.\nBut memories of a forgettable encounter on the pitch will remain because of off-field issues.\nA plane trailing a banner proclaiming '2bn stolen - Glazers out' flew over Elland Road just before kick-off but Red Devils boss Solskjaer insisted that had no effect on his players' performance.\n\"I wasn't aware and I don't think any of the boys have seen that. We have focused on the game, of course it was a difficult week,\" the Norwegian told BBC Sport.\nThat the banner was not set up by any of the organised Manchester United supporter groups just underlines the strength of feeling created by this week's European Super League controversy, fuelling an already negative view of the club's American owners.\nAs one of England's biggest clubs themselves, Leeds will be satisfied at extending their run of home draws against 'Big Six' opposition to five, with only Tottenham left to come.\n'Betrayed' - visitors made aware of ESL feelings\nThe visitors were spared the uncomfortable welcome and intense atmosphere normally associated with this fixture but the passions stirred by the thwarted European Super League breakaway were difficult for them to ignore.\nA banner, pinned to a railing outside the ground, bore a lengthy statement, which started with the words 'Don't let them threaten or bully you any more' and demanded action against the six clubs.\nThe match programme included columns from manager Bielsa and skipper Liam Cooper, which both condemned the plot.\nChief executive Angus Kinnear called it a 'betrayal of every true football supporter' but warned it would be 'na\u00efve to believe the threat has been extinguished forever' and that while 'this week's battle against elitism may have been won, the ongoing war needs to be relentlessly and vigorously fought'.\nWith the banner against the Old Trafford ownership being trailed as well and the Leeds owner Andrea Radrizzani, plus director of football Victor Orta sporting large white roses - the symbol of Yorkshire - in their lapels, there was enough spice even without the presence of supporters.\nUnited executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who was heavily involved in Super League discussions but was prompted to hand in his resignation due to his dislike of the proposals, was also absent.\nIt was a surprise therefore, that the contest began in such a lacklustre manner.\nNot until the final minutes of the opening period did a breakthrough seem possible, when Illan Meslier tipped a goal-bound Rashford free-kick over and Harry Maguire nodded the resulting corner wide.\nThe second period was more even at least and Helder Costa drove a low cross along the six-yard area before his shot deflected off Victor Lindelof and looped over.\nBut goalmouth action was rare and treats even fewer. Indeed, arguably the highlight was seeing Fred and Maguire having a go at each other during a break in play.\nSolskjaer defended both, saying: \"We have a group that demands a lot of each other - the standard is high both in training and in games, it is not just about being a nice guy. We demand maximum effort.\"\nThe result leaves United needing four points from their remaining five games to confirm a place in next season's Champions League.\nRed Devils kings of the road despite draw - the stats\nManchester United are unbeaten in their past 24 Premier League away games (W15 D9), with only Arsenal between April 2003 and September 2004 (27) having a longer such run in English top-flight history.\nLeeds had only six shots in this match, their joint-fewest in a league game at Elland Road under Marcelo Bielsa (also six against Barnsley in July 2020).\nManchester United have drawn seven league games 0-0 this season - only in 1980-81 (8) have they been involved in more goalless draws in a single league campaign. United have the most goalless draws of any side in the Premier League this season.\nManchester United's Luke Shaw has created 11 chances in his last two league games; in 2021 he has created the most chances of any player in the Premier League (50).\nHarry Maguire (10) is only the third Manchester United player to be shown 10+ yellow cards in a single Premier League campaign, after Steve Bruce in 1994-95 (11) and Luke Shaw in 2018-19 (11).\nWhat's next?\nLeeds' next game is at Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday, 1 May (15:00 BST).\nManchester United are next in action in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final against Italian side AS Roma at Old Trafford on Thursday, 29 April (20:00 BST).\nTheir next Premier League game is against Liverpool, also at Old Trafford, on Sunday, 2 May (16:30 BST).\nAre you a pub quiz whizz?

I'm really pleased with the response to the Leicester disappointment.\n\"The lads showed real spirit after a dodgy start. Apart from the last seconds it all worked extremely well.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"I think it was the least we deserved, it would have been a travesty if we had been beaten.\n\"We were the aggressors. I'm still wondering why the penalty was given against us.

We showed we can be a team when Jack [Grealish] is not playing.\"\nMore saves than anyone else - the stats\nIncluding nine in this game, West Brom's Sam Johnstone has made 137 saves in this season's Premier League, more than any other goalkeeper.\nAnwar El Ghazi has scored five goals against West Brom in all competitions, at least three more than he has against any other opponent in his time at Aston Villa.\nTyrone Mings' own goal was Aston Villa's first of the season, and 47th overall in their Premier League history.

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-1 Crystal Palace: Foxes win to move closer to Champions League qualification\nLeicester City moved closer to Champions League qualification as they came from behind to beat Crystal Palace.\nWilfried Zaha put the visitors ahead after only 12 minutes, with a first-time finish following a fine through ball from Eberechi Eze.\nBut Timothy Castagne equalised for the Foxes within five minutes of the second half by firing the ball into the roof of the net after being set up by Kelechi Iheanacho.\nPalace nearly retook the lead but a superb sliding challenge from Jonny Evans denied Christian Benteke what would have been a tap-in into an unguarded goal.\nThat missed chance proved crucial as Iheanacho scored his 12th goal in nine games, when he cut inside on to his left foot and blasted the ball past goalkeeper Vicente Guaita for a late winner.\nThe result leaves the Foxes third in the Premier League, but takes them seven points clear of fifth-placed West Ham with five matches to go.\n\"It's a massive three points for us and we were nervous a bit,\" said Iheanacho.\n\"We changed it around and got control of the game and got them running. But there's still a lot of work to do, we can't talk about the Champions League until the last game.\"\nLeicester, who have also reached the FA Cup final for the first time since 1969, have only played in the European Cup or Champions League once, reaching the quarter-finals in 2016-17 after winning the Premier League the previous season.\nTheir run-in includes games against Manchester United in second, Chelsea in fourth and Tottenham in seventh.\nHow has Iheanacho become so prolific?\nRelive Leicester v Crystal Palace as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n'Evolved' Leicester on course for Champions League\nAfter 33 matches of the league campaign, Brendan Rodgers' side again find themselves third, just as they did in 2019-20.\nHowever, last season they lost three of their final five games as they finished fifth to miss out on a top-four spot by four points.\nBefore the game, Rodgers said his side had improved and \"evolved\" compared to a year ago, but would have been worried by old concerns and a lacklustre first half performance.\nBut it was an instant improvement after the break as Castagne's first goal at the King Power Stadium made it 1-1 following fine hold-up work from the impressive Iheanacho.\nThe Foxes ended strongly as Jamie Vardy, who had missed two chances when it was goalless, had a shot blocked by Guaita, fired just wide and had a goal correctly disallowed for offside.\nYouri Tielemans also missed the target when well placed but they finally got their second when Iheanacho produced some fine skill to get the ball on to his left foot and gave Guaita no chance from 10 yards.\nThe victory means Leicester, who were not one of the 'big six' English teams to sign up to the European Super League before the tournament plans collapsed two days later, now need three more wins to guarantee Champions League football.\nPalace's season ending tamely\nPalace stay 13th, but are 11 points clear of the relegation zone and surely safe from avoiding a drop into the Championship.\nBut Eagles' fans may be left ruing what might have been from this season after they were seventh following eight matches, only three points off the top.\nInconsistent form and a run of injuries have severely damaged their hopes of a top-half finish for the first time since 2014-15 and they have now only picked up six points from their past seven matches.\nThey had not been in action since 10 April, while Leicester had played three matches in that period, including an FA Cup semi-final win over Southampton to set up a final against Chelsea next month.\nPalace boss Roy Hodgson said before the game he was unsure whether the break would have benefited his team, although they made a great start, scoring early on.\nBenteke dispossessed Tielemans with a strong challenge on the halfway line, Eze had the quality and pace to run at the home defence, before sliding a perfectly-weighted pass into Zaha's path with the Ivorian slotting the ball past Kasper Schmeichel.\nAfter conceding, the visitors had a glorious chance to retake the lead as Jairo Riedewald was through on goal but opted to pass it square to Benteke and that enabled Evans to make a fine challenge to deny the Belgian.\nBut Iheanacho's late goal saw Palace leave empty handed as their season is ending in tame fashion.\nPalace's poor run against top-six sides continues - the stats\nLeicester have picked up 62 points from their 33 Premier League games this season, only managing more at this stage of a top-flight campaign in 1962-63 (66) and 2015-16 (72).\nCrystal Palace have not won any of their last 18 league games against sides starting the day in the top six in the table (drew five, lost 13), since beating fifth-placed West Ham 2-1 in October 2019.\nLeicester have picked up 19 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, a figure only Manchester United can better (28).\nCrystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha has been involved in seven goals in his last seven Premier League appearances against Leicester, scoring six and assisting one.\nOnly Harry Kane (14), Dwight Yorke (eight) and Andy Cole (seven) have netted more Premier League goals against Leicester than Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha (six).\nEberechi Eze registered an assist for the first time in 10 Premier League appearances, with the midfielder now joint-top for assists in the competition this season among Crystal Palace players (four, level with Andros Townsend).\nLeicester's Timothy Castagne scored just his second Premier League goal in 22 games, netting for the first time since his first appearance in the competition in September v West Brom.\nKelechi Iheanacho has either scored (12) or assisted (two) in eight of his last nine appearances for Leicester across all competitions.\nOnly Harry Kane (18) has registered more goal involvements than Kelechi Iheanacho (16 - 14 goals, 2 assists) among Premier League players in all competitions in 2021.\nKelechi Iheanacho has netted 14 goals in his last 14 appearances for Leicester in all competitions, as many as he managed in his previous 76 games for the Foxes.\n'I thought we'd see the game through' - what they said\nLeicester City manager Brendan Rodgers to BBC Sport: \"It was a very important win for us. It was the third game in nine days so a tough schedule.\n\"Going one behind against a Roy team, they're super organised and tough to break down. I thought the players were outstanding. They kept the calmness and control and scored two very good goals.\n\"[Scoring early into the second half] definitely helps. It sets us up. It settled us. We could then control the rest of the game.\n\"[Iheanacho's goal was] incredible. Great pass by Jonny [Evans]. We told the strikers to find space in between the centre-backs and full-backs. It was a great ball into space. The skill to turn and finish quickly, a wonderful goal. It capped off a great night for him.\n\"The top priority for me as a coach is helping players to develop. it's been difficult for Kels because of the style we normally played which was one striker - Jamie Vardy. We had to change it round with injuries, he's come in and been exceptional. Not just his goals. He's so happy to work hard for the team and his quality is phenomenal.\"\nOn any fears of them tailing away like last season: \"We spoke about it at the start of the season and put it to bed then. Our performance levels this season have shown that's in the past.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson to BBC Sport: \"I thought for long periods we were going to get at least a point. At half-time I thought we might go on to win.\n\"Leicester scored quickly after the break but after that we looked as though we were seeing the game through reasonably well. Kelechi Iheanacho's quick turn and strike is difficult to defend. Objectively I didn't think it was a bad performance. Had we got a good result I don't think people would have begrudged us.\"\nOn whether his players might lose focus with little on the line: \"I don't fear that because I know the players. That's not the kind of group we are. I don't think anyone who watched the game could accuse us of not doing our utmost.\n\"If we hadn't conceded the goal so early in the second half, our confidence would have been high. The equaliser came too early after half-time. We didn't get enough time to enjoy the fact we were leading. I honestly thought we'd see the game through... but I was wrong.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester play at Southampton on Friday (20:00 BST), a fixture the Foxes won 9-0 in 2019-20 when they equalled the record for biggest victory in Premier League history.\nCrystal Palace entertain league leaders Manchester City on Saturday (12:30 BST).\nTea or coffee?: Which one do you prefer and is it the healthier choice?\nWould you crowdfund your rent?: Meet the young people having to find inventive ways to stay afloat"

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-1 Leicester: 10-man Saints frustrate Foxes' Champions League push\nSouthampton held Leicester to a draw despite playing more than 80 minutes with 10 men to frustrate the Foxes in their push to clinch a top-four finish.\nJannick Vestergaard was controversially sent off after just 10 minutes when his tackle on Jamie Vardy was deemed to have denied the Leicester striker a goal-scoring opportunity.\nVestergaard, on the edge of his box and the last defender, got the ball with a lunging tackle but referee Robert Jones deemed his follow-through on to Vardy's ankle had prevented the striker running in on goal.\nThat decision set the game's pattern, Leicester probing while Southampton defended deep, but it was the Saints who took the lead in the 61st minute.\nJames Ward-Prowse scored from the penalty spot after Kelechi Iheanacho had blocked Stuart Armstrong's effort with his arm raised up by his head.\nJonny Evans headed in Iheanacho's cross eight minutes later for the equaliser but under near-constant pressure Southampton's defence held firm.\nGoalkeeper Alex McCarthy brilliantly denied Vardy with his right boot from close range in the final 10 minutes.\nThe point takes Leicester eight points clear of fifth-placed West Ham having played a game more but they have a difficult end of the season to come.\nSouthampton edge 10 points clear of the relegation zone as they close in on guaranteeing their safety.\nReaction from Southampton v Leicester\nLeicester frustrated on south coast\nThe point takes Leicester closer to their goal of securing Champions League football next season but, having played against 10 men for so long, they should have ended the night with a 10-point cushion over fifth place.\nWilfried Ndidi dragged a shot wide from the edge of the box and Iheanacho came agonisingly close to meeting Marc Albrighton's cross in the closing stages.\nBefore Evans' equaliser, however, they had had created little despite dominating possession.\nWith Southampton in a defensive mindset visiting manager Brendan Rodgers replaced defender Wesley Fofana with forward Ayoze Perez at half-time but many of his side's 22 shots came from long distance.\nIt was Iheanacho, who has been Leicester's star in attack with 12 goals in nine games, who foolishly closed down Armstrong's shot with his arm raised for Southampton's penalty. He did at least redeem himself with a fine left-footed cross for Evans' equaliser.\nLeicester are still in a fantastic position for a top-four finish but their slump at the end of last season, plus the fact they have trips to Manchester United and Chelsea to come as well as a game against Tottenham on the final day, means Champions League qualification is not yet certain.\nSouthampton show much-needed resilience\nFor Southampton this was a morale-boosting result coming in a difficult run that had seen them lose 12 of their past 15 games.\nAfter the early loss of Vestergaard some might have feared a repeat of the 9-0 loss to Manchester United earlier this season when they went a man down early - or the defeat by Leicester last season by the same scoreline.\nInstead, they produced an admirable defensive display that left manager Ralph Hasenhuttl visibly pleased at full-time.\nVestergaard made a mistake with an initial loose touch but his dismissal was harsh.\nThe centre-back clearly made contact with the ball before catching Vardy, admittedly making strong contact with the striker's ankle.\nIt was deemed by referee Jones that his follow-through had prevented Vardy running on to the deflected ball, a decision confirmed by the video assistant referee, but Vestergaard's touch had diverted it back towards goalkeeper McCarthy, who said afterwards he thought he would have reached the ball first.\n'Not a red card' - manager reaction\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl to BBC Sport: \"Big credit. We can discuss the red card and for me how we bounced back was amazing. They had 80 minutes to score against us. The goal we conceded, but the rest was really well defended around the box.\n\"Jannik Vestergaard has a bad touch and then plays the ball back to the keeper. The official explanation was it was 100% goal chance - for me Jamie Vardy never had the ball because the keeper was there.

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-2 Man City: Pep Guardiola's side close in on Premier League title\nManchester City could clinch the Premier League title on Sunday after two goals in the space of 83 seconds saw off a stubborn Crystal Palace.\nCity will secure a third title in four seasons if second-placed Manchester United lose at home to Liverpool.\nAfter a scrappy first half at Selhurst Park, Sergio Aguero thumped City ahead with a clinical finish before Ferran Torres drilled in a low shot.\nThat ended the resistance of Palace, who stay in 13th place.\nRoy Hodgson's side had chances in the first half through Christian Benteke, who flicked a header wide and had a close-range shot blocked by City keeper Ederson.\nBut once City made their breakthrough when Aguero smashed high into the net, quickly followed by Torres' precise finish, the result was not in doubt.\nNow it is a question of when, not if, Pep Guardiola's side will be crowned champions again after relinquishing the crown to Liverpool last season.\n\"We can start to put the champagne in the fridge - not to open yet, but to think about it,\" said Guardiola, whose side moved 13 points clear of United.\n\"The Premier League is already there - it is in our hands. We need one more victory, two more points.\"\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action live\nWhen can Man City win the title?\nAguero inspires City once again\nNot for the first time, but perhaps the last, Aguero provided the inspiration for City as they close in on another trophy.\nThe 32-year-old Argentine will leave when his contract expires at the end of the season after playing such an instrumental role in their success since arriving in 2011.\nWhile he might no longer be deemed by Guardiola as a key starter in City's biggest games, there was a sense of inevitability that Aguero would still have a significant impact in their chase for the Treble as his iconic spell at the club comes towards an end.\nPlaying slightly deeper behind Gabriel Jesus, Aguero was at the heart of City's brighter attacking moments in a first half when they lacked quality in the final third of the field.\nYet they had not managed a shot on target until the ball came into the Palace box from the left and Aguero took a deft touch to create space and blast a powerful shot into the roof of the net.\nIt was a reminder of the quality he still possesses, which is leaving the leading clubs in the world reportedly eyeing a move for him in the summer.\n\"I'm so happy because it has been a long time since I played 90 minutes and the goal was good because maybe we can win the Premier League,\" said Aguero, who said he did not know if he will watch United's game against Liverpool.\n\"Always I'm ready. I am feeling good. I always want the opportunity to play like today.\"\nCity round off a wonderful week\nAs far as weeks in the world of football go, City have enjoyed one which could not have been more perfect.\nStarting on Sunday when they won the Carabao Cup final against Tottenham, and continuing on Wednesday with the impressive victory at Paris St-Germain in the Champions League semi-final first leg, Guardiola's squad perfectly rounded off a pivotal week.\nWith the second leg coming up on Tuesday, Guardiola shuffled his team by making eight changes and they initially lacked rhythm against a well-drilled Palace side.\nAfter Jesus saw a close-range finish ruled out for offside, City went into the break having failed to manage a shot on target in the first half for the first time in 21 matches.\nPatience and second-half improvement had been the key to the win in Paris and so it proved again.\nGuardiola's demeanour was buoyant and relaxed after securing a vital win, having been able to rest key players and seemingly avoiding picking up any injuries.\nNow he switches focus to completing the job against PSG on Tuesday and taking City into their first Champions League final.\n'What a man, I am in love as a person' - reaction\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"Unfortunately we were playing against a team with so much technical ability. You have got to work so very hard to keep them at bay.\n\"The first goal was just a fantastic pass, control and shot.\n\"After all the good work you've done to keep them at bay, you're then looking at 1-0 to Man City and you know you've got to work hard to score a goal or two.\n\"As a result they could take their foot off the gas and run through the latter part of the game quite easily.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola on Sergio Aguero: \"What a goal, what an action, what a player, what a man. I am incredibly delighted he is back.\n\"He is going to enjoy the last games. He showed with his goal what he has been and what he is. I am in love as a person He is an incredible guy.\n\"After the Champions League it is always tough but the players who didn't play in Paris spoke on the grass and they did it perfectly.\"\nWhy City are enjoying their travels - stats of the day\nPalace have suffered three consecutive Premier League defeats for the first time since July 2020 (a run of seven)\nCity enjoyed their 11th away league victory in a row, equalling the English top-flight record for consecutive away wins - Chelsea (Apr-Dec 2008) and City (May-Dec 2017)\nNo team have conceded more Premier League goals from outside the box this season than Palace (11, level with Sheffield United)\nCity's second goal was their 700th in all competitions under Pep Guardiola, 157 more than any other Premier League side since he took over in 2016\nCity had to wait until the 57th minute to register a shot on target, their longest wait in the Premier League since November 2019 v Southampton (70th minute)\nRaheem Sterling has failed to score and registered only one assist in his past 11 appearances in all competitions for City, after netting six and assisting two in the previous nine\nWhat's next?\nPalace travel to relegated Sheffield United on 8 May (15:00 BST).\nCity turn their attention to Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg against PSG (20:00), before hosting Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday (17:30).\nThe Lazarus Heist: A group of hackers cause mayhem in Hollywood for Sony Pictures Entertainment\nProcessing grief: The Crowd Science team explores why it is a universal feeling"

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 2-0 Leeds United: Pascal Gross and Danny Welbeck move Brighton close to safety\nBrighton moved within touching distance of Premier League safety for another season as Graham Potter's hosts opened a 10-point gap to the relegation places with victory over Leeds United.\nWith four games to play, the Seagulls - looking to secure a fifth successive term in the top flight - climbed three places to 14th and have a significant margin to 18th-placed Fulham, who lost to Chelsea later on Saturday.\nThe hosts were rewarded for a positive start at Amex Stadium when Pascal Gross expertly found the bottom corner with a 14th-minute penalty, awarded following Ezgjan Alioski's clumsy foul on Danny Welbeck.\nPotter's side squandered several chances to extend their advantage, but Welbeck eventually sealed an important victory 11 minutes from time with a composed finish after a sharp turn.\nLeeds, missing midfield rock Kalvin Phillips, initially responded to falling behind, but Jack Harrison's whipped shot was caught comfortably by Robert Sanchez and Dan Burn bravely blocked a thunderous Tyler Roberts strike from the visitors' best first-half chances.\nBrighton's forward trio of Welbeck, Leandro Trossard and Neal Maupay were all guilty of wasting opportunities - but Stuart Dallas' dipping first-time attempt with 15 minutes remaining was as close as Marcelo Bielsa's below-par side came to an equaliser.\nFollow reaction to Brighton v Leeds, plus live commentary of Saturday's Premier League action\nBrighton all but safe\nHaving slumped to defeat at bottom side Sheffield United last weekend, Brighton responded with an energetic and determined display that should finally end any nagging threat of relegation.\nThis victory, against an in-form Leeds aiming to consolidate a top-half finish, ended a tough four-match winless run for Potter's side, which had also seen them fail to score in their past three despite attempting 51 shots in total.\nWhen it arrived, Gross' spot-kick ended a six-hour wait for a goal, and though Illan Meslier went the right way the German's low strike could not have been better placed.\nThe profligacy that has plagued Brighton's campaign threatened to cost them once more as Trossard blazed over from Welbeck's cut-back after he robbed Diego Llorente of possession, and Welbeck dragged a low shot wide of the far post shortly before half-time.\nUndeterred, Trossard, Welbeck and Maupay looked fluid and threatening throughout and Welbeck ensured his personal good work was rewarded as a brilliant pivot beat the Leeds defence and presented the Englishman with ample time to pick his spot.\nPotter's faith in the quality of his squad has not wavered despite a lingering threat of relegation - one far from helped by a dismal home record showing just three wins - and now that safety looks all but confirmed they can surely afford to play with freedom as they aim to secure the five points required to better last season's tally.\nLeeds' unbeaten run comes to abrupt end\nMarcelo Bielsa's side arrived on the South Coast looking to extend a six game unbeaten run - their best in the top-flight since November 2001 - as they attempt to consolidate a top-half position to crown an impressive Premier League return.\nThat streak, which included victory over champions-elect Manchester City and draws against Manchester United and Liverpool, had given Leeds an outside chance of sneaking into the European places - but those hopes took a likely fatal blow on Saturday.\nLeeds were far from their breathless best, yet this was a familiar tale in a fixture that continues to prove particularly unfruitful.\nThe visitors, who lost the reverse fixture 1-0 in January, have failed to win away to Brighton since victory in League One in 2009 and have lost their past five games at the Amex.\nThey failed to ignite in attack, landing only two shots on target, and Patrick Bamford managed just 15 touches before being replaced after an hour.\nAnd while they lacked the attacking flair of Raphinha, it was the disruptive influence of Phillips at the base of midfield that was perhaps the greatest miss. Leeds have won just two of nine league games without him this season.\n'One of our best performances' - what the managers said\nBrighton boss Graham Potter to BBC Sport: \"A big victory and a big performance, one with a lot of quality and a lot of character. I was disappointed with the last one and you have to respond, and the players did. Overall a fully deserved three points.\n\"It was one of our best performances. You have to match Leeds for their effort and honesty and I felt we did that really well. There are still a lot of points to play for and we want to get more points as well.\"\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa: \"We didn't play well. The victory for the opponent was fair. We created very little danger and it was difficult for us to recover the ball.\n\"The game was hard with the height of their centre-backs. We couldn't avoid them initiating the play nor could we overcome them trying to get in behind.\"\nLeeds hate trips to Brighton - the stats\nBrighton have won eight of their past nine league games against Leeds.\nLeeds have lost five consecutive away league games against an opponent without scoring for the first time in their history. They have lost their last five visits to Brighton by an aggregate score of 11-0.\nBrighton kept their seventh home clean sheet of the season - only Manchester City and Chelsea, with nine, have more at home in the Premier League this term.\nOnly Leicester (10) have won more penalties than Brighton (nine) in the Premier League this season. Meanwhile, no side has given away more penalties (nine) or conceded more penalty goals (eight) than Leeds.\nDanny Welbeck's five goals in his 21 Premier League games for Brighton this season is his best return in a top-flight campaign since 2017-18.\nPascal Gross has registered 36 goal involvements in the Premier League (15 goals, 21 assists), which is at least eight more than any Brighton team-mate.\nWhat's next?\nNext weekend, Leeds host Tottenham on Saturday at 12:30 and Brighton are away to Wolves on Sunday at 12:00."

There are many reasons to maybe talk about why it is a difficult situation [for Havertz in his first season in England] but in the end you are responsible for yourself and he is.\n\"He must adapt as quick as possible. That is what he is doing and that is what we demand of him.\"\nFollow live text commentary here\nHavertz's finest hour?\nHavertz has struggled to live up to high expectations following his \u00a371m move from Bayer Leverkusen last summer - with Covid leaving him bedridden in November. In 90 minutes against Fulham he managed to double his Premier League goal tally.\nA clinical performance - he scored with both his shots - could put him in manager Tuchel's thinking for the Real game on Wednesday.\n\"I'm always desperate to start games,\" Havertz said afterwards. \"But I know we have a lot of quality players in the team and the other players play well as well.\n\"I keep going, train hard and give my best. We will see on Wednesday.\"\nHis first came at the end of a nice team move which started with goalkeeper Mendy, who has now kept 16 clean sheets in 28 Premier League games. He rolled the ball to Thiago Silva, who sprayed a long ball forward. Mount controlled it well and fed Havertz who slotted home.\nHe then had a goal ruled out for a clear offside from another Mount pass.\nHis second came when he controlled Ben Chilwell's pass and beat two defenders before finding Werner. He continued his run to ghost in behind the defence and received Werner's return pass before finishing.\nThe hard-working, unselfish Werner is another big-money summer signing who seems to have underachieved - yet he is the first player to reach double figures in goals and assists - 11 and 10 respectively - in his first Chelsea season since Eden Hazard in 2012-13.\nOnly four other Premier League players have achieved over 10 goals and assists in all competitions this season.\nThat Havertz goal was Chelsea's only shot in the second half until a late flurry in injury time as they were able to just cruise to victory before the biggest game of their season.\nA matter of if, not when for Fulham\nBrighton's 2-0 win over Leeds earlier on Saturday left Fulham nine points from safety and with four games to go for the London side it is basically all over.\nThey had more shots in the first half than Chelsea, seven to five, with drives from Robinson and Ademola Lookman well saved before Mendy changed his body shape to keep out Aina's deflected strike.\nScott Parker's team looked a beaten side in every way in the second half with only three efforts, none on target.\nThey even handed teenager Fabio Carvalho a league debut in a bid to make something happen but he did not get a chance to make much of an impact.\nTheir run against Chelsea now stretches to one win in their past 40 meetings.\nAll four teams above Fulham play again before their next game so their fate could be even closer to being sealed by then.\nTuchel sets Premier League record - the stats\nChelsea are unbeaten in their past 19 home matches against Fulham in all competitions (W11 D8), a run going back to 1979.\nFulham remain winless in their past 24 Premier League London derbies (D5 L19), since a 2-1 victory against West Ham in January 2014.\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has kept more clean sheets (11) than any other manager in Premier League history from their first 15 games in charge in the competition.\nAll eight of Kai Havertz's goals for Chelsea in all competitions have been scored in London - seven at Stamford Bridge and one at Selhurst Park.\nMason Mount (five goals, two assists) and Timo Werner (two goals, five assists) have been involved in more Chelsea goals under Tuchel than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Real Madrid on Wednesday (20:00 BST) in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final before visiting Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday (17:30).\nFulham have a nine-day break before hosting Burnley on Monday, 10 May (20:00)."

It was an important game and would have been an important result.\"\nEl Ghazi's winner was the only highlight of a relatively flat second half that failed to build on a pulsating first.\nOllie Watkins opened the scoring when he pounced on a mistake by Mason Holgate before slotting past Jordan Pickford.\nHowever, Everton hit back soon after when Dominic Calvert-Lewin powered home a header following a corner.\nHome keeper Pickford then twice denied Watkins with excellent saves to keep Villa at bay, while ex-Everton midfielder Ross Barkley struck the post with a low effort from range.\nBut despite Pickford's best efforts Villa secured the three points when El Ghazi struck late on.\nThe defeat leaves Everton eighth on 52 points while Villa are four points behind in ninth.\nPickford heroics can't save Everton\nTo have still been in the conversation for a top-four finish at this stage of the season is impressive for Everton, but the Toffees will perhaps wonder what might have been if their home form had been just marginally better than it is.\nThe Toffees have collected just 19 points from 17 home matches, with eight of those games ending in defeat.\n\"It's unbelievable. It's difficult to explain why, but it's true,\" Ancelotti said of Everton's home record.\n\"The away run we have is also unbelievable. The home run has affected us in the table. I hope it doesn't affect us in the end.\"\nAfter such an impressive win at Arsenal last time out, Everton never really got going against a Villa side that looked hungrier for the victory from the outset.\nIndeed, the visitors could have won by a bigger margin but for some excellent saves by Pickford.\nHe came off his line quickly to prevent Watkins from adding a second not long after opening the scoring, and produced a stunning save to somehow deny the striker again at the back post.\nIt was arguably Pickford's best performance of the season and bodes well for England with the European Championship starting in just over a month.\nWatkins impresses as Southgate watches\nAnother player with European Championship aspirations is Villa striker Watkins, and this performance will have done his chances of convincing Gareth Southgate to make a place for him in his squad no harm.\nThe England boss was watching in the stands as Watkins took his tally in an excellent debut Premier League season to 13 goals, and he could easily have added a couple more to that total.\nBut aside from his goals, Watkins offers impressive work-rate in attack and he was a constant menace for Everton with his pressing from the front.\nHe was there to steal the ball from a hesitant Holgate to open the scoring and, for a 20-minute period in the first half, the Toffees were unable to get a handle on his determined runs off the ball.\nIt was another impressive display from the former Brentford striker and with games against Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea still to come, Watkins has plenty more chances to further underline his credentials to Southgate.\n\"I thought he was good and difficult to handle. It's what we paid a lot of money for,\" Smith said of his \u00a328m summer signing from Brentford.\n\"I knew what he was and what he was like as a person, and how he wanted to grow and get better. I thought he was outstanding tonight.\"\nWoodwork woes for Villa - the stats\nThis was the 205th top-flight meeting between Aston Villa and Everton, the most played fixture in England's top division - Villa have won 75 times to Everton's 76 (54 draws).\nAston Villa have won more games (20) and scored more goals (73) in the Premier League against Everton than they have vs any other side in the competition.\nEverton have won just one of their last 10 home league games (D3 L6), with that victory coming against Southampton in March (1-0).\nAston Villa have won eight away games in the Premier League this season - their highest total in a single campaign since 2009-10 (nine).\nIn contrast, Everton have lost eight times at Goodison Park this term, only in 1993-94 have they lost more in a Premier League season (nine).\nNo Premier League side has struck the woodwork on more occasions in the Premier League this season than Aston Villa (20).\nAston Villa's Anwar El Ghazi has scored eight Premier League goals in 23 games this season - twice as many as he'd scored last term in 34 appearances.\nOllie Watkins has scored 13 goals in the Premier League this season - only one Englishman has scored more for Aston Villa in a single season in the competition (Julian Joachim, 14 in 1998-99).\nEverton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who netted his 20th goal in all competitions this season, has scored the most headed goals in the Premier League this term (seven).\nWhat next?\nEverton travel to fifth-placed West Ham on Sunday, 9 May (16:30 BST) while Aston Villa are at home to Manchester United on the same day (14:05 BST).\nThe Lazarus Heist: A group of hackers cause mayhem in Hollywood for Sony Pictures Entertainment\nProcessing grief: The Crowd Science team explores why it is a universal feeling"

When you're chasing against these lads it's always going to be difficult. Arsenal were the better side today, it was as simple as that.\n\"Allan Saint-Maximin in the last few weeks has produced all sorts of magic but it wasn't quite there today.\n\"We've never thought [we're safe]. We have four games left and we still have a lot to play for.\"\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta speaking to BBC Sport: \"We got what we wanted, to win the game and keep a clean sheet. We had strong performances individually and collectively we were the better side.\n\"I wanted to be fresh for today and Thursday so that was to give an opportunity to everybody.

        "article_text": "Tottenham 4-0 Sheffield United: Gareth Bale nets hat-trick in Spurs win\nGareth Bale's hat-trick gave Tottenham a comfortable victory over relegated Sheffield United as they maintained their pursuit of European football.\nBale flicked in the opener when it was lifted over the top by Serge Aurier before the right-back teed him up to thump in the third in the second half.\nThe Welsh international was played in by Son Heung-min on the break for his second - a thumping strike which flew into the top right corner.\nSon rounded off a dominant Spurs performance when he curled in a superb fourth goal.\nThe South Korean also had a goal disallowed for offside five minutes into the second half.\nBale said he was \"feeling good\" after starting back-to-back Premier League games.\n\"You have to take your chances when they come,\" he said. \"I just needed to play games and get a run of games and I'm doing that now. I'm happy and when I'm happy I play well.\"\nSpurs interim head coach Ryan Mason added: \"I said all along Bale hasn't and won't lose that ability in the final third to produce moments of excellence. He's a world class player - he's proved that over many years.\n\"The most pleasing thing was his attitude; his running for the team. You feel confident he'll take the chances.\"\nThe result leaves Tottenham sitting five points off fourth place and the Champions League qualification spot with four games remaining.\nSheffield United, who were relegated on 17 April following defeat to Wolves, had one shot on target and were unable to test goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.\nBale sparkles in ruthless display\nBale's hat-trick was only his second in the Premier League and his first since December 2012 when he netted three against Aston Villa.\nHe was one of two changes to the Spurs starting line-up as interim manager Mason called up Bale and Dele Alli in place of Harry Winks and Lucas Moura.\nBoth gave good accounts of themselves - Alli showing sparkles of quality in the first half before fading in the second.\nBut it was Bale who stole the show, making a smart run in behind to poke in the opener before lashing in a powerful second after a swift break from Son down the right.\nAurier's pass for Bale's third was perfectly-weighted too and the Welshman drilled it into the bottom right corner to seal the hat-trick.\nHe celebrated at full-time with a beaming smile as he collected the match ball and he notched up another milestone by becoming the sixth Welshman to surpass 50 Premier League goals.\nBale returned to Spurs on a season-long loan from Real Madrid in September and when asked if he will extend his stay, Mason said: \"I think that is a discussion once the season is done. Our priority is the next game.\"\nBlades fail to trouble Spurs\nAttention has already turned to next season for Sheffield United with relegation to the Championship confirmed a few weeks ago.\nThey were boosted by the return of Norwegian international Sander Berge, who came on as a substitute at half-time and helped the Blades find some balance in midfield.\nJohn Fleck pushed up into a more advanced position and saw lots of the ball, but in truth, Sheffield United never showed enough firepower to get anything from the game.\nDavid McGoldrick and Oliver Burke got in behind the defence on a few occasions but lacked the support needed to create any chances, while Sheffield United's first and only shot on target came in the 65th minute when Oliver Norwood struck it straight at Lloris.\nThe defeat means interim manager Paul Heckingbottom has seen his Sheffield United side concede 15 goals in his six Premier League games in charge.\n'Some of our play was outstanding' - what they said\nTottenham interim head coach Ryan Mason: \"The attitude, the desire to compete and to keep competing over 95 minutes [was good]. We had some real moments of quality but the bravery to play in every duel, every action, is the most pleasing thing.\n\"We had a week where we could train and work on the players. We defended strongly as a team. Some of our play was absolutely outstanding.\"\nSheffield United caretaker manager Paul Heckingbottom: \"We're putting it down to ourselves and how we perform. If we're always putting it down to the opposition then we're going to struggle.\n\"That is not a performance that we want to see. It was so passive and I can't wait until the fans are back in because in a stadium like this it's absolutely dead. We tried to generate our own atmosphere in the second half but the game ran away from us.\"\nBale feels at home - the best of the stats\nSpurs have won five of their last six Premier League home games (L1), one more than they managed across their first 11 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this season (W4 D3 L4).\nSheffield United have lost 27 of their 34 Premier League games this season (W5, D2) - the most the Blades have ever lost in a single league campaign in their history.\nThey have picked up just four points from a possible 51 available away from home this season.\nAll nine of Bale's Premier League goals this season have come at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nSon (16 goals, 10 assists) joined Harry Kane and Bruno Fernandes as one of three Premier League players to both score and assist 10+ goals in the Premier League this season.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to Elland Road to face Leeds on Saturday, 8 May (12:30 BST kick-off), while Sheffield United are at home to Crystal Palace on the same day (15:00 BST).\nThis Time with Alan Partridge is back: Stream his second series on iPlayer now\nFancy cocktails to celebrate this bank holiday?: BBC Food has top tips for drinking outdoors"

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Sam Allardyce says Baggies need miracle\nWest Brom boss Sam Allardyce says the Baggies need a \"magic miracle and fairy dust\" to stay in the Premier League after drawing the Black Country derby with Wolves.\nAllardyce's proud record of never being relegated now requires his side to win all four of their remaining games, beginning with a trip to Arsenal on Sunday, and hope for a complete collapse from one of the five teams outside the drop zone that they can still catch.\nThat combination seems highly unlikely, even with the battling qualities West Brom showed during a game played in torrential rain to earn a point through Mbaye Diagne's header after Fabio Silva's fortunate first-half opener had put Wolves in front.\nNuno Espirito Santo's depleted squad, who lost Wily Boly in the build-up to a positive coronavirus test, carried the greater threat for most of the contest, with Baggies keeper Sam Johnstone saving well from Nelson Semedo and Adama Traore either side of the interval.\nHowever, while Silva ran away in jubilant celebration after sending the ball over Johnstone and into the net in stoppage time, replays showed the young Portuguese knew nothing about it as Kyle Bartley's clearance cannoned off his standing foot.\nDiagne levelled when he powered home Conor Townsend's cross.\nAllardyce will talk to the board about whether to stay next season.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\"We owe it to everyone to keep a professional attitude and go out and try to win every game we've got left and hope every team above us loses every game and then, by some magic miracle and some fairy dust, we stay up,\" he said.\n\"I can't believe we haven't won or taken the chances we created. I'm very sad for the players they haven't converted this game into a victory.\n\"You look at Wolves' goal and say 'why can't we get a bit of luck like that?'\"\nWest Brom's struggle for survival\nThe first half was a microcosm of West Brom's season as a whole.\nThey were very poor for the first half-hour, then they made a change, took some time to adjust, should have scored but didn't and almost immediately conceded a self-inflicted opener.\nOn an awful night weather-wise, it was hard not to feel sorry for Dara O'Shea, who in addition to the ignominy of being substituted in the first half, was as far as it was possible to be from the dug-out when the board went up, condemning him to a sad, lonely, wet walk around half of the pitch.\nThe chance was excellent as Semi Ajeyi rose at the far post to meet Conor Gallagher's cross. Ajeyi's header was clean but it lacked accuracy, which allowed Roman Saiss to clear.\nIt was the kind of chance that had to be taken but invariably they have failed to do so over the past few, frustrating weeks, and they were made to pay almost immediately.\nFrom that point, West Brom were always in trouble. For while Wolves are not the most exciting team in the Premier League, they are the only top-flight side not to lose a game after scoring the opening goal, which now extends to 10 matches.\nMarshalled superbly by skipper Conor Coady, Wolves' defence kept their shape as the conditions worsened and by the end, the visitors looked more likely to get a winner than their hosts, who so desperately needed one.\nBig decisions ahead for the Baggies\nAllardyce has kept repeating he is unwilling to discuss his future until West Brom's fate is known.\nThat day is now getting very close, meaning the Baggies hierarchy will have to tell Allardyce the funds he will be given for a promotion campaign.\nThe clear problem is most of the men who have beyond question improved the Baggies over the final third of the campaign are on loan.\nDiagne is one of them, Okay Yokuslu another and Ainsley Maitland-Niles will not enhance his England aspirations in the Championship.\nThe evidence of Norwich and Watford underlines the advantage parachute payments give relegated clubs but there is a lot of soul-searching to be done at The Hawthorns given owner Guochuan Lai is known to be looking for a buyer.\nWolves' woes at The Hawthorns - the stats\nWolves remain winless in their last 10 away league games against West Brom (D5, L5) since a 4-2 win in September 1996.\nWolves remain the only team not to lose when scoring the first goal in a Premier League game this season (W8, D2).\nWolves' Fabio Silva (four goals) has overtaken Ricardo Vaz Te (three) to become the second highest scoring Portuguese teenager in Premier League history, with only Cristiano Ronaldo (eight) netting more in the competition before turning 20.\nConor Townsend's assist for Mbaye Diagne's equaliser was his first in 46 league games for West Brom, since setting up a goal against Barnsley in October 2019 in the Championship.\nWolves captain Conor Coady and goalkeeper Rui Patricio both played their 109th Premier League games for Wolves this evening making them the outright record appearance makers for the club in the competition (overtaking Matt Jarvis, 108).\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom's next game is against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, 9 May (19:00 BST). Wolves are also in action on 9 May, at home to Brighton (12:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-2 West Ham: Michail Antonio scores two in win for Hammers\nWest Ham forward Michail Antonio said they will not give up on their dream of securing Champions League football after he scored twice in a comeback victory over Burnley.\nThe Hammers moved up to fifth place in the table, just three points behind Chelsea in fourth, with four games of the season remaining.\nChris Wood scored from a penalty to give Burnley the lead before Antonio headed in Vladimir Coufal's teasing cross and poked in Said Benrahma's delivery eight minutes later.\nAntonio, who returned after four weeks out with a hamstring injury, said: \"It would be unbelievable. Everybody wants to play in the Champions League.\n\"I have been here a few years and there have been so many seasons we were fighting to stay in the league and now we have the opportunity for top four.\n\"We are not going to give up on it. We will keep fighting, keep pushing.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes said: \"We want to take it down to the final day and try to sneak in. It will probably need us to win all four games.\n\"Europe would be an incredible achievement. I think I'll be disappointed if we don't get there now.\"\nWest Ham created numerous chances to extend their lead after Antonio's double but Burnley could have made it 2-2 when Jay Rodriguez lashed a shot wide from close range.\nBurnley remain nine points above the relegation zone in 16th place.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nBenrahma impresses as Antonio haunts Burnley\nThe game was finely balanced in the opening stages but Wood's spot-kick seemed to spark West Ham's creativity.\nTheir response to going behind was excellent - Antonio's equaliser came just 154 seconds later, capitalising on a wicked cross from Coufal.\nThe full-back continued to put in dangerous crosses, while Benrahma caused Matt Lowton nightmares on the far side.\nBenrahma's superb cross for Antonio's second capped off an impressive individual display. He could have scored himself but he unselfishly opted to play in Jesse Lingard in the first half and put too much weight on the through ball.\nManuel Lanzini shone in midfield in the absence of Declan Rice and Mark Noble, while Antonio ultimately dealt the crucial blows.\nThe striker should have had a hat-trick too - in the second half, he hit Pablo Fornals' scuffed shot against his standing leg when it fell fortunately for him at the back post just a yard from the line.\nVictory ensures West Ham keep pressure on fourth-placed Chelsea as they battle for a Champions League qualification spot.\nBurnley show fight but undone in first half\nBurnley are now without a win in their past eight home league games - their joint-longest run in their top-flight history.\nBut while they remain two places above the drop zone, they showed the type of character which will no doubt keep them up for the fifth season running.\nWood took his goal well, firing it into the bottom left corner after winning the penalty when he crept in behind West Ham's Issa Diop, flicked it over his head and got a touch on the ball ahead of Tomas Soucek, who brought him down.\nDiop was the weak link in West Ham's defence and Wood got the better of him on a few occasions, before Matej Vydra almost scrambled in an equaliser when Craig Dawson cleared off the line.\nBurnley kept themselves in the game - Ben Mee blocking strikes from Fornals and goalkeeper Nick Pope denying Lingard in the second half.\nRodriguez's miss from close range was the chance they needed to convert but Burnley pushed late on to win a few corners, for which Pope came up.\nManager Sean Dyche threw on striker Ashley Barnes, returning from injury, for the last five minutes but the hosts could not create a clear-cut opportunity.\nIn the end, West Ham's attacking intent in the first half did the damage when Burnley failed to deal with Antonio's presence in the six-yard area.\n'We're not far away from Europe' - what they said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche said: \"They are good outfit. They are chasing Champions League football and looked like it. They have pace and play good on the transition.\n\"We have not gone far wrong. Two soft goals - especially the second - but a lot to be pleased with. The first one is a breakaway. The second we don't read the cross. I don't want to be overly critical.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes said: \"The team played really well. We won 2-1 but I felt it was a lot more than that. We rode our luck at the end but we should have been out of sight.\n\"I'd love to be in Europe. It would be an incredible achievement. We're not far away from the Champions League positions. We've got to keep believing.\"\nWest Ham's Michail Antonio on muted celebrations: \"I've had a couple of goals disallowed by VAR. I thought 'I don't want to be there doing a dance and the goal gets disallowed'. I've toned down my celebrations. A couple of times I've been about to do one and had a handball or whatever... VAR has killed it.\"\nA threat in the air - the best of the stats\nWest Ham have scored 2+ goals in 11 Premier League games in 2021, a figure only Manchester City (15) can better.\nWest Ham have both scored and conceded in 20 different Premier League games this season, more than any other side.\nWood has scored more Premier League goals against West Ham than he has against any other side in the competition (seven goals in eight games)\nSince his Premier League debut in September 2015, Antonio has scored 19 headed goals in the competition, with no player managing more in that time (level with Olivier Giroud and Harry Kane).\nCoufal provided his sixth Premier League assist of the season; among defenders, only team-mate Aaron Cresswell (seven) and Everton's Lucas Digne (seven) have registered more.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Craven Cottage to play Fulham on Monday, 10 May (20:00 BST kick-off), while West Ham host Everton on Sunday, 9 May (16:30 BST).\nThis Time with Alan Partridge is back: Stream his second series on iPlayer now\nFancy cocktails to celebrate this bank holiday?: BBC Food has top tips for drinking outdoors"

We are in the dizzying heights of 13th. We haven't done it yet but we have made big strides in the last few weeks.\"\nFootball Daily podcast: Newcastle deal blow to Leicester's top-four hopes\nFoxes fearing a repeat of last season\nThe evening started badly for Leicester when they were forced into a last-minute change minutes before kick-off, and things only went downhill from there.\nAlbrighton started in place of Jonny Evans, who limped down the tunnel after picking up an injury in the warm-up.\nIt was an uncharacteristically poor defensive display from a Foxes side who have spent the entire season so far inside the top four.\n\"Jonny Evans is the brain of our backline and when he came out of the team that was a big blow for us. However, we should still defend better,\" said Rodgers.\nTwo goal-bound efforts from Federico Fernandez and Kelechi Iheanacho were saved by Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka in the early stages.\nDubravka was eventually beaten late in the second half, first by Albrighton's impressive strike from the edge of the box, followed by a low effort into the bottom right corner from Iheanacho. However, by then the damage had been done.\nRodgers is seeking to avoid a repeat of 2019-20, when they missed out on a place in the Champions League on the final day having spent most of the season in the top four.\n\"We have made it a lot harder for ourselves but it is still in our hands. We have to fight and we are a group that is together,\" he added.\nLeicester have a tough conclusion to this season, visiting second-placed Manchester United on Tuesday and then travelling to fourth-placed Chelsea on 18 May, three days after facing them in the FA Cup final.\nTheir final Premier League game is at home to Tottenham, who are sixth, on 23 May.\nMagpies on brink of fifth successive season in Premier League\nNewcastle came flying out of the blocks at King Power Stadium, and made the most of the rejigged Foxes defence.\nTheir first real chance fell to Federico Fernandez, who came close with a glancing a header from Jonjo Shelvey's free-kick. Shortly after, Allan Saint-Maximin was denied from 10 yards out by a brilliant sprawling stop from Kasper Schmeichel.\nLeicester had been warned, and it didn't take long for them to be punished. Soyuncu's trickery backfired, when Arsenal loanee Willock, who missed the Magpies' last game because of being ineligible to play against his parent club, chased down a mistimed turn from the Turkish defender, before keeping his cool and slotting past Schmeichel. He has now scored in four successive appearances.\nDummett's first Premier League goal since January 2016 stretched Newcastle's lead and Wilson put them out of sight, with two goals inside nine second-half minutes. A brilliant pass down the left from Matt Ritchie got the better of Timothy Castagne, leaving Wilson to stride forward and round Schmeichel for an easy finish. His second came back off the post from 10 yards out but he slotted in the rebound.\nFoxes poor home form continues - the stats\nOnly Sheffield United (12) and Fulham (11) have lost more home Premier League matches than Leicester City in the Premier League this season (eight). In the history of the top flight, the highest a team has finished in the table having lost eight or more home games in a season was seventh, achieved by Blackpool in 1957-58.\nNewcastle have won as many points in their past five Premier League matches (10 - W3 D1 L1) as they managed in their 15 matches prior to this run (W2 D4 L9).\nNewcastle won an away Premier League match against a side starting the day as high as third in the table by two or more goals for the first time since December 2001, when they won 3-1 at Arsenal under Sir Bobby Robson.\nLeicester conceded four goals in a home Premier League match for the first time since losing 4-0 to Liverpool in December 2019, while it's the first time they've shipped four at home to Newcastle in the top flight since January 1909, a 4-0 defeat.\nSince Joe Willock joined Newcastle on loan, he has scored five Premier League goals for the Magpies - in that time, no player from his parent club Arsenal has managed to score more goals than him in the competition.\nKelechi Iheanacho has scored 10 Premier League goals since the start of March, the most of any player. The only player to score more goals over this period in Europe's top five leagues is fellow Nigerian Simy (12 in Serie A).\nWhat next?\nLeicester travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Tuesday (18:00 BST kick-off), while Newcastle host Manchester City on Friday, 14 May (20:00 BST kick-off).\nThe Northern Bank Job: The biggest bank heist in British and Irish history is revisited\nLife Changing: What's it like to lose all your memories overnight?"

        "article_text": "Leeds United 3-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Patrick Bamford helps dent Spurs' Euro hopes\nPatrick Bamford scored for Leeds United in front of watching England boss Gareth Southgate to help dent Tottenham's European chances.\nIn an absorbing game at Elland Road, Stuart Dallas put Leeds ahead with his eighth league goal of the season, the Northern Ireland midfielder pouncing from close range after Hugo Lloris' terrific reaction save to prevent Sergio Reguilon putting through his own net.\nThe lead lasted 12 minutes, Son Heung-min equalising with a clinical finish after Dele Alli was allowed to run unchallenged before threading a clever pass into the South Korea forward's path.\nBut Leeds responded through Bamford, who tapped in Ezgjan Alioski's cross before substitute Rodrigo confirmed Spurs' first league defeat in three games under interim manager Ryan Mason.\nOn a frustrating day for Spurs, Harry Kane had two goals ruled out for offside and hit the bar from a free-kick, while Illan Meslier produced an excellent save to keep out Serge Aurier's deflected attempt.\nWith three matches left, sixth-placed Spurs are five points off fourth spot with both teams immediately above them - West Ham and Chelsea - having games in hand.\nLeeds, who started the weekend in 11th spot, climbed above Aston Villa and Arsenal - who both play on Sunday - into ninth.\nReaction from Elland Road plus Saturday's Premier League latest\nNext Tottenham manager: No trophies or Champions League football - so who fits the bill?\nWill Bamford get Euro 2020 call?\nSouthgate, who will this month name his squad for this summer's delayed Euro 2020 Championship, was at Elland Road to see Bamford score his 15th Premier League goal of the season.\nEarlier this season, Southgate said Bamford was close to being called up but opted instead for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.\nWith countries allowed to select a 26-player squad instead of the usual 23 at this summer's tournament, the former Chelsea player could well be in contention for a first England call at the age of 27.\nHe has been a key to Leeds' solid return to the top flight and was in the right place to score his team's second goal during a typical hard-working performance by Marcelo Bielsa's side.\nTheir return to the Premier League has been peppered with memorable moments. Leeds have taken four points off champions-elect Manchester City, won convincingly at third-placed Leicester and played some exciting football throughout.\nThis high-energy performance was another highlight as they scored three or more goals in a single game for the eighth time. They could have won by a more handsome margin.\nAt 1-1, Lloris produced a one-handed save to keep out Jack Harrison and the Spurs keeper later denied Mateusz Klich at 2-1, before Moreno's goal, after a superb run and pass by the returning Raphinha, settled it.\nThe result means Leeds will finish this season unbeaten at home in the league against the so-called big six.\nWill Spurs make Europe?\nThis was Tottenham's second defeat since sacking Jose Mourinho last month. Not only is 2020-21 their 13th season without a major trophy after they lost to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, they are now in danger of missing out on a place in Europe.\nWhile Mourinho has since resurfaced in Italy at Roma, Spurs' search for a permanent manager looks set to extend into the close season.\nWhoever takes over faces a huge task.\nQuestion marks remain over the future of England captain Kane while Gareth Bale has just three games before he is due to return to Real Madrid.\nTottenham's next manager will be the 10th permanent appointment made during Daniel Levy's 20 years as chairman. He really needs to get the next one right.\nHaving beaten Southampton and relegated Sheffield United at home under Mason, this was a careless performance against Leeds.\nThe hosts were much more energetic and took the lead after Aurier failed to cut out a cross, while Eric Dier's poor headed clearance sparked the move that led to Bamford scoring Leeds' second goal.\nFourth place looks an unlikely prospect now for Spurs, while sixth place will become seventh if Liverpool beat Southampton at Anfield in the day's late kick-off.\n'Leeds are fittest team in league' - what they said\nLeeds boss Marcelo Bielsa: \"We could have scored more goals, but we could have conceded more as well. The difference of two goals is adequate. To have won by more goals, it would not have corresponded, even if it was possible.\n\"I don't think [Spurs] played without enthusiasm. On our part, I link it to the spirit of the players.\"\nTottenham interim boss Ryan Mason: \"Leeds are probably the fittest team in the Premier League so we knew it was going to be difficult early on.\n\"We wanted to come here and win the game. We haven't done that. That's very disappointing.\n\"We have to get over this and we have to work well this week and hopefully get three points next weekend.\"\nLeeds keep out the 'big six' - the stats\nLeeds became the first side to remain unbeaten at home in the Premier League against each of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham in a season since West Ham in 2015-16, and only the third newly promoted side to do so, after Ipswich Town in 2000-01 and Birmingham City in 2009-10.\nSpurs have lost five of their 10 Premier League away games in 2021.\nPatrick Bamford became just the fourth Englishman to score 15-plus goals for Leeds in a single Premier League campaign after Lee Chapman (15 in 1992-93), Rod Wallace (17 in 1993-94) and Michael Bridges (19 in 1999-00).\nBamford has had a hand 22 Premier League goals this season (15 goals, seven assists) - only one Englishman has been involved in more (Harry Kane, 34).\nOnly team-mate Kane (21) and Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah (20) have scored more Premier League goals than Tottenham's Son Heung-min (17) this season.\nStuart Dallas is the first Northern Ireland player to score as many as eight Premier League goals in a single season since Chris Brunt in 2008-09.\nWhat's next?\nLeeds are at Burnley next Saturday (12:30 BST), while Tottenham are at home to Wolves on Sunday, 16 May (14:05 BST).\nOur Silent Emergency: \"Like a lot of people in my generation, I struggle with my mental health\"\nThe Greatest Athlete You've Never Seen: Is 'Canelo' Alvarez the ultimate boxer?"

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 0-2 Crystal Palace: Eze helps Eagles secure Premier League safety\nCrystal Palace secured their Premier League status for another season with a comfortable victory at already-relegated Sheffield United.\nChristian Benteke scored with a deflected shot after 66 seconds to claim his fourth goal in 10 games for Palace, and had chances to improve that tally.\nThe Belgian striker, 30, had a point-blank header saved by Aaron Ramsdale before firing against a post in the second half.\nCaptain John Egan spurned Sheffield United's best chance of an equaliser shortly after the interval, slicing over from a corner from six yards out.\nBut Ebere Eze broke forward late on to convert a second and secure the Eagles' first win in five games, putting them beyond reach of third-bottom Fulham.\nThat capped a fine performance by the English midfielder, 22, who breezed past Egan in the opening minute before laying off to Benteke, whose shot struck George Baldock and bounced over Ramsdale into the Blades' net.\nJeffrey Schlupp's cross then picked out Benteke, who is out of contract this summer, but he directed a free header too close to Ramsdale.\nBenteke also struck a post after dispossessing John Fleck, while substitute Jordan Ayew twice went close to a rare goal.\nAnd the Blades, who handed 17-year-old striker Daniel Jebbison his debut off the bench, offered little in response as their miserable season lurched closer to several unwanted records - such as most defeats and fewest goals scored in a Premier League campaign.\nImpressive Eze again shows his potential\nSheffield United are already preparing for life back in the Championship and, after securing a ninth straight season in the top flight, Palace are also set for a rebuild this summer.\nManager Roy Hodgson and half of the matchday squad at Bramall Lane are out of contract at the end of the season, or returning to their parent club.\nAn announcement is yet to be made on whether Hodgson, 73, will extend his lengthy managerial career or Palace will seek a replacement, but whoever is in charge at Selhurst Park next season, they can rely on the services of two of England's most promising youngsters.\nThe Eagles have signed Eze and Tyrick Mitchell, 21, to long-term deals and they could be mainstays in the Palace side for years to come.\nDeployed in an attacking midfield role, Eze continued an impressive first season since making a \u00a319.5m move from Championship side QPR.\nHe was central to most of Palace's best play, showing his pace and poise on the ball. He laid on the opener and dispossessed Chris Basham before firing narrowly wide.\nIn the first half, Eze also found Wilfried Zaha, whose shot was blocked by Egan, and he burst forward again to clinch victory. After breaking down the left, Eze cut inside, feinted past a couple of defenders and then scuffed a shot into the bottom corner.\nMitchell, meanwhile, was comfortable at left-back but for a clumsy tackle on Sander Berge, making his first start since December, which might have been given as a penalty.\nPalace now need three wins from their last four matches to reach 50 points for the first time in a Premier League campaign. If Eze and Mitchell continue to develop, the Eagles will hope to be challenging for a top-half finish next term.\n'We've got some very dangerous players' - what they said\nSheffield United's interim manager Paul Heckingbottom: \"Aaron Ramsdale's been excellent while I've been in this job. Today was probably his best game yet.\n\"The bit I really like about these players is their honesty. It was there to see again for the full game but I think it cost us today. You don't get a free-kick if you don't go to ground now. We would have had a penalty if Sander Berge had gone down. The way the game is officiated is promoting that type of behaviour from players.\n\"Daniel Jebbison's got a lot of attributes. There's lots of good work going on behind the scenes. He gets on the end of things in the box but he's only 17 so a lot more to come from him. He did himself no harm today with the way he performed.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"I'm happy we bookended the game in terms of the goals but there was a long period in between where we played some very good football and created some very good chances. Unfortunately we weren't able to take them or found a goalkeeper in exceptional form.\n\"[Benteke] has had three difficult seasons before this one, and even the first part of this one, and hasn't been that lucky with injuries. Now we've had him available for a long period and I think he's got better and better. He's always worked hard for us and done the job, tactically, that we've asked him to do. But forwards need goals and when you're not getting them, unfortunately people will scrutinise your performance harshly.\n\"We've got players like Jeff Schlupp, Ebere Eze and Wilfried Zaha who, if we can get them on the ball behind the opposing team's midfield with space in front of them, they're very dangerous players. They're all good runners with the ball and that's something we were fortunate enough to do today.\n\"We've stayed well away from the relegation zone this season and, with a bit of luck, we'd have kicked on further. We had some injuries to key players. But we've got four games to get some more points on the board, and today it didn't look like a team that thought the season was over.\"\nBenteke's long-awaited return to form - the stats\nChristian Benteke has scored more goals this season (seven in 27 games) than he managed in his previous three Premier League campaigns combined (six in 71 games).\nBenteke (79 goals, 21 assists) became the fourth Belgian player to be involved in 100 Premier League goals - alongside Romelu Lukaku (148), Eden Hazard (139) and Kevin de Bruyne (118).\nBenteke's opener (66 seconds) was Crystal Palace's earliest Premier League goal since James McArthur's strike against Everton in November 2017 (51 seconds).\nIn Premier League history only Derby County in 2007-08 (22), Leeds United in 1996-97 (21) and Huddersfield Town in 2017-18 (21) have failed to score in more games in a single campaign.\nPalace were the 11th different side to complete a league double over Sheffield United this season - in Premier League history, only Derby County in 2007-08 have lost both league matches against more opponents (12).\nWhat's next?\nPalace are away to Southampton on Tuesday (20:15 BST) before hosting Aston Villa next Sunday (12:00), the same day Sheffield United visit Everton (19:00).\nThe Northern Bank Job: The biggest bank heist in British and Irish history is revisited\nLife Changing: What's it like to lose all your memories overnight?"

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-2 Chelsea: Aguero misses penalty as Chelsea make City wait for Premier League title\nSergio Aguero made a mess of a Panenka penalty as Chelsea ensured Manchester City must wait a little longer to wrap up the Premier League title by fighting back to earn a dramatic win at Etihad Stadium.\nCity, needing three points to become champions of England for the seventh time, took the lead just before half-time through Raheem Sterling's close-range strike.\nAguero had a glorious chance to make it 2-0 from the spot moments later when Billy Gilmour fouled Gabriel Jesus, but the Argentina striker opted for a dinked effort that was easily saved by Edouard Mendy.\nIt proved a costly miss, as Chelsea improved after the break and equalised when Cesar Azpilicueta set up Hakim Ziyech to fire home from the edge of the area.\nThe visitors had two more efforts ruled out for offside before Marcus Alonso won it for them in injury time, meeting Timo Werner's pull-back and sending the ball looping over Ederson.\nThis was Chelsea's second win over City in the space of three weeks, following their victory in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in April.\nThe two sides will meet again in the Champions League final in Istanbul at the end of this month.\nThis result can only give Chelsea extra confidence for that game, as well as providing a big boost to their hopes of a top-four finish, but in truth this encounter offered few clues to how their next meeting will be decided.\nBoth managers made numerous changes to the sides they put out for their respective Champions League semi-final second-leg matches in midweek - City boss Pep Guardiola made nine to the side that beat Paris St-Germain here on Tuesday, while his Chelsea counterpart Thomas Tuchel made five to the team that defeated Real Madrid on Wednesday - and the result was a disjointed performance from both sides.\nReaction from Etihad Stadium\nNo celebrations for City this time\nHundreds of City fans had gathered before kick-off to greet their players with fireworks and flares when they arrived at the stadium but their plans to celebrate a third title in four seasons in the same way are on hold after this result.\nThey could still be crowned champions before they play their next game, at Newcastle on Friday, if Manchester United drop three points over their next three matches in the next five days - but three United wins would reduce City's lead at the top to four points.\nEven with the title so close, Guardiola was expected to make changes to his line-up after the PSG game, but he also tinkered with his team's formation and playing style.\nInstead of their usual 4-3-3, and trademark patient passing and possession-based game, City lined up in a strange 5-1-3-1 formation and tried to get the ball forward as quickly as possible.\nThey failed to spark until a breathless spell just before the break, when Sterling put them ahead and Aguero should have doubled their lead from the penalty spot.\nGabriel Jesus was involved in both incidents, first brushing Andreas Christensen off the ball and sending over a low cross that Aguero mis-controlled into the path of Sterling, who passed the ball into the net.\nSoon after, with Christensen off the field receiving treatment, Gimour held back the Brazilian forward in the box to concede a penalty, and Aguero - City's record goalscorer, who is leaving the club at the end of the season after an illustrious decade in Manchester - stepped up, only to fluff his lines horribly.\nGuardiola's frustration at that miss turned to fury in the second half, firstly when Chelsea equalised and then when his side were denied a second penalty with the score at 1-1 late on.\nSterling went down in the box after a clumsy challenge from Chelsea substitute Kurt Zouma, but referee Anthony Taylor waved play on.\nTuchel's Chelsea impress again\nWhile City and their fans were left to wonder what might have been, Chelsea offered more evidence of the improvements they have made since Thomas Tuchel took charge at the start of the year.\nThe visitors visibly lacked imagination for the first hour or so, and seemed to be badly missing the creative nous of the absent Mason Mount in midfield, but they were well-organised, apart from that madcap spell before the break, and always in the game at 1-0 down.\nThey came to life in the second half, again demonstrating their threat to City on the break and could easily have had more than just two goals.\nTimo Werner and Callum Hudson-Odoi both found the net at 1-1, only to be denied by the linesman's flag, in decisions that were a good deal tighter than when Werner's effort was ruled out for a clear offside early on.\nIt was an impressive all-round performance, that bodes well for Chelsea's attempts to win the FA Cup next weekend and secure a top-four finish before they can turn their focus to the Champions League final.\nWhat next? City head to Newcastle\nChelsea host Arsenal on Wednesday (20:15 BST) while City will have another chance to wrap up the title when they travel to Newcastle on Friday (20:00 BST).\nCity's home woes continue - the stats\nManchester City have dropped eight points from winning positions in home Premier League games this season, last dropping more at home in the competition in 2008-09 (12).\nChelsea's Thomas Tuchel is the fifth manager to avoid defeat in each of their first eight away games in the Premier League after Kenny Dalglish, John Gregory, Felipe Scolari and Chris Wilder.\nAfter losing his first three managerial meetings with Pep Guardiola in all competitions, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel is unbeaten in his last four encounters with the Spaniard (W2 D2).\nPep Guardiola has lost four home league games this season, twice as many as he'd lost in any other campaign in his managerial career.\nManchester City have lost consecutive Premier League home games thanks to a goal scored in the 90th minute - as many as they had in their previous 235 Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium.\nAt 91 minutes and 54 seconds, Marcos Alonso's winner was the latest winning goal scored in an away Premier League game against Manchester City since Paul Scholes for Man Utd in April 2010 (92:41).\nManchester City have conceded at least twice in four consecutive top-flight home games for the first time since December 1978.\nThe Northern Bank Job: The biggest bank heist in British and Irish history is revisited\nLife Changing: What's it like to lose all your memories overnight?"

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-0: Southampton: Klopp's side close on top four with Anfield win\nLiverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara says Jurgen Klopp's men will keep \"fighting for a small miracle\" to make the Champions League places after scoring his first goal for the club in the win against Southampton.\nIt is a victory that puts pressure on fourth-placed Leicester City, who lost 4-2 to Newcastle United on Friday.\nKlopp's men took full advantage of Leicester's defeat by moving within six points of the top four - and have a game in hand on the Foxes.\nSadio Mane opened the scoring against his former club, heading home Mohamed Salah's cross moments after Alisson had made two saves in quick succession.\nAlisson gifted Southampton a chance to equalise late in the game when he passed straight to Che Adams, but the Brazil goalkeeper made amends by saving the Scotland striker's shot.\nSpain midfielder Thiago then scored his first Reds goal in added time to hand Klopp his 100th win at Anfield in all competitions.\nIt will also have pleased the German manager that his side earned a clean sheet despite the inexperienced Nathaniel Phillips and Rhys Williams forming their centre-back pairing.\n\"There are small chances. We are realistic with our situation,\" Thiago told BBC Sport about his side's top-four hopes.\n\"The most important thing is the three points. We dominated the game and created a lot. If you can help with a goal it's more than welcome.\"\nSouthampton are still not safe from relegation but their Premier League status could be secured when West Bromwich Albion and Fulham play their matches later this weekend.\nA return to form at Anfield\nAfter being imperious at home in the past three seasons, Liverpool's title defence faltered mainly as a result of losing six top-flight games at Anfield for the first time in 67 years.\nBut despite being on a run of just one win from their last 10 home league games, they made a bright start against Southampton with Salah twice testing Fraser Forster early on and Diogo Jota firing straight at the former England goalkeeper.\nLiverpool's stand-in captain Georginio Wijnaldum also headed against the top of the crossbar from a corner, while a Saints break resulted in Alisson having to make a point-blank save from Adams with Nathan Redmond firing straight at him from the rebound.\nJust 40 seconds later, Senegal winger Mane rose above Kyle Walker-Peters to head home Salah's inswinging cross. Remarkably, it was the first time the forwards have combined for a goal in the Premier League this season.\nNathan Tella headed straight at Alisson just before the break, and after Adams spurned his opportunity late on, substitute Roberto Firmino fed Thiago to seal victory with a 20-yard strike into the bottom corner.\nReaction to Liverpool's win over Southampton\nGood experience for defensive duo\nPhillips and Williams became Liverpool's 20th centre-back pairing of an injury-hit season when they started the home defeat by Fulham on 7 March.\nWilliams had not started since, but with on-loan Turkey defender Ozan Kabak and Ben Davies - yet to play since signing in January - ruled out with \"minor fitness concerns\", the 20-year-old was reunited with Phillips, 24.\nThis time the academy products looked more assured than against the Cottagers. Williams gained possession more times than any other Liverpool player (eight), with Phillips making the most clearances (five).\nThey could not be faulted for Adams' first chance as they were left exposed by a break that allowed Tella to race clear.\nAnd while they were missing when Tella rose unchallenged for his header before half-time, it was Alisson who was very much the culprit when Adams should have equalised in the second half.\nThe visitors perhaps got in behind the Liverpool defence more often than boss Klopp would have liked but there is no doubt his inexperienced defensive pair will have learnt a lot from further top-flight exposure.\nPhillips in particular has shown up well with Liverpool's three key centre-backs injured and if he can help his side to more clean sheets in their last four games, they could salvage something from a miserable campaign.\nSaints feeling Ings' absence\nManager Ralph Hasenhuttl had tears in his eyes after Southampton beat Liverpool in the reverse fixture on 4 January, a win that lifted them up to sixth in the table.\nJust two league wins since then have left Saints looking over their shoulder and this latest defeat illustrated the main area in which they are lacking.\nThey made enough chances to get something from the game, with substitute Ibrahima Diallo also stinging the palms of Alisson with a second-half volley.\nBut in the continued absence of top-scorer Danny Ings, they struggled to find a finishing touch.\nWhile they hope the England striker returns before the end of the season, he is likely to have plenty of suitors in the summer,.\nEven if Saints can hang on to their prize asset, Hasenhuttl may feel he needs reinforcements up front if they are to avoid a similarly poor run next term.\n'Top four not impossible'\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp speaking to BBC Sport: \"They are well organised and have an intense style of play. They had their moments. We set up their biggest chance ourselves but we deserved the three points.\n\"We scored a really nice first goal but it's familiar for us now to not finish the game early so we had to stay in the game and scoring a wonderful second goal obviously was a big relief.\"\nOn being in the race for the top four: \"We are kind of. It's not impossible but it's difficult. We will give it a try and see where we get to.\"\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl speaking to BBC Sport: \"The difference was that they scored and we didn't. I think we maybe had more chances - clear chances - than they did.\n\"How we wanted to play was OK. We created good chances, we tried to build up through the lines and we were brave, as you have to be against a big side.\n\"We were cool until the final third and there the coolness was gone. This is what you need to have against such a team.\"\nSalah and Mane rekindle connection - the stats\nLiverpool kept their first home clean sheet in nine Premier League games, since drawing 0-0 with Manchester United in January.\nSouthampton have earned just 11 points from their 18 Premier League games in 2021, fewer than any other side this calendar year (W3 D2 L13).\nThey have now failed to score in five consecutive Premier League away games against Liverpool, with Sadio Mane the last player to score at Anfield for Saints in the competition in October 2015.\nMohamed Salah's assist for Mane's opener was the 15th time the duo have combined for a Premier League goal for Liverpool, but the first time this season.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold created five chances in the match, his most in a single Premier League game since February 2020 (six vs West Ham).\nMane has scored two goals in his last three Premier League games for Liverpool, having netted in just one of his previous 14.\nThiago became the 140th player to score a Premier League goal for Liverpool, and the first to score his first goal from outside the box since Divock Origi in December 2015.\nWhat next?\nLiverpool's rearranged game at Manchester United will take place on Thursday (20:15 BST), before they visit West Brom on Sunday (16:30).\nSouthampton host Crystal Palace on Tuesday (20:15) and have another home game on Saturday against Fulham (15:00).\nThe Northern Bank Job: The biggest bank heist in British and Irish history is revisited\nLife Changing: What's it like to lose all your memories overnight?"

        "article_text": "Wolves 2-1 Brighton: Nuno eager to 'build and improve' players\nManager Nuno Espirito Santo says now is the right time for Wolves to \"build and improve players\" after his youthful side came back from a goal down to beat 10-man Brighton.\nMorgan Gibbs-White, 21, scored a dramatic last-minute winner for the home side, who trailed at the break but benefited from Lewis Dunk's sending-off early in the second to take control of the game.\nDunk had earlier headed the visitors in front from a corner, but was punished for pulling back Fabio Silva after the forward had darted goal-side of him.\nSubstitute Adama Traore made a big impact on the game, providing a threat and scoring the equaliser after a one-two in the box with Silva.\nGibbs-White's first Premier League goal sealed the points for a Wolves side that contained five players under 21 and three teenagers, and which had an average age of just 24 years and 209 days.\n\"All the young players did well,\" Santo told BBC Sport. \"It's the right moment to try and build and improve players.\n\"I thought the reaction of my players in the second half was very good. In the first half we were really disappointed.\n\"The red card made a big difference. But we deserved the win.\"\nTo rub salt into Brighton's wounds, striker Neal Maupay received his side's second red card of the afternoon after the final whistle following a confrontation with referee Jonathan Moss.\nThe win takes Wolves to 45 points, with Brighton remaining 10 points ahead of 18th-placed Fulham and needing one more result to go their way to cement their Premier League place for 2021-22.\nWolves given glimpse of bright future\nAfter a promotion, two seventh-place finishes and a European adventure, this campaign represents a regression for Wolves, its low point the 4-0 hammering they suffered at the hands of Burnley in their last home game.\nThere are mitigating circumstances, not least the extra demands a Covid-affected 18 months has placed on what is a relatively small squad and the loss of main striker Raul Jimenez to a fractured skull in late November.\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that some of the Wanderers players are reaching the end of their natural shelf life at the club, but Nuno is now discovering that some of his younger charges have the potential to succeed them.\nThey were somewhat overawed in the first half against an experienced and physically domineering Brighton, but were afforded greater room to assert themselves in the second and show a level of composure and character that will please their boss.\nSilva has struggled at times this season, but has shown signs of late that he is adapting to the division and he played a key role in the second half, firstly drawing the foul from Dunk that altered the game.\nHe then played a neat one-two with Traore to set the winger up for his equalising goal.\nGibbs-White is another who has shown flashes of his ability, but not quite the consistency required.\nThe 21-year-old started the campaign on loan at Swansea in the Championship, but now back with his parent club he can start to build on his undoubted promise.\nAfter a few weeks where it has looked like Wolves were drifting to the conclusion of the season, they now have the first hints of a brighter future.\nBrighton undone by sending-off\nOn results and league position alone, you could be forgiven for thinking little progress has been made at Brighton in their four Premier League seasons, with Sunday's result another negative to add to the list.\nHowever, there has been a clear philosophy shift at the club and signs that Graham Potter is building something more robust and tactically intelligent than his managerial predecessors at the Amex Stadium.\nWith a full complement of players, they were the better side at Molineux, comfortably mixing a modern desire to play out from the back with older-school qualities of towering goalscoring headers from domineering centre-backs.\nEven with 10 men, they were well-drilled enough to restrict the home side to half-chances for much of the second half.\nLosing to two well taken goals having played for more than 30 minutes a man down is not something to be unduly concerned by, even if it means a delay in sealing their inevitable survival.\nMore concerning is the loss of discipline from Maupay at full-time, meaning Albion will now be without their leading striker as well as their captain through suspension.\n\"I'm disappointed with the result, disappointed we couldn't get the three points,\" said Brighton boss Graham Potter. \"Until you are safe you have to keep fighting.\n\"We gave everything and it wasn't to be. It (the red card) certainly made it a lot more difficult. We were good, we were deservedly in the lead and looking to add to that.\n\"I think Neal's red card was for speaking to the ref, he is frustrated, I don't know what's been said but he needs to be able to to handle that better.\n\"That's the challenge, it's not easy to deal with defeat and disappointment but we have to. We lose him so it's not positive for us.\"\nWolves claim first top-flight win over Seagulls\nIn what was their 12th such meeting, Brighton lost to Wolves in the top flight for the very first time, having won seven and drawn four of their first 11 top-tier league clashes.\nSince Wolves returned to the Premier League in 2018, only Manchester United (54) have recovered more points from losing positions in the competition than Nuno's side (51).\nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in this season's Premier League than Brighton (23, level with Southampton).\nSince they returned to the Premier League in 2018, only Liverpool (7) have scored more winning goals in the 90th minute or later of matches in the competition than Wolves (6).\nNo team has been given more Premier League red cards this season than Brighton (five, level with Arsenal), with Lewis Dunk the first player to be dismissed twice in the 2020-21 competition.\nAll of Adama Traore's seven Premier League goals have been scored in the second half, the most of any player to score all of his goals exclusively in the second half of matches.\nWolves' Morgan Gibbs-White (21y 102d) was the youngest English player to score a 90th-minute winning goal in the Premier League since Marcus Rashford for Manchester United v Bournemouth in November 2018 (21y 3d).\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2017, Brighton's Lewis Dunk has scored 11 goals in the competition, more than any other centre-back in this time, overtaking Virgil van Dijk (10) with his header against Wolves.\nBrighton's Lewis Dunk was the third player to both score and be red carded in the same Premier League game this season (also Erik Lamela v Arsenal in March & Christian Benteke v West Ham in December); it's the most this has happened in a single campaign since 2015-16 (five).\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to face Tottenham on Sunday, 16 May (14:05 BST), the day after Brighton host West Ham in a 20:00 BST kick-off.\nOur Silent Emergency: \"Like a lot of people in my generation, I struggle with my mental health\"\nThe Greatest Athlete You've Never Seen: Is 'Canelo' Alvarez the ultimate boxer?"

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 1-3 Man Utd: Red Devils' comeback keeps Man City waiting on title\nManchester United guaranteed a Premier League top-four finish and ensured rivals Manchester City must wait to be crowned champions as they came from behind to beat Aston Villa at Villa Park.\nHaving sealed their place in the Europa League final despite a 3-2 second-leg defeat by Roma on Thursday, second-half goals from Bruno Fernandes, Mason Greenwood and substitute Edinson Cavani - followed by West Ham's loss to Everton - sealed a Champions League place for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.\nA win for Villa would have clinched the title for leaders City - beaten 2-1 by Chelsea on Saturday - and Bertrand Traore's emphatic finish into the top corner midway through the first half threatened to do just that.\nEmiliano Martinez was equal to attempts from Greenwood and Marcus Rashford as United struggled to respond initially, while Dean Henderson kept out Ollie Watkins' strike to deny Villa a second before half-time.\nUnited levelled shortly after the restart when Fernandes calmly slotted in a penalty after Douglas Luiz needlessly fouled Paul Pogba, and Greenwood completed a four-minute turnaround when his low strike found the bottom corner.\nA VAR check for handball against Greenwood was dismissed after Luiz headed the ball onto the arm of the United forward and the visitors successfully resisted late Villa pressure despite the loss of captain Harry Maguire to injury, before Cavani confirmed victory in the closing stages.\nIn a frantic finale, Villa forward Watkins also received a red card for a second booking for simulation when under pressure from goalkeeper Henderson.\nUnited are 10 points behind champions-elect City but will have the chance to move within four points as they face Leicester and Liverpool before the leaders next play.\n'At least we don't travel back to a party on the Blue side' - Solskjaer happy to delay City title win\nFollow live text commentary of Sunday's Premier League action\nUnited fight back - again\nWith an exhausting short-term schedule to navigate, Solskjaer made four changes from United's midweek trip to Rome for his side's second fixture in a run of four in eight days - a situation created after last weekend's league meeting with Liverpool was postponed due to fan protests.\nHenderson, Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Victor Lindelof started at Villa Park, and while Lindelof should have offered greater resistance for Traore's opener, there was little Henderson could do to keep out his fine strike.\nSolskjaer's side have gone 1-0 down on more occasions (14) than they have gone ahead (13) in the competition this season but, for a Premier League record 10th time in 2020-21, they once again went on to rescue victory.\nWith poacher Cavani benched after scoring twice on Thursday, United initially struggled to test Martinez despite encouraging build-up play.\nBut they were rewarded for a much-improved second-half display, with Fernandes' spot-kick setting the tone for a side totally unfazed by falling behind.\nGreenwood made his latest claim to be included in Gareth Southgate's European Championship plans with his fifth goal in five Premier League games, though Maguire's early departure following a collision with Anwar El Ghazi will be a concern for both the England boss and Solskjaer.\nBut Cavani's accurate header from Rashford's cross ultimately capped a positive week for United, in which they reached a first final of the Solskjaer era and co-chairman Joel Glazer announced plans for his first meaningful discussions with fans since his family bought the club in 2005.\nVilla unable to end United hoodoo\nVictory over an Everton side seeking to keep their European hopes alive last week was further evidence of how far Dean Smith's side have progressed this season, even if results since the turn of the year have dipped.\nLast term, a 3-0 home defeat by Manchester United with four games to go left Villa second-bottom and four points from safety, before they rallied to survive by a single point.\nBattling on without injured captain Jack Grealish for a 12th successive match, a resolute defence denied United clear chances and Martinez looked comfortable when Greenwood and Rashford offered tests.\nTraore's lack of defensive support for right-back Matty Cash appeared an early concern as Luke Shaw found joy out wide, but he demonstrated his quality in the opposite half as he spun past Lindelof before unleashing a powerful drive into the far corner.\nBut once Luiz's trip on Pogba allowed United a foothold, Villa faced an uphill task as the visitors made it 22 Premier League visits to Villa Park without defeat.\nVilla remain 11th and have a top-half finish to aim for in their remaining four matches of a much-improved second season back in the top-flight.\n'We showed character, resilience and belief' - what the managers said\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to BBC Sport: \"A great result and it takes a little bit of pressure away from having to get results because the next two [versus Leicester and Liverpool] are against very good teams.\"\nOn coming from behind again to win: \"It shows character, resilience, belief, fitness.

It is a long season and I am delighted for everyone.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith to BBC Sport: \"I didn't think we started the game particularly well. We upped it and then I thought we were good first half, we high pressed well and got a good goal. We were quite comfortable at 1-0 at half-time. I think the game turns on the penalty decision.\n\"There was a touch but was it enough [for Paul Pogba] to go down? I watched Manchester City last night and Sterling had four touches in his back and doesn't get a penalty and today it is a penalty.

        "article_text": "West Ham United 0-1 Everton\nDominic Calvert-Lewin believes Everton have to \"keep believing\" after his winner reinforced their European credentials with a hard-earned victory away to Champions League hopefuls West Ham.\nAfter being fourth in the Premier League at the turn of the year, a run of six wins from 18 saw the Toffees slip to eighth.\nBut Ben Godfrey's slide-rule pass allowed Calvert-Lewin to score his 16th league goal of the season in the first half at London Stadium.\nAnd manager Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play with three centre-backs was justified as his side defended resolutely to secure a second straight away win having also won 1-0 at Arsenal last month.\nEverton remain eighth but are now one point behind seventh-placed Tottenham and three behind fifth-placed West Ham - with a game in hand on both.\nThe striker said: \"I think every game is getting more important from now until the end of the season, so we simply have to keep believing and go into every game trying to win.\"\nToffees boss Carlo Ancelotti added: \"It was a vital victory, if we don't win here we are out of the fight for Europe.\n\"There was pressure on the game but we managed the game well. We played defensively at the top, really good, and were really dangerous on the counter-attack.\"\nFor the Hammers, this is a big blow to manager David Moyes' hopes of again leading an unfancied team into the Champions League having done so as Everton boss in 2005.\nNewcastle won at fourth-placed Leicester on Friday but this defeat keeps West Ham five points off the top four with just three games left.\nA Europa League spot would be some consolation for Moyes and his former club aim to join West Ham after claiming their 11th away win in the league this season - and their fifth in London.\nPremier League: How many teams will qualify for Europe?\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nFrustrated Hammers fail to get a shot on target\nAfter 34 games last season, West Ham were fifth from the bottom, three points above the relegation zone. At the same stage this term, they were five points off the top four.\nSuch has been the turnaround in Moyes' first full season in charge, with victory at Everton on New Year's Day sparking a run of 11 wins from 18 league games coming into this game.\nThat run was buoyed by the arrival of Jesse Lingard on loan, but despite dominating possession, Lingard and his team-mates struggled to play through Everton's organised defence.\nTheir best chance of the first half saw Said Benrahma's wait for his first Premier League goal continue as he headed over from a Pablo Fornals cross.\nThe Algeria winger has now had 32 attempts without scoring in the Premier League - more than any other player.\nAfter the interval, Fornals had a shot blocked before spreading the play to Vladimir Coufal, whose low shot came back off the inside of the far post and substitute Jarrod Bowen was unable to steer the rebound goalwards.\nLingard was then booked for dissent as the visitors continued to frustrate the Hammers, who failed to register a shot on target.\nReaction as Everton win at West Ham\nCalvert-Lewin could have a big part to play at Euros\nAncelotti made three changes to the side beaten at home by Aston Villa last Saturday, bringing Michael Keane and Yerry Mina back into defence.\nBut Godfrey kept his place, as one of three centre-backs, in a system which allows defenders to step out of the backline when in possession and play the kind of ball that created Everton's opener.\nWith West Ham's defence seemingly set, Godfrey advanced into a pocket of space from halfway before spotting Calvert-Lewin's run off Craig Dawson and the ex-Norwich defender slid a ball into the right channel for the England striker to latch on to and slot inside the far post.\nWhile the Toffees remained dogged in defence, Calvert-Lewin showed why he is much more than just a goal threat and why he could be so valuable to England manager Gareth Southgate at the Euros.\nCalvert-Lewin's flick allowed Richarlison to test home goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski with a close-range effort in the first half, and he showed great hold-up play before picking out Seamus Coleman's run into the box late on, but the Everton captain's shot was blocked.\nThe 24-year-old created another chance to seal victory as he rounded Fabianski before standing up a cross for substitute Joshua King, whose header came back off the post.\nWith Romelu Lukaku now the only Everton player to have scored more goals in a Premier League campaign, Calvert-Lewin could be a key man for England this summer.\n'You can get greedy and forget where you've come from' - what they said\nWest Ham boss David Moyes: \"We kept it well, passed it well but just fell short in the final third. But you have to credit Everton for the way they defended. We just made one mistake that turned the game because prior to that there wasn't much from either side.\n\"I'd praise Everton more than I would question us on it. We needed a few things to drop for us today and they didn't. Overall this was a game of very few chances; we had lots of the ball and certainly didn't deserve to lose.\"\nAre West Ham's Champions League hopes over? \"I don't know; you never know how the other results have gone, so we will keep pushing.\n\"I think because we've lost today defeat might be costly. but you never know in football. If we qualify for Europe I think it would be an incredible achievement, no matter which competition it is.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti: \"We were strong defensively and effective on the counter-attack. We didn't have a lot of clear opportunities but we didn't concede a lot.\n\"If we lost this game, we were out of the fight but we are in the fight with great motivation. We have another important game on Thursday but the attitude was there after the bad performance against Aston Villa.\"\nOn Dominic Calvert-Lewin: \"It could be good for him to reach 20 goals, so he has four games to try to reach this target, which means he had a fantastic season.\n\"The movement for the goal was fantastic, the pass was perfect. I said to the strikers to focus there; it was the right pass and the right movement.\"\nToffees continue to do well on their travels - the stats\nOnly Manchester City (13) have won more Premier League away games than Everton (11) this season.\nEverton's 11 away wins are their most in a top-flight campaign since 1984-85 (12), when they won the title.\nEverton have won 14 of the 15 Premier League away games in which they have opened the scoring under Carlo Ancelotti, only dropping points from such a position against Arsenal in February 2020 (3-2 defeat).\nCalvert-Lewin has scored 16 league goals this season but is yet to make an assist - he is currently the highest-scoring player without an assist since Benni McCarthy in 2006-07 (18 goals).\nWest Ham have lost consecutive league games at home for the first time since December 2019, when they lost each of Manuel Pellegrini's final four home league games in charge.\nWest Ham have hit the woodwork more often than any other team in the Premier League this season (21).\nWhat next?\nWest Ham visit Brighton next Saturday (20:00 BST), while Everton play their game in hand at Aston Villa on Thursday (18:00) before hosting Sheffield United on Sunday (19:00)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-1 West Bromwich Albion: Baggies relegated after defeat\nWest Bromwich Albion have been relegated from the Premier League for a fifth time after a defeat at Arsenal that keeps alive the Gunners' slim hopes of qualifying for Europe.\nSam Allardyce's side were already virtually down but their return to the Championship is now confirmed, with the Baggies sitting 10 points from safety with three games remaining.\nEmile Smith Rowe volleyed a smart opener from Bukayo Saka's cross in the 29th minute after Arsenal had stemmed the visitors' promising start.\nNicolas Pepe made West Brom's task even more difficult six minutes later when he cut in from the right and curled into the top corner to double Arsenal's lead.\nMatheus Pereira gave the visitors hope, running from his own half to score a superb individual goal with 23 minutes remaining.\nBut it was not enough to stop West Brom suffering a joint-record fifth Premier League relegation, with Willian adding a late third for Arsenal from a free-kick.\nVictory means the Gunners, who were knocked out of the Europa League on Thursday, do at least still have a mathematical chance of playing European football next term.\nReaction as West Brom are relegated at Arsenal\nWill Sam Allardyce stay on to lead promotion bid?\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nAllardyce can't save Baggies\nThe fixture pitted two managers at contrasting ends of their coaching careers against each another but who are enduring similar periods of relative struggle.\nFor Allardyce, defeat at the Emirates confirms his first relegation from the Premier League as a manager, although the experienced 66-year-old had all but accepted their fate before the match.\nThe division's great escape artist replaced Slaven Bilic in December when the Baggies were 19th in the table and accepted the task of trying to guide them to survival.\nAllardyce has previously kept Blackburn Rovers, Sunderland and Crystal Palace in the English top flight after taking control in similar circumstances, but the rescue mission at the Hawthorns proved too big with West Brom managing just four wins in the 22 league games he has overseen.\nThey arrived in north London needing to double that tally and win all of their remaining matches, while also hoping that one of Burnley, Southampton and Brighton failed to win any of theirs.\nThe Baggies started well and Pereira curled narrowly wide from distance before again firing off target from a promising break, but that confidence drained once Arsenal broke the deadlock before the half-hour mark.\nIt took a magical moment from Pereira to spark them into life once more, with the Brazilian scoring his 10th league goal of the season with a driving run and smart finish, before his countryman Willian's free-kick put the game beyond the visitors.\nIt means West Brom return to the Championship at the first time of asking and join Norwich City as the only sides to be relegated from the Premier League on five occasions.\nWhether Allardyce, and indeed the impressive Pereira, are at the club to lead the promotion bid next season remains to be seen, with the former England boss saying he will discuss his future once he and the club have dealt with the disappointment of going down.\nYouth key to Arsenal rebuild\nAllardyce had little sympathy for under-pressure Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta before the game and said the Spaniard's time with the Gunners will \"determine his career going forwards\".\nSeventeen months into his managerial career and the 39-year-old's tenure in north London has come under the spotlight after a meek Europa League semi-final exit to Villarreal left the Gunners facing the prospect of no European football next season for the first time in 25 years.\nA place in the Europa League does remain an outside possibility with Arsenal sitting ninth, six points behind West Ham United in fifth and five behind Liverpool in sixth.\nEither way, Arteta insists big changes must be made to his squad for next season and expects the club's owners to back him in the transfer market.\nHe may well look to build his future side around two homegrown stars in Saka and Smith Rowe, who have been excellent this season and combined superbly for the latter to score the opening goal.\nThe influential Saka, 19, has made more assists than any Arsenal player since his debut in November 2018 and got his 19th for the club when he picked out Smith Rowe for the 20-year-old to guide a volley beyond Sam Johnstone.\nThat was Smith Rowe's first Premier League goal and Arteta said afterwards the playmaker is \"making the right steps\" but must now continue to score more.\nArteta will also be hoping club-record signing Pepe can produce more moments like the one that doubled the Gunners' lead soon after, while 19-year-old Gabriel Martinelli was trusted to lead the attack with captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left on the bench.\n'Relegation painful for club and players'\nWest Brom manager Sam Allardyce speaking to Match of the Day: \"It has been looking difficult for a while and we haven't taken our chance to give ourselves a better opportunity of staying up.\n\"I think these players should be fighting to stay out of it. They have performed well enough but our capabilities of scoring have deserted us.\n\"It is a disappointing night but we have to take it on the chin. It is not as painful for me as it is for the club or players. It is painful, I wanted it for the club and players more than me, but it hasn't happened. Everyone has to accept it and recover quickly.\"\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to Match of the Day: \"The best way to do it is with the right attitude. The three goals were very different but really good individual and collective actions.\n\"We have done so many right steps, some you can see and some you can't. The foundations are there.\"\nBig Sam struggles at the Emirates - the stats\nArsenal recorded back-to-back Premier League victories for just the second time in 2021, having previously done so in January.\nOf the five relegations West Brom have suffered from the Premier League, only in 2002-03 was their relegation confirmed with more games remaining (four).\nArsenal are unbeaten in their past 30 Premier League home games against promoted sides (W25 D5), with their last such defeat in November 2010 against Newcastle.\nSam Allardyce has failed to pick up a point in his 10 Premier League trips to Emirates Stadium, with only Harry Redknapp at Old Trafford (15 visits) managing more matches at a single venue without earning at least one point.\nEmile Smith Rowe is the fourth player aged 21 or under to score for Arsenal in the Premier League this season (along with Saka, Martinelli and Nketiah) - no team have had more.\nMatheus Pereira is the first West Brom player to reach 10 goals in a Premier League campaign since Saido Berahino scored 14 in 2014-15.\nWhat next?\nArsenal visit Chelsea on Wednesday (20:15 BST), while West Brom host Liverpool on Sunday (16:30)."

First, his header was deflected agonisingly wide by Tosin Adarabioyo before Areola made an excellent save from the New Zealand forward at the subsequent corner.\nMoments later, a direct ball behind the Fulham defence found Vydra and he skipped beyond Joachim Andersen before picking out Westwood for a simple finish with Areola stranded, before Wood fired a second beyond the on-loan Paris St-Germain goalkeeper.\nWith Ben Mee, who was making his 350th appearance for the club, alongside Tarkowski in central defence the Clarets then stood firm as Fulham applied some pressure in the second half as they sought to keep their slim survival hopes alive.\nDyche can now look forward to a summer transfer window under new owners and the prospect of some, albeit not huge, investment in his squad.\n\"I'm pleased for a lot of people at the club,\" said Dyche. \"It is important for the club, it is important for the town. It's been a real challenging season with the sale of the club.\n\"There was not a lot of investment from the outgoing owners and we've had a lot of injury problems.\"\n'I have nothing but sadness'\nFulham boss Scott Parker speaking to BBC Sport: \"It has been looming but it doesn't hide the disappointment, hurt and sadness I feel tonight. I am gutted.\n\"This year at times, while we have had some big improvements and pushed on in certain elements, the facts are we have fallen short. We have not been quite good enough.\n\"At this moment in time I have nothing but sadness. Now and in the coming days we will have a long, hard think and regroup. My job is to make sure these games end in the right way.\n\"The club needs to make big decisions. We've had a relegation, a promotion and a relegation. The rollercoaster of that and the highs and lows is not something you want.\n\"As a football club we need to make good decisions and work out where we want to go.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to BBC Sport: \"Fulham changed their style, putting the ball forward a lot quicker than they have been doing.\n\"We dealt with that well and scored two good goals. The second half became a dogfight and we are good at that.\"\nRelegation wrapped up in record time - the stats\nBurnley have won on five of their last eight Premier League trips to London (lost three) after enjoying just three victories on their previous 30.\nFulham have failed to score in 11 home league games in a season for just the second time in their history (also 11 in the third tier in 93-94).\nThey are the first side to do so in the top flight since Manchester City in 2006-07 (13 in total).\nBurnley named an unchanged starting XI for the seventh time in the Premier League this season, with only Leeds (10) and Aston Villa (8) doing so more often.\nSix of Ashley Westwood's seven Premier League goals for Burnley have come away from Turf Moor.\nThe midfielder scored in consecutive away appearances for the second time with the Clarets in the top flight.\nMatej Vydra registered his 10th Premier League goal involvement for Burnley (6 goals, 4 assists in 57 apps) with five of those in his last nine games (3 goals, 2 assists).\nWhat next?\nFulham visit Southampton on Saturday (15:00 BST), while Burnley host Leeds United on the same day (12:15).\nSnowfall is back: Hard-hitting drama about the crack epidemic in 1980s LA streaming now\nHow Gen Z is learning to adapt and thrive: Young entrepreneurs find new ways to make money in Covid times"

But the centre-half was sat in the stand with a protective boot on, so his presence was missed at the corner that proved decisive, both for Leicester and Manchester City.\nNo protests but leaky Old Trafford roof\nThe mass protests that led to the late postponement of a scheduled match against Liverpool on 2 May have triggered the offer of peace talks from United co-chairman Joel Glazer.\nThis may be unprecedented but after 16 years of zero engagement, it is no wonder many fans are sceptical.\nThey view the Glazer family's tenure of their club almost exclusively in negative terms.\nIn order to prevent a repeat of those previous scenes, barricades were put in place on the Old Trafford forecourt and huge numbers of police and security staff were guarding them.\nThere were no protestors as it turned out but the process will be repeated in two days' time, when Liverpool visit again, although what happens next week, when Old Trafford will have a maximum of 10,000 fans back inside for the final home game of the season against Fulham, will be interesting.\nAs if to underline it is not just their team that gives United fans cause for concern, a leak in the roof which meant journalists sitting on a certain row got wet on an awful night weather wise, was evidence of the need for investment in the infrastructure as well.\nWhat the managers said\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We've had loads of games recently and had to make changes and that went against us a little bit. Amad [Diallo] was very good. [Anthony] Elanga gave us something different and I thought Mason [Greenwood] was absolutely fantastic.\n\"I know what he can do finishing, it's all the other bits, his robustness, resilience and the way he led the line tonight. He thought he needed to take responsibility and he did that the whole night but I had to take him off because he has played three games in five days.\n\"We did a bit in training yesterday and this morning so we did not have a lot of time to prepare and you could probably see that early on.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It feels really good. I am really happy with the win and the performance. We started well and scored a really good goal.\n\"The move was perfect from our perspective. It was an amazing finish from Luke [Thomas] but we invited pressure by passing too slowly. If you pass the ball slowly top players press the game and they have some top players here.\n\"I am so happy for the players because we were disappointed after the last performance.\"\nThe best stats\nLeicester won an away top-flight game against Man Utd for the first time since January 1998 (1-0), with this just their second such win in their last 23 visits to Old Trafford (W2 D5 L16).\nManchester United have lost five Premier League games at Old Trafford this season, as many as in their previous two campaigns combined.\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers became the fourth different manager to win against United at Old Trafford in the Premier League with two different teams after Jose Mourinho, Rafael Ben\u00edtez and Martin O'Neill.\nSince the start of last season, Mason Greenwood has scored more goals in all competitions than any other teenager in Europe's top five leagues (29).\nAmad Diallo's assist for Mason Greenwood was the first time a teenager assisted another teenager for a Premier League goal since David Wheater set up Adam Johnson for Middlesbrough in May 2006.\nLeicester City's Luke Thomas (19 years and 335 days) is the 10th different teenager to score a Premier League goal against United at Old Trafford and the first since Matty Longstaff in December 2019. Thomas became the youngest player to score his first Premier League goal in a match against Manchester United at Old Trafford.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United are next in action against Liverpool at Old Trafford on Thursday, 13 May (20:15 BST).\nLeicester feature in Saturday's FA Cup final with Chelsea at Wembley (17:15 BST).

        "article_text": "Southampton 3-1 Crystal Palace: Danny Ings scores twice as hosts fightback to win\nDanny Ings scored twice as Southampton fought back to beat Crystal Palace in an entertaining Premier League affair.\nIngs, returning from a hamstring injury, steered a low effort into the bottom corner to level after Christian Benteke had driven in an early opener for the visitors.\nAnd the hosts, who were thankful for goalkeeper Fraser Forster's penalty save from Luka Milivojevic, had the better of a seesaw contest after the break.\nChe Adams put them ahead with a neat close-range finish from Stuart Armstrong's corner and Ings latched on to a pass from his strike partner to round off the scoring.\nSaints' first win in five games moves them up to 14th in the table, with Palace in 13th, a point above them.\nReaction as Southampton beat Crystal Palace\nIngs sparks Saints\nWith both teams having already secured their Premier League status for next season there was very little riding on this fixture other than pride. But it was far from a typical end-of-season affair.\nBenteke's early goal set the tone for that before Ings took over, pushing his England credentials for the Euros this summer with some superb finishing and excellent link play with Adams.\nHad Ings - who has had a stop-start campaign with injuries and after testing positive for Covid-19 - been available throughout the season, Ralph Hasenhuttl's side may have entered the concluding weeks of the season with plenty still to play for.\nHaving been third in the table in mid-December, this was only Saints' fourth top-flight victory since the turn of the year.\nAnd their FA Cup semi-final defeat to Leicester in April now appears the defining moment in a campaign that began promisingly but has petered out over recent weeks.\nThe combination of Ings and Adams, who has doubled his goal tally from last term with eight, does at least provide some encouragement for next term.\nAs does the enduring form of captain, James Ward-Prowse, who made more passes than any other player and was a driving force from midfield.\nIf Ward-Prowse is already likely to be under consideration by England coach Gareth Southgate, his colleague Forster was also excellent, making several telling saves, most notably from the penalty spot to suggest he could yet add to his six Three Lions caps.\nPalace alter their approach\nUnlike many of Crystal Palace's away trips, this was a performance devoid of the pragmatism upon which manager Roy Hodgson usually insists.\nBenteke, Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew were deployed in a front three with Eberechi Eze providing support from midfield. And until Ings scored, the visitors' bold approach looked to have caught Southampton cold.\nBenteke in particular was a handful, and on another night he may have added to his tally through sheer perseverance, bringing the best out of Forster with one stinging drive and seeing several others blocked by defenders.\nZaha, was elusive cutting in from the left and it was his control and touch which drew a foul from Nathan Redmond and provided Milivojevic with the chance to restore their lead.\nWhile equalling their best-ever Premier League finish of 10th now looks beyond them, three consecutive victories to finish could still bring up 50 points for the first time since the English top-flight was reformed in 1992-93.\n'No big gamble' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hassenhuttl speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is the worst thing that should happen, they always score very early, it didn't kill our game plan because we knew we would have a lot of possession and try to create chances.\n\"We could have scored even more. We tried to move them around and they had big problems with our attacking stuff. We needed Fraser Forster before half-time because the penalty save was important.\"\nOn Danny Ings: \"No big gamble because I left him out against Liverpool and he wanted to play, I knew against Palace I needed his quality in the box and this is what we got today. It is good to see and good for the team. This is Danny Ings.\"\nOn the rest of the season: \"To bring as many points as possible, climb a few positions, we know we have had some issues since Christmas - 2020 was fantastic and 2021 so far not, it is now time to turn it around and have a promising ending.\n\"We will not forget what problems we have and to try to solve them in the summer - we have a small squad and need more players.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson to BBC Sport: \"It's disappointing. It hinges on those two minutes before and after half-time.\n\"Had we taken the penalty things could have been different. After we went behind I thought we played OK, we had a few chances and we looked as though we had the threat and we decided to throw caution to the wind and of course on the counter attack we concede the third goal.\n\"Benteke played well again tonight, he was unlucky not to get a second goal. He must be pleased with his night's work. We aren't satisfied with the performance but we can't be accused of not giving it our best shot.\n\"Football is a constant succession of mountains to climb, we won't let the club or fans down, we'll try our best. We want to win the last three games and we'll have to play at least as well as we did on Saturday.\"\nSaints' set-piece threat - the stats\nSouthampton have taken seven points from their last three home games (W2 D1), having won just five points from their previous 24 available to them at St Mary's (W1 D2 L5).\nOnly bottom two sides West Bromwich Albion (1) and Sheffield United (0) have kept fewer away clean sheets in the Premier League this season than Crystal Palace (2).\nCrystal Palace have opened the scoring in the second minute in each of their last two Premier League games - they had previously scored in the opening 2 minutes in just three of their 459 matches in the competition.\nFourteen of Southampton's 44 Premier League goals this season have come from set-piece situations (excluding penalties), the highest ratio in the division (31.8%). Che Adams' strike tonight was from a corner.\nDanny Ings' leveller for Southampton was the 100th in his professional club career in all competitions (now 101). He's scored more for Saints (46) than he has for any other side (Burnley 43, Bournemouth 8, Liverpool 4).\nSeven of Christian Benteke's eight Premier League goals for Crystal Palace this season have come away from home, the highest ratio of any player to score at least five times this season (88%).\nSouthampton keeper Fraser Forster has saved three of the last five penalties he's faced in the Premier League, though tonight was his first such stop in the competition since September 2017.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host relegated Fulham in their next Premier League fixture on Saturday, 15 May (15:00 BST).\nCrystal Palace welcome Aston Villa to Selhurst Park for their next top-flight game on Sunday, 16 May (12:00 BST).\nSnowfall is back: Hard-hitting drama about the crack epidemic in 1980s LA streaming now\nHow Gen Z is learning to adapt and thrive: Young entrepreneurs find new ways to make money in Covid times"

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-1 Arsenal: Blues boss Thomas Tuchel accepts responsibility for loss\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel says he takes full responsibility for his side's home defeat by Arsenal after making seven changes for the game.\nThe Blues had claimed an impressive win at Manchester City on Saturday to delay the Premier League champions' title celebrations and boost their hopes of a top-four finish.\nHowever, with an FA Cup final against Leicester coming up on Saturday, only four players retained their places in Tuchel's side for Wednesday's visit of Arsenal.\nIt was still a strong line-up but a mistake by Jorginho in the first half allowed Emile Smith Rowe to score what proved to be the winning goal for Arsenal and, although Chelsea dominated possession and hit the woodwork twice late on, they couldn't find an equaliser.\nChelsea remain fourth on 64 points but the defeat will give their rivals hope of sneaking into the top four. They are six points ahead of West Ham, who have a game in hand, and seven ahead of Liverpool, who have two games in hand on the Blues.\n\"I'm a bit angry that we had so many changes, that's on me,\" said Tuchel.\n\"I'm not so happy in the end with the line-up, but I didn't know what would happen, I didn't feel us today like I normally do and we can't expect to win games if we're not 100% in games.\n\"I'm not happy with what I saw, I have my responsibility because I picked the line-up, but the performance was the performance.\"\nJorginho's error will have been disappointing for Tuchel. The midfielder misjudged a pass back that was in danger of trickling over the line before Kepa Arrizabalaga managed to claw the ball away but only to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who teed up Smith Rowe to slot in.\nChristian Pulisic thought he had equalised on the hour but his strike was ruled out by the video assistant referee for offside, while Bernd Leno pushed Kurt Zouma's header onto the bar in injury time before Olivier Giroud's volley also bounced back off the woodwork.\nThe victory also meant the Gunners completed the double over the Blues for the first time in 17 years to boost their own hopes of ensuring they are playing European football next season.\nArsenal are eighth and just one point behind Tottenham in seventh, although have played a game more.\nReaction to Chelsea's defeat to Arsenal\nRace for the top four - how are the contenders shaping up?\nOff day for Chelsea gives hope to chasing pack\nChelsea have been hugely impressive under Tuchel and, while the immediate goal is getting the points required to cement a top-four finish this season, the signs are good that they should be title challengers next term.\nThe two-legged win against Real Madrid in the semi-final of the Champions League highlighted how difficult a side they are to beat but this game also showed that they can sometimes be their own worst enemy.\nJorginho's mistakes, when he attempted a blind pass back to Kepa, was the eighth time the Blues have made errors leading to opposition goals in the Premier League this season, a number surpassed only by Liverpool (nine) and Chelsea's most in a single league campaign since 2015-16.\nDespite that Chelsea had plenty of opportunities to get a result but were wasteful in front of goal. Kai Havertz should have scored before Smith Rowe's opener but blazed over when one-on-one while Giroud also had a good chance to equalise in the second half.\nChelsea may have had half a mind on Saturday's FA Cup final against Leicester and they are still in a great position to finish in the top four but the defeat - only their third under Tuchel - will give hope to the chasing pack.\nLiverpool's next two games are away to Manchester United and relegated West Brom and if they are to win those they would only be a point behind Chelsea with two games remaining.\n\"We didn't have a shot for almost the whole second half,\" added Tuchel.\n\"Maybe we deserved this, we will learn something.\"\nA welcome win, but still work to do for Arsenal\nA win at a strong Chelsea side is certainly a very good result and one that keeps alive Arsenal's hopes of avoiding missing out on European football for the first time in 27 seasons.\nThe performance was for large periods a disappointing one as, bar Smith Rowe's tap-in following Jorginho's mistake, they struggled to create anything of note as they spent the majority of the game camped in their own half.\nBut to their credit they were organised in defence, particularly when they came under pressure late on and while they rode their luck at times it was another positive result as the Gunners try to put behind them the disappointment of failing to reach the Europa League final.\nArsenal still look a long way off a side that will challenge for the top four again anytime soon but it is now three Premier League wins in a row and, with games against Crystal Palace and Brighton remaining, they have the opportunity to finish an underwhelming season in a positive fashion.\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta said: \"I am really happy with a lot of things we have done, right from the first minute, the attitude and the desire to win that we showed.\n\"We had to dig in - you have to against this team because they are a fantastic team. We did it and we put [in] everything that we had to try to get the best possible result, and we did it.\"\nDouble delight for Arsenal - the stats\nArsenal completed their first Premier League double over Chelsea since the 2003-04 season, while this was their first league win at Stamford Bridge since October 2011, ending an eight-game winless run there (D2 L6).\nArsenal have won three consecutive away Premier League matches without conceding for the first time since May 2013 under Arsene Wenger.\nArsenal have had a different player aged younger than 21 score in each of their last three Premier League matches against Chelsea - Gabriel Martinelli in January 2020, Bukayo Saka in December 2020 and Emile Smith Rowe tonight.\nBilly Gilmour has started each of Chelsea's last three Premier League games - the 19-year-old is the first Scottish teenager to start three consecutive top-flight matches since Grant Hanley for Blackburn Rovers, in a run ending on New Year's Day 2011.\nChelsea have conceded 26 goals in 19 Premier League games when Antonio Rudiger hasn't started this season, compared to just seven conceded in the 17 games when the German has started.\nChelsea's Mason Mount created more chances than any other player (four), taking his tally for the season to 82; only Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes has created more in the Premier League this season (92).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea's focus switches to the FA Cup final as they face Leicester at Wembley on Saturday, 15 May (17:15 BST), while Arsenal are next in action on Wednesday, 19 May (19:00 BST) when they travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League.\n'I stole \u00a370,000 to feed my addiction': Meet the young gamblers struggling to overcome betting's mental grip\nThe Joe Wicks Podcast is back: He talks to Sir Mo Farah about choosing a positive route in life"

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 0-0 Everton: Drab stalemate dents visitors' European hopes\nEverton's hopes of finishing in the Premier League's European places suffered a blow as they played out a goalless draw at Aston Villa.\nIn an uninspiring contest devoid of quality Tyrone Mings headed Villa's best chance wide from Douglas Luiz's cross.\nSubdued for long periods of the first half, Everton improved after the break, with Ben Godfrey drawing a save from home goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez from Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick.\nAndre Gomes wastefully lashed a left-footed effort over the bar as the visitors chased a winner but Martinez was rarely called upon, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin's late header his only other save of note.\nThe result leaves Carlo Ancelotti's side eight points adrift of Chelsea in fourth, with West Ham, Liverpool and Tottenham all better placed to qualify for Europe.\nVilla, who welcomed captain Jack Grealish back from injury as a second-half substitute, remain 11th in the table.\nFollow all Thursday's Premier League action\nEverton's missed opportunity\nEverton arrived at Villa Park hoping to maintain their fine away record that accounted for 65% of their Premier League points this term.\nAnd while there was the added incentive of gaining revenge against a Villa side that won at Goodison Park 12 days ago, they only showed sporadic flashes of attacking ambition.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure, Richarlison, Michael Keane and Calvert-Lewin all failed to convert when presented with good chances, with Martinez producing an outstanding save to keep out the England forward's header.\nFour draws and defeat in their last seven matches points to a side that has always seemed to be chasing others above them without ever being able to apply any serious pressure.\nWhile they again looked solid defensively - restricting the hosts to just two efforts on target - Ancelotti's side will need to show more attacking ambition in their final three fixtures against Sheffield United, Wolves and Manchester City.\nMartinez and Grealish buoy Villa\nIn a game where Villa displayed few moments of real quality, the return of Grealish offered a timely boost to Villa boss Dean Smith and England manager Gareth Southgate, who is soon to name his squad for the European Championship.\nVilla have enjoyed a 50% Premier League win ratio when Grealish has featured this term, compared to 25% in his absence.\nAnd while he was unable to influence the result in his 26-minute cameo, he showed a few good touches and made one superb darting run from right to left to evade several Everton defenders.\nAt the other end of pitch, Martinez showed exemplary reactions and competence throughout.\nThe Argentine has looked an astute acquisition by Smith and his 15th shut-out of the season saw him equal Brad Friedel's club record for clean sheets in the Premier League era (set in 2009-10).\n'We needed a spark' - what they said\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith, speaking to Sky Sports: \"I thought we controlled the ball well in the first half without creating chances. The second half was a bit scrappy. It started as a basketball game but we never took the control we wanted. They had the later chances.\n\"JJ [Jacob Ramsey] coming on and Jack [Grealish] helped us. We looked like we could create something in final third. That was what was missing for us. It is another clean sheet, we haven't had one for six or seven games.\n\"We knew he [Emiliano Martinez] would be important for us. He's done really well. With Tom Heaton injured at the start of the season we needed someone. He's made it his number one jersey.\"\nOn Grealish:\"The medical staff said [bring him on at minute] 75 but I twisted their arm to get a few more minutes out of him. I felt we were flat in the final third and needed a spark. He won't be ready to start at Crystal Palace.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is a point, what can I say? Not satisfied for the result, satisfied for the performance. We could win but we have to take this point and try to win the next game. We have to try to win the home games, where we have had difficulty this season.\n\"Villa are a good team, to win here is not easy. I think our performance was the best that we can. We could probably do a bit better with the final pass or final shot but in general the performance was good.\"\nOn race for Europe: \"I am really positive. We have a great opportunity and we have to try to do our best. I said at the start of the season the European positions will be decided by the last game, I think they will be decided by the last game and we want to be there.\"\nFamiliar foes - the stats\nThis was the 206th league meeting between Aston Villa and Everton (all in the top-flight), extending its record as the most played match in English league history.\nOnly 12 days separated the two Premier League games between Aston Villa and Everton this season, the smallest gap between two sides meeting in the competition since a three-day gap between Arsenal's two clashes with Bolton in January 2010.\nEverton have kept four consecutive away clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since August 1995 (a run of five) with the Toffees' haul of nine away shutouts in the top flight this season a joint-high tally (level with Manchester City).\nAston Villa have won just one of their last eight home Premier League games (D3 L4) after winning three out of four directly before that.\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti has enjoyed just one win in his seven Premier League games against Aston Villa (D4 L2), his outright worst win rate against an opponent in the competition (14%, min. 5 meetings).\nAston Villa's Jack Grealish made a substitute appearance in a league game for the first time since 6 May 2018 in the Championship, against Millwall.\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa travel to Crystal Palace for their next Premier League game on Sunday, 16 May (12:00 BST).

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-4 Liverpool: Visitors boost top-four hopes with win\nJurgen Klopp celebrated his first win at Old Trafford as Liverpool came from behind to beat Manchester United and boost their chances of a Champions League place.\nIn a thrilling game played against the backdrop of noisy protests against the United ownership outside the ground, United struck first through Bruno Fernandes' deflected opener.\nBut Liverpool, who had seen one of their buses prevented from picking team members up before the game after being blocked in the street, hit back through Diogo Jota's instinctive effort.\nRoberto Firmino, who had only scored once since his two-goal haul at Crystal Palace in December, then put his side on top with a well-taken double either side of half-time.\nMarcus Rashford pulled one back for United midway through the second half but Mohamed Salah wrapped up the points with a late breakaway strike for his 21st Premier League goal of the season.\nThat moved him level with Harry Kane in the Golden Boot standings and condemned Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side to a sixth home defeat of the season.\nThe result takes Liverpool fifth in the Premier League. If they win at West Brom on Sunday they will close to within one and three points respectively of FA Cup finalists Chelsea and Leicester, who still have to play each other at Stamford Bridge on 18 May.\nRead reaction to Liverpool's win at Manchester United\nLiverpool make light of penalty controversy\nBrendan Rodgers was in charge in March 2014, the last time Liverpool beat United in an away game.\nJordan Henderson's groin injury meant there was no-one left from that night in the visitors' ranks, and Klopp celebrated his debut United away win with a double fist-pump as Salah scored.\nSalah might have had the chance to get on the scoresheet much earlier in the game had referee Anthony Taylor not consulted the pitch side monitor and changed his decision to give a penalty for Eric Bailly's tackle on Nat Phillips.\nKnowing victory was needed to maintain a realistic top-four chance, Klopp appeared distinctly unimpressed by the incident. The Ivorian defender certainly played the ball first but the force behind the challenge sent the Liverpool defender flying.\nIn a game that started to the sound of a police helicopter whirring overhead, Liverpool did not have to wait long for another chance.\nJota's finish was excellent but United's defence stood off Phillips after a corner, allowing him to run and turn before his shot spun to the feet of his Portuguese team-mate.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold's superb free-kick delivery to the far post in first-half stoppage time invited Firmino's header to put Liverpool ahead - and was a timely reminder of his ability with England boss Gareth Southgate watching from the stands.\nUnited struggle without Maguire\nThis was one of those nights that made you wonder how United have managed to get themselves in line for a second-place finish.\nUnlike Tuesday's defeat by Leicester, this could not be put down to a weakened team.\nThe hosts even had a helping had for their opening goal, as Phillips turned home a Fernandes effort that may just have been curling in at the far post.\nLiverpool's first two goals exposed long-existing frailties defending set-pieces. Their third was terrible defensively, as Fred giving the ball away with a blind pass to the wing from inside his own box.\nDean Henderson then spilled Alexander-Arnold's fierce shot straight to Firmino, who applied the first-time finish.\nAnother misplaced Fred pass began the counter-attack that led to Jota firing against the post. Little wonder Harry Maguire, sat in the stands nursing an ankle injury that threatens to keep him out of the Europa League final with Villarreal on 26 May, bellowed encouragement from the sidelines.\nThe flowing move that led to Rashford's goal on 68 minutes showed United's attacking ability but, without Maguire, they struggle badly at the back at Salah's pace exposed them again at the end to finish off any hope of a comeback.\nAngry United fans make voices heard again\nAddressing the protests before the game that Greater Manchester Police revealed had led to two arrests, a club official said the Glazer family were committed to communicating to supporters in a different way.\nQuite simply, many of those fans do not believe the message.\nCo-chairman Joel Glazer is due to speak at a Fans Forum for the first time after the season has finished. Before that though, United must get through their final home game of the campaign, against Fulham on 18 May, when 10,000 fans will be in attendance.\nIt is impossible to conceive the barriers that have been erected outside the stadium will remain with so many people about. It is fairly obvious the huge numbers of police will be back, although there is nothing they can do to stop the anti-Glazer chants that seem almost inevitable.\nSalah joins exclusive club - the stats\nManchester United have lost two home games in the space of three days for the first time since April 1958.\nUnited have conceded 27 home goals in the Premier League this season, their most in a single league campaign since 1969-70 (also 27).\nLiverpool are unbeaten in seven Premier League games (W5 D2), the longest current run without defeat in the competition. The Reds had lost six of their seven league games prior to this run.\nA total of 33% of United's Premier League goals conceded this season have been from set piece situations (14/42, excluding penalties), the highest ratio in the division.\nThis was the second Premier League home game this season that United found themselves behind at half-time having opened the scoring (also v Spurs) - this had only happened once in the previous 28 Premier League campaigns (v Liverpool in 2008-09).\nIn his 200th appearance for Liverpool in all competitions, Salah netted his 124th goal for the Reds - only Roger Hunt (133) and Gordon Hodgson (125) scored more for the club in their first 200 games.\nFirmino scored his 17th headed goal in the Premier League for Liverpool - only Robbie Fowler (21) has scored more headers for the Reds in the competition.\nRashford has scored five goals in his last five appearances against Liverpool, with Thursday's strike his 50th at Old Trafford in all competitions for United.\nMaking his 50th Premier League appearance, Fernandes' opener was his 44th league goal involvement for United (26 goals, 18 assists). Only Eric Cantona (46) and Robin van Persie (45) have been involved in more in their first 50 for the club in the competition.\nWhat next?\nManchester United are next in action against Fulham, which is due to be the first game at Old Trafford in front of fans since March last year, on Tuesday, 18 May (18:00 BST). Liverpool go to relegated West Brom on Sunday, 16 May (16:30 BST).\n'I stole \u00a370,000 to feed my addiction': Meet the young gamblers struggling to overcome betting's mental grip\nThe Joe Wicks Podcast is back: He talks to Sir Mo Farah about choosing a positive route in life"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 3-4 Manchester City: Ferran Torres scores hat-trick as visitors win classic\nManchester City twice came from behind to win a Premier League classic against Newcastle in their first game since being confirmed as champions.\nFerran Torres scored a hat-trick for City and his superb backheeled finish was the highlight of a remarkable game that swung back and forth.\nPep Guardiola, who surprisingly selected Scott Carson in goal - almost a decade on from his last English top-flight game - saw his City side dominate early on but fall behind to Emil Krafth's powerful header from Jonjo Shelvey's corner.\nJoao Cancelo equalised with a deflected effort into the bottom right corner and when Torres expertly turned home Ilkay Gundogan's free-kick 185 seconds later it looked as though the visitors could cut loose.\nBut Steve Bruce, who called upon his Newcastle side to go toe-to-toe with the champions, will have been delighted by their response.\nHaving been forced to soak up considerable pressure, they levelled when City defender Nathan Ake was deemed to have fouled Joelinton, allowing the Brazilian to score from the penalty spot.\nA poorly judged tackle by City full-back Kyle Walker handed the Magpies a second penalty just after the hour mark, with Joe Willock following-up to score after Carson had saved his initial spot-kick.\nHowever, man of the match Torres had the final word, guiding Gabriel Jesus' cross into the top right corner and then becoming the youngest player to score a league hat-trick for a Guardiola team, when turning in a Cancelo shot that bounced back off the Newcastle post.\nIt rounded off a captivating encounter and brought up another milestone for Guardiola's side, who set a new league record with their 12th consecutive victory away from home.\nCould Torres replace Aguero up front for Man City?\nRelive the action as Manchester City beat Newcastle United in thriller\nNewcastle step up in class\nBruce's side delivered a wonderful performance in their win at Leicester a week ago, but playing against the newly crowned champions represented a sizable step up in class.\nAnd if the complement of players at Guardiola's disposal was not already a concern, their assignment was made more challenging by the absence of the injured Callum Wilson.\nNewcastle have not won any of the nine matches in which their England forward has missed this season but the manner in which they pushed a City side who are 13 points clear at the top of the table offers plenty of encouragement.\nWilson's understudy, Joelinton, who has underwhelmed since his club-record move in 2019, gave Ake and his defensive partner Eric Garcia plenty of problems.\nAnd the supporting cast of Willock, Miguel Almiron and Saint-Maximin caused City problems down the flanks.\nThe on-loan Arsenal player surprised Raheem Sterling with this pace in the first half and his acceleration caught Walker out to give the Magpies their second penalty of the evening.\nWhile City's class eventually told, it was not before they had been put under severe pressure by a side that a few weeks previous were in the relegation conversation.\nCity's roll continues\nHow every Premier League manager must wish to have the depth of talent that City boss Guardiola has in his ranks.\nThe sight of Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden and Ruben Dias sitting in the stand served as a reminder of that depth, with the champions also travelling north with Ederson, Sergio Aguero and Kevin de Bruyne.\nIn their absence, dogged opponents provided a reminder of just how demanding the Premier League can be but they more than merited their win.\nWith the EFL Cup and Premier League already secure City had the luxury of using their final three matches to prepare for their Champions League final against Chelsea on 29 May.\nBut while there was a touch of sentimentality around giving Carson his first taste of Premier League football since 22 May 2011, the way in which Guardiola urged his team to maintain their standards spoke volumes.\nHe looked far from happy at the way in which his side conceded at least two of the goals but also appeared delighted by the way that Torres came to the fore.\nIn a squad containing so much firepower, the 21-year-old has at times looked on the periphery since his move from Valencia - starting just 14 times.\nAnd if this was a glimpse of the Spain winger at his best their will be a number of clubs concerned by what he is capable of, given an extended run.\n'Maybe Torres is a striker' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Overall our attacking play was good on the counter-attack and we just weren't quite good enough on the night.\n\"The biggest compliment I can pay them is that it's difficult to set up against them. There are large periods where you don't get a kick because they're so good in possession.\"\nOn whether Newcastle can keep Joe Willock: \"We have to respect that Joe is Arsenal's player but if it's possible we'd love to keep him.\"\nOn criticism this season: \"If you're going to do the job in the Premier League you come in for criticism, sometimes it's unjust. I always said when we had our players fit we'd be alright. I'm a football manager and I've been doing it a long time but I'm prepared to work away at it and grow an even thicker skin.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport about Ferran Torres: \"Incredible numbers and goals in his first season in the Premier League. He is so young and clinical. He is a guy brought as a winger but maybe we have to think as a striker. He is a good player.\"\n\"We play against 10 players in the box, they defend so deep.

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-4 Leeds United: Rodrigo scores twice in impressive win\nLeeds United continued their fine form at the end of their first season back in the Premier League with an impressive victory over Burnley at Turf Moor.\nMateusz Klich curled in from the edge of the penalty area shortly before half-time and Jack Harrison's flicked finish from Ezgjan Alioski's strike after 60 minutes all but sealed the three points.\nSubstitute Rodrigo then scored twice in three minutes to complete a fine away win, producing a delightful chip over Bailey Peacock-Farrell for his first before rounding the Clarets keeper for Leeds' fourth.\nThe result means Leeds have lost only once in nine league games and remain on course for a top-half finish - if not a late push for European football.\nBurnley confirmed their Premier League safety with victory over Fulham on Monday and had made a promising start, but Charlie Taylor produced an excellent sliding block to deny Raphinha and the Brazilian also attempted an instinctive over-head strike prior to Klich's opener.\nMatej Vydra was thwarted by the outstretched leg of Illan Meslier as Burnley pushed for an equaliser, before the visitors' dominant end to the contest ensured Burnley remain 15th.\nFollowing the game, Burnley boss Sean Dyche confirmed a report will be passed to the Football Association after an on-field incident involving Dwight McNeil and Ezgjan Alioski.\nLive: Saturday's Premier League action\nRelentless Leeds just keep going\nLeeds are ending their first Premier League campaign in 16 years in great form and, though they began second-best on Saturday, Bielsa's side showed their class in a dominant second-half display.\nBamford had gone closest in the opening stages as he forced Peacock-Farrell into action, before Klich ended Burnley's resistance before the interval with an unopposed run and fine finish into the bottom corner.\nWith England midfielder Kalvin Phillips back to handle the physical test posed by the hosts and the flare of Raphinha reinstated in attack, Leeds were able to cut loose in the closing stages despite a quiet afternoon for top scorer Bamford.\nRodrigo replaced Bamford - who was unable to further his case for an England call-up - before the hour mark and it proved an inspired decision as a tiring Burnley were unable to live with the sharp movements of the \u00a326m summer signing from Valencia.\nBut Harrison, 24, was arguably the standout performer as he claimed a goal as well as two assists for Rodrigo - leaving only Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes with more goal involvements from midfield in the Premier League this season.\nPressure off for Burnley\nThe pressure is now off for Dyche's side, after a sixth successive season in the Premier League was secured with three games to spare this week.\nIt is a remarkable achievement by a club that spent only about \u00a31m on reinforcements in preparation for a season made more congested by the coronavirus pandemic.\nIndeed, given the challenges posed, Dyche said this had been the \"most successful\" of the Clarets' recent top-flight campaigns - despite qualifying for Europe for the first time in 51 years in 2018.\nHowever, he will be hoping the return of 3,500 supporters for Wednesday's visit of top-four-chasing Liverpool can inspire Burnley to improve their home form.\nThey have collected more points away from home than at Turf Moor in the fans' absence this term, and their wait for a home win now stands at a club-record nine league games, stretching back to 27 January.\nOther than a committed team display, the performance of left-back Taylor offered a positive for Dyche in defeat, as the former Leeds player displayed his ability at both ends of the pitch - including his goal-saving challenge to deny Raphinha - in his 100th Premier League appearance for Burnley.\n'We've earned the right to be in the Premier League' - what the managers said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche told BBC Sport: \"We had a big emotional result on Monday. We gave the players and couple of days off and started ever so brightly. There was not much in the game but they were very clinical and we weren't.\n\"It's hard to tinker when you haven't got many players. Mostly, we carry around 20 players and there have been times when we've had seven injuries, so it's been a bit stretched.\n\"We have got 39 points and earned the right to be in the Premier League. We need to build. I really like the club record of being in the Premier League season on season.\"\nLeeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa told BBC Sport: \"They were two different halves. At the start of both it was difficult for us to dominate. They had the dominance but in the first half we didn't suffer chances and attacked well. In the second half we were more efficient but we also conceded a few more chances.\"\nOn his players being in good physical condition: \"You can verify that by looking at the data. I never thought that could be the case. It would have worried me if we had finished the season in physical decline.\"\nBurnley's worst top-flight home run - the stats\nLeeds completed their first league double over Burnley since the 2011-12 Championship campaign and have won four in a row against the Clarets for the first time in the top flight.\nBurnley are without a win in nine home league games, their longest run in the top flight.\nLeeds have scored 13 goals from outside the box in the league this season, more than any other side.\nBurney goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell has lost all four of his league matches this season, conceding an average of more than three goals per game.\nOnly Patrick Bamford (22) has been involved in more Premier League goals for Leeds this season than Jack Harrison (16).\nWhat's next?\nLeeds travel to Southampton on Tuesday at 18:00 BST, while Burnley welcome Liverpool on Wednesday at 20:15.\nSalford's 'Mr Big': Paul Massey's rise in the criminal underworld through violence and extortion\nDive into 2010s nostalgia with our quiz: How much do you remember about music from the last decade?"

        "article_text": "Southampton 3-1 Fulham: Che Adams, Nathan Tella & Theo Walcott earn Saints back-to-back wins\nRalph Hasenhuttl called Nathan Tella the \"biggest talent\" at Southampton's disposal after the striker scored his first senior goal in Saturday's 3-1 victory over relegated Fulham.\nTella took less than two minutes to double Southampton's lead after coming on as a second-half substitute as they registered back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since December.\nThe 21-year-old, who has made only six Saints starts after overcoming a serious knee injury as a teenager, also set up the home side's third goal with a classy backheel to find Theo Walcott.\n\"He's the biggest talent we have at the moment. He had a bad injury and when I see him performing like he does at the moment, I enjoy watching it,\" Southampton boss Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport.\n\"Sometimes he sprints more in 20 minutes than others in 90 minutes. This is an important season for him and we have tried to give him game time.\"\nRelive Southampton's win over Fulham as it happened\nTella's face was a picture of joy after he steered home Kyle Walker-Peters' pinpoint low ball across the face of the penalty area to put the game beyond Fulham.\nHasenhuttl added: \"It's a special moment for a young striker. He's got a smile on his face always, and this is what I really liked from him because he enjoys working for the team, he enjoys playing with us.\"\nChe Adams had punished poor set-piece defending to sweep Saints ahead with an instinctive half-volley when the Cottagers allowed James Ward-Prowse's free-kick to bounce in the six-yard box.\nTella's strike to make it 2-0 was not the only milestone for a young player on show as Fulham teenager Fabio Carvalho drilled in off the crossbar to score on his first Premier League start.\nBut the 18-year-old's effort, Fulham's first goal from open play in more than seven and a half hours, could not prevent Scott Parker's side slipping to a seventh defeat in eight league games.\nSouthampton, who move up a place to 13th, sealed victory in the closing stages as Adams and Tella combined to set up Walcott, whose shot looped home via a slight deflection.\nAdams on course for Euros\nWard-Prowse and Adams combined nicely for Southampton's opener and it is not inconceivable they could be lining up against each other at Wembley on 18 June when England and Scotland meet in the Euro 2020 group stages.\nAdams has capped a season of top-flight improvement with a first Scotland call-up after switching allegiance from England and netted his first international goal in March's World Cup qualifier against the Faroe Islands.\nHis intuitive finish, crashing an unstoppable strike past Alphonse Areola when Ward-Prowse's wide free-kick dropped at his feet, bore the hallmark of a forward high in confidence, his nine goals this term more than doubling the four he managed in 2019-20, his first Premier League season.\nBut Adams' build-up play impressed too, as he set up a first-half chance for Takumi Minamino before playing a role in Walcott's late third, which took a nick off Cottagers defender Joe Bryan on its way in.\nTella's contributions - a cool finish to open his professional account and a skilful assist for Walcott - were also easy on the eye after he replaced a subdued Danny Ings, and the attacking depth Saints showed here will encourage a fanbase worried about the England striker's future, with his contract expiring next summer.\nHasenhuttl added: \"It's not a coincidence that we've scored 10 goals in the last four home games. The subs today had a brilliant impact. This is what you need sometimes in a tight game.\"\nMore Saints sorrow for Fulham\nFulham have won only one of their 31 league visits to Southampton - back in 1935 - and it always seemed a 22nd defeat in that sorry sequence was on the way once Adams steered Saints ahead.\nThe Cottagers have only rescued two points from losing positions this season and only really showed any signs of rallying once they fell two behind at St Mary's.\nA last-ditch Jack Stephens tackle thwarted Ivan Cavaleiro and Bryan whistled a shot just wide from 25 yards before Carvalho fired home Bobby Decordova-Reid's through ball via the crossbar.\nIt was Fulham's first goal from open play since Aleksandar Mitrovic's opener in the 3-1 defeat at Aston Villa at the beginning of April, with only a Josh Maja penalty at Arsenal to show in the four games since.\nThat they were still in the game owed plenty to Areola, who thwarted a Ward-Prowse free-kick and a Nathan Redmond strike, as well as saving from Tella late on, although Carvalho's contribution, neat and tidy in possession throughout, will offer hope as the Cottagers look to next season in the Championship.\n\"Fabio showed his quality today - he's young and he's come into this team because we've been in search of goals,\" Cottagers boss Scott Parker told BBC Sport.\n\"He's scored the goal and put in a very good performance. He was a massive bright spark today.\"\nSaints skipper a set-piece standard-setter - the stats\nSouthampton have netted three or more goals in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2018 (vs Arsenal and Huddersfield).\nFulham have only registered one win in 31 league visits to Southampton (D8 L22) and are winless in 10 top-flight visits to the Saints (D4 L6).\nAll seven of James Ward-Prowse's Premier League assists this season have come from set-piece situations, with the Saints captain providing more such assists than any other player.\nFabio Carvalho (18 years 258 days) became Fulham's third youngest goalscorer in the Premier League behind only Ryan Sessegnon (18y 155d) and Collins John (18y 176d).\nSouthampton's Nathan Tella, who scored his first senior goal in his 21st appearance, found the net just 98 seconds after coming on as a substitute.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Leeds in the Premier League on Tuesday (18:00 BST), while Fulham visit second-placed Manchester United at the same time that evening.\nSalford's 'Mr Big': Paul Massey's rise in the criminal underworld through violence and extortion\nDive into 2010s nostalgia with our quiz: How much do you remember about music from the last decade?"

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 West Ham United: Hammers top-four hopes suffer blow\nDeclan Rice described the feeling as \"horrible\" after West Ham's Premier League draw at Brighton effectively ended the Londoners' Champions League hopes.\nThe result leaves the Hammers in sixth and needing to bridge a five-point gap to fourth-placed Chelsea, with two games remaining.\nLiverpool also sit a point above David Moyes' side and have the benefit of a game in hand.\n\"We can't be relying on other teams to lose,\" West Ham midfielder Rice told Sky Sports.\n\"We have to go out and win - we've drawn too many and lost a few. It's obviously horrible because we had the Champions League in our sights.\"\nHad Said Benrahma not scored a superb late equaliser, the visitors' evening on the south coast might have ended with a fourth defeat in five games, with Craig Dawson and Tomas Soucek both heading earlier opportunities wide.\nAnd Moyes, who felt their top-four aspirations had already disappeared, is now hoping his side can rouse themselves to earn a place in the Europa League.\n\"We're trying to get a place in European football if we can. We're still in a good place for that. It's a great thing to say we're in a good shout with two games to go,\" he insisted.\nDanny Welbeck had looked likely to give the hosts victory, racing clear in the 84th minute to lift the ball beyond West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nUntil Welbeck scored his 50th Premier League goal, Alireza Jahanbakhsh had gone closest to breaking the deadlock for the hosts, arrowing an effort wide of the left post with Fabianski stranded off his line.\nThe Seagulls, who stay 17th, have now dropped 25 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season.\nReaction from Brighton & Hove Albion v West Ham United\nBrighton fail to take next step\nWith their place in the division already guaranteed for next term, a Brighton victory would have seen them take a major step towards eclipsing their highest Premier League finish of 15th.\nBeating their best top-flight finish of 13th in 1981-82 would also have not been out of the question, albeit their final two matches see them face Manchester City and Arsenal.\nBut conceding just 195 seconds after Welbeck's effort, coupled with their failure to turn half chances into goals, makes it much more unlikely.\nGraham Potter's side play with admirable composure passing out from the back, but that appears to disappear almost as soon as they arrive in the final third.\nThe Seagulls failed to muster a shot on target until the 53rd minute, and even then Steven Alzate's effort came from an improbable scoring position with Welbeck better placed to score.\nThat sparked a flurry of good moments for the hosts, with Jahanbakhsh and Alzate wastefully failing to make the most of them.\nHammers' hopes fade\nWest Ham arrived on the south coast hoping to buoy their Champions League aspirations but there was a palpable sense of deflation among the visiting players at the final whistle, despite Benrahma's superb curling effort.\nOne win from their past five Premier League games now looks sure to count against them in the final reckoning for the top four places.\nAnd both Everton and Tottenham will fancy their chances of leapfrogging Moyes' team into a Europa League berth.\nWhile the Hammers welcomed Declan Rice back into their starting XI for the first time since 21 March, they simply did not do enough against a Brighton side who were without the suspended Lewis Dunk and Neal Maupay.\nLate claims for a penalty appeared fanciful rather than convincing and a VAR review correctly found in Brighton's favour after Jesse Lingard's cross at close quarters looped onto Adam Webster's arm from his hip.\nMichail Antonio failed to register a single effort on target and at times they appeared to lack invention when presented with a blue wall of home defenders.\nLingard, who has shone since arriving on loan from Manchester United, had a quiet evening and the same could be said of Pablo Fornals and Jarrod Bowen, with both struggling to ignite the visitors.\n'We can improve in both boxes' - what they said\nBrighton boss Graham Potter, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's always a bit disappointing when you're 1-0 up with not long to go [and you don't win]. Over the course of the game a draw is a fair result - I wouldn't say we deserved more. West Ham were better than us in first half, we were better in the second half.\n\"West Ham have a lot of good attacking players who can attack in different ways - they're challenging for Europe for a reason. Our boys stuck at it and did well, it's a good point in the end.\n\"You think you can hold on but we didn't manage that situation well and they scored. That's been a fault of ours over the season - too many winning positions dropped - and that's something to improve.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes speaking to Sky Sports: \"I'm a bit disappointed we didn't take more but when you go 1-0 down with six minutes left, it's good to get a draw.\n\"I thought we played really well. In the final third it didn't quite work. We brought Said Benrahma to get us goals and assists - it was good he got one tonight.\n\"I thought he [Declan Rice] did OK. Just OK for me because I know the standard he's got and what a good player he is.\"\nBrighton blues for Hammers\nWest Ham have picked up 28 points on the road in the Premier League this campaign - their joint-best away points haul in a single campaign in the competition (also 2015-16).\nWest Ham have faced Brighton more often (8) without ever winning than they have any other opponent in the Premier League (D5 L3).\nBrighton have dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than any other side.\nBrighton's Danny Welbeck, who scored his 50th Premier League goal, bagged his sixth goal of the 2020-21 campaign - his best tally in a top-flight season since 2013-14 (9).\nWest Ham's Jarrod Bowen has been substituted off on more occasions than any other player in the Premier League this season (23).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton are next in Premier League action when they host the champions Manchester City on Tuesday, 18 May (19:00 BST).\nWest Ham travel to already relegated West Brom in their next top-flight match on Wednesday, 19 May (20:15 BST).\nSalford's 'Mr Big': Paul Massey's rise in the criminal underworld through violence and extortion\nDive into 2010s nostalgia with our quiz: How much do you remember about music from the last decade?"

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 3-2 Aston Villa: 'It was like I blanked out' - Tyrick Mitchell\nTyrick Mitchell says it was \"like I blanked out\" after scoring the first goal of his career to give Crystal Palace a comeback victory over Aston Villa in the Premier League.\nIn an engrossing encounter that belied its 'dead rubber' status, both sides contributed energetic displays full of attacking intent, with Mitchell's late goal rewarding Palace for a superb second-half showing.\nThe 21-year-old full-back was in the perfect spot with six minutes left to bundle the ball in with his shoulder following Eberechi Eze's fluffed cross.\n\"I couldn't tell you what I was thinking in that moment but as soon as it went in, it was just joy,\" said Mitchell, for whom Sunday's game was his 23rd for Palace. \"It was like I blanked out.\n\"It is definitely a dream come true for me and my whole family. It's been a big season for me personally. Every day was hard but all the work has paid off.\"\nTrailing 2-1 from the 34th minute, Palace battered at the door after the break until the visitors' resistance was finally broken at Selhurst Park.\nWith 15 minutes left, Wilfried Zaha produced a driving run before cutting inside and firing a fierce shot that deflected into the net off Villa defender Ahmed Elmohamady, with Mitchell netting soon after.\nPalace had already come back into the game once, Christian Benteke heading in against his former club following John McGinn's well-taken opener.\nAnwar El Ghazi lashed in at the back post to restore Villa's lead - a goal that looked like being the winner until Palace's late rally.\nVilla remain 11th, four points behind 10th-placed Leeds with two games to play, making a Premier League top-half finish unlikely.\nAlready safe from relegation, the win took Palace to 44 points - with a chance of hitting the 50-point mark for the first time in the Premier League.\nOn a more positive note for Villa and potentially England, Jack Grealish made a second successive appearance from the bench following injury to provide further evidence of his improving fitness before this summer's European Championships.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League games\nPremier League predictions: Lawro v 1Xtra DJ Ace\nMitchell shows the way forward for Palace\nPalace manager Roy Hodgson said Mitchell received a standing ovation from his team-mates after returning to the changing room.\n\"It was fitting,\" said Hodgson. \"In the changing room I mentioned him but he was speaking to the media. When he came back the players and staff burst into spontaneous applause and the smile on his face is something that will remain in my mind.\n\"It's a day he'll look back on in 15-20 years' time and think 'was I really that good?'\"\nMitchell was not the only Palace player who impressed.\nBefore kick-off, Everything's Gonna Be Alright by Bob Marley echoed around the ground and the home team did their best to back up such a sentiment on the field.\nSometimes maligned for his style of play, Hodgson has comfortably kept Palace in the Premier League during his four seasons at the club, leaning on a core of experienced and reliable players.\nWith the 73-year-old's contract due to expire this summer along with those of a host of first-team regulars, a clear-out seems likely, but Sunday's performance provides further food for thought.\nBenteke is one of those whose deal is about to end, although he is arguably in the form of his Palace career, having netted for the third game running and for the fifth time in nine games.\nHe would have had another but for a superb Emi Martinez save that tipped his header from a corner on to the bar in the second half.\nZaha's talents are undoubted and Sunday showed he still has the drive and desire, qualities also on display from Andros Townsend, Cheikhou Kouyate and others.\nIt is perhaps Eze and Mitchell, though, who Palace should be using as the template going forward. Both are young, talented, forward-looking players around which Hodgson - or, more likely, his successor - can build a side.\n\"In the second half that was the Crystal Palace that I've seen in the last four years - that never-say-die spirit,\" said Hodgson.\n\"We accept we'll never roll teams over and we have to work hard to get a result and we did that today. The players deserve an awful amount of credit.\"\nDefeat does not overshadow Villa progress\nWhen Villa beat Palace 3-0 on Boxing Day, they were just outside the top four and pushing for an unexpected European spot.\nThe following five months have provided a big check to such lofty ambitions, but they should not detract from what has been a season of significant progress for a side who narrowly avoided relegation last campaign.\nClearly undermined by the absence of star man Grealish for 13 games during which they won only three, Dean Smith's side still pack a punch without the England forward, as they demonstrated on Sunday, especially in a first half that contained their two goals.\nThey could have had more, with Kortney Hause - in for the injured Tyrone Mings - twice heading wide from corners.\nHowever, in the second half the absence of Mings and Matty Cash told, as a seemingly tired Villa wilted in the face of the Palace onslaught.\nThey have two games left to finish in the top 10, but, with Tottenham away and Chelsea at home to come, it looks likely Villa will have to settle for the best of the bottom half.\n\"It certainly hits our hopes,\" said Smith. \"We are four points behind Leeds United and we just have to finish well.\n\"We looked a really good team in the first half today. We were unfortunate not to go in more than a goal to the good.\n\"They counter-pressed us better in the second half and we lacked the intensity we had in the first half. They were aggressive and we never really dealt with the ball as well as we did in the first half.\n\"It became more of a scrappy game and we're frustrated with the goals they did score.\"\nPalace hit three for first time since December\nCrystal Palace scored three goals in a Premier League match for the first time since their 5-1 win over West Brom in December, while they did so at Selhurst Park for the first time since a 4-1 win over Leeds in November.\nAston Villa have lost four of their past seven league matches when scoring first. Prior to this game, Villa had won 12 of their first 13 league matches this season after scoring first.\nThis was Palace's first Premier League win against a team as many as three places above them in the table since November 2019.\nThere were 42 attempts at goal (23 for Palace, 19 for Aston Villa), with only Manchester United 6-2 Leeds United in December seeing more in a Premier League game this season (43).\nPalace defender Tyrick Mitchell became the club's youngest top-flight scorer (21y 257d) since Clinton Morrison in 1998 against Sheffield Wednesday (18y 361d). Mitchell is the youngest to score and assist in a Premier League game for Palace since George Ndah in January 1995 against Leicester (20y 22d).\nAnwar El Ghazi has scored seven away league goals this season, the most by a Villa player since 2012-13, when Christian Benteke scored eight and Gabriel Agbonlahor scored seven on the road.\nSince the start of the 2012-13 season, only Olivier Giroud (32) has scored more headed Premier League goals than Benteke, whose 31 is the joint-ninth most in Premier League history, level with Tim Cahill.\nPalace winger Wilfried Zaha scored his 11th league goal of the season, his best in a top-flight campaign.\nWhat's next?\nPalace host Arsenal on Wednesday (19:00 BST) before a final-day visit to Anfield to face Liverpool.\nTottenham are the visitors to Villa Park on Wednesday (18:00), with Smith's team facing Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.\nAli Plumb's duvet day films: Check out the best movies for a Sunday and where to watch them\nLooking for a new phone?: BBC Scotland look at the research you should do before you trade up"

        "article_text": "Tottenham v Wolves: Hosts boost Europa League hopes with comfortable win\nTottenham boosted their hopes of qualifying for the Europa League with a comfortable Premier League win over Wolves.\nSpurs are now five points adrift of a top-four place and leapfrog West Ham into sixth on goal difference, with Everton three points further back.\nIt was a deserved victory for the hosts, who hit the woodwork three times after creating a number of excellent chances.\nHarry Kane saw an early effort cannon off the left-hand post before setting Spurs on their way, calmly slotting in the opener from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's superb pass on the stroke of half-time.\nWhile Wolves carried a threat on the break they were forced to ride their luck at times, with Kane and Dele Alli both hitting the right-hand post within seconds of each other.\nAnd Hojbjerg unsurprisingly doubled Spurs' advantage, reacting first after Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio had parried a Gareth Bale effort to slide the ball into the bottom right corner.\nRomain Saiss, Adama Traore and Fabio Silva all had good opportunities to reply for the visitors, but not for the first time this season it was a frustrating day in front of goal for Wolves, who remain 12th in the table.\nFollow all Sunday's Premier League action\nIs Alli turning a corner after turbulent period?\nKane and Alli star for dominant Spurs\nThis dominant Spurs display was brimming with everything that was absent in their defeat at Leeds eight days ago.\nInterim head coach Ryan Mason will have been delighted by the purpose and poise that his players exhibited and will now be optimistic that Spurs can secure a place in next term's Europa League.\nWhile it was not their goal at the outset of the season, that may provide some consolation at the end of a topsy-turvy campaign and would undoubtedly be a preferable outcome to ending up in the Europa Conference League, which would involve a qualifying round over the summer.\nKane, who scored for the first time in a month, will be probably be keen to avoid that situation, particularly with the rearranged European Championship coming into view.\nThe England captain served early notice of his intentions with a brilliant long-range strike that smashed the base of the Wolves post and was excellent throughout.\nAlli also impressed in front of the watching England boss Gareth Southgate, showing glimpses of the qualities that once made him a first choice for the Three Lions.\nIn his third consecutive start, he ghosted past Saiss on the right touchline during the first half and the only disappointment will have been that he did not cap a fine display with his first top-flight goal since 7 March 2020.\nWolves miss killer instinct\nDespite a recent upturn in form, Wolves are going to finish in their lowest position since returning to the Premier League in 2018-19.\nAnd while there can be few complaints about the quality of their overall football, it is easy to understand why - with only the three relegated clubs and Burnley having managed to find the back of the net on fewer occasions.\nThe club paid a significant sum for Fabio Silva last September, but the teenager has had to acclimatise to a new country in difficult times and is still very much a work in progress.\nThat was highlighted by the way in which he spurned two early chances that could have put the visitors in front.\nHis first effort was blocked and he then dragged a shot wide from an almost identical position on the right-hand side of the Spurs penalty area just before the half-hour mark.\nSilva, 18, also lacked conviction when presented with a gilt-edged chance by Morgan Gibbs-White midway through the second half and was withdrawn with eight minutes remaining.\nWhile captain Conor Coady was excellent at the back and twice cleared off the line before the break, it is at the other end of the pitch where boss Nuno Espirito Santo is likely to focus this summer.\nDele 'loves football' - what they said\nSpurs interim head coach Ryan Mason speaking to BBC Sport: \"The most important thing is to win. Today our performance was excellent - we controlled the game. Our attacking players will be disappointed there weren't more goals - they deserved them.\n\"[Dele Alli is] professional. It's not easy for professional footballers to spend a long time on the sidelines. Dele has started the last three games - that says a lot about him. He loves football, he runs and he fights. He's disappointed he didn't get a goal because he deserved one, he had a really good game.\n\"This is Tottenham Hotspur. We want to be playing in the biggest competition in the biggest games. This season hasn't gone to plan.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were missing lot of things. Not all the game but mainly on the moments when we conceded we were missing discipline, organisation and being aggressive to solve a simple situation.\n\"We repeated the same mistakes. We didn't test [Hugo] Lloris, we got into good situations but didn't put the ball on the goal. The finishing was very bad. We want to keep trying to improve and finding new solutions to our game.\"\nOn Raul Jimenez, who remains sidelined with a head injury: \"He's OK, he meets the specialist on Tuesday and based on that information we will decide [what to do next]. He is working and training but we have to be really patient and cannot afford any kind of mistake.\"\nMason's home comforts\nTottenham have won each of their first three home league matches under Ryan Mason. Mason is the first Spurs boss to do so since Harry Redknapp in November 2008.\nWolves have failed to score in 12 Premier League matches this season, the most games in which they've failed to net in a Premier League campaign since 2011-12 (13).\nTottenham had 24 shots in this match, 13 of which were on target - both figures exceed any amount they had in a single Premier League match under previous manager Jose Mourinho.\nWolves faced 13 shots on target in this match - since 2003-04, only against West Brom in February 2012 have they ever faced more in a Premier League match (14).\nSince winning three of their first five away games in the Premier League in 2020-21, Wolves have only won two of their last 13 on the road in the competition (D5 L6).\nWolves' Fabio Silva had seven shots in this match, the most by a teenager in a Premier League match since Mason Greenwood's seven for Manchester United vs Cardiff in May 2019 - the last teenager to exceed seven shots in a Premier League match was Giuseppe Rossi for Manchester United vs Charlton in May 2006.\nTottenham's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg both scored and assisted in a Premier League game for the first time, in what was his 145th appearance in the competition. He's the third Dane to score and assist in a Premier League game for Spurs after Christian Eriksen (nine times) and Allan Nielsen.\nTottenham's Harry Kane has scored 22 goals and provided a further 13 assists in the Premier League this season- the only players to exceed Kane's 35 total goal involvements in Europe's top five leagues this season are Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski and Barcelona's Lionel Messi.\nTottenham's Harry Kane has hit the woodwork nine times in the Premier League this season, the most since Kevin de Bruyne in 2016-17 (also nine). Since full shot data has been available for the Premier League (2003-04), the only player to hit the woodwork more in a season is Robin van Persie in 2011-12 (10).\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host Aston Villa in their penultimate Premier League match on Wednesday, 19 May (18:00 BST).\nWolves travel to Everton for their next top-flight game on the same evening, also at 18:00 BST.\nAli Plumb's duvet day films: Check out the best movies for a Sunday and where to watch them\nLooking for a new phone?: BBC Scotland look at the research you should do before you trade up"

        "article_text": "West Brom 1-2 Liverpool: Alisson stunner keeps Liverpool in top-four hunt\nGoalkeeper Alisson scored an incredible injury-time winner as Liverpool claimed a significant victory in their quest to achieve a Premier League top-four finish by coming from behind to beat West Brom.\nWith three points a must and just seconds left of a game in which the visitors had been frustrated by an obstinate and disciplined Baggies, the Brazilian keeper came up for a corner.\nIt was surely the Reds' final chance to snatch the win and so it proved as Alisson rose to glance Trent Alexander-Arnold's delivery into the far corner of the net to send the away side into delirium.\nIn an example of extraordinary timing, it is the first occasion in which a goalkeeper has scored a competitive goal for Liverpool in their entire history, dating back to 1892.\nThe stunning moment takes the Reds just a point and a place behind Chelsea in fourth and three points worse off than third-placed Leicester with two games to go.\nThat the Blues and Foxes face each other in their next league game gives Jurgen Klopp's side a huge opportunity to take control of their own destiny in the race for Champions League qualification when they travel to Burnley on Wednesday.\nThings had got off to a terrible start for the reigning champions at the Hawthorns with Hal Robson-Kanu capping his first Premier League start since December 2017 with a neat side-foot finish to give West Brom the lead.\nA typically incisive Mohamed Salah finish brought the visitors level, with the Egyptian's low shot inside the far post taking him to 22 goals for the season, level with Harry Kane at the top of the scoring charts.\nWith Roberto Firmino firing against the woodwork, Sadio Mane seeing a finish ruled out for offside and others profligate in front of goal, it looked as though the Reds had blown their chance.\nBut Alisson's big moment keeps them firmly in the hunt.\n\"I just tried to run into a good place and be there to try and help my players, to bring a defender, but no one followed me and I am lucky and blessed, sometimes things you can't explain,\" Alisson told Sky Sports.\n\"You can't explain a lot of things in my life, the only reason is God and he put his hand on my head today and I'm feeling very blessed.\"\nHe also paid an emotional tribute to his late father, who drowned, aged 57, in February.\n\"I'm too emotional, this last month for everything that has happened with me and my family, but football is my life, I played since I can remember with my father,\" he added.\n\"I hope he was here to see it, I'm sure he is celebrating with God at his side.\"\nReds boss Klopp said: \"It's an unbelievable header, I've never seen anything like that, good technique. I wasn't sure what I was seeing.\n\"We are really close and know exactly what it means to him, it's outstanding, really touching. It's only football but it means the world to us.\"\nAction from West Brom v Liverpool, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nFA Cup final & Premier League predictions: Lawro v 1Xtra DJ Ace\nAlisson makes Liverpool history\nLiverpool have enjoyed some wonderful and dramatic moments during Klopp's time as manager, from Champions League comebacks to crucial late goals en route to a first top-flight title success in 30 years.\nAlisson's header is right up there with the best of them and will live long in the memory of Reds fans.\nThis will especially be the case if it ultimately leads to qualification for the Champions League. It cannot be understated how crucial the moment is, in this regard.\nAhead of the corner, the Reds were facing the very real prospect of a Europa League spot as their only reward at the end of a difficult and, in parts, dire season by their own high standards.\nAt the final whistle, once the away side had finished mobbing their goalkeeper, they were able to reflect upon a situation that has now swung back their way.\nFor so much of the second half at the Hawthorns, Klopp's side huffed and puffed without wobbling West Brom's door a millimetre. Driving runs went nowhere, passes led to blind alleys and, when they came, shots too often hit the stand behind the goal.\nSalah had done his bit in the first half, but was well marshalled in the second, Mane continues to be a shadow of his former self and the midfield failed to play with the speed and precision required to pick open a very well-drilled defence.\nWhat does it matter, though, when you have a goalkeeper who can pick his moment and head a ball as Alisson showed right at the death?\nA get-out-jail card? Possibly. A wake-up call for the last two games? Probably. Something to add to a long list of magical Premier League moments? Definitely.\nLiverpool have now scored 38 winning goals in the 90th minute or later of a Premier League game. That's 13 more than any other team in Premier League history.\nFew of them could prove as important as this.\n\"That game is our season in a nutshell,\" added Klopp. \"A lot of good stuff, we got hammered for the first mistake and then had to work like crazy.\n\"But nobody got over the top, we had shots and kept playing football and its really difficult against these sides, how they defend, how they set up, and in the end we needed Alisson to sort it.\"\nBaggies seconds from frustrating Reds again\nWest Brom have few positives to take away from this season, but they were agonisingly close to frustrating the champions for a second time in the campaign, having drawn at Anfield in late December.\nThey spent large periods on the back foot, but had their attacking moments, most notably Robson-Kanu's neat finish following a pass from the again impressive Matheus Pereira.\nThe Brazilian has now either scored (10) or assisted (six) 16 of West Brom's 33 Premier League goals this season (48.5%); with only Harry Kane for Tottenham (55.6%) directly involved in a higher ratio for his side.\nWhen the Baggies come to rebuild in the summer, they are unlikely to be short of suitors should they wish to offload their star man.\nAlbion also thought they had snatched the win themselves when Kyle Bartley poked in from a corner, but it was ruled out with an offside Matt Phillips obstructing Alisson's view from a corner.\n\"If down at Stockley Park they said that's right then that's nonsense,\" boss Sam Allardyce told the BBC. \"If they say the referee or the linesman disallowed that goal it's a disgrace. There is no interference with the goalkeeper whatsoever.\n\"All those things people say they have to do to stop the goalkeeper saving it. If there was nobody there he still wouldn't have saved it. It's baffling.\"\nLiverpool's latest winner since March 2016\nAlisson's goal for Liverpool (94:18) was Liverpool's latest Premier League winner since Christian Benteke v Crystal Palace in March 2016 (95:10), whilst the Brazilian scored the very first headed goal by a goalkeeper since the formation of the competition in 1992.\nLiverpool have now won six of their last eight Premier League games (D2), the same number as they registered in their 19 top-flight games beforehand (W6 D5 L8).\nWest Brom have only managed to keep four clean sheets since Sam Allardyce took over the club in late December, with only Sheffield United and Newcastle (3) managing fewer. Indeed, no side has conceded more Premier League goals than the Baggies (44) since Allardyce's first game in charge (level with Southampton).\nNo player has scored more Premier League goals this season than Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah (22, level with Harry Kane). Indeed, those 22 goals have won the Reds 16 points, with no player earning more for their side via their goals this season.\nMohamed Salah's equaliser was his 125th goal for Liverpool since signing for the club ahead of the 2017-18 season, the most by any Premier League player across all competitions, with only four other players within the top-five European leagues managing more than the Egyptian since then.\nLiverpool midfielder Thiago created five opportunities from open play for his teammates in his side's draw with West Brom, the joint-most the Spaniard has ever managed in a top-flight league game (also creating five in December 2015 for Bayern Munich against Hannover 96).\nWest Brom forward Hal Robson-Kanu's 13 Premier League goals have been scored against teams with an average position in the table at the start of that day of 7.4 - the highest average position of teams scored against for any player with as many goals as Robson-Kanu in Premier League history.\nHal Robson-Kanu's opener for West Brom was his first Premier League goal since November 2017 against Newcastle, with the Welshman making a scoring return to the starting XI, last starting a top-flight game in December 2017.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool must keep up their winning ways when they travel to Burnley on Wednesday (20:15 BST) if they want to maintain their push for the top four.\nWest Brom's next game is again at the Hawthorns and sees another side near the top of the table, West Ham, the visitors for a 20:15 kick-off.\nAli Plumb's duvet day films: Check out the best movies for a Sunday and where to watch them\nLooking for a new phone?: BBC Scotland look at the research you should do before you trade up"

        "article_text": "Everton 0-1 Sheffield United: Teenager Jebbison earns win for Blades\nTeenager Daniel Jebbison said it felt \"amazing\" to score on his first Premier League start as he gave Sheffield United a victory that dented Everton's hopes of qualifying for Europe.\nThe 17-year-old forward, who was on loan at National League North side Chorley earlier in the season, slid in from close range after good work by Jack Robinson in the area.\n\"I feel amazing, I'm thankful for the opportunity that's been given to me by the club,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"Every single one of those players out there, we fought today and showed excellent character.\n\"The experience was brilliant. I wish the fans were here because I know the Sheffield United fans are crazy and I love it.\n\"I'm buzzing and can't wait to get back to training, get better every single day and show it out on the pitch on the weekend.\"\nJebbison could have doubled his tally when he seized on a short backpass by Mason Holgate, but saw his effort saved by Jordan Pickford.\nAt the other end, Aaron Ramsdale pulled off a stunning double save from Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin to preserve Sheffield United's lead.\nRamsdale was then alert to deny Richarlison again in the second half as the relegated Blades held on for just their second Premier League away win of the season.\nFor Everton, a ninth home league defeat of the campaign means they stay eighth and miss the chance to draw level on points with Tottenham and West Ham in the race for European football.\nJebbison offers hope for bright Blades future\nThe last senior game Jebbison started was for Chorley against Chester in the National League North in December. But despite jumping up six divisions, he did not look out of place here.\nHe was central to a battling Blades performance that belied their position at the bottom of the table and offered the supporters hope for next season after a troubled campaign.\nThe Canada-born forward, who represents England at youth level, showed great awareness to peel away from his marker and score in the seventh minute after Robinson had drilled the ball across the six-yard box.\nBuoyed by that good start, Sheffield United continued to press Everton high up the pitch and create chances.\nJohn Fleck had a powerful drive punched away by Pickford before the England goalkeeper stood up tall to deny Jebbison after he had pounced on Holgate's short backpass.\nThey were equally impressive at the other end, with John Egan typifying their resolute approach with a wonderful slide tackle to deny Calvert-Lewin early in the second half.\nWhen they did break through, Everton found goalkeeper Ramsdale in inspired form.\nThe England Under-21 international did well to palm away Allan's shot from the edge of the area before doing superbly to save from Richarlison's diving header and then stood up quickly to block Calvert-Lewin on the rebound from point-blank range.\nThe headlines, though, will go to Jebbison. There has been speculation linking him with a move away this summer and this performance will have done little to quell the interest.\nIf he does remain at Bramall Lane, he could form a key component of the side next season as the Blades plot an immediate return to the Premier League.\nPaul Heckingbottom, Sheffield United's interim manager, thinks Jebbison is still learning his game, but has the right attitude to succeed.\n\"He's nowhere near finished,\" Heckingbottom said. \"But he deserves his chance. He's been put in on merit.\n\"The biggest reason he was in the team was his running power to stretch their team and be in between the posts when we put the ball in the box. The coaches have helped him develop in a short space of time.\n\"You can see the hard work and natural athleticism. He listens and learns. He performed his role excellently without the ball. He's scored the goal. He's certainly played his part with and without the ball.\"\nEverton's home struggles continue\nEverton moved up to second in the Premier League after their away win at Sheffield United on 26 December - one of 11 away victories for the Toffees this season, their most in a top-flight campaign since 1984-85, when they won the title.\nHowever, their form on the road is in sharp contrast to their struggles at Goodison Park, which is one of the main reasons why they have not been able to sustain a top-four challenge and are instead struggling to secure a place in the top seven.\nFulham are the only team to have earned fewer than Everton's six points at home in 2021 and Sunday's result means they have now lost nine of their 18 home league games this season, their most defeats at Goodison since 1993-94, when they were almost relegated.\nThe Toffees welcomed back Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez after three games out with a calf injury and he showed glimpses of his class early on, seeing a shot deflected just over before providing the cross that drew a double save from Ramsdale.\nHowever, Rodriguez faded after the break and with him went the bulk of Everton's creativity.\nWith Rodriguez peripheral, the home side's increasingly desperate approach was summed up by defender Ben Godfrey attempting a shot from 30 yards that flew well over the bar, prompting manager Carlo Ancelotti to shake his head in bemusement.\nThe Italian said Everton were \"still in the fight\" for Europe after the midweek draw at Aston Villa, but their chances of overhauling the sides above them now look slim.\nThey will likely need two wins from their remaining two matches to have a chance, one of which is a trip to champions Manchester City on the final day of the season.\n'Excellent from start to finish' - what they said\nSheffield United interim manager Paul Heckingbottom to BBC Sport: \"I thought we were excellent from start to finish. It makes a difference when you get the first goal. We didn't create a hatful of chances but we created good ones. We were strong at the other end.\n\"It's a great group of players to work with. The spirit and honesty has got them into the Premier League. A lot of circumstances conspired against us this season with fans and Covid and a hell of a lot of injuries.\n\"These boys have been fighting all season. You've still got to enjoy playing in this league [after relegation]. Next season is totally different. The boys will have a break, which they didn't get this season.\"\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti to BBC Sport: \"We played so bad. The only result that could be possible is a defeat. As we usually did at home most of the time, we lost. I have to take responsibly for this but I hope the players do too.\n\"We have two games to the end. We lost a great opportunity to have the chance to fight for Europe. We have to do our best to the end. The next one we will have fans and maybe they can help us wake up.\n\"It's difficult to say [why Everton are better away]. When we tried to put quality and build from the back we have more difficulties. We are more comfortable when we play direct but that is not the best style of play.\n\"For next season, we are going to change. We have to analyse the season. Certain aspects are really good - away we did fantastic results, at home really bad. Double face.\n\"To be ready for Europe, you have to be in Europe. We have to try to win the two games and see if we are in Europe or not. If we are, we will build a squad to be in Europe. If we're not, we'll build a squad to be better in the Premier League.\"\nBlades ending losing run on the road - the stats\nSheffield United picked up only a second win from their past 24 away league outings (D3 L19), and ended a run of seven straight Premier League defeats on the road since beating Manchester United 2-1 in January.\nOnly Fulham (four) have earned fewer home points in the Premier League in 2021 so far than Everton's tally of six (P11 W1 D3 L7), with the Toffees' one win the joint-fewest on home soil in the competition this calendar year (level with Burnley and Fulham).\nEverton have lost nine Premier League matches at Goodison Park this season; it's the joint-most they have ever lost at home in a league campaign, alongside 1912-13, 1947-48, 1950-51 and 1993-94.\nSheffield United have won more Premier League away games at Everton (three) than they have at any other opponent in the competition.\nEverton have kept just two home clean sheets in the Premier League this season; only Newcastle United (one) have recorded fewer.\nSheffield United's Daniel Jebbison (17 years 309 days) became the youngest player to score on his first Premier League start, overtaking Danny Cadamarteri's record, set for Everton against Barnsley in September 1997 (17y 343d), which was also scored at Goodison Park.\nJebbison was also the youngest player to score a match-winning goal in a Premier League game since Federico Macheda for Manchester United against Sunderland in April 2009 (17y 232d).\nAaron Ramsdale made six saves for Sheffield United, the most he's ever made in a Premier League game in which he didn't concede a goal, while six saves was the most he's made in any league division while also keeping a clean sheet since March 2019 for AFC Wimbledon against Peterborough in League One (seven).\nWhat's next?\nEverton take on Wolves in the Premier League at Goodison Park on Wednesday (18:00 BST), while Sheffield United visit Newcastle at the same time that evening.\nAli Plumb's duvet day films: Check out the best movies for a Sunday and where to watch them\nLooking for a new phone?: BBC Scotland look at the research you should do before you trade up"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-1 Fulham: Edinson Cavani scores stunner in Man Utd draw\nManchester United's Premier League draw against relegated Fulham will be a \"wake-up call\" before next week's Europa League final against Villarreal, says manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nEdinson Cavani welcomed the return of fans back to the Premier League with a brilliant 40-yard lobbed goal, but United were unable to mark the occasion with a victory as Fulham came back to draw at Old Trafford\nAside from a handful of games at a lucky few clubs in December, supporters have been absent from top-flight league football since 9 March 2020.\nNo supporters have seen a goal at Old Trafford since Scott McTominay's inspired second in United's Manchester derby win over City the day before.\nThere were only 10,000 present to see Cavani's inspired effort, but what a noise they made as the Uruguayan strode onto a long ball downfield from David de Gea, which VAR felt touched Bruno Fernandes on the way through, before lifting the ball over Alphonso Areola with a perfectly executed finish that floated into the net.\nFor a long time it looked like being the winner, until Joe Bryan was allowed to ghost in at the far post unchallenged to convert Bobby Decordova-Reid's deep cross from the right.\nSolskjaer said: \"I think it might be a wake-up call because we tried to do the fancy stuff - the flicks, the extraordinary things, the things that pleased the fans.\n\"That's not what we're about. We should be more efficient.\n\"Have a look at Cavani, have a look at how he plays the game. Every single one of us look at him.\n\"Back tackles, runs, scores - there's no fluff. And we can't have fluff in a game of football.\"\nDe Gea's uncertain future\nAfter Alisson's amazing winner for Liverpool on Sunday, there was genuine debate around whether De Gea made another telling contribution by a goalkeeper to his team's offensive effort.\nTV replays indicated Fernandes failed to get a touch as he attempted to flick De Gea's pass through to Cavani, something the forward himself admitted afterwards. But if that was correct, Cavani should have been ruled offside by VAR.\nDe Gea's selection was interesting in itself.\nThe Spain keeper has lost his place to Dean Henderson in recent weeks, but Henderson was at fault for at least one of Liverpool's four goals in their win over United six days previously, so it was not completely clear whether De Gea had got his place back or was being granted a farewell appearance after 10 years of largely outstanding service.\nBoth scenarios have their complications. For Henderson, another season as back up is unlikely to appeal given his England aspirations, whilst De Gea is one of the Premier League's highest-paid players. Finding a club to match that salary, let alone pay a transfer fee, is not going to be easy.\nUntil Bryan's goal, De Gea did not have much to do against the top-flight's second-worst attack. He did make saves to deny Ademola Lookman and Fabio Carvalho and had little chance of keeping Bryan's equaliser out.\n'It's a different game' - fans return but how much do they help?\nGreen and gold\nIn contrast to protests that caused the first meeting with Liverpool earlier this month to the called off and extreme measures, including beds being transported into the stadium for players to sleep on, being implemented to ensure the second one went ahead, this match was completed in relative peace.\nThere were still a lot of police and a helicopter circled above the stadium before the game. But those who chose to wear the green and gold anti-Glazer colours almost exclusively restricted themselves to regular chanting against the club's American owners.\nA mooted 51st-minute protest to press the case for the '50+1' German ownership model clashed with a dangerous free-kick for the hosts - both fizzled out.\nFor United staff and Solskjaer, who had appealed for calm in the build-up, it was doubtless a relief.\nAfter the match, Solskjaer spoke on a microphone just prior to a walk round the pitch, in which Paul Pogba and Amad Diallo paraded a Palestine flag, to declare United \"were not where he wanted them to be\" but hoped to bring the Europa League trophy back to England next week.\nThe loss of McTominay to what appeared to be an injury midway through the second half will be a worry before the meeting with Villarreal in Gdansk on 26 May, as will the paltry nine league wins on home soil this season.\nTonight, though, was all about the fans - and despite the result, they seemed happy just to be here.\nWhen asked about Pogba and Diallo holding up the Palestine flag, Solskjaer replied: \"We have players from different backgrounds, different cultures, different countries and we need to respect their views if they differ from someone else's.\n\"If my players think about other things than football, that's a positive thing.\n\"We have seen that with some of my players before, that they do care. You see Marcus Rashford, for example, the difference he has made.\n\"So, no, we respect their right to have a different view.\"\n'I don't understand how it's not offside'\nFulham boss Scott Parker felt his side were superb but also took exception to United's opener, believing it should have been ruled out for offside against Cavani.\n\"I thought we were fantastic today,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We played like a big team. We had to be courageous.\n\"It's a difficult place to come Old Trafford, let alone today with 10,000 fans in.

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-2 Leeds United: Patrick Bamford scores 16th Premier League goal of the season\nPatrick Bamford's 16th Premier League goal of the season helped Leeds United defeat Southampton in front of 8,000 fans at St Mary's Stadium.\nBamford, who had earlier missed a chance when he only had goalkeeper Alex McCarthy to beat, flicked the ball into the net following Rodrigo's ball over the Saints defence.\nLeeds added a second in injury time when Bamford's strike was parried by McCarthy, with Tyler Roberts converting the rebound.\nSouthampton's best chance came early on but Che Adams' header was tipped over by Leeds goalkeeper Kiko Casilla.\nThe victory takes Leeds up above Arsenal and Everton into eighth and guarantees Marcelo Bielsa's side a top-10 finish.\nSouthampton remain 14th in the Premier League with one game of the season remaining.\nRelive Southampton v Leeds United as it happened\nLeeds continue fantastic season\nBamford's goal, where he squeezed his shot past McCarthy from a tight angle, was a rare moment of quality in a scrappy, but entertaining match on a day where fans returned to Premier League grounds.\nThis was only the third time supporters had been at a Southampton home game in 2020-21, after 2,000 of them watched the 3-0 win over Sheffield United on 13 December and then the 1-0 loss to Manchester City six days later.\nBut they went home disappointed as Bamford scored one and made one to continue Leeds' fantastic season.\nAfter winning the Championship in 2019-20, which ended a 16-season absence from the top flight, Marcelo Bielsa's Leeds side have won many admirers with their attacking brand of football.\nThis win means they could become only the 15th team since the Premier League started in 1992-93 to finish in the top nine after winning promotion the previous season.\nAnd the season could even end in European qualification, although they need results to go their way.\nIf Leeds gain a big win at home against West Brom, seventh-placed West Ham lose both of their last two games and Everton and Arsenal do not record another win, then Bielsa's side can grab seventh and a spot in next season's newly-formed Europa Conference League.\nFor 27-year-old Bamford, uncapped by England, a fine season has now taken him joint-fifth in the Premier League goal charts, only behind Tottenham's Harry Kane, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (both on 22 goals), Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes (18 goals) and Tottenham's Son Heung-min (17 goals).\nFans create great atmosphere, but visitors triumph\nDespite a downpour just before kick-off, the game began in bright sunshine on the south coast and the spectators helped create a great atmosphere.\nLeeds goalkeeper Casilla was handed only his second Premier League start, while Bielsa kept his pre-match promise and left out Germany defender Robin Koch and Poland midfielder Mateusz Klich as they prepare for this summer's delayed Euro 2020.\nCasilla was instantly called into the action as he had to tip over a header from Adams in only the second minute.\nBefore the game, it was announced that Theo Walcott had agreed to sign for the Saints on a two-year permanent contract when his loan deal from Everton finishes and the ex-England winger had a good chance to open the scoring.\nHe took the ball around Casilla in the penalty area, although the Spaniard forced him wide - and from a tight angle Walcott had to pass, with no Southampton player on the end of his cross.\nSaints manager Ralph Hasenhuttl brought on top scorer Danny Ings at half-time and James Ward-Prowse, who received the Player of the Year award before the game, skimmed the crossbar at the start of the second half.\nLeeds did not have a shot on target in the first half, but grew into the game after the break and gave Saints a warning when Bamford burst through and was one-on-one with McCarthy only to take the ball too wide and run out of room.\nThe striker then collided with Southampton's Mohammed Salisu and needed treatment, but he recovered and then steered in the game's first goal, through McCarthy's legs, in the 73rd minute.\nIngs, like Bamford a contender for England's Euro 2020 squad this summer, had a chance to grab an equaliser but missed and the hosts were caught on the counter-attack with McCarthy parring Bamford's strike for Roberts to grab his first goal of the season in injury time.\n'A massive moment for everyone'\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, on the return of fans, said: \"It was absolutely amazing for me. When I was coming out at the beginning of the game, it was an impressive view to see them sitting there.\n\"It looked very full although there were only 8,000, but unbelievable. A massive moment for everyone. We really tried to give them a win because they've been fantastic and supported us until the end.\n\"We did forget how good it felt to have them back and how good it feels to see them. It definitely gives us something we can look forward to next season.\"\nOn the result, Hasenhuttl added: \"An expected tough game with a very good first half from us but without a goal.\n\"We cannot play better than we did in the first half. I didn't have the feeling that we gave a lot of chances away in the second half but they had another gear that we didn't have.\"\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa on Patrick Bamford: \"Patrick had a very generous performance with a lot of effort and he's had a season in which he's shone. I'm sure he'll be very positive about the campaign he's had, be what may.\n\"Everything he's achieved this season is because of the dedication and effort that he's put in to show off his abilities.\"\nOn Roberts' first Premier League goal, Bielsa added: \"I was happy he scored because he had played many games and hadn't managed to do it.\n\"The team in the second half looked a lot more like the team that it is.\"\nLeeds impress on the road again - the stats\nSouthampton lost their final home league game of a campaign for only the third time in the past 16 seasons (won nine, drew four), also doing so in 2016-17 against Stoke and 2017-18 against Manchester City.\nLeeds have won 10 or more away games in a single top-flight campaign for the first time since 1973-74, when they won 12 on the way to winning the title.\nSouthampton are without a clean sheet in their past 10 home league games (15 goals conceded) after keeping shutouts in six of the eight before that.\nLeeds are only the second promoted team to win 10 Premier League away games in a single season (10), and the first to do so since Nottingham Forest in 1994-95 (10 in total).\nLeeds are only the second team in Premier League history to finish a campaign without a single away draw (won 10, lost nine), after Tottenham in 2018-19.\nLeeds striker Patrick Bamford's haul of 16 goals Premier League goals this season is the most by a player for a promoted side in a top-flight season since Charlie Austin's 18 for QPR in 2014-15.\nBamford is the first player to score 10 Premier League goals away from home in a single season for a newly promoted club since Andy Johnson for Crystal Palace in 2004-05.\nLeeds sub Tyler Roberts scored his first-ever Premier League goal in his 27th appearance in the competition.\nAlex McCarthy made his 100th Premier League appearance for Southampton, just the third goalkeeper to hit that milestone for Saints after Paul Jones (193) and Fraser Forster (115).\nWhat's next?\nThe final day of the Premier League season is on Sunday and Southampton visit a West Ham side hoping to secure European football.\nLeeds will have fans at Elland Road for the first time since March 2020 when they entertain already relegated West Bromwich Albion.\nPowerful new drama Danny Boy: Searching for truth in the fog of war\nThe Cost of Concussion: Watch as former rugby players take legal action over their brain injuries"

And after we are going to go for the final of the Champions League.\n\"I am concerned because this is the final of the Champions League, because the opponent is so tough.\"\nCity also lost Gundogan to injury in the second half, but Guardiola provided positive news about the midfielder after the game.\n\"We are going to check tomorrow,\" said the manager of the German, who had earlier scored his 17th goal of the season.\n\"The doctor is quite optimistic. The problem is a kick and he was running in the second half with disruption and I didn't want to take a risk.\"\nReaction from Brighton v Man City, plus the rest of Tuesday's Premier League action\nLawro's full predictions v Harry Potter actor and Leeds fan Matthew Lewis\nAlbion give their fans something to cheer\nBrighton were already safe from the drop, but have now moved to 41 points and up to 15th in the Premier League table. They also have a first win over City since April 1989.\nThe game was the perfect way for Albion to sign off their home season, with a performance somewhat aided by having a man advantage for 81 minutes but also entirely in keeping with the positive ethos of manager Graham Potter.\nAfter Foden had added to Gundogan's opener early in the second half, it looked as though Brighton were heading for a frustrating defeat characterised by missed opportunities.\nWelbeck had chipped a shot over Ederson side and wide before Pascal Gross fluffed a close-range shot following a pull-back.\nBut their response to Foden's goal was timely and crucial, with Trossard finally finding the patience, skill and efficiency to evade a series of challenges in the box and fire in.\nThe crowd lifted, it provided a surge of belief through the home players, which they rode to victory. In a period of sustained pressure, the excellent Ben White saw two long-range efforts blocked.\nThey were not to be denied, as Webster struck with his header before Burn hammered home at the second attempt, choosing the best possible moment to score his first goal for the club.\nThe cheer at full-time was more representative of a full house than just under 7,500 - and spoke of a unified approval of a job well done and a joy at what live football can provide.\n\"It was an emotional feeling in the stadium and I thought the players gave a top performance which the crowd appreciated.\" Potter said. \"The supporters were fantastic and it was a great game.\n\"Obviously we benefited when they went down to 10 men so early, but we still had to play well and with the personality that we did.\n\"We have improved and we have a young team that can get better and better.\n\"I am really pleased for the players. They have had a tough year, they have stuck at it and it's nice to enjoy a fantastic victory with our supporters and get to 41 points.\"\nTired Man City suffer for early red\nHaving wrapped up their seventh English top-flight title and third under Guardiola, City's focus is now principally on that European final against Chelsea in Porto.\nCity have conceded six goals in two games, but it would too simplistic to suggest that they have taken their eye off domestic matters.\nThis game had one major extenuating circumstance in Cancelo's dismissal, leaving his team-mates to soldier on without him for most of the game, at the end of a demanding season against a side buoyed by home support for the first time in five months.\nThey almost pulled it off too and possibly would have done had they held on for a bit longer before conceding Brighton's first. However, once the tide turned, it proved too much.\nSpecial mention must be made of Foden's goal - a powerful, driving run followed by a superb finish into the far corner, which served only to underline once more how big a player he could be for England this summer.\nThe loss ends City's record-breaking runs of 12 successive away league victories and a 23-match unbeaten run away from home in all competitions.\nThey will now have the chance to play in front of home fans themselves when Everton visit Etihad Stadium on Sunday and then all attention switches to the Porto's Estadio do Dragao and the chance for European glory.\nCity record lowest percentage of Pep Guardiola's managerial career\nManchester City's possession figure in this match was just 37% - the lowest recorded by a side managed by Pep Guardiola in a single top-flight match.\nManchester City have lost six Premier League games having led by two or more goals - only Tottenham (with eight) have suffered more such defeats in the competition's history.\nThis was just the second time in Premier League history a team starting the day top of the table has led by two or more goals and lost, after Manchester City themselves did so against Manchester United in April 2018.\nBrighton picked up their first-ever Premier League victory over Manchester City. They had lost each of their previous seven against the Citizens by an aggregate score of 21-2.\nManchester City have conceded six goals in their past two away Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous 14 on the road in the competition.\nDan Burn's winner for Brighton was his first-ever Premier League goal (in his 69th appearance), and his first in any league since April 2018 (for Wigan against Fleetwood).\nManchester City's Phil Foden has scored 15 goals in all competitions this season. Among players in the top five European leagues currently aged under 21, only Erling Haaland (39) has scored more.\nIlkay Gundogan's goal was the 10th that Manchester City have scored in the opening two minutes under Guardiola in the Premier League - only Arsene Wenger (19) and Alex Ferguson (17) have seen their sides score more in this timeframe in the competition.\nJoao Cancelo's red card, after nine minutes and three seconds, was Manchester City's second earliest from the start of a Premier League game, after Dedryck Boyata was sent off after four minutes and 28 seconds against Arsenal in October 2010.\nManchester City became just the third side to have both scored a goal and had a player sent off in the opening 10 minutes of a Premier League match, after Blackburn Rovers (against Leeds in February 1995) and Norwich City (against Portsmouth in January 2005).\nLeandro Trossard (five goals, five assists) is just the second Brighton player to register at least five goals and five assists in a single Premier League campaign, after Pascal Gross in 2017-18 (seven goals, eight assists).\nWhat's next?\nThe final round of fixtures sees Man City host Everton, while Brighton travel to Arsenal.

There was no VAR review into that one.\nThen Werner was clearly offside as he scored from Mason Mount's first-time pass - with no need for VAR.\nWerner thought he finally had his goal - and celebrated with the fans - before VAR correctly deemed he had bundled the ball in with his arm and not his head.\nChelsea's frustrations lifted in the second half when Jamie Vardy inadvertently flicked a Ben Chilwell corner into the path of Rudiger, who scored with his thigh.\nAnd then a VAR decision went Chelsea's way when Fofana needlessly fouled Werner, with Jorginho scoring the penalty.\nChelsea did manage to set up a tense finale for themselves by trying to play their way out of defence with Mateo Kovacic losing the ball to Ndidi, who set up Iheanacho, but they held out.\nBack down to earth for Leicester\nWhatever happens now for Leicester, this is their second most successful season ever (behind the Premier League title-winning season of 2015-16) thanks to winning their first ever FA Cup.\nIf they do miss out on the top four, that victory will make it easier to take than last season's collapse in the league that also saw them miss out.\nBut they will be highly frustrated, knowing a win at Stamford Bridge would have guaranteed their place in next season's Champions League.\nThey need either Burnley or Crystal Palace to deny Liverpool, or to beat Spurs at least 3-0 on the final day (they need even more goals if the Reds win their games by more than one).\nThey were excellent on Saturday against Chelsea but disappointing in this game.\nIheanacho's introduction after 60 minutes made them look a better team and he gave them hope with a first-time strike, and also forced a save from Edouard Mendy.\nThat goal gave the Nigerian the unusual distinction of being the first player to score a Premier League goal on all seven days within a single season.\nThey did have one late chance to level - and it was a big one - as an unmarked Ayoze Perez shot over the bar as the clock ticked 90.\nJorginho equals Milner record - match stats\nIt is the first time where the sides starting the day in the top three of the Premier League all played but did not win since 31 January 2017 (Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea)\nLeicester have won just two of their last 30 away league games against Chelsea (D11 L17)\nChelsea have scored 10 Premier League goals via corners this season, more than any other team.

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 1-0 Sheffield United: Joe Willock scores for sixth straight game as fans return\nJoe Willock scored for the sixth successive game as Newcastle United welcomed 10,000 fans back to St James' Park by beating relegated Sheffield United.\nThe 21-year-old on-loan Arsenal midfielder headed home Jacob Murphy's cross in front of the Gallowgate End to become the youngest-ever player to net in six straight Premier League games.\nWillock's strike ensured a relatively serene reunion with supporters for Magpies boss Steve Bruce - who has come under criticism from a section of fans - although there were a few smatterings of disquiet.\nThat could have been different had David McGoldrick taken an early chance to put the visitors in front but he steered Enda Stevens' lay-off wide from just inside the box.\nAfter that let-off, however, Allan Saint-Maximin teased and tormented the Blades backline, playing a key part in the goal, before being substituted with what appeared to be a calf injury in the second half.\nIndeed, injuries were the only real downside for the hosts, already without top scorer Callum Wilson, as Willock also limped off to cast doubt over whether he will have the chance to extend his scoring run.\nFollow live text commentary from all of Wednesday's Premier League games\nMagpies hit form - at right or wrong time?\nBruce will point to injury and unavailability as one of the reasons for the Magpies' mediocre season, having been deprived of Wilson and long Covid sufferers Maximin and Jamaal Lascelles for long spells.\nWith Joelinton also withdrawn in the first half and goalkeeper Martin Dubravka - clearly in pain - forced to finish the game as Newcastle had made all their permitted substitutions, Bruce would be forgiven for being happy to see the season end on Sunday.\nOn the other hand, his side are in arguably their best form of the campaign after a fourth win in eight games - a run that has included victories over West Ham and Leicester, draws with Liverpool and Tottenham, and a display that gave champions Manchester City a run for their money.\nIf their walking wounded can round the campaign off with a win at Fulham, Bruce's side, who began Wednesday 17th in the table, could astonishingly match or better their 13th-placed finish last term.\nOne of their first orders of business this summer will surely be to see if they can tempt Willock to return, either on a lengthier loan or permanently, after proving a revelation since his January transfer deadline day switch.\nHe showed he is as adept with his head as with his feet by rising above Jayden Bogle to power home the winner in first-half stoppage time, a goal met with acclaim by Newcastle fans attending a home game for the first time in almost 15 months.\nRamsdale again impresses for travel-sick Blades\nMcGoldrick and keeper Aaron Ramsdale have been two of the shining lights in a forgettable season for Sheffield United and both did their best to help the Blades come away with something.\nWhile McGoldrick did waste the visitors' best chance seven minutes in, his effort was only just wide and he was incredibly unlucky with a dipping 25-yard shot in the second half that clipped the bar.\nRamsdale, meanwhile, came through a testing opening few weeks with the club to produce a string of superb displays and the \u00a318.5m signing made a stunning one-handed save to keep out Jonjo Shelvey's close-range header.\nHe produced a save just as good to deny Willock, although the offside flag would have ruled that one out, before reading Saint-Maximin's intentions to deny Dwight Gayle a sure-fire tap-in after the break.\nUltimately, though, neither player could prevent a 16th defeat in 19 away games for the Blades, who will bid to avoid two unwanted Premier League records when fans return to Bramall Lane for their final game at home to Burnley.\nThis loss equalled the mark of 29 Premier League defeats in a season, held by Ipswich, Sunderland and Derby. And they remain on 19 goals, one short of Derby's record-low of 20 in 2007-08.\n'We'd love to bring him here' - what they said\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce speaking to BBC Sport: \"The supporters were terrific. When you think there were only 10,000 here, the difference is amazing.\n\"We could have put it to bed a bit earlier. Some of our play in the first half was very decent.\n\"We all aspire to take Newcastle into the top half of the table. We have to be actively better than just surviving. We have got the makings of a half-decent team.\"\nOn the prospects of keeping Joe Willock at Newcastle: \"It's a double-edged sword. We have to respect he's Arsenal's player. If we can, we'd love to bring him here.\n\"Let's see what we can do because he's exactly what we needed. Joe has still got a lot to learn but we have given him a freedom and a licence to get forward. He is a young player enjoying his football.\"\nBlades caretaker boss Paul Heckingbottom: \"We started really well, stopped Newcastle playing forwards, won the ball back in good areas and then broke from those areas and created chances, which we didn't take.\n\"Then we got punished with the last kick before half-time, and that's been the story of the season, hasn't it? It's been no lack of effort, the players have been there.\"\nSaint-Maximin rivals Messi as dribble king - the stats\nNewcastle have won four of their past seven Premier League games (D1 L2), as many as they had in their previous 23 matches in the competition combined.\nThis was Newcastle's first home win without conceding in the Premier League since June 2020, with that also coming against Sheffield United in a 3-0 victory.\nSheffield United were beaten for the 16th time away from home in the league this term, with only Burnley in 2009-10 (17) ever suffering more away defeats in a single Premier League campaign.\nSheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale ended on the losing side in a Premier League game for the 50th time, with his 74 appearances being the fewest to 50 defeats of any player in the competition's history.\nNewcastle's Allan Saint-Maximin completed 15 dribbles against Sheffield United; the joint-most by a player in a single game in the top five European leagues this season, along with Lionel Messi versus Celta Vigo (also 15).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle finish their Premier League season with a trip to relegated Fulham on Sunday (16:00 BST), while Sheffield United host Burnley at the same time."

        "article_text": "Everton 1-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Richarlison header keeps alive Toffees' European hopes\nEverton kept alive their hopes of playing European football next season as Richarlison's header gave the Toffees victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in front of their own fans at Goodison Park.\nAfter a goalless first half, Richarlison rose highest to power home a header early in the second half.\nThe Brazilian had been the home side's most dangerous player, having forced a good save out of John Ruddy in the first half before firing wide from close range.\nAdama Traore went closest to scoring for Wolves but his powerful first-half drive was tipped over superbly by Jordan Pickford.\nThe Everton goalkeeper had also done well to keep out a Morgan Gibbs-White volley as the visitors had the better of the opening 45 minutes.\nBut that was as close as Wolves got as Everton instead finished the game strongest with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison going close to adding to the scoreline.\nThe victory ensured the Toffees finished a disappointing home campaign on a high and means they go into the final round of Premier League fixtures this weekend with a chance of a top-seven finish.\nThey are currently eighth, level on points with Tottenham and three behind West Ham.\nReaction to Everton v Wolves, plus the rest of the Premier League action\nReturn of fans boosts Everton\nEverton have really struggled on home soil this season and their loss to Sheffield United at Goodison Park last time out left manager Carlo Ancelotti saying he felt embarrassed as his side suffered a record-equalling ninth home loss of the season.\nThe absence of fans has undoubtedly played a part and it is no surprise that Everton's best performances in their own ground this season - a 1-0 win against Chelsea and a 2-1 defeat of Arsenal in December - came in front of watching Everton fans.\nThere were 6,500 Toffees spectators back in the stands for the visit of Wolves and their return certainly gave the home side that extra bit of spark that has often been lacking.\nThere were times when familiar bad habits slipped through, particularly in the first half as they often lacked quality in the final third.\nBut there was a distinct determination to work hard in front of their fans. After taking the lead three minutes into the second half the home side dug in to repel any hint of a Wolves fightback and secure what could yet prove to be a vital victory in the race to secure European football.\nIt will not be easy, with Everton heading to champions Manchester City on the final day this Sunday but they will head to Etihad Stadium with a stronger chance than many fans perhaps anticipated after the disappointment of the Blades loss.\n\"The reaction was good,\" Ancelotti told BBC Sport.\n\"We are in the fight. It is unpredictable but we are still in the fight. Maybe we are going to have the most difficult game of the season but to be in the fight is important.\"\nOn having fans back and their positive influence, Ancelotti joked: \"Knowing this, we don't need to sign new players if the supporters are in the stadium next season.\n\"They make a difference, in the history of the club our supporters make the difference and next season they will make a difference. It was nice to see them, totally different atmosphere.\"\nWolves winding down a season to forget\nWhile Everton have generally been poor at home, it is on the road where Wolves have found their struggles this season.\nThey had won only one of their 13 Premier League away games before the trip to Everton - a significant reason why Nuno Espirito Santo's side are certain to finish outside the top 10 for the first time since they were promoted to the top flight in 2018.\nWhile Pickford did make an excellent save to deny Traore, Wolves were disappointing in attack, particularly with their set pieces.\nThey had 11 corners in the first half alone against Everton but were unable to make the most of them as they failed to score in the first half for the 30th time in the Premier League this season - the most in the top flight.\nInjuries have certainly played their part in a disappointing campaign for Wolves but regardless they will be targeting a much-improved campaign next term.\n\"It was a good performance,\" Wolves boss Nuno said. \"The first half was very good, the goal changed the game. The first half was very positive, dominant, [there was] control and aggression. Very good.\n\"The bad was the focus and concentration on the set-piece that changed the game.\"\nTraore the first since Traore - the stats\nEverton have completed their first league double over Wolves since the 1975-76 campaign when managed by Billy Bingham.\nWolves have lost their final away league game of the season in each of the last five campaigns.\nEverton's win was only their sixth at home in the Premier League this season. Despite victory, their total of 22 points at home in 2020-21 is their lowest in any league campaign in their history when converting to three-points-per-win all-time.\nWolves have failed to score in the first half of 28 Premier League matches this season, the joint-most of any side along with Sheffield United.\nGylfi Sigurdsson, who set up Richarlison's opener for Everton from a corner, has assisted 21 Premier League goals from set plays since his debut in January 2012, the third-most of any player in the competition after Chris Brunt (25) and Christian Eriksen (24).\nAdama Traore was fouled six times in this match; the last Wolves player to be fouled at least six times in a Premier League match was Traore against Sheffield United in April, while the previous occasion was also the Spaniard against Southampton in November.\nWhat next?\nEverton conclude their Premier League campaign at champions Manchester City on Sunday, 23 May (16:00 BST), while Wolves host Manchester United at the same time.\nPowerful new drama Danny Boy: Searching for truth in the fog of war\nThe Cost of Concussion: Watch as former rugby players take legal action over their brain injuries"

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Aston Villa: Spurs' European hopes dented\nTottenham's hopes of securing European football were dented as Aston Villa came from behind to claim a deserved Premier League victory in front of 10,000 fans at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nAs speculation increases about Harry Kane's future before the summer transfer window, chants of \"He's one of our own\" were sung by the returning home fans, who were welcomed back by Steven Bergwijn's thumping eighth-minute opener after he had stolen possession from Marvellous Nakamba.\nVilla's response warranted an equaliser and it was Sergio Reguilon who delivered it as the Spurs left-back sliced Nakamba's cross into the top corner of Hugo Lloris' goal.\nOllie Watkins completed the turnaround before half-time, collecting Reguilon's weak clearance and holding off the challenge of Eric Dier before finding the bottom corner to continue his fine first season in the top flight.\nWatkins was thwarted by Lloris either side of half-time, and although Spurs did test Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez more regularly following the restart through Bergwijn and Kane, they failed to find an equaliser.\nSpurs - booed at the final whistle as fans stayed long after full-time to protest - dropped to seventh following West Ham's victory over West Brom. They are level on points with Everton going into their final game against Champions League hopefuls Leicester City on Sunday.\nReaction to Spurs v Aston Villa, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League action\nTottenham 'lost sight of priorities', says chairman Daniel Levy\nSpurs slump with Kane's future in doubt\nThe game began to a backdrop of reports this week\n, external\nclaiming Harry Kane has a 'gentleman's agreement' in place to depart the club - and has even formally asked to leave.\nWith the England captain having a six-year deal running until 2024, the club has said \"finishing the season as strongly as possible\" is its only focus and prior to kick-off interim boss Ryan Mason said speculation surrounding Kane's future had not been a distraction.\nHowever, Spurs were notably poor following Bergwijn's emphatic opener and fighting for sixth place and Europa League football on the final day is unlikely to do much to convince Kane that he can win silverware if he stays.\nReguilon endured a first half to forget as, under no pressure, his swiped attempt at a clearance sent the ball beyond Lloris to score the 1000th own goal in Premier League history before surrendering possession for Villa's second.\nThe hosts were much improved after the interval, registering more shots in the first five minutes (four) than in the entire first half - although Bergwijn's attempt from close range was the closest they came to earning a valuable point.\nEven the introduction of on-loan Gareth Bale, making his final home appearance before returning to Real Madrid, could not inspire a fightback - indeed they were second best for large periods of the match and a nasty injury to Japhet Tanganga compounded a miserable evening.\nSpurs, who currently occupy a qualification place in the new Europa Conference League play-off round, will have to win away at Leicester on the final day and hope West Ham lose to Southampton if they are to claim a Europa League spot.\nWhatever the outcome on Sunday, it looks set to be a summer of significant change at the club.\n\"It's a big game for us [on Sunday], it's a big game for them [Leicester City]. We have to get over this. We will work tomorrow, there is no doubt we have to be ready and we know what we have to do,\" Tottenham interim boss Mason told BBC Sport.\nOn Harry Kane, he added: \"He means a lot. He's a Tottenham player. I've answered so many questions on Harry Kane in the last 24 hours. I'm willing to speak about the game but not individuals. We were fully focused on the match and I'm very disappointed.\"\nSpeaking on BBC's Match of the Day, former England captain Alan Shearer said: \"Yes [I think that was Kane's last home game for Spurs] and I don't think anyone or any Tottenham fan would hold it against him. He's given absolutely everything for the club. He's been magnificent.\n\"For all we know, he might have asked to leave last summer and they've persuaded him to stay one more year. There are some big hitters after him. Manchester City will need someone, Manchester United will need someone, Chelsea will need someone.\"\nDetermined Villa deserve victory\nWhile Villa's hopes of a top-half finish have ended, there was no evidence that Dean Smith's side regard their season as over as they inflicted a damaging defeat on opponents who in theory have more to play for.\nIn a microcosm of their 2020-21 campaign, Villa impressed in the first half in defeat by Crystal Palace at the weekend but failed to sustain that level.\nBut, buoyed by the return of Jack Grealish - who created the game's most chances on his first start since 13 February - they made no such mistake on Wednesday as they turned the tide after a slow start to earn a deserved victory.\nHaving earlier had claims for a penalty waved away after he was felled by Lloris, the tireless Watkins demonstrated what he could offer if he is named in England's Euro 2020 squad next week as he married hard work for the team with a well-taken goal.\nIn defence, the return of centre-back Tyrone Mings helped protect the advantage as did some key saves by Martinez, as Villa added yet another win to their best Premier League season since 2009-10.\n\"We're guaranteed 11th now and that's some progress for the club. We have been inconsistent in the second half of the season but our best player has missed 13 games. We saw a confident Jack Grealish today. He looked confident and assured,\" Villa boss Smith told BBC Sport.\nOn striker Watkins, he added: \"He's the best pressing centre-forward in the league in my opinion. He earned the goal himself. It was a great performance from Ollie and he'll probably feel he could have scored a couple more.\"\nWatkins' stellar debut campaign - the stats\nTottenham suffered their first home league defeat under Ryan Mason and their sixth overall this season - their most since 2014-15.\nSpurs lost their final home Premier League match of the season for the first time since 2015-16.\nAston Villa won their ninth away Premier League match of the season, their most in a single campaign since winning nine in 2009-10.\nVilla also registered their first away top-flight win when conceding the first goal since August 2013 - they had been winless in 52 such games.\nOnly Everton (53), Aston Villa (47) and Arsenal (44) have scored more own goals in Premier League history than Spurs (41).\nVilla striker Ollie Watkins has scored 14 Premier League goals this season, the most by a player in their debut season in the competition since Alexandre Lacazette in 2017-18 (also 14), and the most by an Englishman in their first season since Charlie Austin scored 18 for QPR in 2014-15.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham end their campaign away to Leicester City, while Aston Villa host Chelsea. Both games take place at 16:00 BST on Sunday."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-3 Arsenal: Gabriel Martinelli and Nicolas Pepe score late on\nRoy Hodgson says managing Crystal Palace has been a \"fairytale\" despite his final home game in charge ending in disappointment after Arsenal scored twice in injury time.\nVeteran manager Hodgson, 73, announced on Tuesday he will be leaving the club at the end of the season after four years in the job and was given a warm reception from the returning home supporters.\nBut his farewell match at Selhurst Park ended in a last-gasp defeat as Gabriel Martinelli latched onto fellow substitute Martin Odegaard's cross to convert from close range in added time before Nicolas Pepe coolly rolled in Arsenal's third four minutes later.\nChristian Benteke's diving header from Andros Townsend's free-kick had levelled for the home side after Pepe had volleyed in to finish off a neat Arsenal move.\n\"It has been exceptionally good,\" Hodgson told BBC Sport. \"I never really envisaged it. From being on the terraces at the age of five to finish managing the team at the age of 73 - it is something of a fairytale or like Roy of the Rovers. It's been a privilege.\n\"I am delighted with the reception they gave me. It seems they appreciated me as much as I appreciated them and that's a nice feeling.\"\nAsked about his favourite moment at the club, Hodgson said: \"In a year or so I might say tonight was the standout moment. A guard of honour, people cheering you throughout and the reception at the end. Not all managers have experienced that in their life.\n\"It was a nice feeling. I am sure that will mean more to me than the odd game or good performance I remember.\"\nPalace can move up a place to 12th on the final day if they better Wolves' result against Manchester United, while Arsenal's hopes of a top-six finish were ended by West Ham's victory over West Brom.\n'It has been a magnificent four years'\nMuch-travelled boss Hodgson is the oldest man to have managed in the Premier League and said on the eve of the game it was the \"right time to step away\" from the rigours of the top flight.\nSince taking over in September 2017, he has further stabilised Palace as a top-flight side, steering them clear of the relegation zone with 11th, 12th and 14th-placed finishes.\nThe former England manager was applauded onto the pitch by the 6,500 Palace fans who made their return to the stadium, while Hodgson received a guard of honour from both sets of players and staff.\nHis farewell looked to be heading for a satisfactory conclusion when Benteke stooped to head home for his 10th goal of the campaign but the visitors' late rally spoiled the mood.\nAddressing the crowd at full time and with the players watching on from the sidelines, Hodgson said: \"It has been a magnificent four years of my career and I enjoyed every moment. We would have liked to have finished the season here with a good result against a top team.\"\nHe perhaps also hinted at retirement from management by adding: \"I shall miss everybody, I shall miss football but it has been a fantastic journey and I thank you very much.\"\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta said: \"I thought it was great to have fans on his day because he deserves what happened before and right now [fans' noise while the interview was happening].\n\"An incredible achievement. He's someone to try to emulate because what he's done in football is remarkable.\"\nLifeline for Arsenal\nUp until the 90th minute, Arteta's side had been largely poor and it looked as if a fairly miserable season was petering out without much incident.\nThe Gunners have lost a club record-equalling 13 games in a 38-game season but Martinelli and Pepe's goals gave their side a lifeline in the quest for European football next season.\nBut they will need results to go their way if they are to finish seventh and claim a place in next season's inaugural Europa League Conference competition.\nDespite failing to offer significant attacking threat for much of the contest, they ended up scoring with all three of their shots on target.\nOn-loan Odegaard started the game on the bench and his future in doubt but the Real Madrid man proved his effectiveness with a delightful cross which Martinelli converted.\nArsenal's excellent late-season form has seen them collect their fourth straight league win for the first time since 2018 and they will go into Sunday's match against Brighton optimistic they can salvage something from a modest campaign.\nArteta added: \"We will keep fighting right up to the last day. If someone said in November or December [they could qualify for Europe] it looked impossible but we've been on a strong run these past six months and we deserve a chance to be there on the final day.\"\nArsenal's young guns - the stats\nArsenal picked up their first Premier League victory against Crystal Palace since January 2018, having been winless in five against the Eagles prior to today.\nCrystal Palace have lost their final home game in a Premier League season for the first time (P12 W8 D3 L1).\nArsenal have won four consecutive Premier League games under Mikel Arteta for the first time.\nGabriel Martinelli (19y & 335d) became the youngest player to score a 90th-minute winner for Arsenal in a Premier League game.\nArsenal have never lost a Premier League game in which a teenager has scored, with tonight (Martinelli scoring) being the 60th such match for the Gunners in the competition, winning 50 and drawing 10.\nFollowing his brace this evening, Nicolas Pepe has scored in back-to-back Premier League appearances for the first time in his Arsenal career.\nCrystal Palace forward Christian Benteke has scored in four consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since April 2013, while only Everton's Dominic Calvert Lewin (7) has scored more headed goals in the competition this season than the Belgian (6).\nBenteke has scored 10 Premier League goals for Crystal Palace this season, the first time he has reached double figures in the competition since 2016-17 (15).\nPowerful new drama Danny Boy: Searching for truth in the fog of war\nThe Cost of Concussion: Watch as former rugby players take legal action over their brain injuries"

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-3 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp delight at 'semi-final' win as Reds move into top four\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp likened his side's victory at Burnley to winning \"a semi-final\" that takes them to Sunday's \"final\" against Crystal Palace and the chance to seal a top-four finish.\nLiverpool's incredible win at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday kept their Champions League hopes alive and at Turf Moor they built on their last-gasp weekend heroics with a victory that was much tighter than the scoreline suggests.\nA cool finish from Roberto Firmino turned the game Liverpool's way then a first club goal for Nathaniel Phillips and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's late drive made the points safe and improved the Reds' goal difference.\nThe Reds are now in the fourth Champions League spot, level on points with fifth-placed Leicester City and with a goal difference four better than the Foxes.\nKlopp's side host the Eagles in Roy Hodgson's last game in charge in four days' time, with 10,000 fans inside Anfield.\nThe Foxes are at home to Tottenham while Chelsea, who are a point better off than both, are at Aston Villa.\n\"Today was a semi-final,\" Klopp told Sky Sports. \"We had to win the semi-final and we did.\n\"Nothing is decided yet but we improved our position and we have the final. That's what we needed. It's what we deserve because this was a top performance.\n\"Now we have to make sure we recover quickly. We have a thin squad in some positions. We have to wrap them in cotton wool.\n\"I can't wait for the 10,00 fans at Anfield. Nothing is decided - Palace are strong.\"\nAction from Burnley v Liverpool, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League games\nLiverpool tighten up top 4 race & bye Big Sam\nLiverpool dig deep for salvation\nHaving required a sensational injury-time goal from goalkeeper Alisson to complete a comeback and beat West Brom at the weekend, the Reds endured another stressful encounter at Turf Moor.\nThey were harried all over the pitch throughout by a committed home side keen to impress their 3,000 fans and provide them with an end to a terrible run of home form.\nLiverpool struggled to deal with the Clarets' energetic pressing, especially in the first-half, with the home side's physicality posing a challenge the Reds failed at times to deal with.\nHowever, despite their relative inexperience at the back, Phillips and Rhys Williams did well on the whole against the in-form Chris Wood, with the former even adding a welcome goalscoring element to his play.\nHaving come up for a corner, the 24-year-old was perfectly placed to head home when Mane swung over a cross from the left - his first goal in what has been an unexpected but vital 20 appearances for the injury-hit Reds this season.\nPhillips also positioned himself perfectly on the line to clear a Ben Mee header that would have given the visitors a far more challenging final 20 minutes.\nAs it was, they snatched a third, with Oxlade-Chamberlain scoring his first goal - a fine finish after evading Charlie Taylor - at the end of a season hampered by injury as well as long spells on the bench.\nIt was Firmino's goal, though, that had much earlier provided the crucial breakthrough, his low finish from Andy Robertson's pull-back being the first shot the visitors had managed on target in a frantic and often end-to-end first half.\nIt was not a comfortable experience for Klopp's side but not much has been during their run of nine games unbeaten that has put them on the verge of salvaging something from this hugely disappointing season.\n\"It never is easy,\" Klopp told BBC Sport. \"I can't remember an easy game against Burnley.\n\"What a job Sean Dyche is doing here. The way they play is so tricky to defend against. They are smart.\n\"Apart from a nervy start passing-wise, we had to adapt to the atmosphere in the stadium, but then we played really good football.\"\nThe Reds are now into the top four for the first time since February off the back of a fourth straight victory - their longest winning run of the campaign.\nOne more will be enough unless Leicester run riot against Tottenham and significantly improve their goal difference.\nBattling Burnley give all they've got\nBurnley have now extended an unwanted club record to 10 consecutive top-flight home league games without a win, dating back to January.\nWith fans back inside Turf Moor, the home side were clearly in a mood to make amends, harrying all over the pitch, snapping into tackles and diving in to block shots.\nJames Tarkowski and Mee were typically combative in an attempt to protect goalkeeper Will Norris, starting his first Premier League game for the club.\nThings could have been different had Wood not fired an effort wide after nipping in behind the Liverpool defence to get on to a long ball forward, but this was indicative of the lack of ruthlessness that has, at times, blighted their season.\n\"We've had a really tough season,\" Dyche told BBC Sport. \"We've had some knocks on the way.\n\"I thought we gave a good account of ourselves. We have actually played pretty well over the last few weeks but we haven't taken our chances.\n\"We could have been effective in the final third when it really counts. That's probably been my biggest bug.\"\nThere is little more Dyche could have asked from his players both in this game and the league campaign, which has again seem them defy their relatively small budget to stay in the division.\nHowever Dyche will be eager to end on a high at Sheffield United before a summer that the long-serving manager will hope sees more investment than in the previous close season.\n\"There's always a lot to do here,\" said Dyche. \"It's a restart every summer. We will see what happens and what can be done investment wise.\n\"We have a base here to work on and it's how we layer up on top of that to find the next generation of players to keep moving forward.\"\nWhen Firmino scores, Liverpool win\nLiverpool haven't lost any of the 14 Premier League matches in which Roberto Firmino has scored the opening goal of the game (W12 D2) - including winning each of the last 11 in a row.\nLiverpool forward Roberto Firmino is only the second player to score in three consecutive Premier League away games at Turf Moor, after Anthony Martial. Indeed, the Brazilian has now scored as many times in his last three league appearances as in the 19 matches beforehand (3).\nIncluding a spell at Stuttgart last season, Nathaniel Phillips' header was his first career goal as a professional, on what was his 20th appearance for Liverpool across all competitions.\nSince the start of last season, Burnley have lost all five of their Premier League games without Nick Pope in goal, conceding 3.4 goals per game on average, compared to just 1.2 in the 70 top-flight games in which he has started for the Clarets.\nSince the start of the 2017-18 season, only Kevin de Bruyne (49) has more Premier League assists than Liverpool full-back Andrew Robertson (35), who assisted twice in a Premier League game for the first time since April 2019.\nPowerful new drama Danny Boy: Searching for truth in the fog of war\nThe Cost of Concussion: Watch as former rugby players take legal action over their brain injuries"

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-3 West Ham: Late goals give Hammers victory\nWest Ham are tantalisingly close to a European return after they came from behind to beat relegated West Brom in the Premier League at The Hawthorns.\nDavid Moyes' side are guaranteed at least seventh place - and a spot in the new Europa Conference League play-off round - unless results go against them significantly on Sunday.\nA point at home to Southampton would ensure sixth spot and a place in the Europa League group stage. It would also mark their highest position since 1999.\nWest Brom already knew they would be playing Championship football next season - but will be doing so without Sam Allardyce. The Baggies boss confirmed after the game that he would not be staying on next term.\nVictory did not come easily for the Hammers, with Declan Rice missing a first-half penalty before Matheus Pereira gave West Brom the lead.\nTomas Soucek levelled before half-time with his 10th goal of the season, but the hosts continued to carry a threat.\nAngelo Ogbonna nodded West Ham in front eight minutes from time, though, before Michail Antonio finished the Baggies off at the end.\nReaction to West Brom's game against West Ham plus the rest of the Premier League action\nFrom relegation candidates to European contenders\nMoyes has effected a remarkable transformation at London Stadium over the past 12 months. With two games left of last season, there was still a possibility they would end up in the Championship.\nSoucek's impact has been immense. But the Czech is not on his own.\nJesse Lingard's arrival from Manchester United during the January transfer window gave the Hammers impetus, while Antonio has justified his manager's decision not to bring in a mid-season striking reinforcement.\nBut West Ham fans will worry whether anyone will come in with a significant bid for Rice.\nThe England midfielder keeps the Hammers moving in his unfussy, mature way and not even a missed penalty could put him off on Wednesday.\nRice struck his effort confidently enough after goalkeeper Sam Johnstone had taken down Antonio, who had seized on Semi Ajayi's terrible backpass. But it crashed back to safety off Johnstone's right-hand post.\nThat was after two minutes and four seconds of play, meaning Rice enters the history books for the earliest penalty miss in a Premier League match.\nAaron Cresswell's inspired free-kick, when he caught Johnstone out of position and rattled the outside of a post, was the visitors' best effort until Ogbonna struck, with his first goal since December, to give West Ham a priceless advantage.\n\"We have been playing really well, but in this game we did not play really well - but it shows we can win in other ways,\" Moyes said.\n\"I am delighted but it is not done. I will go away and sit back and enjoy it and look at the permutations. We have to win our game and then there is no danger.\n\"Overall we have earned it this year [to be in a position for European football] but we have a bit to do yet and hopefully we can get over the line.\"\nAllardyce's decision indicates tough times ahead\nSam Allardyce's decision not to see out the final year of his contract says quite a lot about the financial clout West Brom have to mount an immediate promotion challenge.\nThe former England boss said a few weeks ago that he didn't want to be \"messing around\" if he did drop down to the Championship. Evidently, the odds were not to his liking.\nQuite apart from the loan players who will not be returning, Johnstone and Pereira are likely to be the subject of top-flight interest.\nThe West Brom fans told Pereira \"we want you to stay\" and his goal, a dangerous corner that was on target when Soucek flicked it in, underlined why.\nPereira nearly had another with a stinging effort that was well saved by Darren Randolph, a late replacement for first-choice Hammers keeper Lukasz Fabianski, who was injured in the warm-up.\nAjeyi might have put the hosts back in front with a close-range effort Randolph saved with his chest but this was another of those games where West Brom put themselves in a good position to get a result only to let it slip by the end.\nSoucek equals Nolan's record - the stats\nWest Ham have picked up 31 points in away matches this season, their most on the road in a single top-flight campaign since 1985-86 (also 31).\nWest Brom conceded 39 goals at home in league competition this season, their worst defensive performance at home in a single league campaign.\nWest Ham boss David Moyes has now won each of his past eight Premier League meetings with Sam Allardyce.\nWhen converting to three-points-per-win all-time, only in 1890-91 (10) and 2002-03 (14) have West Brom earned fewer points at home than this season (15).\nWest Ham have failed to score four of their last eight penalties in the Premier League that weren't taken by Mark Noble, while Noble has converted each of his last 10 in the competition.\nMatheus Pereira has been directly involved in 17 goals in the Premier League this season (11 goals, six assists), the most by a West Brom player in a single campaign since Romelu Lukaku in 2012-13 (21).\nMatheus Pereira's 11 Premier League goals for West Brom have all been scored with his left foot - only Stuart Pearce (20/20) has scored more goals in the competition entirely with his left foot.\nTomas Soucek has netted 10 goals for West Ham in the Premier League this season, the most by a midfielder for the club in a single campaign since Kevin Nolan in 2012-13 (also 10).\nWest Ham left-back Aaron Cresswell has assisted eight Premier League goals this season, the most of any defender - each of the last three have been for headers at corners.\nWhat next?\nWest Brom play their last Premier League game for at least a season at Leeds. West Ham entertain Southampton at London Stadium. Both matches are on Sunday, 23 May (16:00 BST).\n-"

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-2 Newcastle United: Willock scores for seventh game in a row\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce says he hopes some of his team's critics \"will eat humble pie and give them some credit\" after victory against relegated Fulham saw the Magpies end the season in 12th place.\nOn-loan Arsenal midfielder Joe Willock scored for the seventh successive game, equalling Alan Shearer's club record, as Newcastle matched their best points tally in the Premier League since promotion in 2017.\n\"We'll never say it's an achievement to finish 12th for a club of our stature,\" said Bruce, \"but I'm delighted with the way we have ended the season.\n\"When we really needed the results, the players and staff have worked tirelessly to turn it round.\"\nWillock's opener was a fine one, marauding from his own half before capitalising on a fortunate rebound to lash the ball into the bottom corner.\nFulham huffed and puffed in front of their 2,000 fans but rarely troubled Martin Dubravka in the visiting goal, their afternoon summed up by Ivan Cavaleiro ballooning over with the goal at his mercy.\nThis 12th blank at home ensures Scott Parker's side take the record of fewest home goals scored in a Premier League season (nine) from Manchester City (2006-07) and Huddersfield (2018-19).\nFor Newcastle, Fabian Schar's composed late penalty sealed a fifth win in eight games.\nAll the action as it happened on the Premier League's final day\nWillock on the shopping list\nA heavy defeat at Brighton on 20 March left Newcastle in 17th place, just two points above Fulham and with pundits ringing this final-day match as a potential relegation decider.\nBut the incredible goalscoring form of Willock means they end the season 17 points clear of the bottom three.\nSigning Willock permanently from Arsenal must be the priority this summer, with club legend Alan Shearer this week calling for Newcastle to \"break the bank\" to complete that deal.\nAll is not well though at St James' Park with owner Mike Ashley still hugely unpopular with many fans and takeover talk quieter of late.\nThe jury is also still out on Bruce, who has overseen two similar campaigns, flirting with relegation before a spring recovery to stabilise in mid-table.\nThey were comfortable here against a Fulham side who offered little but they will need further reinforcements - and to keep key players such as Allan Saint-Maximin and top scorer Callum Wilson fit - if a top-10 push is to be considered realistic next season.\nSummer of uncertainty for Fulham\nFor the fourth year in a row, Fulham enter the summer contemplating life in a different division.\nParker has at times brought an appearance of solidity to Fulham, at least in comparison to their last failed attempt at staying in the Premier League, but it has still ended with the same result.\nAnd with seven loanees returning to their parent clubs, the playing staff looks set for churn once again this summer.\nAfter the game, Parker admitted: \"It's a big summer for us. There are big decisions to be made and we need to make sure we make the right ones.\"\nDoubts also persist over his future, given he has been linked with the vacancy at Tottenham, and there have been reports of friction with the Fulham hierarchy.\nCan Fulham bounce back?\nWhether or not Parker stays, the core of their promotion side remains intact and will be bolstered by the parachute payments that come with a drop to the second tier.\nThere is also plenty of talent blooming in the Fulham academy - their under-18s side just clinched successive Premier League South titles.\nBut there is no hiding from those appalling goalscoring statistics - no shots on target in this one either - and a miserable run of two points in nine games to finish the season may cause a lasting hangover.\nWhat they said\nBruce on the possibility of keeping Joe Willock: \"I couldn't be more pleased for him. He's done so well. We'll try our utmost to keep him but we must respect that he's Arsenal's player.\"\nFulham boss Parker: \"It was a snapshot of our season. We made a real improvement over a short space of time but we've fallen short in the fine margins and the quality of this division.\"\nThe stats - toothless Fulham and clinical Newcastle\nFulham are the first side in Premier League history to fail to hit double figures for home goals in a single season, with the Whites netting just nine in their 19 games in 2020-21.\nNewcastle have won five of their past eight Premier League games (D1 L2), after enjoying just two wins in the 19 before that (D6 L11).\nFulham have lost six home league games in a row for only the second time in their history, since losing seven in a row between November 1961 and February 1962.\nSince April, Newcastle have scored 18 goals in the Premier League, with only Liverpool (20), Tottenham and Manchester City (19 each) managing more.\nJoe Willock is only the second Newcastle player to score in seven consecutive Premier League appearances, after Alan Shearer in 1996, with this just the 13th occasion overall a player has achieved this in the history of the competition.\nSince his Premier League debut for Newcastle on 6 February, Joe Willock has scored eight goals in the competition, a total only Harry Kane, Kelechi Iheanacho (11 each) and Gareth Bale (10) could better.\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

        "article_text": "Wolves 1-2 Manchester United: Nuno Espirito Santo beaten in final game\nWolves were unable to give manager Nuno Espirito Santo the winning send-off they craved as they ended the Premier League season with defeat by Manchester United.\nFour and a half thousand Wolves fans were at Molineux to say goodbye to Nuno, two days after the surprise announcement this would be his last game in charge.\nBut United spoiled the send-off somewhat as they secured a win that ensures they have gone a full league season without losing an away game for the first time in their history.\nAnthony Elanga opened the scoring when he marked only his second Premier League start with a goal, powering home a header inside the first 15 minutes.\nWolves responded well, equalising five minutes before the break when Nelson Semedo scored his first goal for the club by sweeping in from Fabio Silva's smart square ball.\nBut United, who were already assured of second place before the game, reclaimed the lead on the stroke of half-time. Donny van de Beek was caught on the back of his foot by Romain Saiss, and after referee Mike Dean initially decided against awarding a penalty, he reversed his decision following a VAR review.\nThat left the home fans furious, with loud boos greeting the half-time whistle, and there was an added determination about Wolves' play in the second half.\nBut despite plenty of possession they lacked quality in the final third - something that has plagued them all season, in no small part because of injuries to key players.\nRelive a dramatic final day of Premier League action\nHow a Man Utd legend left for Dunstable Town\nDefeat fails to overshadow emotional farewell\nJust 72 hours ago, the most notable thing for many Wolves fans thinking about this fixture will have been the return of supporters to Molineux.\nBut that all changed when it was announced Nuno's four-year reign would come to an end after this game.\nWolves have enjoyed some incredible highs under the Portuguese - winning the Championship with 99 points, successive top-seven finishes in the Premier League, and an incredible run to the quarter-finals of the Europa League.\nAnd the appreciation for what Nuno has achieved was shown by those Wolves fans fortunate enough to have tickets.\nSupporters gathered outside to greet the team bus and cheer Nuno when he stepped off, and his name rang out around the ground as players and officials emerged from the tunnel before kick-off.\nThere were, however, some boos heard from the stands as the players took a knee ahead of kick-off.\nOnce the game got under way it was soon clear the players were determined to put a show on for their departing manager, and Adama Traore flashed a shot wide inside the first two minutes.\nBut when Elanga struck and Traore went off injured, it appeared Nuno would not get the dream farewell.\nSemedo's goal gave a glimmer of hope, but in the end it was not meant to be.\nDespite that, Nuno's name was chanted long after the final whistle as the fans showed their appreciation to a manager who leaves them firmly established as a Premier League team.\nThe old and the new catch the eye\nWith second place long since secured, United's focus now is on Wednesday's Europa League final against Villarreal.\nThat was reflected in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team selection here, with only Axel Tuanzebe retaining his place in the starting XI and Dean Henderson handed the chance to potentially stake his claim for a place in goal in midweek.\nBut it was two of the fringe players that caught the eye.\nElanga, who made his first Premier League start in the defeat by Leicester on 11 May, initially looked nervous and lacking in composure as he spurned two decent opportunities, but his goal was one of real quality as he thumped a header into the back of the net.\nWhile Elanga is at the start of his United career, a player much nearer the other end of his also made his mark. Mata has made 271 appearances for United, but his seven-year association with the club could be coming to an end\n, external\nwith his contract expiring this summer.\nWith Bruno Fernandes not included in the squad, it was Mata who stepped up take the decisive penalty, scoring in typically assured fashion.\nIf this is to be his final Premier League game for United, the winning goal is a fitting send-off.\nMan Utd join elite club - the stats\nUnited have become just the fourth side to remain unbeaten away from home across an entire English top-flight campaign (P19 W12 D7 L0), after Preston (1888-89), Arsenal (2001-02) and Arsenal again (2003-04).\nAfter winning four in a row between 2013-14 and 2016-17, Wolves have lost their past four games on the final day of a league season.\nMata's first Premier League goal in 29 appearances was United's 10th goal from the penalty spot this season - the Red Devils' joint highest tally in a single Premier League campaign (also 10 in 2019-20).\nElanga became the 19th different teenager to score a Premier League goal for United - only Arsenal (20) have had more in the competition's history.\nSemedo became the third Portuguese player to score his first ever Premier League goal against United, after Joao Moutinho in September 2018 and Cedric Soares in December 2018.\nFernandes missed a Premier League game for the first time since signing for United, having appeared in each of the Red Devils' 51 matches in the competition since making his debut on 1 February 2020.\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

We wanted this feeling, this game, this atmosphere. Finishing the season in third is incredible,\" Klopp told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Credit to the boys - I can't believe how it worked out in the last few weeks, incredible.\"\nRelive all the action as it happened on the final day of the Premier League season\nFinal farewells and top four decided\nA top-four spot looked beyond Liverpool when they sat eighth in early March after a campaign undermined by injuries and a catastrophic run of home form including six successive Anfield league defeats.\nEven at the end of April they remained four points off fourth place with just five games to go but won each of those to not only seal a place at Europe's top table again but also leapfrog Chelsea into third.\n\"It's big. If someone told me five, six, eight weeks ago we can finish the season in third - it was out of reach, barely possible,\" added Klopp.\n\"Fighting through this and finishing here in third is the best lesson you could learn in life. From nowhere to the Champions League in five weeks is a massive achievement.\"\nMane poked home from a corner nine minutes before half-time to ease Liverpool's early anxieties and the Senegal forward wrapped up victory with a deflected shot in the 74th minute.\nAndros Townsend gave Liverpool an early scare when he raced clear only to shoot off target but the home side took control from there and eased to victory with few further alarms.\nNo trophies - but Klopp will be delighted\nLiverpool were contemplating a season in the Europa League or Conference - or indeed no European football at all - when Joe Willock's 95th-minute equaliser gave Newcastle United a point on 24 April.\nLiverpool's players and Klopp looked shell-shocked after that match - five days after another dispiriting draw at Leeds United - as they sat in sixth place and looking anything like a side likely to string a series of wins together.\nHowever, with Fabinho back in midfield after his spell in defence, they found their form and the run of victories mean they will be back in Europe's elite tournament next term despite the struggles of this campaign.\nThere was nothing more dramatic than that remarkable last-gasp header by Alisson at West Bromwich Albion, when the keeper raced forward in desperation with Liverpool being held 1-1 and their Champions League hopes slipping away.\nTo finish in the top four is a success, of sorts, given it was delivered in the face of disruption and an astonishing collapse in form - especially at Anfield.\nVirgil van Dijk was ruled out for the season by a knee injury in September, soon to be followed by fellow defenders Joe Gomez and Joel Matip while new signing Thiago Alcantara's Liverpool career got off to a false start, also because of injury.\nThe likes of captain Jordan Henderson and \u00a345m summer signing Diogo Jota were also ruled out for lengthy periods.\nThrow in the worst run of home results in Liverpool history and it seems remarkable that a season containing so much poor form can conclude on the relative high of third place ahead of the likes of Chelsea and Leicester City, who had been ahead of them for so long.\nLiverpool have not come close to silverware but the scenes when Mane scored his second and at the final whistle - muted celebrations at best - hinted at a mixture of delight and relief that Klopp and his players had made the best of a bad job this season.\nThere was also a fond farewell to Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, whose contract expires this summer, with a post-match guard of honour.\n\"It is very emotional for me because I lose a friend and I will miss him but it is normal in football these things happen,\" added Klopp.\n\"Each club who is interested in him should call me because I couldn't be more positive about what he did. Now it looks like the time is over but nobody can take our memories from us.\"\nHodgson's tame ending\nRoy Hodgson's Premier League managerial career is likely to have ended at Anfield, where he endured a short and unsuccessful spell in charge after succeeding Rafael Benitez in summer 2010.\nHe did not win over Liverpool fans back then, but heard the sound of warm applause from them on Sunday when he made a pre-match appearance at the side of the pitch.\nPalace started as if they were in the mood to give Hodgson a victorious send-off and scupper Liverpool's Champions League plans, but once Townsend missed a good early chance and Mane had put Klopp's side in front, the traffic largely flowed in only one direction.\nHodgson has done a predictably steady job but now the Palace hierarchy must decide on their next move, with the hunt on for a new manager and numerous players coming to the end of their contracts.\nThere will, no doubt, be the usual summer speculation surrounding forward Wilfried Zaha but, no matter whether he stays or goes, it will be a time of change at Selhurst Park.\n\"It's been a wonderful time. It's quite incredible what the players have done,\" Hodgson told BBC Sport.\n\"I'm very proud of the performance. We played a top, top team. As a last game of the season, with nothing to play for, we gave them a really good game.\"\nHe added: \"I know I have to come to terms with the fact my last game has been played and I am pleased that last game has been played at Anfield, this is one of the temples of football.\n\"You're in the Premier League to get visits to Old Trafford and Anfield and when I look back on it with a bit more distance I think I will be pleased it was here for the last time, albeit against a team who were much better than us on the day.\"\nPalace's Liverpool woes - the stats\nLiverpool finished the season third, and have now been in the top four in all five of their full seasons under Jurgen Klopp. It's the club's longest run of finishing as high as fourth in England's top-flight since doing so in 10 straight campaigns from 1981-82 to 1990-91.\nCrystal Palace have lost each of their last eight league meetings with Liverpool, conceding 24 goals in the process (three-per-game on average).\nLiverpool won their two Premier League meetings with Crystal Palace this season by a combined 9-0 score; only against Ipswich in 2001-02 (11-0) have they enjoyed a bigger aggregate margin across two Premier League meetings with an opponent in a season.\nLiverpool's Mane has scored in eight consecutive Premier League games against Crystal Palace, becoming just the second player to score in eight consecutive Premier League appearances against a single opponent, after Robin van Persie against Stoke.\nMane has scored 10 or more goals in all seven of his Premier League seasons (two with Southampton, five with Liverpool), the most number of campaigns by any player while scoring 10 or more in all of them.\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-0 Brighton: Nicolas Pepe scores double for Gunners\nNicolas Pepe scored twice in the second half as Arsenal beat Brighton, only to be denied a place in Europe by Tottenham's fightback against Leicester.\nA strong finish to the season moved the Gunners within a point of their north London rivals heading into the final day, and with Arsenal cruising after Pepe's double, they were set to snatch seventh place from Spurs.\nDespite finishing the season with a fifth straight league win, Arsenal were condemned to an eighth-placed finish as Tottenham clinched a 4-2 victory at the King Power Stadium.\nThat result ends the Gunners' record of playing in Europe every season since 1995-96 and means they have not finished above Spurs since 2016.\nArsenal director Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan, was in attendance and some of the 10,000 fans returning to Emirates Stadium held banners that read 'Kroenke out', with the club's involvement in the abandoned European Super League having intensified ill-feeling towards the board.\nFans also voiced their disapproval during the game and as news of Tottenham's win filtered through after the final whistle, a cruel blow after Arsenal thought they had salvaged something from what has been a lacklustre season.\nAll the reaction from the Premier League's final day\nArsenal turnaround offers some encouragement\nThe mood at the final whistle was in stark contrast to that midway through the second half.\nArsenal were firmly on top, with Gabriel heading against the crossbar in the first half before Pepe controlled Calum Chambers' low ball into the Brighton box and fired right-footed past goalkeeper Robert Sanchez.\nPepe then added his 16th goal of the season, stroking the ball inside the far post with his left foot after the recalled Martin Odegaard rolled the ball into his path on the right wing.\nThere was a party atmosphere inside the ground when Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey volleyed against the crossbar and leapfrogging their derby rivals looked possible.\nAfter Arsenal's defeat at Everton on 19 December, that seemed unthinkable as the Gunners were 15th, four points above the relegation zone and 11 behind third-placed Tottenham.\nThe fact they got so close, even after being seven points adrift of Spurs with five games left, offers some encouragement for next season.\nSo too the form of Pepe and Odegaard. Ivorian Pepe has finished the season with five goals in three games, suggesting he could be a key man for Arsenal next term, while Norwegian Odegaard played like he wants to return for another loan stint from Real Madrid.\nArsenal forward Pepe has 'come a long way', says Arteta\nPotter keeps building at Brighton\nBrighton were hoping to finish the season with a flourish, despite being assured of another year of Premier League football with three games to spare.\nThey drew with West Ham then came from behind to beat champions Manchester City on Tuesday, reaching 41 points to equal their best tally in four seasons in the Premier League.\nThey were unable to improve on that at the Emirates, having just one shot on target, while Arsenal's victory would have been more emphatic had Rob Holding not had a first-half effort disallowed for offside after Partey flicked on an Odegaard corner.\nThat meant the Seagulls finished one place lower than last season in 16th, but in his second year on the south coast, manager Graham Potter continues to improve the quality of his team and make their football easier on their eye.\nThe 46-year-old has already been linked with the Tottenham job this summer, but if Brighton can retain his services, along with the likes of defender Ben White and midfielder Yves Bissouma, they can hope to improve again next term.\n'It wasn't in our hands, but we tried our best' - what they said\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta: \"It wasn't in our hands. We tried to do our best, but it was not enough.\n\"This club deserves trophies and the Champions League and we haven't managed to do that in very challenging circumstances. Now we have to be critical of ourselves and prepare for next season in the best possible way.\n\"It is frustrating because last season with 61 points we [would have finished] fifth. Now we are eighth and that is the step that we have to identify.\n\"The level has gone so high so the only way to do it is to be much better next season and much more consistent, and this is the challenge ahead of us.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter: \"We did our best but we just weren't good enough today. The boys kept going and I can't criticise them for that. Sometimes you have to be honest and say we weren't at our level.\n\"We have had a tough week, a tough season and maybe today was a step too far for us. We weren't good enough to maintain attacks long enough. We didn't do enough to win the game so the result is a fair one.\"\nArsenal end the season strongly - the stats\nDespite finishing the season with five straight league wins, Arsenal have finished as low as eighth in consecutive campaigns for the first time since a run of four between 1973-74 and 1976-77.\nArsenal kept three clean sheets in their last five Premier League games, more than they had in their previous 14 in the competition (two).\nArsenal had three players score 10+ Premier League goals this season (Alexandre Lacazette, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Nicolas Pepe) - the first time they've had as many reach double figures since 2016-17 (Alexis Sanchez, Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott).\nArsenal have won their final league game in each of the past 10 Premier League campaigns, and haven't lost one since 2004-05 against Birmingham.\nBrighton have lost three consecutive away league games for the first time since January 2020.\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

        "article_text": "Leicester 2-4 Tottenham: Brendan Rodgers feels 'nothing but pride' for players\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers says he has \"nothing but pride\" for his players despite seeing their hopes of Champions League qualification dashed by a dramatic final-day defeat by Tottenham.\nStarting the last round of fixtures in fifth place, the Foxes knew their best chance of finishing in the top four was to win and hope Liverpool and Chelsea slipped up in their respective final games.\nChelsea did leave the door open, losing 2-1 at Aston Villa, but Leicester were unable to do their part and finished a point behind Thomas Tuchel's Blues.\nIt means the Europa League awaits the Foxes again.\n\"It's hugely disappointing for us,\" Rodgers told BBC Sport. \"We fought so hard all season. I always said you're judged after 38 games, and unfortunately we couldn't quite make it.\n\"I have nothing but pride and admiration for the players. They've constantly had things go against them with injuries. If you look at the importance of the players out today, we were able to take it down to the last game and the last 15 minutes.\n\"The ownership have given me amazing support. The players have given me their heart and souls every day. I'm so disappointed for them we couldn't get over the line.\"\nIt was Gareth Bale who hammered in the final nails, finishing low into the bottom corner to put Spurs ahead in the game for the first time in the 87th minute, before following up his own shot that had hit the post to add a second in stoppage time.\nIn truth, though, it was an own goal from Kasper Schmeichel that really ripped the heart out of City's challenge, with the keeper punching a corner into his own net under pressure to make the score 2-2 with 14 minutes left.\nPrior to that, with Chelsea losing at Villa, two coolly taken penalties from Jamie Vardy - both of which he was fouled for - looked to be sending the Foxes into Europe's premier competition for just the second time.\nThe match may also represent the final one in a Tottenham shirt for talismanic striker Harry Kane, who has signalled his desire to leave the club this summer.\nIf so, the England captain has signed off with the 221st goal of his Spurs career - a fine first equaliser from inside the box that also takes him to a Golden Boot-winning tally of 23 for this league campaign.\nWhether a place in the new Europa Conference League - Tottenham's reward from this season through their seventh-placed finish - is enough for Kane, remains to be seen.\nSunday's game may also be the last for Bale, who ended his loan spell from Real Madrid in impressive fashion, and interim manager Ryan Mason, with the club considering numerous candidates as a permanent successor to Jose Mourinho.\nAll the reaction from the Premier League final day\nKane wants 'honest conversation' about future with Spurs chairman\nLawro's full predictions v Noel Gallagher\nLeicester down but far from out after season of progress\nLast season, defeats in their final two games saw Leicester drop to fifth and miss out on the Champions League after being in the top four since September.\nIt was a case of deja vu this time around, with this crushing loss coming after a 2-1 defeat at Chelsea in their penultimate game.\nIt will hit harder, though, as Rodgers' team had spent more days in the Premier League's top four than any other side this season - 242 in total - and yet failed to finish there.\nIt will not feel like it, but it has been another season of impressive progression for the Foxes, who have played some superb football, built around a trusty old guard and a host of exciting young talents, including Wesley Fofana and the resurgent Kelechi Iheanacho.\nIt was telling just how much an injury to the former in the first half affected the home side, with Tottenham coming back into the game and finding their first equaliser.\nEither side of that, though, it was all about Vardy, who calmly dispatched the two spot-kicks he himself had won by drawing fouls from Toby Alderweireld and Davinson Sanchez - the first of which needed a pitch-side VAR check from Anthony Taylor.\nThese games are emotional affairs, with mental strength as important as physical.\nRoared on initially, Leicester were typically aggressive and attacking, but as the game wore on, the clear nerves among the watching fans began to permeate onto the pitch, with the home players growing increasingly reticent to do anything that may cause a mistake.\nThe mistake did come, with Schmeichel misjudging a corner and punching into his own net, a blow from which they failed to recover.\nThe players were still cheered as they paraded the FA Cup after the game. When the disappointment of Sunday fades, they will begin to appreciate just what that trophy represents for their season.\n\"I said to the players before the game we've been playing non-stop - except for 21 days - for two years,\" added Rodgers.\n\"When we started work together we were mid-table and just over two years later we're challenging the elite and won the FA Cup for the first time in our history and we're on the right path without the resources [of other teams].\n\"We need a period to go away and recover and relax a little bit. Premier League management is intense. We have work to do to improve the squad and come back early July motivated.\"\nTottenham face summer of change\nUnlike Leicester, Tottenham have a summer of huge change ahead of them.\nTheir seventh place represents their lowest Premier League finish since coming eighth in 2008-09 and gives them a Europa Conference League spot - not good enough for a club believing itself worthy of a place in the now abandoned European Super League.\nTop of Daniel Levy's in-tray is to resolve the future of Kane.\nThe 27-year-old once again showed that he is one of the best finishers in the business, firing in after Son Heung-min's cross looped to him in the box to make it an unmatched 23 goals in the division this campaign.\nHe has won the Premier League Golden Boot for a third season (also 2015-16 and 2016-17), becoming only the third player to win the award as many as three times, after Thierry Henry (four) and Alan Shearer (three).\nBale is also unlikely to be in a Spurs shirt next season, meaning Levy will have to find a way to replace almost half of the league goals his team have scored in 2020-21.\nHe also has to appoint a new manager.\nThis was Mason's fourth win from his seven games in charge and the most impressive, but whether that is enough to give the 29-year-old rookie the job remains to be seen.\n\"[We showed] immense qualities - to play, to be brave, to be aggressive, to work for the team,\" said Mason.\n\"There was an energy in here, you could feel there was a lot riding on the game. We used that to our advantage. We used the fact it was a big game for them, it was a big game for us.\n\"It's no secret - we want to finish higher. We're disappointed not to be in the Champions League.\n\"We have to respect any European competition we're in and we will. We'll have to come back stronger next season.\"\nSix defeats in 13 seals Leicester's fate\nHaving only lost six of their first 25 Premier League games of the season (W15 D4 L6), Leicester have since lost six of their past 13 league matches of 2020-21 (W5 D2 L6).\nSince Leicester's promotion in 2014, their 14 Premier League meetings with Tottenham have seen 54 goals scored; since 2014-15, the only fixture to witness more goals in the competition is Arsenal v Liverpool (58).\nLeicester's Jamie Vardy has scored two penalties in three different Premier League matches (all this season) - only Steven Gerrard has done so in more different games in the competition's history (four).\nTottenham's Harry Kane has scored 15 goals in just 12 Premier League appearances against former club Leicester; in the competition's history, only Alan Shearer (20 v Leeds and 16 v Everton) and Les Ferdinand (16 v Everton) have scored more times against a single side.\nWith 23 goals and 14 assists, Kane recorded his best Premier League season for goal involvements (37), overtaking his 36 from 2016-17.\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

        "article_text": "West Ham United 3-0 Southampton: Hammers clinch Europa League spot\nWest Ham clinched sixth place in the Premier League - and a spot in next season's Europa League group stage - after comfortably beating Southampton in front of 10,000 supporters at London Stadium.\nDavid Moyes' side needed only a draw to guarantee a top-six finish, but Pablo Fornals' first-half brace and Declan Rice's late strike ensured the Hammers end a superb campaign on 65 points - their highest tally in the top flight.\nFornals opened the scoring against the run of play, firing into an empty net after Alex McCarthy had steered Jarrod Bowen's goal-bound effort into his path on the edge of the six-yard area.\nThe 25-year-old doubled his tally three minutes later, latching on to Vladimir Coufal's low cross and finding the net via a slight deflection off Saints defender Jannik Vestergaard.\nRice completed the scoring late on with a composed finish from Fornals' clipped pass.\nSouthampton finish the campaign in 15th after suffering their 19th league defeat of the season.\nOnwards and upwards for Hammers?\nEuropean qualification caps a remarkable year for West Ham and their manager Moyes.\nTen months on from narrowly staving off relegation, the Scotsman has guided the Hammers to their highest top-flight finish in 22 years, only missing out on a place in the top four by three points.\nMoyes is reportedly close to agreeing a new three-year contract at the club\n, external\n, but will the 58-year-old be able to keep hold of his prized assets at London Stadium?\nEngland midfielder Rice is likely to attract attention from other clubs, while the future of Jesse Lingard - a revelation since his loan move from Manchester United in January - remains up in the air.\nCzech Republic duo Coufal and Tomas Soucek may also be subject to offers after tremendous campaigns.\nIt was Fornals who set West Ham on their way against Saints, registering his first double for the club since joining from Villarreal in 2019.\nLukasz Fabianski was forced into action on a number of occasions, thwarting Kyle Walker-Peters in the first half before producing a fine stop to deny Jan Bednarek in the second, but Rice put the result beyond doubt late on when he broke clear down the left and drilled a low shot beyond McCarthy in the Southampton goal.\nSaints end season with a whimper\nThis was a limp end to a disappointing season for Southampton, who have collected fewer points in 2021 than any other Premier League club apart from relegated Fulham.\nThey briefly topped the table in early November but injuries eventually took their toll on a small Saints squad, which at one stage featured no fewer than 10 absentees.\nRalph Hasenhuttl has been open in his desire to bolster his options in the summer, but the Austrian manager's biggest test may be persuading star striker Danny Ings to stay at St Mary's.\nThe former RB Leipzig coach has admitted Saints are a \"different side\" with Ings, who has recently been linked with a move to Manchester United\n, external\n.\nIt was the 28-year-old's deft flick which almost led to an early Southampton breakthrough, but Takumi Minamino's effort trickled inches wide of Fabianski's far post.\nWest Ham's goalkeeper had to be at full stretch to deny Bednarek in the second half but there was little prospect of a Saints recovery once Fornals' quick-fire double had given the Hammers a two-goal cushion.\n\"The way we conceded today was a mirror of what we've seen this season,\" Hasenhuttl told Sky Sports afterwards. \"It's very frustrating.\n\"We need a reality check of what we really can achieve. We don't deserve any more.\"\nMoyes' best finish in nine years - the stats\nWest Ham secured a top-six finish in the Premier League for only the second time, with the Hammers also finishing 5th in 1998-99 under Harry Redknapp.\n2020-21 was manager David Moyes' best finish since he came 6th in his final season as Everton boss in 2012-13.\nSouthampton have lost 10 of their 11 Premier League away games in 2021, conceding 33 goals in these 10 defeats, scoring just seven in return.\nSouthampton have conceded more Premier League goals in 2020-21 (68) than they have in any other season in the competition.\nWest Ham have won 19 Premier League games this season - their highest tally of wins in a single top-flight campaign since 1985-86 when they finished third (26 wins in a 42-game season).\nOnly West Ham team-mate Aaron Cresswell (eight) has more assists among defenders in the Premier League this season than Vladimir Coufal (seven).\nWest Ham's Pablo Fornals has scored five goals in the Premier League this season (33 apps), three more than he netted in 2019-20, despite playing three fewer games (36 apps).\n'We've been really consistent' - what the managers said\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, speaking to Match of the Day: \"If you'd said at the start of the season that we'd finish sixth I don't think many would have believed that. After losing the first two Premier League games of the season it didn't look likely, but we've been really consistent. We grew as the season went on.\n\"We started to see signs of players getting better. We've had some brilliant moments on the road, like the 3-3 draw at Tottenham. Moments like that lift you and give you more confidence and belief. We've had some great performances this season.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We don't have to discuss it. This is definitely not Premier League [standard].\n\"We've conceded the second-most goals in the Premier League. We have to change massively, otherwise it'll be about relegation again [next season.]\"\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

        "article_text": "Man City 5-0 Everton: Aguero scores twice as champions clinch thumping win\nManchester City striker Sergio Aguero marked his final appearance at Etihad Stadium with two goals as the new Premier League champions ended their domestic campaign with a thumping win over Everton.\nAguero, who has won five league titles during a glorious decade with City, was not fit enough to start but, with his side already 3-0 up he quickly made his mark after coming off the bench with 25 minutes to go.\nThe 32-year-old Argentina striker scored his 259th goal for the club with a clever curling shot with the outside of his foot, then headed home Fernandinho's cross a few moments later.\nOnly a smart Jordan Pickford block stopped Aguero from completing his hat-trick, the only blip on a memorable day for Pep Guardiola's side and their fans.\nThere were City supporters inside their stadium for the first time this season, and they were able to enjoy a dominant performance from start to finish, topped by Aguero's farewell goals and seeing the Premier League trophy lifted after full-time.\nKevin de Bruyne fired City ahead from the edge of the area after only 11 minutes, then set up Gabriel Jesus to gallop clear and make it 2-0.\nGylfi Sigurdsson had a penalty saved by City keeper Ederson before the home side made sure of the points thanks to a cool finish by Phil Foden after good work by Raheem Sterling and Jesus.\nThe crowd had already been demanding Aguero's introduction for most of the match and, when they got their wish, the club's record goalscorer did not disappoint.\nReaction to Man City v Everton, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League fixtures\nLawro's final-day predictions v Noel Gallagher\nAnother day to remember for Aguero\nAguero's season has been interrupted by Covid and injury, as well as his manager favouring a system without a traditional striker, so this was only his 12th league appearance of 2020-21.\nBut he was never going to go quietly, starting when thousands of fans chanted his name as the team coaches approached Etihad Stadium, briefly blocking the road.\nHis name was also sung when he emerged to warm up, when he came on for Riyad Mahrez and, of course, when he scored his final two City goals at Etihad Stadium - both of which were set up by Fernandinho.\nAguero's goals ensured he broke one last record too - he now has 184 in the league for City, eclipsing Wayne Rooney's 183 for Manchester United which was previously the record for a player at a single club.\nThere could still be more to come from the expert marksman, of course - after celebrating their third domestic title in four seasons, City head for Porto next, where they will face Chelsea in the Champions League final on Saturday.\nEverton's season ends in disappointment\nWhile City were celebrating even before the game began, Everton's campaign ended in disappointment - and the heaviest defeat of a very mixed season.\nThey went into the match knowing a win could see them finish seventh, and secure a place in the Europa Conference League, but instead they fell to 10th.\nThe Toffees led the table at the start of October after winning their first four league games but their European aspirations have been undermined by their dismal home form, the worst in the club's 143-year history.\nTheir away form has been one of the highlights of their past nine months, but the Etihad has never been a happy hunting ground for them and they rarely looked like ending their 10-year wait for a win here.\nEverton's best efforts all came on the counter-attack, and they had an early chance when Dominic Calvert-Lewin saw a shot blocked by Ederson with the score at 0-0.\nAnother breakaway ended with Richarlison going down in the area under a challenge by Ruben Dias but Ederson plunged to his right to keep out Sigurdsson's spot-kick and that effectively signalled the end of Everton's hopes.\nAguero the super sub - the best stats\nAguero scored two goals as a substitute for only the second time for the club, the first being his debut against Swansea City in August 2011.\nEverton have lost each of their last seven Premier League games against Manchester City, only losing more games consecutively in the competition against Manchester United from 1999 to 2004 (nine).\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti suffered the heaviest defeat of his managerial career in what was his 1,167th game in management.\nManchester City gave away 10 penalties in the Premier League this season, the most they have ever conceded in a single campaign in the competition.\nKevin de Bruyne has scored 18 goals from outside the box in the Premier League since joining Manchester City, the second-most of any player since his debut, behind Harry Kane (19). Indeed, 43% of his league goals for Manchester City have come from outside the box (18/42).\nManchester City's Gabriel Jesus has scored eight goals in eight Premier League games against Everton, at least three more goals than he has scored against any other opponent in the competition.\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

Hopefully the players come back in really good shape to have a successful season.\n\"I've had no conversation with the club about the job. My position was clear - take the team until the end of the season. I know there have been discussions about potential managers and I just hope there's a decision soon.\n\"A big decision needs to be made about who is going to be in charge and keeping the squad together is going to be important, and then hitting the ground running at the start of next season.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"There's a frustration in the result and in the last couple of results. But I've asked an awful lot of these players and with injuries to key players - we've got our captain [Ben Mee] missing, a fantastic keeper - they are hard slots to fill when you are a club like us.\n\"It's been a challenging season off the pitch but a challenging season on the pitch, particularly with injuries, so there's a pinch of frustration. But you balance that with the fact we're in the Premier League.\n\"It's been really tough on the players so I'm not going to overly question them. We've petered out at the end but after the big win against Fulham, there's bound to be a bit of that.\n\"We've pulled back the layers of these players, we've asked a lot of them. Now we need some more strength in depth without a doubt.\"\nBramall Lane bogey for Burnley - the stats\nUnited won three of their final six league matches this season (L3), and each of their past four wins were 1-0.\nBurnley have won just one of their past 19 away league games against Sheffield United (D5 L13), triumphing 3-2 in a Championship match in December 2008.\nThe Clarets have now lost their final league game of the season in each of the past five campaigns.\nNo United player has more than two Premier League assists this season (John Lundstram, John Fleck and George Baldock all on two) - in the history of the Premier League, only one other team has gone through a season without a player reaching at least three assists, Charlton Athletic in 1998-99.\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

As soon as [my future is] resolved the club will announce it,\" Bielsa told BT Sport.\nOn Phillips' injury, he added: \"I couldn't tell you if the injury is severe or not but we hope that he can go to the Euros.\"\nWork to do for West Brom\nUnable to commit to West Brom for the long term after failing to save the Baggies from relegation to the Championship, Allardyce confirmed on Wednesday that this would be his final game in charge.\nWith another immediate return to the Premier League required, former Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder appears the standout candidate among those thought to be under consideration for the job.\nThere is much work to be done if the Baggies are to bounce straight back up, with the club facing the prospect of losing key players such as their top goalscorer Matheus Pereira - a noticeable absentee from the squad after he called in sick on Saturday.\nAllardyce's side were much better after half-time as lively substitute Robson-Kanu had three attempts at goal before taking advantage of a poor touch by Phillips with a fine finish.\n\"I'm glad I came back and I'm disappointed I haven't done what I've done previously. We stopped getting thrashed, then we started getting better but unfortunately not good enough,\" Allardyce said.\nWhen asked who might replace him, he added: \"I've told the club what I think and it's up to them. I haven't spoken to them for the last two or three days as we've been concentrating on the game. I'm not too disappointed in the performance but you can't give away goals like we did today.\"\nLeeds' best top-flight winning run since 2001 - the stats\nLeeds won four in a row in a single Premier League season for the first time since April 2001.\nWest Brom lost four league games in a row for the first time since a run of eight consecutive defeats between January and March 2018.\nWith West Brom, manager Sam Allardyce registered his worst points per game with any club in the Premier League (0.76) - averaging exactly one goal scored (25 in 25) and two conceded per game (50 in 25) with the Baggies, which are also lows for the manager in the competition.\nLeeds' striker Patrick Bamford scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season, the most by a player for a promoted club in a top-flight campaign since Charlie Austin for QPR in 2014-15 (18).\nRaphinha registered his ninth Premier League assist for Leeds, the first player to do so in a top-flight season for the club since both Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (13) and Harry Kewell (nine) in 1998-99.\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

Tuchel will hope his injury does not hamper his plans for next weekend.\nTesting summer for Villa\nVilla ended a highly satisfactory season with a thrilling win in front of their own fans, and their total of 55 points is 20 more than they managed last season when they escaped relegation on the final day of the campaign.\nIn front of England boss Gareth Southgate, who names his squad for the European Championship on Tuesday, Villa produced a performance oozing character - but manager Dean Smith faces a big summer.\nGrealish's return from injury has added energy to the side but will the captain be at his hometown club next season?\nThe midfielder, who finished the league season with six goals and 10 assists, continues to attract attention which will no doubt only intensify should he be picked for England for the delayed Euro 2020.\nFellow midfielder Ross Barkley looks likely to return to Chelsea now his loan is over but Villa's future appears to be in good hands.\nOllie Watkins has ended his debut top-flight season with 14 goals while goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez has proved a bargain, the Argentine keeping 15 Premier League clean sheets since arriving for \u00a317m last September.\n'Massive positives' - what they said\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"I think the fans helped us over the line against a very good Chelsea team. The first 20 minutes I had to count there wasn't more than 11 of them as they seemed to get overloads all over the pitch.\n\"It's been a season of progression and to finish six places and 20 points higher than we did last season is a sure sign.\n\"There are massive positives to take from this season but we know we must get better.\"\nChelsea boss Thomas Tuchel: \"I knew three or four minutes before our game was over [that Chelsea had made the top four] because the game at Leicester was over a bit earlier and it was clear we were through.\n\"We did not prepare for the occasion today, we prepared for the match. It's normally hard to create chances against Aston Villa but we created a lot.\"\nVilla's edge over Chelsea - the stats\nAston Villa have taken four points from Chelsea in the Premier League this season, more than they had from their previous 11 league meetings (W1 L10).\nJorginho finished the season as Chelsea's highest scorer in the Premier League with seven goals - all from the penalty spot. He is the Blues' lowest-scoring top-scorer in a top-flight campaign since 1974-75.\nAnwar El-Ghazi's penalty for Aston Villa was the 100th spot-kick scored in the Premier League in 2020-21, the first campaign in the competition to reach triple figures for penalty goals.\nChelsea's Ben Chilwell registered his eighth goal involvement in the Premier League this season (3 goals, 5 assists) - among defenders, only Trent Alexander-Arnold has been involved in more (9).\nWhat's next?\nWhile Aston Villa's players head off for a break, Chelsea now turn their thoughts to Saturday's Champions League final against Manchester City in Porto (20:00 BST).\nWhy do we love wrestling?: Mark Andrews talks to some of the biggest names in the sport about what it means to them\nFive healthy habits to start today: Dr Alex's top tips to making long-term meaningful change"

        "article_text": "Liverpool 4-1 Norwich: Newly promoted side overwhelmed at Anfield\nLiverpool scored four first-half goals as they started the new Premier League season with a blistering performance to demolish newly-promoted Norwich City at Anfield.\nNorwich captain Grant Hanley scored the opening goal of the top-flight season when he sliced Divock Origi's cross into his own net before Mohamed Salah opened his account after a pass by Roberto Firmino.\nGerman midfielder Marco Stipermann forced a fine save by Reds keeper Alisson before an unmarked Virgil van Dijk headed the third from Salah's corner, Origi nodding the fourth after a stunning pass by Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nTeemu Pukki's composed finish reduced the deficit after Liverpool lost Alisson to injury, the Brazil keeper replaced by new signing Adrian after slipping while taking a first-half goal-kick.\n\u2018A disjointed pre-season and a lack of signings \u2013 but Liverpool make ideal start\u2019\nReaction from Anfield\nCan Liverpool break their second-place 'curse'?\nThere was a carnival atmosphere at Anfield for Liverpool's first home game since beating Tottenham in the Champions League final on 1 June and Jurgen Klopp's side responded with a superb display.\nThey might have won by a more handsome margin as Tim Krul palmed Origi's attempt onto the bar after making a brilliant save to keep out Firmino's ferocious volley. Krul also did well to keep out Alexander-Arnold's late free-kick.\nNo Reds hangover from last season's failed title charge\nAny fears Liverpool might be suffering a hangover after missing out to Manchester City by one point in the race for last season's title were quickly dispelled as the Reds started their quest to win a first top-flight title in 30 years in style.\nSupporters were looking for evidence Klopp's team can go one step better than last season and, while bigger tests lie ahead, a thumping win against a team fresh out of the Championship is a decent start.\nAfter a quiet summer in the transfer market, it was the same familiar faces on show including nine players who started the win over Spurs in Madrid in June.\nOrigi, who came off the bench to score in the Champions League final win, helped his side take the lead with a cross which ended in the back of the net after Hanley's misfortune.\nSalah doubled the lead with a trademark low angled finish after Firmino's assist before Salah turned provider with the corner for Van Dijk to make it 3-0.\nLiverpool were coasting and even after losing Alisson to injury they increased their advantage after Alexander-Arnold's sublime pass allowed Origi to head the fourth goal.\nOn a night of positives for the home side, Joe Gomez came through his first league game of 2019 after recovering from a fractured leg.\nHow will the promoted sides fare?\nMan admits posting racist tweets at Salah\nAlisson gives Klopp cause for concern\nKlopp said he was worried about the injury suffered by Alisson, who was a key figure in Liverpool's eye-catching 2018-19 season.\nAfter slipping in front of the Kop, the Brazilian received treatment on the pitch before a stretcher was brought on.\nAlisson eventually managed to get back to his feet and leave the field with help from a physio, but any prolonged absence would be a blow for Liverpool.\n\"With Alisson it is not good, but we will find a solution and move on,\" Klopp told BBC Sport's Match of the Day.\n\"He felt his calf. He looked behind him because he thought something hit him.\"\nThe German added that the Brazilian would not feature in Wednesday's Uefa Super Cup match against Chelsea.\nFormer West Ham keeper Adrian, brought in to replace the departed Simon Mignolet earlier in the week, made one fine save from Moritz Leitner before being beaten by Pukki.\nTough lesson for Norwich\nThis was Norwich's first Premier League game since losing 3-0 at Liverpool's neighbours Everton in May 2016, having already been relegated. They fared no better on their return to Merseyside.\nIn truth, next week's home game with Newcastle will provide a better gauge of how the Canaries will fare this season.\nDespite the scoreline, Norwich caused Liverpool's defence problems and Pukki's lovely finish after Emiliano Buendia's pass at least provoked some gallows humour from Norwich's travelling fans.\n\"One-nil in the second half,\" was the defiant song that rang out.\nNorwich have been busy in the transfer market and although none of their new recruits started at Anfield, expect that to change when they return to Carrow Road next week.\nMan of the match - Divock Origi (Liverpool)\n'I'm totally in love with this team' - reaction\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp told Match of the Day: \"For 60 minutes we looked very sharp, then we have to control the game a bit more. Norwich have all my respect - they stayed cheeky, they enjoyed their football.\n\"At the start of the second half we could have scored a fifth or sixth goal, then Norwich scored. After that we were never in danger but had to work hard to keep the score what it was.\n\"The players had a break (over the summer). For the body it was long enough, nobody asked for longer, so they didn't lose a lot of their physical standards. We have to be a bit smart for the next two games, we have to make a few decisions and try to win both of those games, which will be difficult.\"\nNorwich boss Daniel Farke speaking to Match of the Day: \"We're disappointed. We were greedy, we wanted to be the first team in two-and-a-half years to win here.\n\"But I'm totally in love with this team. The mentality to win the second half in front of an excited home crowd, we showed great character.\n\"No-one wanted to hear it at half-time, but I told them we had the same possession and had created more chances. Liverpool had scored four though.\n\"It was tough to take but I felt we were not too far away from a good result.\"\nHernandez makes Premier League history - the stats\nLiverpool have scored 15 goals in their four opening day Premier League matches under manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp (W3 D1 L0), netting four times in their first match of the league season in consecutive seasons for the first time in their entire history.\nNorwich have won their first match of the league season in just one of the past 17 seasons (W1 D8 L8).\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 13 Premier League games against Norwich (W11 D2 L0), scoring 43 goals across those games, including at least four goals in five of their last seven meetings.\nSalah has scored in Liverpool's first Premier League match in each of the last three seasons (2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20).\nThe first goal of the Premier League season was an own-goal for only the second time - the other occasion was in 2015-16, when Kyle Walker's own-goal was the only goal in Manchester United's 1-0 win over Spurs.\nPukki has scored with his first shot on target in each of the last eight league seasons (across Schalke 04, Celtic, Brondby IF and Norwich careers); a record stretching back to the start of 2012-13.\nLiverpool scored three goals in the opening half-hour of a Premier League game for the first time since February 2014, when they were 4-0 up after 20 minutes against Arsenal.\nLiverpool defender Alexander-Arnold became the first player to register an assist in five consecutive Premier League appearances since Arsenal's Mesut Ozil in 2015, and is one of only eight players in Premier League history to do so.\nNorwich's Onel Hernandez became the first Cuban player in the Premier League, with Cuba the 114th different nationality represented in Premier League history.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool are off to Istanbul to face Chelsea in the Uefa Super Cup on Wednesday (20:00 BST) while Norwich have a full week to prepare for the visit of Newcastle United to Carrow Road on 17 August (15:00)."

        "article_text": "West Ham 0-5 Manchester City: Raheem Sterling gets hat-trick in VAR-dominated game\nRaheem Sterling scored a hat-trick as Manchester City got their title defence off to a winning start with victory at West Ham in a game that saw the video assistant referee play a significant role for the first time in the Premier League.\nThe technology is making its debut in England's top flight this season and, after last night's curtain raiser between Liverpool and Norwich passed off without incident, it took centre-stage on Saturday.\nVAR was first called on when Gabriel Jesus appeared to have put City 3-0 up midway through the second half, only for Raheem Sterling to be ruled fractionally offside in the build-up.\nAfter Sterling added City's third, a moment also reviewed for possible offside, the system then awarded the visitors a penalty retake after Sergio Aguero's tame effort was saved by Lukasz Fabianski but Declan Rice was deemed to have encroached into the area.\nThe striker made no mistake at the second attempt.\nGuardiola praises 'special' Sterling\nVAR's Premier League debut: Did it work?\nThis was, nevertheless, a dominant and deserved victory for Pep Guardiola's side, who laid down a marker for the season ahead in emphatic fashion.\nThe visitors had looked a little short of their best early on but they took the lead midway through the first half when Jesus flicked in Kyle Walker's low ball into the box.\nThey doubled their advantage six minutes into the second half, Sterling sliding in a low shot after being put through by Kevin de Bruyne.\nAfter Jesus' VAR-denied effort, a third did come for City as Sterling ran on to a ball over the defence before coolly lobbing Fabianski. And after Aguero's retaken penalty, Sterling got his third in injury time to complete the rout.\nVAR takes centre stage\nThe advent of VAR has been controversial, not least during a summer in which it was criticised for the confusion it caused within stadiums and the time it took to make decisions at the Women's World Cup.\nThe Premier League, however, had vowed to ensure its use would have minimum impact on the spectacle. That was certainly the case at Anfield on Friday night, where it did not disrupt the flow of the game.\nInitially, that continued in this game as a couple of early incidents were checked and a decision made in seconds.\nBut its first controversial moment arrived early in the second half when City, 2-0 up and looking comfortable, appeared to score a third when they opened the West Ham defence with quick football before Sterling teed up Jesus to slot in.\nThe away fans started celebrating wildly - until 'VAR in review' appeared on the big screen. After a few moments of checking, the goal was ruled out with Sterling's shoulder just beyond the offside line.\nCity fans were understandably more cautious when Sterling stuck the ball in the back of the net soon after and there were ironic cheers when 'VAR in review' once again appeared on the big screen.\nBut this time the goal stood and from then on the fans were in playful mood, occasionally chanting \"VAR, VAR\". But frustrations started to creep in again when Aguero's penalty had to be retaken.\nIf its use in this game is anything to go by, the controversy over VAR is not going to go away anytime soon.\nCity pick up where they left off\nChampions City struck the first blow against Liverpool by winning the Community Shield last weekend, only for the Reds to respond with an impressive 4-1 thumping of Norwich in the league on Friday night.\nAnd a few eyebrows were raised as City made a lethargic start in London, perhaps caught off-guard an aggressive start from the hosts. Ultimately though - as so often last season - it proved a false dawn and the visitors eventually took full control.\nImproving this City side is no mean feat but Guardiola's summer signings look like good additions to an already hugely talented squad.\nRodri, the club's \u00a363m record signing from Atletico Madrid, slotted straight into midfield and impressed with his physicality and eye for a pass.\nAnd even if full-back Joao Cancelo did not start, he still appeared to have had a positive impact on the team - Walker appeared especially keen to impose himself on the game and turned in an impressive performance, including the assist for the opener.\nGames between these two sides have been heavily one-sided affairs in recent seasons, with City having now won their past eight competitive matches against the Hammers, scoring 28 goals and conceding just four in the process.\nOn this evidence, the champions are going to take some stopping.\nHope for Hammers despite big defeat\nWest Ham have struggled to get comfortable at London Stadium since moving in three years ago but former City boss Manuel Pellegrini appears to have steadied the ship since arriving last year - and after a summer in which they look to have recruited well, there is a real sense of optimism among fans that their side can challenge for the top six.\nSebastien Haller and Pablo Fornals have come in for a combined \u00a369m, adding additional flair to an attack that includes Manuel Lanzini and Felipe Anderson.\nHaller, who scored 14 goals in 27 appearances for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, immediately looked a more than capable replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who moved to China in the summer.\nHis excellent hold-up play and ability to bring in others was a big factor in the Hammers dominating their opponents in the opening 20 minutes.\nWest Ham have not had a 20-goal-a-season striker since Teddy Sheringham back in 2004-05. Whether Haller can hit that target this season only time will tell, but his all-round play means he looks set to be a useful acquisition.\nSo while this was another heavy defeat for West Ham against City, it is not a game on which their prospects for the coming season can be fairly judged.\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling (Man City)\nCity cannot stop winning - the stats\nManchester City have won their past 15 Premier League games, three short of their own top-flight record (18 between August-December 2017).\nCity have won their past nine opening fixtures in the Premier League, a run stretching back to 2011-12.\nWest Ham have now lost their past four opening fixtures to a Premier League season, including each of the past three by an aggregate score of 13-0.\nRaheem Sterling became the eighth player to score a hat-trick on the opening weekend of a Premier League campaign, and the first since Didier Drogba in 2010-11.\nGabriel Jesus has been directly involved in 18 goals in his past 10 starts for City in all competitions, scoring 13 and assisting a further five.\nSterling's second goal in this match was his 50th in the Premier League for Manchester City - he's the sixth player to reach the milestone for the club in the competition.\nCity forward Sergio Aguero has scored seven goals on the opening day of a Premier League season - only Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard and Alan Shearer (all eight) have scored more.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham head to Brighton next Saturday (15:00 BST) when Manchester City host Tottenham in the late game (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-1 Sheffield United: Billy Sharp snatches late equaliser for Blades\nSheffield United's Billy Sharp said \"he had dreamed of\" scoring in the Premier League as his late equaliser earned his side a point at Bournemouth in the Blades' first top-flight match since 2007.\nSharp, who had only been on the pitch for six minutes, bundled the ball home from close range after Oliver McBurnie's mishit shot bounced off Nathan Ake and into the striker's path.\nChris Mepham's first Premier League goal, when he smashed in a rebound after Callum Wilson's shot on the turn had been parried by away goalkeeper Dean Henderson, had looked like giving Bournemouth the three points.\nSharp, 33, had only played in two Premier League matches before - both at the start of the 2012-13 season while at Southampton - and began on the bench, despite being the Blades' top goalscorer with 24 goals in all competitions in 2018-19.\n\"I wanted to get on the pitch and help the football club out,\" said Sharp. \"We put bodies in the box, managed to create something and I was the lucky one to get on the end of it.\n\"It was what I dreamed of last night and it was a proud moment for me and the family.\n\"I'm very proud of the boys, they were magnificent. It's a great point, we're off the mark and deserved something out of the game.\"\nBournemouth versus Sheffield United as it happened\nSaturday's Premier League action\nBlades look sharp in Premier League return\nSheffield United had not played in the Premier League since being relegated on the final day of the 2006-07 season and had even had a six-year spell in League One, before they finished second in the Championship last season to regain their place among English football's elite.\nManager Chris Wilder will be delighted with the performance from his side as they did not look overawed at the top level.\nIndeed, the visitors nearly took the lead inside the opening 30 seconds when David McGoldrick's powerful strike was well saved by 21-year-old Bournemouth goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, who was making his Premier League debut.\nRamsdale again did well to deny Callum Robinson a goal in his first senior appearance for the Blades following an \u00a38m move from Preston in the summer, before McGoldrick shot another chance narrowly wide.\nThose missed opportunities looked to be costly when Mepham put the hosts ahead. But Wilder went for it, bringing on \u00a317.5m club record signing McBurnie and then, with eight minutes left, Sharp.\nWilder was rewarded for his decisions with Sharp's first ever Premier League goal to spark great scenes of celebration among their fans.\n\"The manager told us to stick our chests out, be brave,\" added Sharp. \"We all watched Norwich last night. They played very well but got beaten [4-1] by Liverpool.\n\"No disrespect to Bournemouth, but we thought we could come here and get something from the game.\"\nInjury-hit Bournemouth have to settle for a point\nIt has been a testing summer for Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, who was without Arnaut Danjuma, David Brooks, Dan Gosling, Lloyd Kelly, Simon Francis, Lewis Cook and Junior Stanislas.\nThe hosts did not have a shot on target for the first hour before Philip Billing, impressing in his full debut since moving from Huddersfield for \u00a315m in the summer, hit a beautiful strike from 25 yards out which Blades goalkeeper Henderson did excellently to push it wide.\nBut Bournemouth did take the lead within five minutes of that. A free-kick on the right was floated into the box by Ryan Fraser, it got headed back by Billing to Ake, who tried the overhead.\nThat fell to Wilson, whose shot on the spin was not a brilliant connection, but Henderson could only parry the effort with Mepham there to smash in the rebound.\nBournemouth had looked like holding on for the three points and they got a bit unlucky with the Blades' equaliser as McBurnie's shot was going wide before it deflected and hit Ake in the face, then fell for Sharp to deny the Cherries a winning start.\nStats - Mepham becomes Bournemouth's third youngest Premier League goalscorer\nBournemouth have lost just one of their 12 Premier League home games against promoted sides (won seven, drew four).\nSheffield United are winless in their last 11 Premier League away games (drew two, lost nine), with their last such victory coming in December 2006 at Wigan (1-0).\nBournemouth have only won one of their five opening day games in the Premier League (drew one, lost three).\nSince the start of last season, only Liverpool (30) have scored more Premier League goals from set-pieces than Bournemouth (22).\nBournemouth's Chris Mepham netted just his second ever league goal and his first since March 2018 for Brentford, in what was his 57th league appearance.\nAt 21 years and 278 days old, Chris Mepham is Bournemouth's third youngest goalscorer in the Premier League after David Brooks and Nathan Ake.\nMan of the match - Philip Billing (Bournemouth)\n'Up steps Mr Sheffield United' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe speaking to Match of the Day: \"I am disappointed we didn't get over the line. It was a really tight game. It wasn't free-flowing from either team and I don't think we played to our strengths enough.\n\"Chris [Mepham] did well. He took his goal well and it was a good time for us. We hadn't created too many chances so I was pleased to see him score.\n\"It is always a concern when you are without a few key players. It will be something we have to deal with.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder: \"It is the right result. I think we deserved something from the game. We grew into it. There was obviously going to be some anticipation.\n\"It has been a great experience and one we really enjoyed. We came here to get a result and that was the biggest thing. It is a very good Bournemouth side who have done very well in the last few seasons so we knew it would be tough.\n\"We should have gone 1-0 up in the first moment and we had a few chances in the second half - so did they. We handled it well. There were a lot of ricochets and bobbles around the goal and up steps Mr Sheffield United.\n\"I am delighted for him and everyone else at the club. We have to have confidence in our ability. It will be a tough season for us.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to play another newly-promoted side, Aston Villa, on Saturday, 17 August (15:00 BST) before Sheffield United play their first top-flight match at Bramall Lane for more than 12 years when they entertain Crystal Palace a day later (14:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Watford 0-3 Brighton: Neal Maupay scores on Seagulls debut\nNew Brighton manager Graham Potter said his side's winning start to the Premier League season was a \"dream\" as the Seagulls put three past a stunned Watford.\nBrighton narrowly avoided relegation last term under Chris Hughton but, with Potter now at the helm, put that misery behind them as Abdoulaye Doucoure's first-half own goal gave them the lead.\nThe Seagulls had travelled to Vicarage Road on the opening day of last season, losing 2-0 on that occasion, but the scoreline was reversed as substitute Florin Andone, with virtually his first touch of the game, doubled their lead.\nJust minutes later, Neal Maupay, who signed for the Seagulls on Monday, justified his \u00a320m price tag with a debut goal, calmly finishing after rounding Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster.\n\"To score three away from home and not concede is a dream,\" Potter told BBC Sport.\n\"The preparation was first class. Overall I thought we tried to do what we set out to do and then you just need a bit of luck and quality.\n\"We've worked hard every day. There is a really good foundation from what has been done previously - our job is to get better. You can see how they have applied themselves, now we dust ourselves down and don't get carried away.\"\nWatford, who finished 11th in the league last season and reached the FA Cup final, made the more promising start but their late slump at the end of 2018-19, in which they lost their final three matches of the campaign, continued into the new season.\nNot since the opening day of the 2015-16 term - when they were in the Championship - had Brighton won their first league match of a season.\n\"What I know is that they played better than us and deserve the victory today. No excuses. It is the first game and we try to improve for the next one,\" said Watford boss Javi Gracia.\n\"The best news is that it is the first game. Sometimes it is good to wake up and improve - we need to do that for the next game.\n\"There were many individual mistakes. The first and second goal, they took advantage. We expected them to play three at the back and with that shape. We worked in the week to adjust well, but [did so] after they got the win.\"\nWatford v Brighton - as it happened\nNew season, new start\nBrighton finished 17th in the Premier League last season but a new campaign marks a fresh start for the Seagulls with Potter at the helm.\nManaging his first Premier League match since replacing Chris Hughton in May, new signings Maupay, Leandro Trossard, Adam Webster and Aaron Mooy all started on the bench.\nAfter a shaky start, the Seagulls soon settled at Vicarage Road, but little separated the two sides until Watford's Doucoure turned a Pascal Gross cross - destined for the boot of Glenn Murray - into his own net.\nIt marked the first time the away team had scored - albeit in this case with a helping hand - in a Premier League meeting between Watford and Brighton.\nHalf-time soon arrived but although it was the hosts who looked the more likely to score after the break, they were undone when Romania international Andone tapped in Davy Propper's cross from close range, moments after being introduced.\nVictory was sealed just minutes later as Maupay latched onto a through ball, his goal confirmed after the video assistant referee - making its Premier League debut this season - checked for a possible offside.\nWatford chances go begging\nLast season's 11th place finish marked a record-breaking campaign for Watford, but manager Javi Gracia chose to postpone the debuts of new signings Ismaila Sarr and Danny Welbeck, who has a long-term ankle injury.\nHowever, his squad was bolstered by the return of Gerard Deulofeu - scorer of 10 goals for Watford last season - after recovering from a muscle problem that plagued his pre-season.\nAnd Deulofeu and captain Troy Deeney both had chances to give their side the lead as the Hornets searched for an opener, only to be left reeling after Doucoure's error.\nWatford were unlucky not to level soon after though, when Brighton's new captain Lewis Dunk nearly put the ball into his own net - a Mat Ryan save bouncing awkwardly off his thigh and out for a corner.\nAfter the break, substitute Roberto Pereyra led screams for a penalty after his free-kick from outside the area looked to have struck a hand in the wall, but after a VAR check, they were denied the spot-kick.\nThat frustration was compounded when Brighton scored their second, then their third, and from then on Watford lost their mojo.\nDebutant Craig Dawson, who joined from West Brom in July, went close with a header from a corner that sailed into the arms of Ryan, but Watford's fans were pouring out of Vicarage Road from the moment Brighton's third went in.\n'A dream' - what they said\nMan of the match - Lewis Dunk (Brighton)\nStats\nWatford's 3-0 defeat was their first loss at home against Brighton since September 2012, when they lost 1-0, ending a run of four league games against the Seagulls at Vicarage Road without defeat.\nBrighton secured their biggest victory on the opening day of a league season since 1999-2000 (6-0 v Mansfield in Division 4), whilst Watford suffered their biggest defeat on day one since 2001-02 (3-0 v Manchester City in the second tier).\nBrighton have won their opening game of a top-flight season for just the second time (also in 1980-81 beating Wolves 2-0), drawing two and losing three of their other five games.\nWatford have lost their opening game of a season for the first time since 2006-07 (a 2-1 defeat v Everton), ending a run of 12 matches without defeat on day one (won six, drawn six).\nBrighton have ended a nine-game winless run in the Premier League (D3 L6), their first victory in the competition since beating Crystal Palace back in March.\nWatford have lost three consecutive home league games for the first time since December 2013 in the Championship, when they suffered five consecutive defeats.\nFlorin Andone netted Brighton's second goal just 62 seconds after coming on as a substitute.\nBrighton's Neal Maupay is the 13th different French player to score on his Premier League debut; only England (96) has seen more debut goalscorers in the competition.\nSince the start of last season, no side has scored more Premier League own goals than Watford (four - level with Wolves and Burnley).\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to Merseyside next Saturday to face Everton at Goodison Park (15:00 BST) while Brighton welcome West Ham to the south coast at the same time."

        "article_text": "Burnley 3-0 Southampton: Ashley Barnes scores twice in Clarets win\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said his side have \"come back with a real edge\" as the Clarets made a winning start to the new Premier League season against Southampton at Turf Moor.\nBurdened by the additional demands of Europa League qualifying 12 months ago, the Clarets endured their worst start to a top-flight season since 1927 to leave them bottom of the table with one point from their opening five matches.\nIn contrast, on Saturday they recorded their biggest opening day league victory since 1966 with three goals in 12 impressive second-half minutes.\nStriker Ashley Barnes scored twice, the first coming on 63 minutes with the hosts' first shot on target as he scored from summer signing Erik Pieters' cross.\nThe pair again linked up as Barnes fired into the corner to double the advantage, before midfielder Johann Berg Gudmundsson added a third from a tight angle as Sean Dyche's side got their campaign under way in style.\n\"We've all learned from last season. It doesn't guarantee anything but the brain's clear and they've come in with a thirst and desire knowing how tough the Premier League is,\" said Dyche.\n\"It's a nice start for us. The mentality and energy, the will and desire was all there. The lads have come in really bright this season.\"\nSouthampton started the game brightly - \u00a315m summer signing Che Adams narrowly missed the target in the opening minutes, and Nathan Redmond also going close with a powerful, rising shot at Nick Pope's goal before the interval.\nThe game was also not without calls to the video assistant referee system. VAR upheld an offside call that had ruled out Burnley striker Chris Wood's effort after 16 minutes - and was called on to review two potential first-half red cards. Adams arrived high and late on Burnley's Ben Mee, while Gudmundsson crunched in on Ryan Bertrand - but neither was shown a card.\nBurnley v Southampton as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nBurnley make flying start\nWith their European exploits behind them, Burnley embarked upon an impressive unbeaten run at the turn of the year, during which they looked more like the side who finished seventh a year prior.\nThat run ensured a fourth consecutive top-flight season at Turf Moor and, with attention solely on the league at the beginning of 2019-20, Dyche called on his side to learn from the challenges faced in the previous campaign. They could not have hoped for a more promising start.\nAfter battling through an even first half, the Clarets - who had rarely threatened - blew Southampton away in the space of 12 minutes as Barnes demonstrated his quality in front of goal.\nHaving suffered a club record 10 home league defeats last season, this was first and foremost a typically solid performance, built on captain Mee and James Tarkowski's partnership.\nBut after recording the lowest number of top-flight attempts on goal last season, discovering a clinical edge was a challenge for Burnley this campaign - and one to which Barnes duly responded.\nOn Barnes, Dyche added: \"I have great admiration for him. This pre-season he didn't score a goal and he looked hungry for it.\n\"The first goal was a fantastic touch and finish, it was great skill. His second finish was sublime, it's a brilliant ball by Erik Pieters, but when centre-forwards finish like that it looks easy. It's not easy when the ball is coming over your shoulder like that.\"\nHasenhuttl left with plenty to ponder\nA first full season under manager Ralph Hasenhuttl offered much optimism for Saints fans. The Austrian successfully guided the club to safety last term despite assuming control of a side with just one win and nine points from their opening 15 matches.\nNicknamed the 'Klopp of the Alps' during his tenure at previous club RB Leipzig, the Austrian has worked quickly to implement a more attacking philosophy at St Mary's - and reaped the early rewards.\nWith a full pre-season under his belt, and his attacking options bolstered by summer additions Adams and Moussa Djenepo - the Mali winger an unused substitute - Saints appeared confident in possession and posed the greater threat with swift forward moves.\nAdams, who had been linked with a move to Turf Moor, squandered the first sight of goal in the opening minutes as he missed the target from Yan Valery's cross.\nIn a lively first competitive appearance for the club, Adams also survived a potential red card after his ill-judged, yet by no means malicious, tackle on Mee.\nHasenhuttl's visitors remained the most likely to find a breakthrough in the early stages of the second half as Bertrand shot narrowly over from curling free-kick and Redmond failed to keep an attempt from the edge of the area down.\nBut Southampton lost their grip on the contest with Burnley's opener, their system unravelling at a concerning rate to leave the manager with lots to consider at this early stage.\n\"For 60 minutes it was OK. We knew it'd be a difficult game here - they play very quick, very long. The pressure after the first goal was high but for the next 12 minutes we lost the way we want to play and the game was gone,\" Hasenhuttl said.\n\"We learnt that one long ball can kill the game and I think it did. It's a bad start for us but now we have to bring our heads up and focus on the next games.\"\nMan of the match - Ashley Barnes (Burnley)\nBurnley's biggest opening win since '66 - the stats\nIt is the first time since 1966 that Burnley have won their first game of a league season by a three-goal margin or greater.\nSouthampton have not won their opening Premier League fixture since 2013-14.\nEight of the nine Premier League meetings between Burnley and Southampton have been goalless at half-time, the highest percentage of any Premier League fixture to have been played at least six times.\nAshley Barnes has scored 34 Premier League goal for Burnley, 14 more than any other player for the club.\nBarnes has scored five Premier League goals against Southampton, 15% of his total tally in the competition.\nSince the start of 2016-17, Johann Berg Gudmundsson has been directly involved in 23 Premier League goals for Burnley. That's a record bettered only by Barnes in that period.\nWhat's next?\nNext week, Burnley travel to play Arsenal in Saturday's early kick-off (12:30 BST) while Southampton host Liverpool later that afternoon (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-0 Everton: Jordan Pickford blocks earn 10-man Toffees point\nJordan Pickford made two crucial saves as 10-man Everton and Crystal Palace played out a goalless draw at a very windy Selhurst Park.\nThe England goalkeeper, who endured a mixed 2018-19 campaign, blocked efforts from Jordan Ayew and then Max Meyer as Palace put the visitors under pressure in the second half.\nGerman Meyer also went close in the first half when his goalbound effort looped behind off the foot of Seamus Coleman.\nAll the Premier League action\nRelive the action from Selhurst Park\nPremier League 2019-20: BBC Sport pundits pick champions and top four\nVAR should not kill game - Milivojevic\nMarco Silva's Everton dominated much of the first period with Gylfi Sigurdsson firing a yard wide before full-back Coleman smacked a shot into the body of goalkeeper Vicente Guaita.\nSigurdsson produced another effort that was blocked on the line and team-mate Richarlison curled a sumptuous effort narrowly wide of Guaita's upright.\nPalace's Wilfried Zaha, who handed in a transfer request and was the subject of a summer window bid from the opponents, came on in the 65th minute to warm applause.\nHe failed to affect the scoreline as did the 76th minute sending off of Morgan Schneiderlin, who picked up a second yellow for a foul on Luka Milivojevic, as Everton kept Roy Hodgson's men at bay in the closing stages.\nPickford comes to Everton's rescue\nIt was a 2018-19 season of contrasts for Pickford. He entered it as England's number one after his World Cup heroics and exited it with some questioning whether he deserved to retain his spot.\nThe former Sunderland keeper made four errors that led to goals in the league last campaign and that count does not include a farcical rugby tackle on Newcastle's Salomon Rondon which resulted in a penalty much to the delight of the St James' Park support.\nHe could ill-afford more of those lapses of concentration in the opening game at Selhurst Park. Instead he produced an outstanding display, making himself big to deny Ayew and Meyer.\nHe also remained alert with seconds remaining as Connor Wickham came charging in at the near post in attempt to convert Zaha's near-post delivery.\nCheers greet Zaha\nBoth sides must have wished they had a Zaha operating at 100%. Everton, who had a bid of \u00a352m for the winger turned down in the transfer window, could have done with his guile and pace to open up the Palace defence in the second half.\nAs for the Eagles, they held on to a player who provided 10 goals and five assists last season but then told the club he wanted to leave.\nHodgson suggested in the build-up that the winger was not in the right frame of mind, so it came as no surprise he did not start. When he was finally introduced, with 25 minutes to go, would he be greeted with cheers or jeers from the home support? It was largely the former.\nHe made little impact on the match in the short time, bar one piece of play when he fed the ball to Patrick van Aanholt who almost found Christian Benteke at the far post.\nIf Hodgson can get Zaha's mind right then it could be another positive season for Palace.\nMan of the match - Jordan Pickford (Everton)\n'He's such a natural phenomenon' - reaction\nPalace manager Roy Hodgson speaking about Zaha on BBC's Match of the Day: \"He did quite well, he did what we hoped he would do - create opportunities, put Max Meyer in one v one, a couple of times he had to be bundled off the ball at the last minute.\n\"Of course, when you've been away for three weeks, he's such a natural phenomenon as an athlete but to get him back to full capacity will take him a week or two.\"\nEverton boss Marco Silva: \"It was a tough game, competitive as you would expect. We lost Andre Gomes [to injury in the first half], we were controlling the game, creating moments - it's clear for me in some moments when you bring in new players they need time to adapt.\n\"Today was a good example, we lost some balls in zones we cannot.\n\"Our first half deserved something more. A clean sheet, the attitude was there. We lost some easy balls and if they didn't happen we would have controlled the game until the end.\"\nSchneiderlin joins select club - the stats\nEverton have drawn their opening game in six of the last seven Premier League campaigns. However, this is the first time they've began with a goalless draw since 1998-99.\nSince the start of last season, Palace have failed to score in more league home games than any other current Premier League side (nine).\nOnly Manchester City (13) have kept more Premier League clean sheets so far in 2019 than Everton (11).\nThe last shot on target in this match came after 62 minutes, from Sigurdsson.\nSchneiderlin became the third Everton player to be sent off on the opening weekend of a Premier League campaign, after Li Tie in 2003-04 and Phil Jagielka in 2018-19.\nSchneiderlin's sending off made Everton the first team to receive a red card in consecutive Premier League opening weekends since Arsenal in 2010-11 and 2011-12.\nWhat's next?\nPalace are at promoted Sheffield United next Sunday (14:00 BST) and Everton are at Watford next Saturday (15:00 BST)."

His side played with freedom and a spirit which suggests they are capable of holding their own at this level.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\n'We were confused' - what they said\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"We were a bit confused and that is my fault, I'm the manager, but we made a lot of mistakes and didn't work well in the first half.\n\"In the second half we fixed the problems, our positional game was completely different and we moved the ball better.\n\"It's very important for us to start with a victory, we have a lot of work to do.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"We want to be competitive in this league. Next week we'll be walking out at Villa Park - but we'll be doing so with zero points and that's something we have to work on.\n\"The better team won on the day in the second half. We were perhaps unfortunate with the goals. Their physicality shone through in the end.\n\"The first half performance and our defensive organisation was very good. They're not Champions League finalists for nothing - they have a very well coached group of players.\n\"We're always learning lessons, today's game has set a standard for us.\"\nA game for the debutants to remember - the stats\nWith Aston Villa's John McGinn and Tottenham's Tanguy Ndombele each finding the net, this game was the first match to see both sides have a player score a Premier League debut goal since Burnley (Scott Arfield) v Chelsea (Diego Costa) in August 2014.\nNdombele is the first player to score on his Premier League debut for Tottenham since Eric Dier against West Ham in August 2014.\nKane has scored six goals in six Premier League appearances against Aston Villa.\nVilla's Jack Grealish has lost each of his last 19 Premier League games, the longest run of consecutive defeats suffered by a player in the history of the competition.\nTottenham have won 37 Premier League games after finding themselves behind at half-time, more than any other side.\nVilla are winless in their last 19 Premier League away games (D3 L16), losing their last eight in a row.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham visit champions Manchester City (17:30 BST) next Saturday while Villa entertain Bournemouth (15:00) on the same day."

        "article_text": "Newcastle 0-1 Arsenal: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang strike seals win\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang punished slack Newcastle defending to give Arsenal victory at a rain-drenched St James' Park.\nStarting with many of their \u00a3125m-worth of signings on the bench and without midfielders Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac, Gunners boss Unai Emery watched his side struggle to cut through their opponents in the first half.\nThat all changed just before the hour mark when Aubameyang was left unmarked on the edge of the area, collected Ainsley Maitland-Niles' cross from the right and fired past Martin Dubravka.\nEmery gave \u00a372m club-record signing Nicolas Pepe and midfielder Dani Ceballos debuts from the bench, but they failed to make much of an impression.\nAs for Steve Bruce, his Newcastle managerial debut was about what could have been.\nThe Magpies' record signing Joelinton went close with a shot blocked by Bernd Leno, before Jonjo Shelvey saw his drive crash off the woodwork.\nThe home side were flat for much of the second half, although another new recruit, the exciting wing prospect Allan Saint-Maximin, tested German Leno with a near-post drive.\nAubameyang makes the difference\nUnai Emery went through a range of emotions in his dugout area during the first period, ranging from anguish to anger.\nHis somewhat makeshift Arsenal starting XI, without the experienced Ozil and Kolasinac, struggled with both the conditions and the five-man Newcastle midfield.\nThey only opened up the Magpies' defence twice in that opening period, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan firing wildly over before Aubameyang struck a firm drive at Dubravka.\nBoth sides had pacy frontmen, but only one was proven at this level. And when Aubameyang, who scored 22 Premier League goals last season, was given a second chance at goal he took it brilliantly.\nThe Gabon international was inexplicably given a free run into the area as Jamaal Lascelles went AWOL, and slotted in Maitland-Niles' delivery from the right.\nIvorian winger Pepe and Ceballos were given a run-out but made little impact, although had Maitland-Niles' cross reached the record signing in the area late on, then we might have seen a goal on his debut.\nNo doubt we will see why Arsenal paid \u00a372m to Lille for him in the coming weeks.\nPositives in defeat for Newcastle\nAs a former centre-half himself, Bruce would have been disappointed to have seen skipper Lascelles drawn towards the ball which left Aubameyang free to score the decider.\nUp until then his backline coped admirably with the pace of the Gunners - producing the type of disciplined display seen on countless occasions under the stewardship of predecessor Rafael Benitez.\nAt the other end Brazilian Joelinton had a lively debut, and roused the home crowd when he slalomed past two challenges to hammer in a low shot saved by Leno.\nAnd Shelvey, who will be hoping to once again become a regular fixture in the Newcastle midfield, showed his prowess from distance with a vicious drive which shook the rain off the woodwork.\nJoelinton and Miguel Almiron both worked tirelessly, but did not quite click up front as they partnered each other for the first time in a competitive fixture.\nBut it is worth noting that Ayoze Perez and Salomon Rondon took until the second half of last season to form a potent union, which eventually reaped 23 goals.\nThere was enough shown on the pitch on Sunday to suggest that there are better days to come for Joelinton and Almiron.\nMan of the match - Ainsley Maitland-Niles (Arsenal)\nYoung Gunners - the stats\nArsenal named two English teenagers (Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson) in their starting XI for a Premier League game for the first time since February 1998 (Paolo Vernazza and Matthew Upson v Crystal Palace), before either Willock or Nelson were born.\nThe Gunners won and kept a clean sheet in their opening game of a Premier League season for the first time since 2008-09.\nNewcastle haven't won their opening game in any of their last six Premier League campaigns.\nNewcastle manager Bruce suffered defeat in his first game at a new club for the first time since December 2001, when he began his Birmingham City reign with a 2-1 defeat to Wolves in the second tier.\nArsenal have only lost one of their 25 Premier League games under Emery when opening the scoring.\nSince making his Premier League debut for Arsenal in February 2018, only Mohamed Salah (36) has scored more goals in the competition than Aubameyang (33).\nPepe made his Premier League debut for Arsenal, becoming the 200th player to feature for the Gunners in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle are at newly-promoted Norwich City on Saturday (15:00 BST) while Arsenal take on Burnley at the Emirates on the same day in the early kick-off (12:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Leicester 0-0 Wolves: Leander Dendoncker has goal ruled out by VAR decision\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo said video assistant referee decisions are affecting \"the spirit of the game\" after his side had a goal ruled out in their scoreless draw at Leicester.\nJoao Moutinho's right-wing corner was headed goalwards by Leander Dendoncker and hit the arm of Wolves' Willy Boly at close range before Dendoncker shot the rebound past Kasper Schmeichel from eight yards out.\nBut, after one minute and 38 seconds and a VAR review, the goal was disallowed by on-field official Andre Marriner, with Leicester fans cheering when no goal was announced via the stadium's big screens.\n\"What I'm concerned about is, let's not ruin the game,\" said Nuno.\n\"It's what fans come for, to celebrate a goal, not to celebrate a no goal - that's not the real celebration of football.\n\"It's not good for the atmosphere of football. The Leicester fans were celebrating the no goal. That's not the mindset of the game. Six months ago it would've been a goal, so that is an issue for VAR.\n\"We have such a nice Premier League, such a product, we cannot lose that. Two minutes the game stopped. The anxiety of us celebrating, then we waited - it's not the spirit of the game.\"\nAnalysis from Sunday's Premier League games\nFoxes name son of late owner as chairman\nWho will finish where in the Premier League?\nVAR's Premier League debut - did it work?\nVAR moment overshadows game\nThese two sides have been tipped as potential challengers to the Premier League's top six, but this game did not sparkle, with only three shots on target in total, and Leicester having to wait 83 minutes before their solitary goal-bound chance.\nFoxes substitute Harvey Barnes had a curling effort well held by Rui Patricio, and Wolves' best legal effort fell to Raul Jimenez, but he shot straight at Schmeichel.\nBut the main controversy came early in the second half when Dendoncker put the ball in the back of the net and Wolves were celebrating before the goal was overturned.\n\"I thought it was a goal, we were ready to start again and VAR [on the big screen] said it might've seen something and I was surprised,\" said Dendoncker.\n\"Willy Boly was just jumping and I had no clue it was a handball. It's a new rule so we have to adapt to it and get used to it.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers joked he \"was a massive fan of VAR, especially today\", but also added: \"I've said all along that it will work really well in the game and that some will go for you, like it did today, and some will go against you, like it has done for Nuno today.\n\"It has to always be consistent and if there's a handball and that leads to a goal, it gets ruled out.\n\"The officials are trying to work it the best they can. It's not perfect yet but as long as you get to the right decision, that's what we want.\"\nRodgers praises Maguire replacement Soyuncu\nEarlier this week, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha was confirmed as Leicester's new chairman and was introduced to the King Power Stadium crowd in an emotional moment before kick-off, with the Foxes supporters giving him a large round of applause.\nAiyawatt succeeds his late father Vichai, who was one of five people who died when his helicopter crashed outside the stadium last October.\nAfter kick-off on Sunday, the hosts were the most wasteful side in the opening half. Ben Chilwell, Ricardo Pereira, Wilfred Ndidi and Youri Tielemans all shot wide, while Jamie Vardy failed to get a touch from close range on a low cross fizzed in from the right side of the six-yard box by Tielemans.\nFor Wolves, Diogo Jota should have done better than drag a shot wide from a central position just outside the penalty area, and only an excellent last-ditch challenge from Jonny Evans denied Ryan Bennett a shooting chance six yards out.\nWithin seconds of the restart, Jimenez, who scored 13 Premier League goals last season, shot straight at Schmeichel after a quick counter-attack.\nWolves had a round trip of more than 6,000 miles for their Europa League tie on Thursday against Armenian side Pyunik, but Nuno's side ended with more shots on target than Leicester, with Jimenez again denied by Schmeichel.\nThe visitors brought on striker Patrick Cutrone, an \u00a318m summer signing from AC Milan, but they could not find their way past a well-organised Leicester defence. Caglar Soyuncu, who came in for Harry Maguire after the England international's \u00a380m move to Manchester United, was among those impressing.\n\"Caglar was excellent,\" said Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers. \"He got a round of applause at the end from his team-mates and it's not easy to come in for a special player like Harry, but Caglar was strong and comfortable on the ball.\"\nMan of the match - Willy Boly (Wolves)\n'Every point is important' - what they said\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers told Match of the Day: \"It was a good game, two well-matched teams. At this time of the season it's never going to be perfect but I'm really pleased with the attitude. Sometimes in these games you can lose 1-0 but we kept fighting to the end.\n\"At this level every point is important and if you cannot win you take a point and work hard to improve next week.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo told Match of the Day: \"We did OK. We were very organised, a very good shape.\n\"Leicester are a very good team, well-managed and know what to do. We had very good situations in counter attacks.\n\"Both teams compete and that's fantastic. Both managers will say 'maybe I could've had it' but the boys worked very hard and I'm proud of them.\"\nLeicester fail to win season opener again - the stats\nLeicester have won their opening Premier League match of a season just once in their last 11 attempts (drawn five, lost five) - against Sunderland in 2015-16.\nWolves have drawn 0-0 in their opening game of a top-flight season for the first time since 1951-52.\nWolves had failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their previous 15 away league games before today - a run stretching back to a 1-0 win at Crystal Palace in October 2018.\nEach of the last two occasions in which a side has faced no more than one shot on target despite having less than 30% of possession in a Premier League game have been Wolves - against Leicester today and against Arsenal in April 2019.\nLeicester didn't have a shot on target until the 83rd minute, courtesy of substitute Harvey Barnes - their latest first attempt on target in a Premier League game since May 2018 v West Ham (86th minute).\nLeicester have failed to score in each of their last three games - this is only the second time a Brendan Rodgers side has done so, after a run of three games with Swansea City in November 2011.\nJamie Vardy failed to attempt a single shot in a home Premier League game in which he started for just the seventh time - the last occasion was also against Wolves in August 2018.\nWhat's next?\nOn Thursday, Wolves play the second leg of their Europa League third qualifying round tie against Pyunik (19:45 BST), but Nuno Espirito Santo may have a chance to rest some of his players after his side's 4-0 opening leg win.\nThey are at Molineux again four days later, on Monday 19 August, when they host Manchester United in their first home Premier League game of the season (20:00 BST).\nLeicester have a week off before they play at Chelsea on Sunday (16:30 BST) in Frank Lampard's first home game in charge of the Blues."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 4-0 Chelsea: Marcus Rashford stars in fine win\nManchester United recorded their biggest Old Trafford win over Chelsea since 1965 to condemn Frank Lampard to a miserable start as a Premier League manager.\nMarcus Rashford scored twice, either side of a close-range effort from Anthony Martial, who had been given the number nine shirt back following the sale of Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan.\nSubstitute Daniel James completed the scoring with a goal on his debut nine minutes from time.\nThe final scoreline was harsh on the visitors, who were the better side before the break and hit the frame of the goal through Tammy Abraham and Emerson, but still suffered their worst ever opening-day defeat in 104 league seasons.\nThe ecstatic home supporters did not care about that though, as the negativity of a difficult summer was swept away by their best result against Chelsea since they beat them by the same score in the 1994 FA Cup final.\nMan Utd remain 'a work in progress' - Solskjaer\nWe have to learn harsh lessons quickly - Lampard\nVAR's Premier League debut - did it work?\nWan-Bissaka your player of the match\nAn \u00a380m introduction\nUnited had to pay Leicester \u00a380m - and make Harry Maguire the most expensive defender ever - to land manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's number one summer transfer target.\nMaguire's England team-mate Rashford may grab the plaudits with his brace but the Yorkshireman's authoritative performance underlined why his new boss wanted him above getting the big name midfield or striking reinforcements so many United fans have demanded on social media.\nHis calmness under pressure helped ensure that when the home side looked shaky in the first half they did not add to their concerns with self-inflicted mistakes.\nMaguire was happy to keep it simple in possession and push the ball on to Paul Pogba when he could, and had the awareness to spot team-mates in trouble, something former United boss Jose Mourinho rather churlishly said on TV might be frequently needed in the case of Luke Shaw.\nThe game was still in the balance when Maguire stepped up to challenge Abraham on the edge of the United box. Maguire calmly took possession, leaving Abraham on the floor in the process, and strode away, setting in motion the attack that ended with Martial bundling home.\nRisky strategy\nLampard went for an early morning run around Old Trafford to prepare for his Premier League debut as Chelsea manager.\nThe Blues' record goal-scorer has made some bold decisions already, despite being barely a month into his new job.\nHe has picked seven home-grown players in his senior squad: the four in action against United - Abraham, Mason Mount, Andreas Christensen and Fikayo Tomori - the currently injured duo of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi, and promising defender Reece James.\nIt is an unprecedented number for the Roman Abramovich era. But, while it is the philosophy of promoting youth from within that Chelsea's fans have wanted, it comes with risk.\nFor every powerful fourth-minute shot from Abraham that thunders off the inside of a post, there is the moment Mount had when, presented with a shooting opportunity from an angle on the right of the United box, the 20-year-old elected for a cut-back, which ran disappointingly through for new United defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\nGiven that investment in youth, this summer's transfer ban and the departure of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid, Lampard took a brave decision to sell David Luiz to Arsenal on deadline day.\nThe Brazilian may not be the most reliable defender but his experience is valuable and Luiz's replacement on Sunday, Kurt Zouma, struggled badly.\nHe not only conceded the penalty but was also caught out of position and gave away possession, both expensive mistakes in an era when top teams routinely build from the back.\nChelsea's inability to stem the flow of goals in the second half will be a major concern for Lampard, whose name was still being sung heartily by the visiting fans at the end.\nA word for the referee\nUnited's opening goal came from the penalty spot.\nReferee Anthony Taylor played an excellent advantage after Andreas Pereira had been fouled, allowing play to continue as Zouma brought Rashford down.\nNever a regular penalty taker for club or country, two of the three penalties Rashford has scored were in the World Cup last-16 shoot-out with Colombia last year and in the fourth-minute of injury-time to give United their memorable Champions League victory against Paris St-Germain in March.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nDay to forget for Lampard - the stats\nFrank Lampard suffered the heaviest defeat by a Chelsea manager in his first match in charge since Danny Blanchflower lost 7-2 to Middlesbrough in December 1978.\nFor a second consecutive season, Manchester United's first goal of their Premier League campaign has been a penalty (also Paul Pogba v Leicester City in 2018-19).\nChelsea will end the day in the Premier League relegation-zone for the first time since 30 September 2000.\nSince his debut in September 2015, Anthony Martial has scored 49 goals in all competitions for Manchester United - more than any other player.\nThe last manager before Frank Lampard to lose by four or more goals in his first Premier League match in charge was Gustavo Poyet in October 2013 (Swansea City 4-0 Sunderland).\nChelsea's starting XI average age was 25 years and 199 days - compared to Manchester United's average age of 24 years and 227 days.\nWhat's next?\nUnited have a full week to prepare for the game at Wolves on 19 August (20:00 BST). Before then, Chelsea play two games - the Uefa Super Cup against Liverpool in Instanbul on Wednesday (20:00) and a home league game with Leicester next Sunday (16:30)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-1 Burnley: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scores winning goal for Gunners\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the winner as Arsenal defeated Burnley to record successive victories at the start of a Premier League campaign for the first time since 2009.\nFrench striker Alexandre Lacazette marked his return from injury as he impressively held off Erik Pieters and shot between the legs of goalkeeper Nick Pope to put the Gunners ahead after 13 minutes.\nAshley Barnes levelled the match two minutes before half-time, converting at close range from Dwight McNeil's deflected pass for his third goal in two matches.\nThe hosts, who handed full debuts to \u00a38m defender David Luiz and Real Madrid loanee Dani Ceballos, saw an immediate response ruled out for offside after Reiss Nelson appeared to have completed a slick passing move with a confident finish into the roof of the net.\nBut the impressive 23-year-old Ceballos recovered possession to set up Aubameyang for a powerful, low finish with 64 minutes played.\nBurnley goalkeeper Pope made a series of fine saves to keep the Clarets alive, but he was unable to prevent his side losing a 10th straight league meeting with the Gunners.\nCeballos shines for Arsenal\nThree points away to Newcastle - along with a valuable clean-sheet - marked a pleasing start for manager Unai Emery following some exciting summer transfer business.\nAnother victory in their first home match was made all the more enjoyable for the home support by the enthralling performance of midfielder Ceballos, on loan from the Bernabeu for the 2019-20 campaign.\nThe Spaniard, unable to impress in his substitute appearance at Newcastle, oozed class in the centre of the pitch and delivered dancing runs through the Burnley midfield with sharp feet and twisting dribbles.\nHis whipped corner paved the way for Lacazette's opener, the Frenchman doing well to turn and shoot under pressure, while the 23-year-old celebrated passionately as Aubameyang converted from his tireless recovery work.\nLikewise, youngsters Nelson, Joe Willock and Matteo Guendouzi impressed in successive starts, while \u00a372m summer signing Nicolas Pepe emerged from the bench after the interval to add further promise for the season ahead.\nHowever, with Luiz yet to settle into the back-line, Arsenal's defensive frailties were apparent as Barnes and Chris Wood caused awkward moments from set-pieces.\nAn almighty scrap in the Arsenal penalty area following a first-half Burnley corner offered a timely reminder of the questions that remain - though Luiz appeared, for the most part, calm and composed when in possession.\nArsenal are showing promise as the season warms up and, though old worries remain, back-to-back opening wins and a dazzling Ceballos display will keep Emery smiling.\n\"We didn't control the game as much as we wanted. We need to improve. Each match is giving us a lot of information. I think we can do better. We lost some easy balls at times, but in general we can be proud of our first match here,\" Emery said.\nOn Arsenal's new signings, he added: \"I want to speak about the team, but for the first match [at home] it was good. It's good for David [Luiz], for Pepe, for Dani [Ceballos], who are another step ahead.\"\nBattling Burnley leave empty handed\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche arrived in north London with a miserable managerial record against Arsenal - one which continued with a ninth straight Premier League defeat by the Gunners on Saturday.\nThe Clarets made a perfect start to the season with a 3-0 win against Southampton on home soil courtesy of clinical finishing from striker Barnes who again proved crucial to the Clarets' cause.\nBarnes, who shot narrowly wide earlier in the half, remained composed to level deservedly for the visitors after 43 minutes - but was unable to convert from a tight angle in the closing stages.\nWith Arsenal's Luiz making his debut alongside Sokratis Papastathopoulos in defence, Dyche's side targeted set-pieces and called Gunners goalkeeper Bernd Leno into action through James Tarkowski and Barnes' close-range attempts.\nThough they left with defeat, Burnley delivered a convincing showing, remaining unfazed and organised as Arsenal dominated possession. Indeed, they attempted more shots (18) than the hosts (16) though their accuracy - just five were on target - let them down.\nThey had Pope to thank on several occasions at the other end, stretching to block from Guendouzi's close-range attempt and diving to deny Ceballos moments before Aubameyang left the goalkeeper with little hope of preventing the eventual winner.\nWith Jay Rodriguez again emerging from the bench and fellow summer addition Danny Drinkwater yet to return to fitness, Burnley - free from the additional demands of Europa League qualifying that burdened them 12 months ago - have established a strong base from which to build their season.\nOn the performance, manager Dyche said: \"I don't feel hard done by. I think it was a very good performance. We used the ball wisely when we could. They had a few chances, Pope made a superb save. Overall I am happy with the performance - we really brought the game to them and made a number of chances.\"\nOn striker Barnes, he added: \"I am enjoying his performance. He deals with knocks really well. I have been pleased with the group - if we keep playing like that and we keep competing then we will get some rewards on the way.\"\nMan of the match - Ceballos (Arsenal)\nA one-sided fixture - the stats\nArsenal had not won their first two games of a Premier League season since 2009-10.\nBurnley boss Dyche has lost all nine of his Premier League matches against Arsenal - the joint worst 100% losing ratio by a manager against a team in the competition along with Gary Megson, who also lost nine against Liverpool.\nArsenal have won their last 10 Premier League games against Burnley, only ever enjoying a longer run against Man City (11).\nLacazette has been directly involved in 28 goals (21 goals and seven assists) in 36 Premier League appearances for Arsenal at the Emirates.\nLacazette registered his 40th goal involvement for Arsenal in the Premier League since his debut in August 2017 - a tally only Aubameyang, with 43, can better for the club in that time.\nAubameyang has scored seven goals against Burnley in four league appearances, four more than he has netted against any other Premier League side.\nOnly Sadio Mane (14) and Sergio Aguero (13) have scored more Premier League goals in 2019 than Burnley's Barnes (12).\nCeballos is just the third player to assist two or more goals on his first Premier League start for Arsenal. Ray Parlour and Henrik Mkhitaryan are the other two.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley are away to Wolves on Saturday (15:00 BST), while Arsenal face a trip to Liverpool later that day (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-2 Liverpool\nLiverpool beat Southampton to secure an 11th successive top-flight victory and equal their best-ever Premier League winning run - despite a late blunder by goalkeeper Adrian.\nWith the European champions leading 2-0, Liverpool's number two keeper - starting in place of the injured Alisson - cleared the ball against the shin of substitute Danny Ings to gift the Saints striker a goal against his former club.\nSadio Mane had given Liverpool the lead at the end of the first-half with a delicious arrowed finish from the edge of the penalty area after Saints had gone close on three occasions.\nAdrian, who was passed fit despite an ankle injury in a collision with a pitch invader following the Uefa Super Cup win over Chelsea, had kept out Maya Yoshida's header while Che Adams spurned two chances to equalise.\nMane turned provider to set up Roberto Firmino to double Liverpool's advantage with a clever finish and that proved to be crucial given Adrian's mistake in the closing stages.\nAdrian's error could have been even more costly for the Reds because in a dramatic finale Ings wasted a great chance to equalise inside the six-yard area.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nMixed afternoon for Adrian\nWith Alisson ruled out \"for the next few weeks\" with a calf injury he picked up in the season-opening win against Norwich City, new signing Adrian has found himself immediately thrust into the first team.\nOn Wednesday, the Spaniard kept out Tammy Abraham's penalty to secure victory over Chelsea in the Super Cup.\nBut against Southampton, his glaring error put the recent recruit into the spotlight for the wrong reasons - and it was not Adrian's first mistake of the afternoon.\nWith the game goalless, his attempted clearance following Virgil van Dijk's backpass struck James Ward-Prowse but fortunately spun out of play.\n\"Adrian had a swollen ankle and we played too many balls back to him in that period,\" said Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp.\n\"The other players have to then feel more the responsibility for the build-up and cannot give all the balls back to him and hope the pain killers still help or whatever.\n\"I don't think the goal was because of that, but a few other balls were. He is completely good with his feet.\"\nOn the plus side, Adrian then reacted smartly to make one of the saves of the game as he kept out Yoshida's close-range header.\nAlisson's presence - alongside that of Van Dijk - brought a calmness to the Liverpool defence last season and since the Brazil keeper's injury, Klopp's side have looked vulnerable at the back.\nNorwich scored at Anfield, Chelsea got two in the Super Cup - and could have had more - while on numerous occasions there was alarm in the Reds' defence against Southampton, who were wasteful in punishing the visitors.\nPositives for Saints in defeat\nHaving suffered a 3-0 defeat at Burnley on the opening weekend of the season, Southampton needed to respond in front of their own fans.\nAlthough his team remain without a point, Ralph Hasenhuttl's side gave the European champions a stern test that bodes well for next week's trip to Brighton.\nAdams caused problems with his pace while Ward-Prowse worked tirelessly in midfield.\nSouthampton have not kept a clean sheet in the Premier League for nine games and that search for an impregnable defence continued against Liverpool - but it required a strike of the highest quality by Mane to break the deadlock.\nFirmino's goal, in contrast, was a disaster as far as Saints were concerned after they conceded possession at a throw-in and were punished by the Brazil striker.\nAdrian's error gave Southampton hope of salvaging something from a game in which they more than matched last season's Premier League runners-up for large parts.\nSo while Saints have not won a Premier League match since 13 April, they will be confident they can end that run sooner rather than later after this spirited performance.\nWill Oxlade-Chamberlain shine this season?\nIt was far from a vintage performance by Liverpool, but that was perhaps understandable considering they only arrived back in England on Thursday after facing Chelsea in Turkey.\nIt was not surprising, therefore, that Klopp rotated his team to face Saints - especially in midfield, where Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was given a first Premier League start since April 2018.\nHe started the Super Cup game in a more advanced wide role and lasted just 45 minutes, but in his favoured midfield position the England player was particularly lively in the first half.\nHaving recovered from a serious knee injury, if Oxlade-Chamberlain can return to the form he showed at the end of his first season with the club, it will be a huge boost for Klopp, who did not make a major signing in the summer.\nHe got another 89 minutes under his belt against Southampton - including creating a good chance for Salah - and will hope to face another of his former clubs, Arsenal, next week at Anfield.\nLiverpool will play another club with six points in that match and while they are yet to hit top form this season, they will approach the game with confidence having not dropped a point since the goalless draw at Everton on 3 March.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\nLosing run continues - the stats\nSouthampton have now lost all of their last five league games against Liverpool by an aggregate score of 13-2.\nLiverpool have won their first two league games in back-to-back seasons for only the second time in the Premier League era, having previously done so in 1993-94 and 1994-95.\nSouthampton have lost both of their first two Premier League games of a season for the first time since their first campaign back in the division in 2012-13 under Nigel Adkins.\nMane scored his 20th goal for Liverpool in all competitions in 2019, at least eight more than any of his team-mates in this calendar year.\nMane is the first player to score in his first Premier League start of a campaign in four back-to-back seasons since Mark Viduka did so between 2002-03 and 2005-06.\nSince the start of last season, Ings has scored eight Premier League goals for Southampton, more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton have a full week to prepare for their trip to Brighton next Saturday (15:00 BST) while Liverpool are also in action on the same day when they welcome Arsenal to Anfield (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Everton 1-0 Watford: Early Bernard goal enough for Everton\nEverton manager Marco Silva says he wants Goodison Park to be \"a fortress\" after his side's fifth straight home win against Watford.\nBernard's goal after just 10 minutes was enough to give Everton their first victory of the 2019-20 season.\nThe Toffees have not conceded at home since they lost 2-0 to Manchester City on 6 February.\n\"My style and my philosophy is I like to play offensive football. Keeping clean sheets is important,\" said Silva.\nThe Hornets are on a poor run having won just one of their last eight league matches, and have yet to score in this campaign.\nThey came closest to equalising when Craig Dawson's header hit the bar, following Bernard's shot that beat keeper Ben Foster at his near post.\nWatford improved after the break, but Abdoulaye Doucoure missed late on.\nTroy Deeney had been denied by a fine save from Jordan Pickford earlier in the second half, when the Watford captain went one-on-one with the Everton keeper.\nAnd a Deeney shot that deflected off Michael Keane set up Doucoure inside the Everton area only for the midfielder to pull his shot wide.\nEverton striker Richarlison had two good chances to score against his former club with headers but missed both, while substitute Moise Kean rolled a shot just wide of Foster's right post in second-half stoppage time.\nRelive the action from Everton v Watford\nToffees tough to crack at home\nEverton have become an increasingly tough proposition on their own turf under former Watford manager Silva, and have now won five in a row at Goodison for the first time since Ronald Koeman's reign in April 2017.\nTheir back four of Lucas Digne, Michael Keane, Yerry Mina and Seamus Coleman seem to be a settled unit, and it was the impressive Digne who set up the game's only goal with a superb long pass from deep inside his own half.\nAnd the late addition of recent signing Kean gave them an added edge in attack, with the 19-year-old using his size and strength to worry the Watford defence.\nA first chance for the Italian was blazed wide, but his miss in injury time after a lovely piece of close control was much closer to the target and bodes well for when Silva chooses to give him longer appearances.\nSlow start punishes Hornets\nWatford's journey to the FA Cup final in May papered over the cracks of a subdued second half to last season, when a 2-1 win at already-relegated Huddersfield gave Javi Gracia's side their only victory in their final seven league outings.\nThis defeat was the Hornets' sixth in a row, factoring in their humiliation at the hands of Manchester City at Wembley.\nBut the frustration for manager Gracia will lie in his side's slow start that allowed Everton to edge ahead, which was followed by a much-improved display late in the first half and for much of the second.\n\"I think we deserved a better result,\" said Gracia. \"We had more possession and more shots on target, we dominated some spells but we didn't score and we need to try better next time.\"\nDanny Welbeck made his Watford debut as a second-half substitute, and while the former Manchester United and Arsenal player made little impression, Gracia will be hoping the 28-year-old England striker will be up to speed soon to give some much-needed cutting edge.\nThe Watford manager added: \"I am happy for him because he was a long time injured and today was his first game. I am happy with his performance and I am sure he will help us in the future.\"\nThe slow start to the season is in contrast to last year when Watford won their first four matches - but have since accrued 38 points from 36 league outings.\nMan of the match - Digne (Everton)\nMore woe on the road for Watford - the stats\nEverton have won five consecutive Premier League home games for the first time since a run of eight under Ronald Koeman in April 2017.\nIn the top-flight, Watford have collected five points from a possible 75 in 25 away games against the two Merseyside clubs (Everton and Liverpool), winning one, drawing two and losing 22 of those games.\nEverton have kept six consecutive clean sheets at Goodison Park in the Premier League for the first time since a run of seven between March and September 2013.\nWatford boss Gracia has lost six consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time in his managerial career.\nWith a run starting with a 71st-minute West Ham strike through Marko Arnautovic in May, Watford have conceded 12 goals in all competitions without reply.\nAmongst defenders, only Liverpool full-back duo Trent Alexander-Arnold (14) and Andrew Robertson (11) have been directly involved in more Premier League goals than Everton's Digne (nine - four goals and five assists) since the start of last season.\nWatford defender Jose Holebas has received a yellow card in 35% of his Premier League appearances (36 in 102) - of players with at least 50 appearances in the competition, only Cheick Tiote has a higher ratio (38% - 52 in 138).\n'Fortress Goodison' - what the managers said\nEverton boss Silva, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The three points were the most important thing. We scored a goal and did not concede and that was important for us. Looking at the whole picture I think we deserved the win.\n\"Of course the second half I would like the performance to be better but it is the first home game of the season. I think we had more big chances than them to score.\n\"With a second goal you are more safe. We want to make Goodison our fortress.\"\nOn Kean's cameo: \"Was tough for him. He had that big moment to make an impact and put his stamp on the game. He didn't score but he is a boy and he should improve and should know better our team in time.\"\nWatford boss Gracia, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I think today we had our performance and we were close to getting a better result.\n\"They scored from a long ball, an individual action. We were a little bit unlucky because our defender touched a little bit their shot. We then hit the crossbar, we had good performance but didn't take the chances and they won the game.\n\"We need to improve many things but there were many positives today.\"\nWhat's next?\nEverton face Aston Villa at Villa Park on Friday, 23 August at 20:00 BST, while Watford are next in action when they take on West Ham at Vicarage Road on Saturday, 24 August at 15:00 BST."

Now it's done, we're really happy with the result and the work from the boys.\n\"It was time to win a game to launch the season.\"\nHaller, who missed last weekend's 1-1 draw at Brighton, opened his West Ham account with a tap-in from Felipe Anderson's cut-back.\nAnd he then acrobatically turned the ball home with an overhead kick from three yards after following up from a corner.\nMark Noble's third-minute penalty set West Ham on their way to their first win of the season after Manuel Lanzini had been fouled by Abdoulaye Doucoure.\nBut Watford responded to level with a well-worked Andre Gray goal, with the forward drilling home a right-foot shot from Will Hughes' pass.\nHowever, the Hornets were punished for their wastefulness in front of goal with just three of their 23 shots finding the target.\nJavi Gracia's side, who sit bottom of the table, have now lost seven successive games in all competitions for the first time since 1999.\nReversal of fortunes for Watford\nAt the same stage last term Watford had collected nine points after an impressive start, but a pointless return this time around represents a complete reversal of fortune.\nWhile they did at least register their first goal of the campaign, manager Gracia appears to have problems at both ends of the pitch to contend with.\nDespite creating a multitude of opportunities, Gray's 17th-minute strike was all they had to show for their endeavour.\nGerard Deulofeu's influence as a creator was a plus, but he cannot be relied upon to be the prolific forward the club need to improve on last term's 11th-place finish.\nThe former Barcelona man had seven shots on goal, with only a close-range strike that hit the West Ham crossbar finding the target.\nIt was a chance, alongside Will Hughes' extraordinary miss from a yard out after Gray had squared the ball with the score at 1-1, that summed up the hosts' lack of potency in attack.\nAt the other end the presence of Haller, Anderson and Lanzini provided too much power, pace and guile for the Watford defence to cope with.\nGracia's side now face a challenging sequence of fixtures - with a home game against Arsenal sandwiched between trips to Newcastle and reigning champions Manchester City - having shipped 41 goals in their last 18 matches.\nHaller takes centre stage\nHaving arrived at West Ham after impressing at Utrecht and in the Bundesliga, there is a certain amount of expectation surrounding Haller.\nBut his first two goals and overall performance suggested that he has the attributes to justify his club record price tag.\nThe 25-year-old led the line in exemplary fashion and contributed to all three West Ham goals.\nHis work to chase down possession led to Lanzini winning the penalty that delivered their opener.\nThe former France Under-21 international then displayed his predatory instincts, holding his run to ensure he was well positioned to capitalise on Anderson's break down the left.\nThat allowed him to comfortably claim his first goal for Pellegrini's side before acrobatically doubling his tally.\n\"[Sebastien Haller's] goals were two very important goals for him,\" Pellegrini said.\n\"Coming to the Premier League is not easy. He had just one start in a difficult game against Man City, for a striker the most important thing is to score.\"\nMan of the match - Sebastien Haller (West Ham)\nNoble joins esteemed company - the stats\nWatford have lost four league matches at home in a row for the first time since a run of five between October and December 2013 in the Championship.\nWest Ham are undefeated in their last four away matches in the Premier League, winning three of those (D1) - they'd lost seven of their previous eight (D1).\nWest Ham are the first club to have had as many as 150 different goal-scorers in the Premier League, following Haller's first goal for the club.\nWatford had more shots against West Ham (23) than they managed in their first two games of the season combined (19).\nWatford's Gray has scored 13 Premier League goals since his debut for the Hornets - only Troy Deeney has scored more in this period (14).\nWest Ham's Noble has scored five Premier League goals against Watford - more than he has netted against any other side in the league.\nNoble has now scored 25 penalty goals in the Premier League - only Alan Shearer (56), Frank Lampard (43) and Steven Gerrard (32) have scored more in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nWatford host Coventry in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday 27 August (19:45 BST) before they visit Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday 31 August (15:00 BST).\nWest Ham visit Newport in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday 27 August (19:45 BST), before resuming their Premier league duties at home to Norwich on Saturday 31 August (15:00 BST)."

I felt John McGinn drove the game forward, he had a couple of chances in the first half and we got the goal through Douglas, but we have to be better in possession and its a harsh lesson.\"\nAston Villa 1-2 Bournemouth - as it happened\nIn a fiery encounter at Villa Park - hosting its first top-flight match in 1,197 days - Bournemouth were lucky to see out the first half with all 11 men as Philip Billing walked a tightrope with a number of poor challenges before the break.\nIt was Villa who enjoyed the lion's share of the possession, and they went close to getting an equaliser when chances fell to McGinn and Trezeguet, among others.\nBut it ended as Bournemouth's first victory of the new campaign, and was the first time they have won their opening away league fixture in consecutive seasons since a run of three between 1996-1998.\n\"Losing the game is harsh on us,\" Smith added. \"We created chances but we have got to take them - they took their chances and we didn't.\n\"I'm not disappointed in the way we've played, I'm just disappointed in the results.\"\nCherries hold on after emphatic start\nHowe made two changes from the Bournemouth starting XI that drew with Sheffield United last week, and while his injury-hit squad remain without a host of key players, they could not have asked for a better start to life on the road this season.\nMartin Atkinson's decision to award them a penalty inside the first minute was met by stunned silence in Villa Park. King sent Heaton - who joined Villa from Burnley in the summer - the wrong way with his spot-kick.\nThe silence proved even more deafening some 10 minutes later when Harry Wilson, who was on loan at Derby last season, made it two. He capitalised on a Luiz mistake before letting fly from outside the box, with his goal aided by a hefty deflection.\n\"[Wilson] looked like he fitted into the team, he was getting balls in between the lines,\" Howe told BBC Match of the Day. \"The Premier League is such a high level, it will be a very hard challenge but he's certainly started really well.\"\nVilla soon started to find their feet on home soil as the tension started to boil over, with visiting midfielder Billing involved in a melee with another of Villa's new signings, Wesley.\nMoment later, Billing received a yellow card following the first of two poor challenges on McGinn, and more questionable tackles followed on Jack Grealish and Luiz before his manager hauled him off at half-time.\nVilla controlled proceedings in the second half, yet Bournemouth still saw chances to extend their lead go begging and found a second wind after Luiz's goal, with Ryan Fraser going close in the dying minutes.\nHowe added: \"It was a big result for us today. We knew the importance, the game was still in the balance at half-time, but more pleasing for us was the way we saw out the game after letting the lead slip last week.\n\"It was great to see we were creating chances. We were a threat. Aston Villa are a very good team. They have quality players but we managed to stay ahead. We defended the last 10-15 minutes really well.\"\nVilla see chances wasted\nHad Villa expected a gentle reintroduction to Premier League life, last week's late defeat by Tottenham and conceding two goals inside 12 minutes against Bournemouth gave them a taste of the harsh reality.\nFive of Smith's starting line-up were making their home debuts following Villa's mass spending during the transfer window, but new signing Luiz failed to impress his new team's fans in a sloppy first-half performance.\nThe Brazilian was at fault for Wilson's goal, dummying a ball between his legs after mistakenly thinking a team-mate was nearby, allowing the Bournemouth man to intercept possession.\nMinutes later, Luiz was lucky to avoid scoring an own goal, sending the ball towards his own net but over the bar from a delivery fired across goal by Callum Wilson.\nAfter the break, Villa saw a penalty appeal denied by the video assistant referee after Wesley was felled by Bournemouth keeper Aaron Ramsdale. But they continued to go close to finding the back of the net, including a chance for Neil Taylor, who is looking for his first club goal since 2010.\nLuiz earned some reprieve with his delightful goal, curling his strike in from a Grealish assist, and his joy was evident as he buoyed the Villa Park crowd on.\nBut Bournemouth stayed solid at the back as the clock ticked down, and Bjorn Engels scuppered the home side's final chance with a header from close range.\nThe stats\nAston Villa have lost 14 of their last 15 Premier League games (including their last spell in the top flight in 2016), drawing the other one and last winning a Premier League game in February 2016 (2-0 v Norwich).\nBournemouth have registered three wins in their last six Premier League away games - as many as they managed in their previous 14 on the road.\nAston Villa have lost consecutive home leagues games for the first time since February 2017.\nBournemouth enjoyed only their third ever Premier League away win against a newly promoted side in their 12th such clash (D2 L7).\nJosh King's second-minute penalty for Bournemouth (1:40) is the earliest spot kick to be scored in a Premier League match since Sergio Aguero against Newcastle in February 2015 (1:12).\nKing's opener was also Bournemouth's quickest Premier League goal since Junior Stanislas netted against Leicester in May 2017 (0:59).\nSince the start of last season, Harry Wilson has netted 10 goals from outside the box in all competitions, more than any other player in English football.\nDouglas Luiz netted his first goal in European league football in his 40th game (two games in the Premier League, 38 in La Liga with Girona).\nMan of the match - John McGinn (Aston Villa)\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa welcome Everton to Villa Park on Friday (20:00 BST), while Bournemouth welcome champions Manchester City to the south coast next Sunday (14:00)."

        "article_text": "Norwich City 3-1 Newcastle United: Pukki scores hat-trick to seal win\nTeemu Pukki admitted he \"wouldn't have even dreamt of a day like this\" after his impressive hat-trick gave Norwich City their first win back in the Premier League against a laboured Newcastle United.\nThe 29-year-old's previously unremarkable career took in spells at Schalke, Celtic and Brondby before he hit 29 goals for Norwich as they won the Championship last season.\nHe scored in the 4-1 defeat at Liverpool last week but he oozed Premier League quality with three fine finishes in his side's first Premier League game back at Carrow Road.\n\"Of course this is one of the best games I've had in English football,\" he said. \"A hat-trick in the Premier League I wouldn't even have dreamt about a couple of years ago.\"\nPukki's stunning volley set Norwich on their way in the first half, lashing into the top corner after Newcastle failed to clear a corner.\nThe home side were buoyant and Pukki doubled their lead in the 63rd minute when he clinically finished off a neat passing move.\nHe then rounded off the scoring after Todd Cantwell caught the visitors' defence cold, taking over to slot his third past a helpless Martin Dubravka.\nNewcastle did get a consolation goal in second-half stoppage time through Jonjo Shelvey but this disjointed and toothless display will only ramp up the pressure on new manager Steve Bruce.\nPukki punishes Newcastle\nPukki had scored with three of his past four shots on target before this game but he was uncharacteristically profligate early on as Newcastle's defence struggled to handle Norwich's intricate attacking play.\nFirst, he flashed a shot wide from 12 yards before spinning Fabian Schar and hitting a shot too close to goalkeeper Dubravka.\nNewcastle failed to heed the warning signs, though, and the Finnish striker punished them in style on 32 minutes.\nIt was a delicious strike from last season's Championship top scorer, carefully watching a loose header drop before unleashing a thunderbolt volley high into the Newcastle net.\nHe tormented the visiting backline and underlined his finishing abilities when he clipped a shot into the bottom corner in the second half before sliding home his third with 15 minutes left.\nHis tireless display even featured a potentially goal-saving challenge when he raced back to deny Joelinton a run at goalkeeper Tim Krul.\nAfter scoring Norwich's consolation at Anfield last week, the Finnish striker looks completely comfortable at this level.\nToothless Newcastle struggle in the sun\nNewcastle manager Bruce had seen plenty of promise from his side in last week's narrow defeat at home to Arsenal but he would have been dismayed at how they were overrun at Carrow Road.\nIt might have been different had they not spurned two glorious first half chances before Norwich opened the scoring.\nFirst, debutant Emil Krafth blazed over from just six yards when picked out at the back post.\nThen, Isaac Hayden carved out space on the right and whipped in a glorious cross for Joelinton. The ex-Hoffenheim man met it powerfully but sent it spinning the wrong side of Krul's left post.\nHe limped off later after a heavy challenge from Grant Hanley, while Miguel Almiron - his predecessor as record signing - was virtually anonymous.\nJonjo Shelvey scored a neat consolation in injury time but Bruce has plenty of problems at the top end of the pitch before a daunting trip to Tottenham next week.\nMan of the match - Teemu Pukki (Norwich)\nWhat they said\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke: \"Carrow Road was buzzing today. The performance was great and we deserved the three points. The players have a lot of tactical knowledge and we work really hard to put it into practice.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce: \"We were nowhere near good enough and it was a disappointing afternoon with and without the ball.\"\nNewcastle's August woes - the stats\nNorwich are unbeaten in their past seven home Premier League games against Newcastle United (W5 D2 L0), since losing at Carrow Road in January 1994.\nNewcastle have won their first away league match in just two of the past 22 campaigns (W2 D8 L12), winning in 2007-08 against Bolton Wanderers and 2011-12 against Sunderland.\nThey have won just two of their last 29 Premier League away games in August (D10 L17) and are winless in their last eight such matches.\nDaniel Farke is the first Norwich manager to win his opening home Premier League game in charge since Mike Walker in August 1992 - prior to today, each of the past seven managers had lost their first Norwich top-flight home game.\nThe past five Newcastle managers have all lost their first away Premier League match in charge of the club - Alan Pardew, John Carver, Steve McClaren, Rafael Benitez and Steve Bruce.\nTeemu Pukki is the first Norwich player to score in his first two Premier League appearances for the club since Ashley Ward in December 1994.\nWhat's next?\nNorwich welcome Chelsea to Carrow Road for next Saturday's early kick-off (12:30 BST) while Newcastle travel to Tottenham on Sunday (16:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Guardiola 'accepts' VAR after goal overruled\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola said he would \"have to accept it\" after a VAR decision overruled what looked to have been a late winner over Tottenham.\nCity were celebrating after Gabriel Jesus appeared to have scored in injury time, but the goal was ruled out because the ball had brushed Aymeric Laporte's arm in the build-up.\n\"We have to accept it,\" said Guardiola after the game ended 2-2.\n\"It's tough because we scored a goal late on. But ask VAR people, not me.\"\nRaheem Sterling had headed dominant City ahead in the first half, but Erik Lamela immediately equalised against the run of play with a strike from distance.\nSergio Aguero flicked home Kevin de Bruyne's cross before Substitute Lucas Moura nodded in seconds after coming on as a substitute to pull Spurs level again.\nIt was a frustrating result for City in their first home game of the season, particularly after beginning their title defence with a 5-0 win at West Ham last weekend.\nIt is the first time they have dropped points at home since losing to Crystal Palace on 22 December last year.\nThe home fans greeted the final whistle with boos directed at VAR as the disallowed goal stirred memories of City's Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Tottenham last season.\nReaction to the thrilling draw between Man City and Tottenham\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday\nDeja vu for City\nIn April, City needed a goal to secure passage to the last four of the Champions League in their second leg encounter with Spurs at the Etihad.\nThe hosts thought that had arrived in injury time when Sterling struck, prompting wild celebrations from City boss Pep Guardiola.\nBut emotions switched instantly as the video assistant referee had the final word, ruling that Aguero was offside when Bernardo Silva diverted the ball into Sterling's path.\nThis time, City players wheeled away to celebrate what appeared to be a last-gasp winning goal that would have extended City's winning run at home in the Premier League to 11 games.\nHowever, those celebrations were cut short when referee Michael Oliver indicated that a VAR review was under way, and the goal was disallowed after replays showed a ball into the box had flicked off Laporte's arm.\nNew handball rules introduced this season state that any goal resulting from handball, accidental or otherwise, must be ruled out and Man City found out to their cost just how strictly these laws will be applied.\nSpeaking on Match of the Day, Danny Murphy was scathing in his assessment of the decision.\n\"The new handball rule is ridiculous,\" he said. \"That should never on any playing field anywhere in the world be disallowed.\n\"It wouldn't even be seen if we didn't have VAR.\"\nIt is the second successive City game in which VAR has played a significant role. The system also overturned a goal by Sterling in their win at West Ham last time out.\nAguero was particularly frustrated with the officials at the final whistle against Tottenham. He had also earlier exchanged angry words with Guardiola when he was substituted for Jesus, but the City boss dismissed that as a misunderstanding.\n\"He thought I was annoyed with him for the goal we conceded,\" said Guardiola. \"But it is emotions, and that is part of the game. We talked afterwards. I love him a lot because we know his feelings.\"\nCan Tottenham truly challenge City this season?\nTottenham finished 27 points behind City last season but Mauricio Pochettino's side strengthened in the summer, giving fans hope that they could challenge for a first league title since 1961.\nHowever, Spurs barely had a touch of the ball in the opening 10 minutes as City enjoyed 74% possession and, even though they did manage to equalise, it was against the run of play as Lamela made the most of a rare opening in the home side's defence.\nBut despite the hosts' dominance, Spurs appear to have a knack of scoring against City.\nPrior to Saturday's game, City had won their previous 15 home games in all competitions, conceding just six goals in the process. But three of those six goals were scored by Tottenham in the 4-3 Champions League game in April.\nAnd Spurs breached their defences once more when Moura headed home from a corner just 19 seconds after coming on as a substitute.\nIt was a big result for Tottenham, who were beaten home and away by City in the Premier League last season. But despite the result, they were heavily outplayed by their opponents, who finished with 30 shots on goal compared to Spurs' three.\nThey will want to be more competitive against their title rivals if they are to challenge for honours this term.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nDe Bruyne display a highlight for City\nThere will no doubt be frustration among City fans that their side could not notch up an early win over a title rival, but De Bruyne's performance will have given them some comfort.\nWhen Manchester City won the Premier League in 2017-18, the Belgian playmaker was the creative heartbeat of the team, providing 16 assists - more than any other player in the league that season.\nVarious injuries made for a difficult campaign last term, but a strong pre-season suggested the fitness problems that plagued him last season were behind him, a feeling that has been reinforced by his explosive start to 2019-20.\nDe Bruyne got his first assist of the season when he set up Sterling for City's second goal in the 5-0 win at West Ham last weekend, and the two combined superbly once again on Saturday, with De Bruyne evading the Tottenham defence with a wonderful curled pass for Sterling to nod home.\nThe hosts' second goal came from a typical Manchester City move. De Bruyne found a pocket of space on the right and delivered across the face of goal for Aguero to turn in.\nDe Bruyne managed just two Premier League assists last season but already has three to his name in this campaign. If his injuries are truly behind him, the early signs are that the Belgian player could be back to his very best.\n'We need to improve'\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said: \"I'm very pleased with a point but also know we need to improve. We are in a process where we need to improve in all areas and the team is going to improve step by step, but we need time.\n\"It was an unbelievable goal [by Lucas Moura]. Always when you play a team like Manchester City, you have to play your best.\n\"We need to accept that [VAR]. I was a little bit critical of VAR but now we have to accept the rules. Now it benefits us. No doubt it won't benefit us at other times. It's a rule we need to accept.\"\nSensational Sterling - the stats\nManchester City mustered 30 shots, the most Tottenham have faced in a Premier League fixture since November 2011 (31 v Fulham).\nRaheem Sterling has been directly involved in seven goals in his last seven games for Man City against Spurs in all competitions (six goals, one assist), including netting five in his last four against them at the Etihad.\nSterling has scored in four consecutive club appearances in all competitions for the first time in his career, netting seven goals in those four games.\nKevin de Bruyne has registered three assists in his two Premier League games this season, one more than he managed in the whole of the last campaign.\nSergio Aguero has netted 97 goals at the Etihad in the Premier League, the joint-third highest total by a player at a single stadium in the competition (Henry 114 at Highbury, Rooney 101 at Old Trafford, Shearer 97 at St James' Park).\nLucas Moura has been directly involved in five goals in his last five games in all competitions for Tottenham (four goals, one assist), as many as he managed in his previous 20.\nAll three of the Premier League games where Erik Lamela has both scored and assisted have come against Manchester clubs, twice against City and once against United.\nWhat next?\nManchester City will look to get back to winning ways when they travel to Bournemouth on Sunday, 25 August (14:00 BST). Tottenham, meanwhile, are at home to Newcastle on the same day (16:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 1-0 Crystal Palace: John Lundstram earns Blades first win\nSheffield United crowned their first Premier League game at Bramall Lane for 12 years with a hard-fought victory over Crystal Palace.\nSpurred on by a raucous home crowd, who were watching League One football three seasons ago, Chris Wilder's team added to their point at Bournemouth last weekend with a precious win thanks to John Lundstram's early second half goal.\nThe Blades are being tipped by many to get relegated, but they created the better chances and stood firm against a Palace side who earned more points away from home than at Selhurst Park last season.\nThe hosts should have gone ahead in the first half when David McGoldrick's close-range shot was saved by Vicente Guaita in the Palace goal.\nBut Lundstram, who had set up that chance, gave them the lead early in the second half as he smashed in from 10 yards after Luke Freeman's shot was stopped.\nA frustrated Palace were limited to very little as Wilfried Zaha - making his first start of the season after a proposed summer move away fell through - was shackled by an industrious Blades defence.\nThe victory will be a fillip for Wilder, who out-foxed Palace boss Roy Hodgson with a 3-5-2 formation that continues to excel at both ends of the pitch.\nWilder, a former Sheffield United player, says he won't compromise his style as he seeks to establish his side in the top flight but the early signs are that he might not need to.\nWilder's team poses new problems for Palace\nThe last time Bramall Lane hosted Premier League football, it was for a defeat by Wigan in the pouring rain, which consigned the Blades to the Championship on the last day of the 2006-07 season.\nThat eventually led to a six-year stay in League One - but bathed in warm sunshine, Wilder's team were boosted by their noisy supporters, who repeatedly sang about their journey to the Premier League under the former Blades ballboy, who they claim as \"one of our own\".\nDespite an early shot for Christian Benteke, which was saved by Dean Henderson, the hosts were on top for most of the first half but were let down by poor finishing as John Fleck and McGoldrick wasted chances.\nUnited also claimed a penalty as Enda Stevens had his effort blocked by Joel Ward, but the referee David Coote waved appeals away.\nTheir profligacy ended when Luke Freeman, who replaced the injured Fleck in the first half, burst down the left and had his shot saved.\nBut the powerful Lundstram was on hand to send Bramall Lane into raptures.\nOli McBurnie also headed over as Wilder's team pushed for a second, but marshalled by the excellent Oliver Norwood in midfield, they did not let control of the game slip and after holding on towards the end, sent their fans home with belief it could be a memorable season.\nPalace can't find a plan B\nPalace were the sixth-best team in the Premier League away from home last season, based on counter-attacking style which suited some of their more skilful players such as Zaha and Andros Townsend.\nBut they were unable to impose themselves in this encounter and appeared not to have to the answers to United's guile and energy.\nZaha was their most dangerous outlet, but when he was well marshalled by the Blades defence, they did not appear to have another strategy.\nAt times, the hosts' tackling drew the ire of Zaha, who was also taunted by the Bramall Lane crowd for what they considered theatrical diving.\nThree Sheffield United players were booked, including George Baldock, who was perhaps fortunate not to receive a straight red for a nasty tackle on James McCarthy.\nYet only a deflected shot from Townsend threatened the United goal in the second half, and Hodgson was left a passive figure as his side pressed in vain for an equaliser.\nHaving earned a 0-0 draw with Everton last weekend, Palace are now winless and goalless in their opening two games.\nMan of the match - Oliver Norwood (Sheff Utd)\n'A proper Sheffield United performance' - what the managers said\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"We wanted a special atmosphere and we certainly got that and the players rose to the occasion.\n\"We have got that enthusiasm, if anyone comes here they have to do a lot of good things to get a result but I thought we were good and we nicked a tight game - it was a great effort from everybody to gain the three points.\n\"We have to play quicker and be a bit more streetwise but the players got up to the speed of the game and it was a proper Sheffield United performance.\n\"The players give me everything day in day out and they've given me two honest performances from two games. We are underdogs and we do have to have that siege mentality.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson said: \"I didn't think we were good enough. In the first half we looked OK, but in the second half when they scored we were nowhere near good enough.\n\"Sometimes people do not play well, they are not robots or chess pieces. We hardly had a strike at goal in the second half and that is inadmissible, the quality of the players we have is far better than we showed in the second half.\"\nWilder and Pep - the stats\nSince the start of the 2016-17 season, Chris Wilder has won 77 league matches as Sheffield United boss - only Pep Guardiola, with 88 victories, has won more in that time among managers in England's top four divisions.\nThe Blades registered their first top-flight win over Crystal Palace since April 1973. That ended a run of six top-flight games without a win against the Eagles.\nFor a third time in the past four seasons, Palace have failed to win either of their opening two Premier League games while also failing to score (2016-17, 2017-18 and 2019-20).\nPalace have won only one of their past 11 Premier League matches in August, failing to score in eight of those games.\nUnited became the first team since Norwich City in April 2012 to name a fully British and Irish starting XI in consecutive Premier League games.\nWilder is the first manager to name a fully British/Irish starting XI in his first two Premier League matches since Gary Megson did so in 1995 with Norwich City.\nPhil Jagielka made his first Premier League appearance for Sheffield United since 13 May 2007 - 4,480 days ago. Only Wayne Rooney for Everton has had a bigger gap in appearances for a team in Premier League history (4,837 days between May 2004 and August 2017).\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United host Leicester City on Saturday (15:00 BST) while Crystal Palace are at Manchester United at the same time."

We have to be patient as we are working towards something.\n\"Two or three nil would have taken the game away from them but we didn't take those chances. That's the story of our season so far. We need to be more clinical, for sure. It is defining.\"\nOn the reception he received from Chelsea's fans: \"This is home for me and I really appreciated the support. It's my club, I played here so long and I'm slightly disappointed we didn't get the win but I'm thankful to the fans.\"\nLeicester City boss Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is my fault, the mistake [that led to Chelsea's goal], because I ask my players to build in the game. But it was a brilliant response.\n\"We were outstanding in the second-half but didn't win the game. We came out with a positive mindset and had chances to put it to bed. The most important thing is getting the players into those positions.\"\nMount makes Chelsea history - the stats\nMason Mount became the first English player to score on his first home appearance for Chelsea in the Premier League since Paul Hughes did so against Derby County in January 1997.\nMount became the first English player to score for Chelsea under an English manager since Dennis Wise against Blackburn Rovers in May 1996 (Glenn Hoddle as manager).\nFrank Lampard is the first Chelsea boss to fail to win any of his first three games in charge of the club since Rafael Benitez in the 2012-13 campaign.\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers has faced Chelsea on 13 occasions as a manager but is yet to register a victory against the Blues.\nLeicester midfielder Wilfred Ndidi's goal was just his fifth in 90 Premier League appearances, and his first away from home.\nAfter winning their first Premier League home game in 12 consecutive seasons between 2003-04 and 2014-15, Chelsea have failed to win three of their last five opening home games in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in action against newly promoted teams next, with Chelsea at Norwich on Saturday (12:30 BST) and Leicester at Sheffield United (15:00) on the same day."

        "article_text": "Wolves 1-1 Man Utd: Paul Pogba misses penalty at Molineux\nPaul Pogba had a second-half penalty saved as Manchester United were held to a Premier League draw at Wolves.\nWith the score 1-1 in the second half, the Frenchman was fouled by Conor Coady and got up to take the spot-kick, despite failing with three penalties last season and Marcus Rashford scoring from one against Chelsea on the opening weekend.\nPogba's powerful shot was pushed away by Rui Patricio, who saved low to his right.\nIn a first half containing just three shots, Anthony Martial had put United in front with his 50th goal for the club - a fine left-footed finish - only for Ruben Neves to level with a sensational strike from the edge of the area, which bounced down off the crossbar 10 minutes after the break.\nWolves' Raul Jimenez had flicked a header against the inside of a post just before Neves' effort but neither keeper was troubled after Pogba's miss.\n'Weak management' - pundits criticise Man Utd penalty strategy\nInter to make Man Utd loan offer for Sanchez\nFootball Daily podcast: Neves, Newcastle and Pogba's penalty woes\nBest and worst of Martial\nIn his news conference on Friday, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he wanted Martial and Rashford to be more clinical in front of goal.\nHe might well have been talking about the cross Rashford floated over to the far post midway through the opening period.\nIt is easy to imagine someone like Alan Shearer taking every defender with him in his desire to make sure the ball ended up in the net. Martial barely extended his right leg, let alone made contact as the opportunity drifted away.\nWhat followed underlined just how many goals the Frenchman is capable of getting if he did adopt that ruthless streak. After a fantastic move, which started with Jesse Lingard, included Luke Shaw and ended with Rashford prodding a short pass beyond the Wolves defence, Martial struck a first-time shot, with barely any backlift, that gave Patricio no chance.\nIt was part of an excellent opening period for the visitors, only spoiled by the booking winger Daniel James received for diving.\nThe second half was a different story but United probably would have won had Pogba not missed his penalty.\nThe key question is why was Pogba taking it?\nIn addition to scoring against Chelsea, Rashford also converted in stoppage-time to seal that magnificent Champions League win at Paris St-Germain last season, in addition to scoring in England's World Cup shootout against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup.\nAt the final whistle, Pogba covered his head with his shirt, then chuntered to himself as he headed for the tunnel.\nTraore the game-changer\nMartial's effort turned out to be the only shot on target in that first half of three efforts on goal. There hasn't been a top-flight game with fewer since 2003-04, when such statistics started to be collated.\nIt also meant Wolves had managed only two shots on target in the first match and a half of their Premier League season, something that will need to change if they are to match last season's excellent seventh-placed finish.\nHaving beaten them twice at Molineux last season, Wolves were aiming for a third successive win against United for the first time in almost 40 years. After a disappointing opening period, Adama Traore's half-time introduction changed the game in their favour.\nTraore's pace unsettled the visitors' defence and from a free-kick Harry Maguire conceded for a foul on the Spaniard, Jimenez hit the inside of a post with a deft flick from Joao Moutinho's cross.\nIt turned out to be a temporary reprieve for United as Moutinho picked Neves out with his corner.\nOn the bench, manager Nuno Espirito Santo leapt in delight. There was barely any room between David de Gea's outstretched hand and the top of the visitors' net.\nThe goal provided another video assistant referee (VAR) talking point.\nBefore this season, Molineux would have erupted in joy at Neves' wonderful equaliser, those watching on TV would have said 'wow' and the Manchester United fans would have shrugged and accepted they had seen a phenomenal goal.\nInstead, home celebrations were cut short as referee Jon Moss took instruction from the video referee Paul Tierney on a potential offside. The decision eventually went their way but the Wolves fans were loud in their collective view that the ends do not justify the means.\nMan of the match - Ruben Neves (Wolves)\n'Neves has fantastic technique' - reaction\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to the BBC's Match of the Day: \"I'm pleased with the performance. In the first half United controlled the game and pressed very high. In the second half the reaction was very good. I'm proud of all the performance.\n\"Adama Traore helped the team when he came on. He's about that. The squad is about managing the options you have.\n\"When Neves lined up the shot for the equaliser I was hoping, not expecting. He has fantastic technique.\"\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: \"We dominated possession, we get the first goal and second half we know they'll come out like a house on fire.\n\"They probably got the goal they deserve. I thought we took control again and could have won it.\n\"First half was a mature performance. Second half was a bit sloppy. We are improving. We are a young team who will learn, we learned on the pitch today.\n\"We get a penalty that normally would get us another two points, sometimes the keeper makes a good save.\"\nSolskjaer's bogey team - the stats\nWolves are the first to team to come from behind and avoid defeat in three consecutive Premier League games against United.\nWolves are unbeaten in their past four games against Manchester United in all competitions (W2 D2 L0), last tasting defeat in March 2012 (5-0).\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has failed to win any of his four games in all competitions against Wolves (D1 L3); they're the side he's faced most without winning in his managerial career.\nThe average age of United's starting XI was 24 years and 173 days - the youngest in the Premier League this season and their youngest in the competition since the final day of the 2016-17 campaign (22 years, 284 days v Crystal Palace).\nPremier League referee Jonathan Moss has shown 12 cards for diving in the competition since the start of the 2017-18 campaign; double the amount of any other referee.\nMartial scored with the very first shot in this match, becoming the 53rd player to score 50 goals in all competitions for United.\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to Italy for Thursday's Europa League play-off first leg against Torino (20:00 BST) before entertaining Burnley (16:30 BST) in the Premier League on Sunday. Manchester United play Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday at 15:00 BST."

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 2-0 Everton: Wesley & Anwar El Ghazi on target for hosts\nAston Villa collected their first Premier League points of the season as goals from Wesley and Anwar El Ghazi gave them victory over Everton.\nBrazilian Wesley, who arrived from Club Bruges for a club record fee, opened his account in English football with a close-range effort from Jota's incisive pass.\nEl Ghazi sealed victory late on after collecting John McGinn's pass and sliding a shot underneath Jordan Pickford from six yards out.\nThe result lifts Dean Smith's side up to 11th in the table and gives Villa their first win in the top flight since February 2016.\nSubstitute Alex Iwobi went closest to scoring for Everton, driving a low effort against the right-hand post at 1-0.\nHowever, it was a largely frustrating evening for Marco Silva's side with Theo Walcott also spurning a glorious 89th minute chance to equalise from a right-foot volley.\nVilla drawing on 'togetherness' at club, says boss Smith\nEverton toil at both ends\nWith four points from their opening two fixtures of the season, Everton's undefeated start to the campaign had been constructed on their collective solidity rather than attacking verve.\nHowever, Villa's opening goal was a result of a breakdown in communication and a disregard of defensive duties.\nAndre Gomes, who joined the Blues permanently from Barcelona in July, and Michael Keane were both culpable.\nCaught out of position by Jack Grealish's quickly taken free-kick, the Portugal midfielder allowed Jota both the time and space to slide a pass through the Everton defence.\nKeane's sluggish reaction then compounded matters, with the England defender allowing Wesley to run across him and put the ball past a helpless Pickford from seven yards.\nWhile Silva's side were slick in possession, there was a noticeable absence of attacking threat to their play.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin wasted a glorious opportunity to equalise at 1-0, firing a shot straight at Villa's Belgian defender Bjorn Engels.\nAnd while the second-half introduction of Moise Kean, Iwobi and Walcott provided more thrust and pace, the latter's late miss with the goal gaping summed up an evening in which they only managed a single shot on target.\nJota and McGinn excel for Villa\nSuccessive defeats have delivered a tough period of acclimatisation for Aston Villa who returned to the top flight this summer after three years in the Championship.\nWith individual errors rather than poor performances depriving Villa of points, this fixture was a test of their nerve and concentration.\nRepeatedly cut open in the early stages, Smith's side found discipline and shape before Jota was the catalyst for an upturn in their fortunes.\nExerting his influence from the right, the 28-year-old Spaniard's presence of mind and ability to retain possession halted Everton's dominance.\nA delicious pass to Wesley brought the opening goal and three minutes later he again carved the visiting defence apart, sliding the ball behind Keane and Yerry Mina to create another opening for the Brazilian.\nNot to be outdone his fellow midfielder McGinn produced a superbly weighted pass for El Ghazi's goal in added time.\nMan of the match - Jota (Aston Villa)\n'It's difficult to see how we lost'- what they said\nEverton boss Marco Silva, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is really difficult to see how we can lose this game when we create so many chances to score.\n\"We started well and controlled the game with some dangerous moments around their box. The first time they went in our box they scored.\n\"We spoke during the week that Villa like to play fast set-pieces and they did that and we switched off. In the first moment it was 1-0.\n\"It is concerning about the goals we didn't score and of course we should score more. Against Palace we created lots of chances to score and didn't and again today.\"\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith told BBC Sport: \"I am more pleased to get the first points in the Premier League. Our performances have been OK, Tottenham was tough first up and we were good for an hour. We played well against Bournemouth and from the supporters there is a lot of optimism. They stuck right behind us. Everton started brighter but it was a good performance to get the win.\n\"We have had a bit of fortune, they have missed two big chances form inside the box and Theo Walcott shot over. I always felt we were a threat on the counter and we broke at pace. They play a higher line and we used that well.\"\nSmith breaks Premier League duck - the stats\nAston Villa ended a run of 15 Premier League games without a win (W0 D1 L14). This was their first top-flight victory since beating Norwich City 2-0 in February 2016.\nEverton suffered only their third Premier League defeat in their past 14 matches in the competition (W7 D4 L3).\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith enjoyed his first win against Premier League opposition - as a manager, Smith had lost all eight of his previous games against top-flight opponents across spells at Walsall, Brentford and Aston Villa.\nEverton have lost back to back Premier League games against newly promoted opponents (also 2-0 v Fulham in April) for the first time since August 2011.\nJota has been involved in 21 goals in 32 league appearances under manager Smith across his spells at Brentford and Aston Villa (12 goals, nine assists).\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa visit Crewe in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday (19:45 BST) and then go to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday, 31 August (15:00).\nEverton travel to Lincoln in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday (19:45 BST) before resuming their Premier League duties at home to Wolves on Sunday, 1 September (14:00)."

I did feel something for him today and it will do wonders for his confidence.\"\nAbraham was the target of racist abuse on social media after the Chelsea's Super Cup defeat by Liverpool in Istanbul earlier this month.\n\"He has had a tough little period for the reasons we all know and strikers get judged purely on goals at times which is sometimes slightly unfair, but when you ask about character and enthusiasm to play for this club then he is right up there,\" added Lampard.\n\"You see it every day and he can get better and better so I am really pleased for him.\n\"I supported Tammy over the online abuse. I did it out loud and I did it behind the scenes. I supported him on that as much as I can.\n\"In terms of playing, hopefully he will see my belief in him from the fact he is playing and hopefully from the fact I want to do extra shooting with him daily, every type of finishing and the first one today was top drawer. That comes from work on the training ground.\"\nChelsea youth stay patient\nLampard made two changes to the side that drew with Leicester last weekend, bringing in Abraham and Mateo Kovacic for Giroud and the injured N'Golo Kante, but he was forced to make another change after Pedro picked up a hamstring problem in the warm-up, replacing him with Ross Barkley.\nHis trust in his younger players paid dividends inside the opening 20 minutes, with Abraham - who he said before kick-off would \"cause Norwich problems\" - finishing off Cesar Azpilicueta's cross with a sweet finish into the bottom right-hand corner in the opening stages of the match.\nJust 11 minutes after Cantwell's equaliser for Norwich, Mount - who Lampard had on loan at Derby last season - cut inside the hosts' defence and unleashed an unstoppable shot high into the net for his second goal of the season.\nDespite Norwich's second leveller, Chelsea continued to pressure their opponents' shaky defence and Mount and Christian Pulisic both saw efforts go wide within moments of the second half getting under way.\nAbraham's second goal saw him become the youngest Chelsea player to score twice in a Premier League fixture since 1998, twisting and turning and tying Grant Hanley and Jamal Lewis in knots before firing an unstoppable drive past Tim Krul.\nThe Blues thought they had scored again when Kurt Zouma poked a loose ball home, but it was ruled out by the video assistant referee after substitute Olivier Giroud was judged to have fouled the Norwich keeper.\nThe only downside to Chelsea's victory came late on as Mount hobbled off injured, with the win meaning they are unbeaten against Norwich in 16 meetings.\nCanaries chirpy start slows down\nPremier League newcomers Norwich have quickly established themselves as a side not to be underestimated this season and they demonstrated that early on against Chelsea as Finnish striker Pukki - the Canaries' hat-trick hero against Newcastle - put the ball on a plate for Cantwell to score his first goal in the top flight.\nAfter Mount's goal, Chelsea enjoyed a spell of sustained pressure and Norwich had Krul to thank for not slipping further behind, the keeper producing a sublime save to swipe an Andreas Christensen header over the bar.\nThe hosts were soon level though, Pukki effortlessly slotting home from a tight angle to become only the 10th player to have scored in his first three Premier League appearances.\nNorwich struggled to match Chelsea's tempo after the break and had to wait more than 20 minutes for their first attack of the second half, but were punished just 30 seconds later as Abraham bagged his second.\nBen Godfrey hit the bar with a header from a corner soon after but manager Daniel Farke ruled change was needed, making a triple substitution with 10 minutes to go as his side searched for a late equaliser.\nIt worked to some extent, Norwich pushing Chelsea harder in the later stages than they had throughout the half but ultimately struggling to find the end product.\nMan of the match - Mason Mount (Chelsea)\n'I'm really pleased' - what they said\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was a tough test and Norwich will get a lot of points here because they are a good side.\n\"The two goals we gave away I didn't like but there were lots of good elements to our play and I'm really pleased.\n\"I'm particularly pleased for Tammy and he scored two good goals and the winning goal, but I want to talk about all the players today as we controlled the game on a hot day.\n\"Our performances haven't given us what we deserved so far - but today it did.\"\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke, speaking to BT Sport: \"It was a pretty close game. Small details made the difference today.\n\"I think 2-2 at half time was the right result. Then Chelsea were dominating in the first 15 minutes of the second half and that gave them the edge.\n\"Sometimes when you play against a team like Chelsea, you have to ride that pressure out.\n\"I am pretty happy with the performance, we had a number of chances, unfortunately we could not find the equaliser.\"\nThe stats\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard has lost none of his three managerial meetings with Norwich (W2 D1), winning both of his visits to Carrow Road (also 4-3 with Derby in December 2018) - Mason Mount has been on the scoresheet in both such wins.\nNorwich have scored at least twice in 16 of their last 17 home league games, scoring a total of 46 goals in this period. However, this was their first home league defeat of 2019 (P12 W8 D3 L1).\nBoth Norwich and Chelsea had scored after just five minutes and 32 seconds, the earliest time taken for both teams to find the net in a Premier League fixture since November 2017, when Crystal Palace v Everton was at 1-1 after 5:25.\nChelsea striker Tammy Abraham has scored 28 league goals (including in the play-offs) since the start of last season, the most of any English player in the top two tiers of English football in that time.\nAged 21 years and 326 days old, Abraham is the third youngest player to score a brace in the Premier League for Chelsea, after Mark Nicholls in January 1998 against Coventry (20y 225d) and Eddie Newton in December 1992 against Tottenham (20y 358d).\nNorwich forward Teemu Pukki (five goals) is the 10th player to score in each of his first three Premier League appearances, while only Pavel Pogrebnyak also scored as many as five in his first three in the competition.\nChelsea had two English players aged 21 or under score in the same Premier League match (Abraham and Mason Mount) for the first time since 22 August 1992, when Eddie Newton and Graham Stuart scored against Sheffield Wednesday.\nNorwich's Todd Cantwell (one goal, two assists) has already been directly involved in as many Premier League goals in three games as he was in 24 Championship appearances last season.\nSince the start of last season, Norwich's league matches have seen a total of 164 goals scored (99 for, 65 against), more than any other side in the top four tiers of English football in this time (excluding play-offs).\nWhat's next?\nFollowing a trip to Crawley in the EFL Cup on Tuesday (19:45 BST), Norwich travel to West Ham on Saturday (15:00 BST) while Chelsea host Sheffield United at the same time."

        "article_text": "Man Utd 1-2 Crystal Palace: Patrick van Aanholt scores winner\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson hailed a \"heroic victory\" after his side stunned Manchester United with an injury-time winner to record their first victory at Old Trafford since 1989.\nFull-back Patrick van Aanholt netted in the 93rd minute, thumping in as the ball broke loose following Wilfried Zaha's burst forward.\nDaniel James thought he had rescued a point for United when he curled in a delightful equaliser in the 89th minute following neat build-up from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.\nBut Rashford will rue striking the post from the penalty spot earlier in the second period - the second spot-kick the Red Devils have missed this week after Paul Pogba had one saved in the 1-1 draw at Wolves on Monday.\nJordan Ayew had scored the opener in the first half against the run of play, latching on to Jeffrey Schlupp's flick-on and coolly converting Palace's first goal of the campaign, before the late drama.\nHodgson said: \"It was hard work and the players showed incredible concentration on the tactics they were trying to employ. We kept Manchester United in front of us for very long periods.\n\"It was a long, hot afternoon and we had to accept our talented opponents would have more of the ball than us. We had to make certain that they did not play the passes to get the balls into the areas where they would punish us too severely. It was a heroic victory.\"\nRelive Crystal Palace's shock win over Manchester United\nSee the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nUnited's failing evident\nPogba received racist abuse on social media after his miss from the spot at Molineux.\nUnited released a statement condemning the abuse, while fans brought an anti-racism flag into the stadium and sang \"there's only one Paul Pogba\" to show they were behind the France midfielder.\nHowever, the tweets that followed Rashford's miss showed the issue remains, if from a nasty minority.\nThe England striker's failure from the spot formed part of a bad day for United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nThe club paid a collective \u00a3130m this summer for defenders Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka - but neither covered round the back of centre-back Victor Lindelof in the lead-up to Palace's opener, so when the Swede lost out to Schlupp as the pair challenged for goalkeeper Vicente Guaita's clearance, Ayew was able to race clear of the United defence and finish.\nJames was Solskjaer's third summer signing. The Welshman is having an impact and his curling shot to equalise was a brilliant effort.\nHowever, for the second game running, the winger was booked for diving - even if the decision from referee Paul Tierney looked harsh.\nHodgson added: \"United are not stupid, they have a very experienced group of people looking after them and they will be aware of that.\n\"They will be surprised if teams are going to be coming here playing gung-ho football and flying at them and giving them the chance to counter-attack, because they have such pace and skill on the ball that would be a recipe for disaster for most teams.\n\"They have to come to terms with the fact that teams in the lower half of the league, if they are organised and disciplined and if they put up the fight like we did today they will be hard to breakdown.\n\"And if they are lucky with players on the field that can hurt them on the counter-attack, that is what they have to prepare for at Old Trafford for a long part of the season.\"\nDream debut for Cahill\nIt was a sweet day for Crystal Palace's veteran defender Gary Cahill.\nPlaying at Old Trafford in the Premier League for his fourth different club, Cahill was celebrating his first win.\nHe made only two league appearances for Chelsea last season, so the 33-year-old could be forgiven an element of rustiness, although it was pure pace from Martial that caused the centre-back to drag the forward down as the hosts searched for a quick equaliser.\nCahill could easily have been sent off. Instead, he remained on the pitch and used his experience to steer Palace to an unexpected victory.\nEagles manager Hodgson is too experienced to get carried away by one game - but given his side were yet to score this season and had lost five of their past six visits to Old Trafford, the former England boss surely cannot have travelled with much confidence.\nBut they now sit level with United on points, and with Cahill easing himself in after his summer move from Chelsea, Hodgson could have one of the season's best free transfers at their disposal.\nMan of the match - Gary Cahill (Crystal Palace)\nPalace break records - the stats\nManchester United have won only one of their past nine matches, scoring just eight goals and conceding 16.\nPalace's Van Aanholt became only the second player to score a 90th-minute winner against United in the Premier League after Thierry Henry for Arsenal in January 2007, and the first to do so at Old Trafford.\nPalace earned their first win over United in the Premier League in their 21st meeting in the competition, and their first in the league since May 1991 (3-0 at Selhurst Park).\nUnited are only the second team to win a penalty in each of their first three matches of a Premier League season, after Chelsea in 2012-13. However, the Blues scored all three of theirs while the Red Devils have missed two.\nSince the start of last season, Palace have earned 60% of their points in the league in away games (32 out of 53), more than any other side.\nJames is the seventh United player to score in his first two Premier League appearances at Old Trafford for the club.\nAyew's opener for Palace came from their first shot and first touch in the opposition's box.\nRashford's long-range effort in the 58th minute was the latest United have attempted their first shot on target of a Premier League game at Old Trafford since April 2017 against West Brom (67th minute)."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-3 West Ham United: Sebastien Haller's second-half brace secures points\nRecord signing Sebastien Haller believes that West Ham's opening Premier League victory at Watford can \"launch\" their season.\nHaller, who arrived in a deal worth up to \u00a345m from Eintracht Frankfurt in July, scored twice as Manuel Pellegrini's side consigned the hosts to a third straight defeat this term.\nThe Hammers, who lost all three of their corresponding fixtures last term are 13th, albeit in a cluster of 10 clubs on four points that goes up to fourth.\nThe French forward said: \"It's really important to get a win. Now it's done, we're really happy with the result and the work from the boys.\n\"It was time to win a game to launch the season.\"\nHaller, who missed last weekend's 1-1 draw at Brighton, opened his West Ham account with a tap-in from Felipe Anderson's cut-back.\nAnd he then acrobatically turned the ball home with an overhead kick from three yards after following up from a corner.\nMark Noble's third-minute penalty set West Ham on their way to their first win of the season after Manuel Lanzini had been fouled by Abdoulaye Doucoure.\nBut Watford responded to level with a well-worked Andre Gray goal, with the forward drilling home a right-foot shot from Will Hughes' pass.\nHowever, the Hornets were punished for their wastefulness in front of goal with just three of their 23 shots finding the target.\nJavi Gracia's side, who sit bottom of the table, have now lost seven successive games in all competitions for the first time since 1999.\nReversal of fortunes for Watford\nAt the same stage last term Watford had collected nine points after an impressive start, but a pointless return this time around represents a complete reversal of fortune.\nWhile they did at least register their first goal of the campaign, manager Gracia appears to have problems at both ends of the pitch to contend with.\nDespite creating a multitude of opportunities, Gray's 17th-minute strike was all they had to show for their endeavour.\nGerard Deulofeu's influence as a creator was a plus, but he cannot be relied upon to be the prolific forward the club need to improve on last term's 11th-place finish.\nThe former Barcelona man had seven shots on goal, with only a close-range strike that hit the West Ham crossbar finding the target.\nIt was a chance, alongside Will Hughes' extraordinary miss from a yard out after Gray had squared the ball with the score at 1-1, that summed up the hosts' lack of potency in attack.\nAt the other end the presence of Haller, Anderson and Lanzini provided too much power, pace and guile for the Watford defence to cope with.\nGracia's side now face a challenging sequence of fixtures - with a home game against Arsenal sandwiched between trips to Newcastle and reigning champions Manchester City - having shipped 41 goals in their last 18 matches.\nHaller takes centre stage\nHaving arrived at West Ham after impressing at Utrecht and in the Bundesliga, there is a certain amount of expectation surrounding Haller.\nBut his first two goals and overall performance suggested that he has the attributes to justify his club record price tag.\nThe 25-year-old led the line in exemplary fashion and contributed to all three West Ham goals.\nHis work to chase down possession led to Lanzini winning the penalty that delivered their opener.\nThe former France Under-21 international then displayed his predatory instincts, holding his run to ensure he was well positioned to capitalise on Anderson's break down the left.\nThat allowed him to comfortably claim his first goal for Pellegrini's side before acrobatically doubling his tally.\n\"[Sebastien Haller's] goals were two very important goals for him,\" Pellegrini said.\n\"Coming to the Premier League is not easy. He had just one start in a difficult game against Man City, for a striker the most important thing is to score.\"\nMan of the match - Sebastien Haller (West Ham)\nNoble joins esteemed company - the stats\nWatford have lost four league matches at home in a row for the first time since a run of five between October and December 2013 in the Championship.\nWest Ham are undefeated in their last four away matches in the Premier League, winning three of those (D1) - they'd lost seven of their previous eight (D1).\nWest Ham are the first club to have had as many as 150 different goal-scorers in the Premier League, following Haller's first goal for the club.\nWatford had more shots against West Ham (23) than they managed in their first two games of the season combined (19).\nWatford's Gray has scored 13 Premier League goals since his debut for the Hornets - only Troy Deeney has scored more in this period (14).\nWest Ham's Noble has scored five Premier League goals against Watford - more than he has netted against any other side in the league.\nNoble has now scored 25 penalty goals in the Premier League - only Alan Shearer (56), Frank Lampard (43) and Steven Gerrard (32) have scored more in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nWatford host Coventry in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday 27 August (19:45 BST) before they visit Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday 31 August (15:00 BST).\nWest Ham visit Newport in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday 27 August (19:45 BST), before resuming their Premier league duties at home to Norwich on Saturday 31 August (15:00 BST)."

I don't think he's meant to do it, but it's one we can't defend.\n\"We tried to be positive with 10 men, but it was a tough task against a good Southampton team.\n\"We're at the start of this process together. It's about how we react to these moments and situations.\"\nLewis Dunk thought he had given the hosts the lead eight minutes after Andone's sending off, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside against defender Dan Burn.\nSubstitute Jurgen Locadia struck the post for Brighton late on, but Redmond slid home Sofiane Boufal's cross in second-half stoppage time to seal the win for the away side.\nSeagulls fade following Andone dismissal\nAfter narrowly avoiding relegation last season, Brighton have made a solid start to life under former Swansea City manager Potter.\nAn eye-catching 3-0 opening-day win at Watford was followed by a 1-1 home draw with West Ham, in which summer signing Leandro Trossard delivered a man-of-the-match display.\nThe Belgian was heavily involved early on at the Amex Stadium, teeing up Maupay whose tame effort was easily held by Southampton goalkeeper Angus Gunn.\nThe 24-year-old's in-swinging cross was headed wide by Montoya soon afterwards as Potter's side continued to turn the screw.\nHowever, the game swung the visitors' way when Andone was dismissed following a rash challenge that left Valery writhing in agony near the halfway line.\nThe Seagulls responded well initially, with Dunk's header chalked off by VAR, but Southampton capitalised on their numerical advantage in the second half.\nPotter's side almost equalised moments before Redmond's strike when Locadia latched onto Glenn Murray's flick-on, but the Dutchman sliced his effort against the frame of the goal as the Saints inflicted a first defeat on the new Brighton boss.\nDjenepo's instant impact\nSouthampton responded to their 3-0 reverse at Burnley on the opening day with a much-improved performance in defeat to Liverpool last weekend.\nHasenhuttl's side matched the European champions for large parts at St Mary's but failed to take their chances, with Danny Ings missing a glorious opportunity to equalise in second-half stoppage time.\nAt the Amex Stadium, the Saints failed to register a shot on target prior to Andone's red card, despite seeing plenty of the ball.\nIndeed, the closest they came to a breakthrough in the first half was when Redmond's low shot from the edge of the box was held by Mat Ryan.\nDjenepo, who made his debut for the club against Liverpool last weekend, replaced Valery eight minutes into the second half and his impact was almost instant, cutting in from the left and curling into the top corner just two minutes after entering the fray.\nSecond-half substitute Stuart Armstrong was thwarted by Ryan late on, but Redmond's strike - following fine play by Boufal - sealed the win as Southampton secured their first Premier League clean sheet since their 1-0 victory at Brighton in March.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond (Southampton)\nSaints continue dominance over Seagulls - the stats\nSouthampton have won each of their last three away games against Brighton in all competitions, keeping a clean sheet each time.\nBrighton have scored just eight goals in their last 14 Premier League home games, and never scored more than once in a match in that run.\nThree of the last four Premier League red cards shown by referee Kevin Friend have been to Brighton players (Shane Duffy v Crystal Palace, Anthony Knockaert v Bournemouth and Florin Andone today).\nMoussa Djenepo's goal for Southampton - his first in the Premier League - came with his first touch in the match and just 78 seconds after coming on as a second-half substitute.\nNo player has scored more Premier League goals for Southampton under Ralph Hasenhuttl than Nathan Redmond (7).\nSouthampton's Danny Ings has been directly involved in three goals in his last four Premier League games (1 goal, 2 assists), more than he had in his previous 11 in the competition (2).\n'The red card made it difficult' - what they said\nBrighton manager Graham Potter, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We started really well and created some opportunities. The red card made it difficult for the rest of the game.\n\"We started the second half well - we had attacks and won the ball back, but then they score.\n\"I was incredibly proud with the effort they put in. That's life sometimes.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to Match of the Day: \"There's no question it was a clear red card. I'm glad Yan Valery was not injured because it looked horrible.\n\"Sometimes we gave the ball away too easily. After two games you have no points so you have little confidence, but I still think we could have done better. This was an important win for us.\n\"Moussa Djenepo is very quick and hard to defend against - in the two games he's played he's made an impact as substitute.\"\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to Bristol Rovers in the EFL Cup on Tuesday 27 August (19:45 BST), before returning to Premier League action at champions Manchester City on Saturday 31 August (15:00 BST).\nSouthampton play Fulham at Craven Cottage in the EFL Cup on Tuesday before welcoming Manchester United to St Mary's in the Premier League the following Saturday (12:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 1-2 Leicester City\nSubstitute Harvey Barnes' majestic strike helped Leicester City inflict a first Premier League defeat of the season on Sheffield United in a pulsating affair at Bramall Lane.\nSix minutes after coming on, Barnes fired a half-volley from the edge of the box which flew past home keeper Dean Henderson to dampen what had been a spirited United fightback.\nThe superb finish came just eight minutes after the home side had cancelled out Jamie Vardy's first-half opener, when record signing Oliver McBurnie found a first goal for the club after coming off the bench.\nMcBurnie's header, low into the bottom corner, sent Bramall Lane into raptures and United appeared to have momentum.\nBut Barnes then lashed in to give Leicester a first league win of the season and Chris Wilder's side only their second defeat in 21 matches.\nRelive Leicester's win over Sheffield United\nSee the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nLeicester marry grit with class\nIn his own words, Barnes found a \"sweet connection\" from 18 yards to leave Henderson motionless and win the first ever Premier League meeting between the clubs.\nIt was perhaps harsh on Sheffield United who deservedly trailed at the break but showed an abundance of endeavour in the second half, notably from 54 minutes when Wilder introduced Billy Sharp and McBurnie.\nBut if Barnes' hit was classy, Leicester deserve praise for their grit in the face of the hosts' onslaught, with central defender Caglar Soyuncu proving outstanding all day and defensive midfielder Hamza Choudhury completing more interceptions than anyone else on the pitch.\nThe Foxes' opening goal underlined their mix of work-rate and class. Ayoze Perez robbed defender Chris Basham before James Maddison played a deft pass with the outside of his foot into space, allowing Vardy to race in and power home left footed.\nVardy - a boyhood Sheffield Wednesday fan - had been booed throughout and duly cupped his ears in celebration.\nHe had just eight first-half touches and 16 across the 94 minutes but with Maddison so crafty in finding space around him, Vardy always looked a threat.\nSince the beginning of last season, Maddison has created more chances than any other Premier League player and with England manager Gareth Southgate watching from the stands, he again served up an intelligent display.\nEffort is not enough for the Blades\nWilder summed up the defeat by stating his side got what they deserved and when quizzed on their admirable effort, he replied: \"I don't see why that should get an applause.\"\nIt was a harsh, if typically honest reflection from the 51-year-old.\nMatch of the Day commentator Alistair Mann highlighted the \"terrific noise\" generated inside Bramall Lane early on but aside from the long-range efforts from John Lundstram and George Baldock, the home side did little to repay their fans in the opening 45 minutes.\nThe Blades' passing accuracy at 75.5% was down by about 2% on last week's win over Crystal Palace and they could not find an attacking rhythm early on.\nSharp and McBurnie's introduction seemed to raise home spirits and suddenly Leicester's midfield of Choudhury, Youri Tielemans and Dennis Praet seemed unable to close spaces as quickly.\nBaldock's pin-point delivery allowed McBurnie to score - proving why the Blades paid Swansea \u00a320m for the striker. But after that goal, Leicester defended their penalty area stoutly.\nKeeper Kasper Schmeichel spectacularly denied McBurnie - though the effort was later flagged offside - and the home side then struggled to muster a moment of quality, even with former Manchester United midfielder Ravel Morrison introduced from the bench for his debut.\nIt proved a day of frustration for Wilder who concluded his side were not \"brave enough\".\nMan of the match - James Maddison\nThe Maddison-Vardy axis - key stats\nLeicester City have recorded consecutive league victories against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane for the first time since March 1965 under Matt Gillies.\nSheffield United are winless in their past seven matches against Leicester in all competitions (D2 L5), losing each of the past four in a row.\nSheffield United became the first Premier League side to name an all British/Irish starting XI in each of their first three games of a season since Wolves in 2011-12.\nJamie Vardy has scored 10 Premier League goals in 13 appearances since Brendan Rodgers' first game in charge of Leicester City in March, the first player to reach double figures in that time.\nFour of James Maddison's Premier League assists have been for Vardy - he has not assisted another Leicester team-mate more than once in the competition.\n'A lot to work on' - manager chat\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I didn't think we deserved anything from the game today. Out of possession it was far too comfortable for them and in possession we weren't brave enough and we turned it over too much.\n\"I think the better team won today. I'm not pleased with the effort because that is just bog standard. 'Cheers for effort' doesn't tick a box for me.\n\"If we keep giving the ball away to good players we are going to create bad situations. In both boxes they were better than us. There is a lot for us to work on.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We needed to be ready to fight and show resilience and it was an important three points for us. We had to change the system in the last 25 minutes to cope with the balls coming into the box.\n\"It is a very young group but they are all focused and doing well for me. It was fantastic technique for Harvey's goal and that kind of goal was worthy of being the winning goal.\"\nUp next?\nSheffield United go to Blackburn in the EFL Cup on Tuesday and Leicester travel to Newcastle in the competition a day later."

We were completely in charge of the game.\n\"We are not Disneyland, we do not need to excite everyone in every second.\"\n'Liability Luiz costs otherwise promising Arsenal'\nThe Gunners, the only other side in the top flight to win their first two games, had opportunities to shock Liverpool in a tight first half, especially when record \u00a372m signing Nicolas Pepe shot straight at keeper Adrian after running clear.\nLiverpool took control when Matip put them ahead with a powerful header from Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner four minutes before the interval.\nAnd any hopes manager Unai Emery had of watching his side mount a recovery were snuffed out in the 49th minute after a moment of madness from new signing David Luiz, who needlessly dragged Salah back in the area.\nLiverpool's Egyptian attacker drilled home the penalty and then embarrassed Luiz again out on the touchline at the start of a dazzling run that ended with a low, curling finish into the bottom corner just before the hour.\nArsenal substitute Lucas Torreira pulled one back late on, but nothing was getting in the way of Liverpool's 12th successive league victory, equalling their best sequence in the top flight under Kenny Dalglish between April and October 1990.\nLiverpool back in the old routine\nLiverpool had moments when they stuttered against Southampton and their defence has looked unusually fallible - but this was a movie we have seen many times before at Anfield under Jurgen Klopp.\nArsenal have suffered badly here in recent seasons, losing 5-1 last season and 4-0 in Arsene Wenger's final season. Once again, despite taking their time to hit top gear, Liverpool's ruthlessness and intensity simply proved too much for Arsenal.\nTrue, they gratefully accepted Luiz's gifts but once Matip put Liverpool ahead the pressure and intensity applied to Arsenal was simply too much for the Gunners to resist.\nAnd, as Arsenal discovered, when you fail to take chances to punish Liverpool, the inevitable outcome is that you will be punished yourselves.\nLiverpool do not simply have a prodigious work ethic that makes life permanently uncomfortable for opponents; they also have world-class attacking options as illustrated by Salah's brilliant weaving run and slide-rule finish for their third.\nKlopp's side missed out on the title by a single point despite only one loss, to champions Manchester City, last season - and three wins from three has quickly put the marker down that they intend to go one better and claim that first title in 30 years.\nLiability Luiz kills Arsenal chances\nLuiz has a track record of success that suggests he may be able to bring moments of quality to Arsenal's defence after his surprise \u00a38m move from Chelsea - but there is no escaping he has the enduring capability to be a complete liability.\nThe Brazilian, at 32, is not going to change and so it proved as he delivered a moment of crass stupidity that killed stone dead Arsenal's hopes of taking anything away from Anfield.\nIt is a stretch to say Arsenal had Liverpool on the ropes but, despite the overall domination of the European champions, the Gunners certainly had moments of threat through the pace and menace of Pepe and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. They would have started the second half with hope.\nLuiz made it all count for nothing when he felt his best method of dealing with Salah's 49th-minute raid into the penalty area was to blatantly drag him back by the shirt in a red-mist moment that did not even seriously require the intervention of the video assistant referee.\nSalah, despite some ludicrous protests from Luiz, drilled home the penalty before taking him to cleaners when scoring Liverpool's brilliant third.\nToo much of the Arsenal's playing out from the back was asking for trouble against this Liverpool side. Throw in the act of stupidity from Luiz and ultimately they got what they deserved, despite some areas for Emery to admire.\n\"We were doing some transitions very good and we had some chances but, in the second half, the penalty was very soft,\" Emery told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"After 2-0 our reaction was good. We needed to attack and take a different moment in the match. We are disappointed we lost 3-1 but watching some players we can be optimistic.\n\"We need to improve in possession and countering the pressure but Liverpool is the best team with this. We have to be realistic but we can fight closer to them.\"\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nArsenal's Liverpool woe - the stats\nSince Jurgen Klopp took over in October 2015, Liverpool have scored 26 goals in eight Premier League games against Arsenal - the most one side has netted against another in the competition in that period.\nOnly Everton at Arsenal (64) have conceded more away goals against a single opponent in the Premier League than Arsenal at Liverpool (62).\nArsenal have now failed to win any of their past 23 away league games against fellow 'Big six' sides (D8 L15) - during this run they have conceded 53 goals while keeping just one clean sheet.\nSince the start of last season, Arsenal have given away eight Premier League penalties - only Brighton (10) have faced more.\nLiverpool have scored 22 headed goals in the Premier League since the start of last season; seven more than any other side. The Reds have scored three in this campaign already, while no other side has scored more than one.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has faced Arsenal eight times without defeat in the Premier League (W5 D3).\nMohamed Salah has been directly involved in more Premier League goals against Arsenal than against any other side (eight; six goals and two assists). He has scored in all four of his home games against them.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold has assisted nine goals in his past 10 appearances at Anfield for Liverpool in all competitions, including assisting once in each of his past five competitive home games.\nNicolas Pepe has become the first player to successfully dribble past Virgil van Dijk in the Dutch defender's past 50 appearances in the Premier League, since Mikel Merino in March 2018 for Newcastle.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Burnley in their next Premier League fixture on Saturday, 31 August (17:30 BST).

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-3 Manchester City: Aguero double seals win for champions\nPep Guardiola hailed David Silva as \"one of the best players\" he has seen after he contributed to all three of Manchester City's goals in a convincing win at Bournemouth.\nOn landmark day for Silva, making his 400th appearance for City, he again demonstrated his enduring quality as the champions moved up to second in the Premier League, two points behind leaders Liverpool.\nThe 33-year-old began the move for Sergio Aguero's opener and then provided assists for Raheem Sterling and Aguero to add to the Blues' tally.\n\"He played incredibly well. David in this kind of game - with a defence so deep and with such few spaces - is so good,\" Guardiola said.\n\"He's one of the best players I've ever seen.\"\nDespite an occasional defensive lapse, it proved a largely comfortable afternoon City who quickly established control and went in front when Argentina forward Aguero turned Kevin de Bruyne's cross into the bottom left corner from eight yards.\nSterling then doubled their advantage with his fifth goal in as many matches, flicking a shot beyond Cherries keeper Aaron Ramsdale after a fine Silva pass.\nWhile Bournemouth rallied and substitute Harry Wilson's superb 25-yard free-kick raised hopes of a fight-back, Aguero pounced for City's third after more good work from Silva.\nThe 31-year-old emphatically finished from 10 yards to record his 400th career goal.\nIt ensured Bournemouth, who drop to 10th place, continued a miserable run against City that has seen them concede 28 times in their last nine league meetings.\nFollow all Sunday's Premier League action\nSilva sets the tone\nIf Sterling and Aguero were responsible for City's goals, it was Silva who set the tone for their victory as he reached his own personal milestone.\nWhile Sterling, 24, who scored his 11th goal against the Cherries, represents City's future, Silva almost 10 years his senior, is in his final season in Manchester.\nBut this performance showed his ability to carve open opposition defences - a talent that has underpinned a trophy-laden period - is still as priceless as ever.\nNicknamed 'Merlin' by the club's supporters, the 2010 World Cup winner initiated City's opening goal with a couple of neat passes to spread the ball wide before Aguero dispatched the simplest of finishes.\nHis brilliance then fashioned City's second.\nOperating in the space between midfield and attack, Silva swivelled to receive possession and delivered a sublime pass into the path of Sterling in one motion, allowing the England forward to poke the ball past Ramsdale from six yards.\nHis control looked to have drawn a penalty from Jefferson Lerma, however VAR deemed there was not enough evidence to overturn the original call from referee Andre Marriner not to award the spot-kick.\nNot that it mattered. Moments later Silva collected the ball on the left of the Cherries' penalty area and weaved away from two defenders before the ball broke to Aguero, to seal victory.\n'Howe can take heart'\nEddie Howe's side won just two of their 12 matches against top-six opponents last term and this was always going to be a particularly tough assignment for the Cherries who failed to register a shot in their 1-0 loss to Guardiola's side in March.\nThe sweltering south coast conditions probably did not help, as the hosts chased shadows in the first 30 minutes with City dominating possession.\nHowever, much of that could be attributed to Bournemouth's own errant passing and Howe was heartened his side responded and did not capitulate against the champions.\nThe Cherries even had a measure of control in the 10 minutes either side of half-time, when Charlie Daniels' knee injury prompted a reshuffle of personnel and the introduction of their scorer Wilson.\nHis effort that flew into the top-right corner was far from an isolated attempt at goal.\nNathan Ake miscued a volley after Steve Cook's long throw, while Adam Smith blazed a glorious chance over the City bar from six yards, after being presented with the ball by visiting defender Nicolas Otamendi.\nCallum Wilson also drew a save from Ederson as Bournemouth continued to press though, in the end, that proved scant consolation.\n\"We did have our chances and that's the frustrating thing,\" Howe said.\n\"Compare this game to our previous encounters against Manchester City, and that's the most we've created by a long way. We were a constant menace to them physically, but it was a really tough afternoon - we really had to dig in for long spells.\"\nMan of the Match - David Silva (Man City)\nBournemouth's City hoodoo - the stats\nManchester City have won all nine of their top-flight games against Bournemouth - the best 100% win record by a team over an opponent in top-flight history.\nBournemouth have lost four of their last seven home Premier League matches (W1 D2 L4), as many as in their previous 18 at the Vitality Stadium.\nMan City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne registered his 50th Premier League assist in his 123rd appearance, reaching the tally in the fewest number of games in the competition's history.\nSergio Aguero's second goal was his 400th career goal for club and country, with 235 of those coming for City.\nBournemouth's Harry Wilson became the youngest player (22 years & 156 days) to score in his first two Premier League appearances since Anthony Martial in September 2015 for Manchester United (19 years & 289 days).\nIn all competitions, City's Raheem Sterling has scored 11 goals against Bournemouth - more than any other opponent during his club career.\nCity's David Silva assisted twice in this game and has assisted more than once in 14 separate Premier League games - only Ryan Giggs and Cesc Fabregas have done so more often (17 games).\nAguero and Silva have combined for 27 Premier League goals - the only duos to combine for more are Thierry Henry and Robert Pires (29) and Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard (36).\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth host Forest Green in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday 28 August (19:45 BST) before travelling to Leicester in the Premier League, on Saturday 31 August (15:00 BST).\nManchester City are next in action when they welcome Brighton to Etihad Stadium in the Premier League, on Saturday 31 August (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-1 Burnley: Late Jimenez penalty rescues hosts\nRaul Jimenez scored a stoppage-time penalty to salvage a point for Wolves and deny Burnley victory at Molineux.\nAshley Barnes looked to have won it for the Clarets after pouncing from around 25 yards - his fourth goal in three Premier League games this season - against a disjointed Wolves side playing their third game inside a week.\nThe hosts beat Torino in a Europa League play-off match on Thursday after drawing with Manchester United last Monday, and their hectic schedule appeared to have caught up on them as they struggled for long periods.\nBurnley were denied a second goal when Rui Patricio produced an excellent save to keep out Chris Wood while Ben Mee headed against the bar with the rebound coming off Wolves defender Ryan Bennett and hitting the post.\nHowever, Wolves were awarded a penalty in the dying moments when Erik Pieters fouled Jimenez.\nAfter a video assistant referee check, Jimenez stepped up to calmly roll the ball past Nick Pope and earn Wolves a third successive Premier League draw.\nReaction from all Sunday's Premier League matches\nLate drama saves Wolves after hectic week\nThis was a big test for Wolves, who are on the cusp of qualifying for the group stage of the Europa League following a 3-2 first-leg victory over Torino in Turin.\nShould they complete the job against the Italians in Thursday's second leg, Nuno Espirito Santo's side face a testing schedule of Thursday-Sunday games.\nOn a hot sunny day in the Black Country against Burnley, they were flat, lacklustre and flaky for long periods, only coming alive in the closing stages.\nHaving come from behind to take a point off Manchester United before travelling to Italy, Wolves were facing a Burnley side who were refreshed and full of energy after a free week to prepare for the match.\nSix Wolves players - Patricio, Conor Coady, Willy Boly, Joao Moutinho, Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota - were making their third starts of the week, and Wolves were a shadow of the side that finished seventh in the Premier League last season.\nAn early dipping attempt from 25 yards by Ruben Neves was as close as they came to scoring in the first half, but having struggled for the first 80 minutes Wolves did step it up towards the end.\nWhen Jimenez rolled the ball invitingly across the six-yard area, there was no Wolves player to poke it home, while Nick Pope was forced to keep out a deflection off his own player Ben Mee before the late penalty drama.\nEncouragement for Burnley despite late twist\nBurnley's players were crestfallen at the final whistle - Jimenez' equaliser virtually the last kick of the game.\nThe Clarets had looked set for a second win of the season after a typically hard-working performance by Sean Dyche's side, and three points would have taken them up to third in the table.\nHaving peppered Arsenal's goal with 18 shots in the narrow 2-1 defeat at Emirates Stadium last week, they had another 13 attempts at Molineux.\nBarnes' early-season form has been a highlight for the Clarets and his cracking finish from distance past the diving Patricio had Burnley's travelling fans in raptures.\nBarnes and attacking partner Chris Wood hassled Wolves' defence throughout and it required a fine save by Patricio - after a long kick by Pope - to prevent the visitors from doubling their lead.\nIt was a critical moment in the game as Wolves went on to snatch a point from the jaws of defeat.\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski (Burnley)\n'We have to embrace it' - what they said\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"The boys worked very hard. Burnley are a very good team. The way they do things is so good. They score, they create chances. [Chris] Wood and [Ashley] Barnes hold the ball. It's a physical game they force from us, but the boys did well.\n\"The patience was about circulating the ball and still having patience and possession. I just told the boys it's the next step we have to take - managing the game when you are tired.\n\"We are very aware of the cycle that we have. We started competing on the 25 July. We have to embrace it and go again on Thursday.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We deserved to win the game. I thought we were out of the box sharp, we mixed the play enough to cause them problems. They didn't cause us too many problems.\n\"I'm not going to knock the players because their mentality is good. It was just taken away by a late decision.\n\"We're looking a different animal to last season, which is important at this early stage. There's a real good energy, some good quality and some good moments.\n\"They hit the post, to be fair, but I don't think they had too much today. Defensively we were very strong.\"\nSix in six starts for Jimenez - the stats\nWolves have drawn their first three games of a league campaign for the first time since 1938-39, when they finished second in the top flight.\nBurnley are winless in their last five away games at Wolves in the top flight (W1 D4), with their last such victory coming in September 1973.\nWolves are unbeaten in their last 10 home games in the Premier League (W6 D4); their longest run without defeat in the top flight since April to October 1979 (also 10 games).\nBurnley have only won one of the last five Premier League away games in which they've scored the opening goal (D3 L1), including none of the last three.\nWolves' equaliser in the 97th minute was just their second shot on target in the game, with their first coming in the 87th minute.\nWolves striker Raul Jimenez has scored six goals in six starts in all competitions this season, however this was his first in the Premier League this season.\nOnly Sergio Aguero (16) and Sadio Mane (15) have scored more Premier League goals than Burnley's Ashley Barnes (13) in 2019.\nJimenez' goal for Wolves after 96 minutes and 55 seconds was the latest scored in the Premier League since January 2017, when Alexis Sanchez netted after 97 minutes and 14 seconds for Arsenal against Burnley.\nBurnley midfielder Dwight McNeil has made six assists in the Premier League in 2019 - the only English player with more in this period is Trent Alexander-Arnold (11).\nWhat's next?\nThe games keep coming at a rapid rate for Wolves who take a 3-2 lead into Thursday's Europa League play-off second leg against Torino at Molineux (19:45 BST).\nBurnley are also in midweek cup action - against Sunderland in the second round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday (19:45 BST)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Newcastle United: Joelinton gives Steve Bruce first Newcastle win\nClub record signing Joelinton's first goal in English football gave Newcastle United a surprise win at Tottenham - and Steve Bruce his first Premier League points as their manager.\nThe Brazilian striker took advantage of sleepy Tottenham defending to control substitute Christian Atsu's through pass beautifully before drilling past Hugo Lloris.\nAtsu, sent on after Allan Saint-Maximin had to go off with an early hamstring injury, provided the assist with his first significant contribution.\nSpurs lacked the creativity to break down a resolute Newcastle side, whose four-man midfield spent a large chunk of the contest sitting deep in front of a back five.\nBruce hopes Newcastle win 'will shut a few people up'\nSon Heung-min, making his first Tottenham appearance of the season after completing a three-match suspension, saw a bouncing first-half volley beaten away by Martin Dubravka, then rolled a shot wide shortly before the interval.\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino sent on Christian Eriksen and Giovani lo Celso for the final half-hour in an attempt to salvage something from the 500th match of his managerial career.\nIt almost worked: Lo Celso's pass for Harry Kane ended with the England captain falling under Jamaal Lascelles' challenge - but Mike Dean ruled it was not a penalty, and was backed up by the check from video assistant referee (VAR) Anthony Taylor.\nThen Eriksen's superb diagonal pass gave Moussa Sissoko the room to cross low, but Lucas Moura skied his shot over the bar from around eight yards.\nSunday's Premier League reaction\nRobust Newcastle's perfect response\nNewcastle's fans have had to spend a fair amount on petrol money in the season's first three weeks - with a 516-mile round trip to Norwich last weekend followed up by this 560-mile round journey to north London.\nThey must have wondered why they had bothered going to Carrow Road, given a feeble display in a 3-1 defeat, with centre-back Paul Dummett later acknowledging that \"it wasn't right\" in the warm-up - and admitting that the players had to take responsibility.\nManager Bruce was looking for a lift after beginning his reign with two defeats - and his players provided it for that loyal travelling support.\nNewcastle produced a display of immense discipline in intense heat in north London, with Dummett and his fellow centre-backs Jamaal Lascelles and Fabian Schar working themselves into the ground.\nIt was not just the defenders who toiled, though - striker Joelinton showed he was willing to help at both ends of the field by getting back to heard away two early Erik Lamela corners, and he ran himself to the point of exhaustion, eventually coming off in the final moments with apparent cramp.\nThe visitors had only 20% possession, and had to absorb plenty of early Tottenham pressure, but it was a sign of how well they did that Tottenham managed just two shots on target.\nNewcastle had the game's first shot on goal, with Sean Longstaff's rising drive tipped away by Lloris after Joelinton had held up the ball for him.\nBruce was not thrown by the early injury to French winger Saint-Maximin, who pulled up in the first 15 minutes after chasing a Matt Ritchie free-kick that ran out of play.\nNewcastle's manager will have been pleased that his players showed such a willingness to work for the cause - a characteristic that will be vital in the months ahead.\nSon cannot find the spark\nTottenham have conceded the first goal in all three of their Premier League matches this season - but while they recovered to beat Aston Villa and draw at Manchester City, they could not fight back here.\nThey may well have had a case for a 78th-minute penalty as Lascelles leaned across Kane as they chased Lo Celso's pass; with VAR official Taylor deciding to back referee Dean's original decision.\nBut Spurs did not do anywhere near enough to pick holes in Newcastle's blanket defence until time was running out. They failed to register a single shot on goal until the 33rd minute, when Son was denied by Dubravka.\nThe South Korean forward was given a sign of just how tough an afternoon he would have when a promising second-minute run down the left was snuffed out by Emil Krafth, the Newcastle right-wing back.\nOn the occasions when Son managed to get past Krafth, he then found Schar blocking his path.\nPerhaps if Moura had not steered wide when Dubravka missed Kane's cross right on half-time, Tottenham would have had the platform on which to build a victory.\nBut then if Eriksen had played from the start, Spurs maybe would not have found themselves still chasing an equaliser as time ran out.\nThe Dane, whose contract expires at the end of this season, has made it clear he wants a new challenge - but while he remains a Tottenham player, the question for Pochettino is: Why not make full use of him?\nMan of the match - Paul Dummett (Newcastle)\nWhat they said\nMauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I am very disappointed with the result and the performance. We conceded a cheap goal and it is not easy to come back after that.\n\"You need the capacity to step up in this type of situation but we didn't show that quality today. When the ball arrives in the last third you need something from the talent and quality we have there and today we didn't have that.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We needed a bit of courage and thankfully the players had that from the first whistle. We have tried to quieten the storm. Hopefully that will shut a few people up a little bit. After two games, it's been hard to get that criticism. We have had to ride it.\n\"I hope that gives us a little a bit of time. It is only the first win but we have seen some big performances today. They only thing you can do is show that it means something to play for the club.\"\nOn Joelinton's winning goal: \"A lot of the players have only been here for a matter of weeks and it takes time to get used to the Premier League. I am delighted that Joelinton got the goal today. We played him a lot better today, it worked and he will be delighted to get the goal.\"\nSo much possession, so little to show for it - the key facts\nTottenham had 79.8% possession, the second-highest figure for a losing side in the Premier League since those records began in 2003-04 - behind only Liverpool's 80.4% against Burnley in August 2016\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino marked his 500th match as a manager in all competitions (W231 D112 L157), with this his first defeat against Newcastle since May 2016 (5-1).\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce (five) became the sixth manager in Premier League history to register a victory with five or more different teams after Alan Pardew (five), Harry Redknapp (five), Mark Hughes (six), Roy Hodgson (five) and Sam Allardyce (seven).\nBruce recorded his first away win against Spurs in the Premier League, ending a run of nine games without victory (D2 L7).\nSpurs' Harry Kane has scored in just two of his nine Premier League appearances versus Newcastle and had the fewest touches of any home player to start this match (24).\nNewcastle registered their first away Premier League win against 'big six' opposition since December 2015, when they beat Spurs 2-1; it ending a run of 15 such matches without a victory (D1 L14).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle are in Carabao Cup action at home to Leicester on Wednesday (19:45 BST) before Watford visit them in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00). Tottenham have a clear week to prepare for the big north London derby at Arsenal next Sunday (16:30)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-1 Man Utd: Jannik Vestergaard header earns 10-man Saints a point\nJannik Vestergaard's towering header gave 10-man Southampton a point after another moment of magic from Manchester United new boy Daniel James looked to have put them on course for victory at St Mary's.\nJames scored his third Premier League goal in four appearances with a fierce, rising right-foot drive after only 10 minutes, and the 21-year-old Wales attacker was the biggest threat for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.\nSaints, however, gained momentum in the second half as a disappointing United side grew increasingly sloppy, and Vestergaard capped a spell of pressure with the equaliser just before the hour.\nChe Adams had blazed wide of an open goal and David de Gea had saved superbly from Danny Ings before the giant figure of Vestergaard rose to meet Kevin Danso's fine cross.\nIt proved the high point of Danso's afternoon as he was then sent off for a crude lunge at Scott McTominay when he was already on a yellow card, leaving referee Mike Dean with an easy decision.\nUnited, predictably, laid siege to Southampton's goal in the closing stages but were kept out as keeper Angus Gunn saved superbly from Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood, while both Jesse Lingaard and Ashley Young were just off target.\nIt leaves the Old Trafford side with only one win from four league games, the opening-day win against Chelsea being followed by draws here and at Wolves and that home defeat by Crystal Palace.\nMan Utd already seeking crumbs of comfort\nUnited lack quality & killer touch\nFew tears were shed when Manchester United said their farewells to expensive attacking failures Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, departed for Inter Milan permanently and on loan respectively.\nIt was ironic, then, that a lack of killer touch by those left behind saw United leave St Mary's with just a point after taking charge of most of the first half and mounting an assault on Southampton's goal following Danso's dismissal.\nJames mixed the dangerous and the erratic after his brilliant goal but looks a real talent, with pace to burn and end product - the same could not be said for the disappointing Rashford.\nSolskjaer will rightly point to the late heroics of Gunn and several other near misses but their chance of victory suffered its biggest blow when they lost any semblance of control early in the second half and allowed the hosts, always determined under Ralph Hasenhuttl, back into the game, culminating in Vestergaard's header.\nJuan Mata had little influence, while Paul Pogba produced the sort of display that frustrates so many, conceding possession countless times and his efforts paling in comparison to those of the likes of James and McTominay.\nUnited's recent record is dismal, reading just two wins in their past 13 games and with no away victories since Paris St-Germain were beaten in the Champions League in March.\nThere is plenty for Solskjaer to ponder - and work on.\nHasenhuttl joy as Saints show fight\nSaints boss Hasenhuttl's reaction at the final whistle showed exactly what this point meant to him and his side.\nThe Austrian punched the air in delight, hugged counterpart Solskjaer then delivered a few more clenched-fist salutes before making his way around the pitch taking the adulation of the home fans.\nIt may only have been a draw but his delight was understandable. Hasenhuttl must have feared the worst when Danso's reckless lunge at McTominay left his side at a numerical disadvantage and at United's mercy.\nGoalkeeper Gunn played his part, while bravery and last-ditch defending answered other emergency calls. It was exactly what Southampton's manager and supporters wanted to see.\nIt also means Saints can look back at a good week, with a win away at Brighton, victory at Fulham in the Carabao Cup and a creditable draw here after opening with defeats at Burnley and at home to Liverpool.\nMan of the match - Oriol Romeu (Southampton)\nUnited's winless away run goes on - the stats\nSouthampton are winless in nine home Premier League matches against Manchester United (D4 L5), although this is the first time they have avoided defeat in consecutive home games against them since January 1998.\nIn the past three Premier League games between Southampton and Man Utd, the team scoring first has failed to win each time (D2 L1).\nManchester United have collected five points in their opening four Premier League games this season (W1 D2 L1), last picking up fewer in their first four games of a Premier League campaign in 1992-93 (four points).\nManchester United are winless in eight away matches in all competitions (D3 L5), their worst run since going nine without a win between April and November 2014.\nJames has scored three goals in his first four Premier League matches for United - as many as he scored in his final 22 Championship appearances for Swansea.\nVestergaard scored his first Premier League goal for Southampton in his 27th league appearance for the club, becoming the third Danish player to score for the Saints in the Premier League, after Ronnie Ekelund and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.\nSouthampton defender Danso is the first player to get an assist and be sent off in a Premier League game since Paul Pogba in December 2017 for United against Arsenal.\nBefore Danso, the last player to be sent off in their first home Premier League appearance was Yannick Sagbo for Hull City in August 2013.\n'Daniel James is fantastic' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BT Sport: \"We showed good mentality today after the red card. It was not easy. But with all the hard work, a man less and a third game in a week it is an unbelievable performance mentality from my team. I can only raise my hat to them. It was fantastic today.\n\"In the first half we showed a really intense performance. There was one action where we went 1-0 down. The players believe in what we are trying to do and showed they are always trying to be positive. That was the key to the success today.\"\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We need some scrappy goals as well. We should have won today - we had the game where we wanted it [but] we were careless in our finishing and our last pass.\n\"We built pressure, we got round them, created good openings but the clinical edge wasn't there. We should have won, again.\n\"Daniel James is fantastic - he has a great attitude, he wants to learn, he is hungry. He is at the start of his career but with his habits he will have a good one. We want to help him become the finished article.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to Sheffield United in their first game after the international break on Saturday 14 September (15:00 BST), while United welcome Leicester City to Old Trafford at the same time."

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 1-1 Watford: Will Hughes scores as Hornets take a point\nWill Hughes' early goal helped Watford secure their first Premier League point of the season with a battling draw at Newcastle.\nThe Hornets stay bottom of the table but a spirited performance at St James' Park ended a run of three consecutive defeats at the start of the new campaign.\nIn a game of few clear-cut chances, Hughes steered the opening goal into the bottom left corner from 10 yards after just 78 seconds following a deflected Tom Cleverley shot.\nDefender Fabian Schar equalised four minutes before the break, guiding a 10-yard left-foot shot past Ben Foster after the ball fell into his path from Isaac Hayden's knockdown.\nThe point lifts Steve Bruce's Newcastle up to 14th in the table going into the international break.\nFollow all the latest from Saturday's Premier League games\nWatford's revamped approach\nAfter a barren start to the season in which his side had conceded seven times, Watford manager Javi Gracia adjusted both the shape and personnel of the team for their trip to the north east.\nGerard Deulofeu - Gracia's most creative player in their defeat by West Ham - was consigned to the substitutes' bench as the Hornets fielded three central defenders.\nAnd, while that conservative approach was far from easy on the eye at times, Watford did at least appear disciplined in executing Gracia's gameplan.\nSitting deep for long periods, the visitors looked content to concede possession in front of them and counter quickly.\nAll three of their shots on target came in that manner and the approach nearly provided them with the cushion of a second goal before Newcastle equalised - Kiko curling a right-foot shot just over the bar, and Andre Gray failing to hit the target from close range after being found expertly by Roberto Pereyra.\nNewcastle lack sparkle\nWith injury depriving Bruce of first-choice wingers Allan Saint-Maximin and Matt Ritchie, the hosts toiled for significant periods.\nAnd their performance did little to enthuse the 44,157 crowd, which was well below last season's average of 51,121.\nSean Longstaff's distribution from central midfield was errant throughout - his passing accuracy was below 80% - while Christian Atsu, who impressed at Tottenham, and Miguel Almiron were initially on the periphery.\nIt was a performance devoid of sparkle, though they did improve after taking an old-fashioned route to their equalising goal, which came with their first shot on target.\nSwedish full-back Emil Krafth's lofted ball into the Watford penalty area found its way to Schar, and his goal galvanised his side.\nHayden's rasping drive forced Foster into a superb saved after the break, and substitute Yoshinori Muto and Schar also had chances to grab all three points.\nMan of the match - Tom Cleverley (Watford)\n'I live under pressure' - what they said\nWatford manager Javi Gracia speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"After scoring the first goal and dominating they score at the end of the half and we suffered in the second half.\n\"I think it's a good point. I live under pressure. It's my job. We try to always do our best, work hard, change the dynamic and look to the next game to get the victory for us. I think the supporters want to win.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We are disappointed we didn't nick it in the end because we had a couple of really good chances in the second half. We had a 15-20-minute spell where we looked likely to score and unfortunately we didn't take the big opportunities.\n\"Considering we were 1-0 down after a minute, I thought we responded in the right way.\"\nOn the Magpies start to the season: \"It's probably level par especially when you think we've had Tottenham and Arsenal in there. You would accept it. We had a wonderful opportunity to get six (points) today. We've had a really good week. We played well last week and in midweek and did enough to win the game today.\"\nNewcastle's recovery act - the stats\nNewcastle have lost two of their 10 top-flight home games against Watford (W5 D3).\nWatford are without a win in eight Premier League matches (D2 L6), their longest streak since an 11-game run between November 2006 and January 2007.\nWatford have picked up just one point from their opening four Premier League games, their lowest tally at this stage of a season since 2006-07 (also one), when they were relegated under Aidy Boothroyd.\nSince the start of 2019, Newcastle have won seven points from losing positions at St James' Park in the Premier League; only Tottenham and West Ham (both eight) have recovered more after going behind on home soil this year.\nHughes' opener was Watford's second fastest goal in the Premier League - Etienne Capoue scored after 32 seconds against Leicester in November 2016.\nNewcastle are the first side Hughes has scored more than one Premier League goal against, with both of his goals in the competition against the Magpies coming at St. James' Park (the first was in November 2017)\nSince the start of 2019, Schar has scored five Premier League goals, more than any other current Newcastle player. Four of those have come at St. James' Park.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle's next Premier League match is on Saturday, 14 September when they travel to Anfield to face Liverpool (12:30 BST).

        "article_text": "Leicester 3-1 Bournemouth: Jamie Vardy magic helps see off Cherries\nJamie Vardy scored twice and made the other as an impressive Leicester maintained their unbeaten Premier League start by easing past Bournemouth at King Power Stadium.\nBrendan Rodgers' side have won two and drawn two of their opening four games, showcasing their early ambitions of breaking into the top six at the end of the season with another excellent showing.\nVardy's opener was simple, yet stunning. He latched on to Ben Chilwell's punt into the left channel, took a touch before lobbing a perfectly-executed finish over Aaron Ramsdale.\nHis hard work for Youri Tielemans' goal for 2-1 epitomised his display, rolling the ball across the six-yard box for the Belgium international to tuck home from a yard out.\nBournemouth were lacklustre at best with Callum Wilson equalising for 1-1 with their only real chance of note.\nAt this early stage in the season, Leicester look well set in third position, while Bournemouth drop to 15th.\nFollow all the Premier League reaction\nRe-live text commentary of Leicester v Bournemouth\nLeicester signal ambitions\nWith Manchester United, who finished sixth last season, dropping further points with a 1-1 draw at Southampton, Leicester look like a side who could realistically claim a European spot next season.\nRodgers' side were in control throughout the contest, with defender Caglar Soyuncu impressing once more with another assured showing at the back - the Turkey international made more passes (82) and more tackles (five) than any other player on the pitch.\nIn midfield, Wilfred Ndidi returned to the side and was at his destructive best once more with an all-action performance, while the ever-maturing James Maddison, called up to the England squad this week, showed his defensive capabilities by gaining possession eight times.\nLeicester could have had more but Harvey Barnes and Soyuncu both curled efforts narrowly wide from promising positions.\nBut it was up front where the real star of the show was for Leicester.\nVardy runs Cherries ragged\nRodgers has implemented a quick, passing style of play for Leicester, but the performance against Bournemouth was a throwback to the unforgettable 2015-16 season in which they famously won the Premier League title under Claudio Ranieri.\nThe Foxes bypassed the midfield at every opportunity, knocking the ball long towards the willing runner in Vardy in the final third. It worked a treat.\nThe former England international gave Cherries centre-backs Steve Cook and Chris Mepham a torrid afternoon and every chase and closing down of the defenders was roared approvingly by the boisterous home supporters.\nVardy's opener was simple, yet stunning. He latched on to Ben Chilwell's punt into the left channel, took a touch before lobbing a glorious finish over Aaron Ramsdale.\nThe visiting goalkeeper, making just his fourth top-flight appearance having spent last season on-loan at League One AFC Wimbledon, was also given an equally uncomfortable afternoon and looked extremely shaky when presented with the ball at his feet.\nOn one occasion, Ramsdale thought he had more time as Vardy darted into the box and stuck out a foot to a short pass, which fortunately rolled straight back into the hands of the keeper.\nVardy stung Ramsdale's hands with a thumping drive from the edge of the area and it was his industry, not giving up on a loose ball, which allowed for the second, rolling the ball across the six-yard area for Tielemans to tuck home.\nAnd the outstanding Vardy added to his tally in the second period by converting Tielemans' low drive, with the home supporters left chanting their hero's name.\nTielemans, though, looked fortunate to stay on the pitch and might not have had the chance to grab his goal after a nasty-looking over-the-top challenge onto the ankle of Callum Wilson. Despite a VAR check, Tielemans did not receive a yellow card.\nBournemouth not given a sniff\nBournemouth finished 14th in the league last season, losing half of their 38 games, and this looks like being another inconsistent season for them.\nEddie Howe's side were barely given a sniff by the hosts, former Coventry striker Wilson evading the offside trap to score just three minutes after Vardy's opener, but they were unable to build on it.\nOn-loan midfielder Harry Wilson, who has made a positive start in a red-and-black shirt, failed to engineer any opportunities before being brought off on 64 minutes, while Joshua King was also quiet.\nSummer signing Philip Billing and Jefferson Lerma put themselves about in the middle of the park, but Bournemouth lack a creative spark.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\n'We were worthy winners' - Rodgers\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"There's a long long way to go. It's been a very good start for us. They've been working hard - third game of the week.\n\"I'm so, so proud of them. They gave so much - against a very good side.\n\"We were worthy winners I felt.\n\"Vardy is a top-class striker. From the day I walked though the door he's been amazing - it was a difficult goal today - on the bounce, his connection and finish.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"There were bits in the first half we were pleased with. The goals killed us - from the first to the third. We've gifted them goals. It gave us a mountain to climb.\n\"I had a good view of the Tielemans challenge on Callum Wilson - it looked a bad one.\n\"Those moments do have a bearing on the result. Not the referee's fault we conceded three.\n\"The last two games we conceded three apiece. Against Manchester City it's going to be difficult but today we didn't do our jobs.\"\nVardy shines under Rodgers\nLeicester have won five of their last eight Premier League home games (D2 L1), as many as they had in their previous 20 at the King Power Stadium (W5 D6 L9).\nSince the start of last season, Bournemouth's Premier League games have seen more goals than other sides have in the competition (139 - F61 A78), with only Fulham conceding more top-flight goals than the Cherries in that time.\nThis was Rodgers' 500th competitive game as a manager - he's won all five of his meetings with Bournemouth.\nBournemouth pair Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson have combined for 13 Premier League goals since the start of last season, at least five more than any other duo in that time.\nVardy has been directly involved in 14 goals in 14 Premier League games under Rodgers (12 goals, two assists).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester are at Manchester United on Saturday, 14 September (15:00 BST), whole Bournemouth host Everton the following day at 14:00."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 2-0 Norwich City: Sebastien Haller scores third Hammers goal in routine win\nWest Ham United boss Manuel Pellegrini says striker Sebastien Haller is a \"complete player\" after he scored a third goal in two games during their win against Norwich City.\nThe Frenchman had scored twice against Watford leading into the game against the Canaries and struck midway through the first half on Saturday.\nHaller gave the Hammers the lead with an easy finish from close range after a low cross from the left wing by Arthur Masuaku before Andriy Yarmolenko wrapped up the win in the second half.\n\"He scores goals but works a lot for the team as well. He will continue improving in every game.\" Pellegrini said following the match.\n\"Sebastien is a complete player.\"\nAs it happened: West Ham United 2-0 Norwich City\nWest Ham's victory lifted them to fifth while Norwich suffered a third defeat in four league games and have now conceded more goals (10) than anyone else in the Premier League this season.\nDespite going in 1-0 down at the break, Norwich fared well against an organised West Ham side, with Todd Cantwell coming closest to inspiring a quick equaliser.\nAfter Max Aarons put a fine run into the box, beating several West Ham markers in the process, he delivered a chipped ball to Cantwell who headed over the bar from close range.\nThe visitors' task was made harder on 36 minutes when captain Christoph Zimmermann was forced off through injury following a robust tackle from Haller.\nIbrahim Amadou replaced him, having only made his debut in their midweek Carabao Cup defeat by Crawley Town, and the inexperience showed as the hosts dominated the second half.\nYarmolenko went on to double West Ham's advantage as he found the net with a left-footed volley after Norwich failed to clear.\nDespite the visitors' best efforts, the Hammers did well to cancel out Norwich's prolific goalscorer Teemu Pukki to complete what was ultimately a routine win against the newly promoted side.\nThe Hammers' fine turnaround\nWest Ham's win marks a change in fortunes from last season for Manuel Pellegrini's side, who might have anticipated another tough start to a campaign after their heavy defeat by Manchester City on the opening day.\nAt this point last season, the Hammers were bottom of the Premier League without a point and had conceded 10 goals in four league games.\nBut since that opening 5-0 loss to the champions, Pellegrini has guided his side to a draw at Brighton, a win against Watford and a midweek Carabao Cup victory over Newport County, before seeing off the Canaries in some comfort.\nNorwich did well to dictate the flow of the game in the early stages of both halves, but Haller's 24th-minute goal shifted the game in favour of the hosts.\nThe Frenchman, who signed from Eintracht Frankfurt for a club record \u00a345m in the summer, got on the scoresheet again after his double against Watford as he linked up with Masuaku to poke home.\nThe Hammers fielded pressure from Norwich afterwards, but they rarely looked in danger even before Yarmolenko's impressive second-half volley doubled their lead.\nThis was a performance to inspire confidence in front of West Ham's vociferous home support and their side now look in better shape than they did this time just 12 months ago.\nNorwich's tough start continues\nNorwich have had a week to forget. After home defeat by Chelsea last Saturday and an EFL Cup exit at Crawley in midweek, they struggled to find an answer to the hosts' fine defensive performance.\nThat loss to Chelsea followed a comfortable 3-1 win over Newcastle, but the promise shown in that game appears to be quickly wearing thin.\nPukki, who came into the game with five goals in three games, had an uncharacteristically quiet match and Norwich were short of answers once the hosts took the lead.\nAnd the loss of Zimmermann left a hole in defence that the Hammers easily exploited through the match.\nIn the end, the loss could have been heavier, goalkeeper Tim Krul saving Manuel Lanzini's close-range header before making a fine save from Anderson soon after.\nMan of the match - Andriy Yarmolenko\n'I'm a friend of VAR but on this day it didn't work'- what they said\nWest Ham goalscorer Sebastien Haller: \"I'm a striker and it's really important to get confidence and score goals. The Premier League is not easy, it is quite tough and intense. I try and adapt and do everything to get good information. It is really good for our confidence going into the international break with a win.\"\nNorwich City head coach Daniel Farke told Match of the Day: \"At this level small details cost. This is a game where VAR didn't work. There was a nasty tackle against my centre-back [Christoph Zimmermann] and it wasn't even given as a free-kick. Then a few minutes later my centre-back wasn't able to spring back and block the cross [for West Ham's first goal]. My centre-back is now in hospital. My feeling was this made the difference.\n\"I'm not claiming for red cards, it is up to the VAR to judge it. The only thing I say is that my centre-back is in hospital and the other player is on the shoulders of the West Ham goalscorer. I'm a friend of VAR but on this day it didn't work.\"\nWest Ham keep up fine form - the stats\nWest Ham remain unbeaten in their past nine home games against Norwich in all competitions (W5 D4), scoring 19 goals and conceding nine in this run.\nNorwich have lost three consecutive matches in all competitions for only the second time under Daniel Farke, and the first since they lost four in succession in November 2017.\nWest Ham have won seven points from their opening four league games this season (W2 D1 L1); it took them seven games to reach this tally in 2018-19 (W2 D1 L4), having lost each of their first four such games last term.\nWest Ham have won six of their past eight games across all competitions (D1 L1), as many as their previous 20 matches combined beforehand (W6 D4 L10).\nS\u00e9bastien Haller is only the fourth player to score as many as three goals in his first three Premier League appearances for West Ham, after Trevor Sinclair, Ian Wright and Demba Ba.\nAndriy Yarmolenko scored his third Premier League goal for West Ham, 349 days after he scored his first two for the club against Everton in September 2018.\nEach of Arthur Masuaku's six Premier League assists for West Ham has been for different players (Antonio, Kouyat\u00e9, Sakho, Arnautovic, P\u00e9rez, Haller).\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to the West Midlands following the international break as they take on Aston Villa on Monday, 16 September (20:00 BST).\nNorwich face reigning champions Manchester City at Carrow Road two days earlier on Saturday, 14 September (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-2 Sheffield United: Blades 'are not day trippers' says Wilder\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said his side are \"not day trippers\" after they battled back from two goals down to snatch a point at Stamford Bridge.\nChelsea were 2-0 up by half-time after striker Tammy Abraham struck twice, but Kurt Zouma's late own goal ensured a draw following Callum Robinson's strike in the first minute of the second half.\nThe result puts the visitors, who finished second in the Championship last season, into eighth in the Premier League table, one place above Chelsea.\n\"Three years ago we were bottom of League One and now we have come away from Chelsea with a result,\" said Wilder. \"We are not day trippers getting autographs and collecting shirts.\"\nA spill by United keeper Dean Henderson when under pressure from Christian Pulisic gave Abraham the chance for his first, and a mistake in the United defence allowed the Chelsea striker the opportunity for his second.\nBut the Blades pulled one back in the first minute of the second half when Robinson, who had missed from close range in the first half, scored his first since joining the club from Preston in the summer.\nFollow all the Premier League action\nRelive Chelsea v Sheffield United\nChelsea struggled to threaten after Henderson made a brilliant save in the second half to deny Abraham a hat-trick.\nAnd United pulled level after 89 minutes when Robinson's cross towards substitute Lys Mousset was diverted into his own net by the unlucky Zouma, to leave Frank Lampard still searching for a first home win since he became Chelsea manager.\nYoung Blues good start undone\nAfter a loss and a draw in their first two league games, Chelsea's 3-2 win at Norwich last week had finally given Lampard the result that he felt his side had deserved based on their performances from the start of the season.\nAnd Lampard named the youngest Chelsea starting 11 in the Premier League era with an average age of 24 years and 158 days, including Canadian defender Fikayo Tomori, who made his first start for the club, three years after a sole substitute appearance in the Premier League that was followed by loans at Brighton, Hull and Derby.\n\"The emergence of youth is one thing but winning games is another,\" said Lampard. \"When you are 2-0 up at half-time you should win the game.\"\nA flat second-half display undermined the good work of earlier, especially by Abraham.\nThe 21-year-old was quick to react to Henderson's mistake, which allowed him a sharp chance from six yards for his first.\nAnd he was equally alert when Jack O'Connell and John Egan conspired to give him the opportunity to fire the ball home from the edge of the box off Henderson's hand and just inside the post.\nThe home crowd became increasingly edgy, which seemed to transfer to their team and it came as little surprise when Sheffield United equalised.\n\"If we can't go on and get a third goal that's something we have to work on, this is the Premier League, it's ruthless,\" Lampard added. \"At 2-0 up you have to take advantage of it.\"\nRacist abuse of Zouma criticised by Lampard\nZouma's own goal led to the 24-year-old becoming the latest Premier League player to be racially abused on social media.\nThe criticism of the Frenchman on Twitter followed recent incidents where team-mate Abraham and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba were abused on the social media platform.\nLampard had said social media companies needed to do more to combat racism following the Abraham incident, and the Chelsea manager reiterated his opinion following the abuse of Zouma.\n\"Firstly it is a person that does it, wherever they are hiding from, and secondly we have to look at social media and the platforms and give them some accountability to actually have people register who can be chased down for it,\" said Lampard.\n\"Until there is some culpability, anyone can say anything to anyone. It's not just racism, it could be calling them names, homophobia, sexism, it could be anything.\"\nBlades 'need to believe more' says Wilder\nWilder had not been impressed by his side's efforts in their 2-1 defeat by Leicester in their previous league outing, saying he \"didn't see why they should get applause\" from the Bramall Lane crowd.\nCompare and contrast with this week, when the manager and his players celebrated this hard-won point on the pitch in front of their fans after the final whistle.\n\"I believe in the players more than they do sometimes,\" Wilder reflected. \"We've gone toe-to-toe with a really good side.\"\nThe half-time scoreline was not a fair reflection on United, who had looked threatening in their rare attacks before the break.\nChris Basham miscued a shot a long way wide after a neat United move, and Robinson missed with a low header when free inside the six-yard area.\nBut the striker's first goal for the Blades changed the momentum of the game at just the right time, and helped deflate the home side and their supporters.\nA lack of Premier League experience compared to Chelsea counted for nothing, and Wilder's side showed the value of taking chances when they come along by scoring with their only on-target efforts of the match.\nMan of the match - Callum Robinson (Sheffield United)\n'We're not here to collect shirts' - what they said\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder: \"It's a great result for us. We gave away really poor goals. You can't give teams like Chelsea a two-goal start and think everything is OK. Dean Henderson should have done better for the first goal but he's made a great save to keep us in it.\n\"I am biased but I believe we deserve something from today.\n\"It's been a great start, we can enjoy a night out tonight. We are here to compete.\"\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard: \"It was under control, it is our fault for gifting them a goal in the first minute of the second half. It's a similar story already.\n\"We had more than enough on the pitch to win that game from 2-0 up. There is no chance that that game should swing like that. We gave them the possibility to hurt us.\n\"We have to take responsibility, we allowed that to happen. It was on us to take the game away from them and we allowed them to get back into it.\"\nThe stats\nThe last three occasions that Chelsea have failed to win a Premier League game having led by 2+ goals have come against newly promoted teams (Sheff Utd in Aug 2019, Reading and Southampton in Jan 2013).\nYorkshire teams have won only one of their last 26 Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge (W1 D9 L16), with Leeds United winning 2-0 in December 1999.\nSheffield United have won five points from their four Premier League games this season - only in 1993-94 (6) have they had a better start in the competition.\nKurt Zouma is the first Chelsea player to concede an own goal at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League since John Terry in January 2016 v Everton.\nChelsea's Tammy Abraham has scored more goals than any other English player in the top two tiers since the start of last season (including play-offs), netting 30 in the process.\nAbraham is the first Englishman to score at least two goals in consecutive Premier League appearances for Chelsea since Frank Lampard in January 2010.\nEach of Chelsea's last six Premier League goals have been scored by English players (Abraham 4, Mount 2), the first time this has happened for the Blues (excluding own goals) since October 2011 (seven - Sturridge 3, Lampard 3, Terry).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea visit Molineux to take on Wolves when the Premier League returns after the international break, kicking off at 15:00 BST on Saturday 14 September. The Blades host Southampton at Bramall Lane on the same date with the same start time."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 4-0 Brighton & Hove Albion\nSergio Aguero was labelled a \"special talent\" by Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola after the Argentine hit two goals against Brighton, continuing his record of scoring in all four of his team's Premier League games this season.\nAguero, who has scored with each of his last seven shots on target in the top-flight, also provided the assist for substitute Bernardo Silva to score as the champions eased to victory.\n\"Of course we need his goals, everybody knows it. But even the days he doesn't score, with the commitment - he is like this from day one so I'm happy for him,\" said Guardiola after the long-serving Argentine, who has been at the club since 2011, took his tally for the season to six.\n\"He is a special talent who I love from day one. We change many things, but from day one I am delighted about his commitment.\"\nKevin de Bruyne had opened the scoring from close range with the Premier League's quickest goal of the season just 68 seconds after kick-off, before Aguero finished off a free-flowing move to double the lead.\nHe made it 3-0 with a sumptuous finish from the edge of the penalty area following half-time, then Silva completed the scoring with his second touch after replacing David Silva.\nHowever, City lost French defender Aymeric Laporte to injury. The former Athletic Bilbao player was carried off on a stretcher after a collision with Adam Webster and was taken to hospital.\nLaporte carried off in Brighton game\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nRuthless City show no mercy\nCity have scored 14 goals in their first four matches of this campaign.\nHaving hit five against West Ham on the opening weekend of the season, they scored two against Tottenham and put three past Bournemouth before notching another four against Brighton.\nIf they carry on scoring at this rate, averaging 3.5 goals per game throughout the season, they will end up with 133 top-flight goals.\nAt the age of 31, Aguero continues to show the same desire and hunger as when he first joined eight years ago from Atletico Madrid for \u00a338m.\nDespite the score, this was not vintage City but Aguero's man-of-the-match contribution inspired his team as he took his tally to 237 goals for the club. Fitness permitting, he will be past 250 by Christmas.\nLaporte injury a worry for Guardiola\nDespite his side's routine win, Pep Guardiola will be concerned at the loss of Laporte - particularly as central defence is not an area of strength for City.\nLaporte cut across Webster, who was making his Premier League debut, as he tried to stop Brighton player surging forward.\nHe went down heavily and there was a delay while the player received treatment on the pitch before being taken to hospital to have the injury assessed.\n\"It doesn't look good,\" admitted Guardiola afterwards.\nThe City boss, who opted not to replace defender Vincent Kompany after the Belgian left in the summer, sent on Fernandinho to operate alongside Nicolas Otamendi, with John Stones injured.\nAlthough Brazilian Fernandinho is more than capable of doing the job, the loss of Laporte for any length of time could cause Guardiola problems.\nBrighton plan undone by early goal\nA visit to City, who clinched the title at the Amex Stadium on the final day of last season, was pretty much a free-hit for Brighton who will target maximum points in their next two games against Burnley and Newcastle.\nHaving suffered nine defeats in 12 games against the teams that finished in the top six last season, few gave them a chance to avoid defeat - although Crystal Palace's surprise win at the Etihad last December was not lost on Graham Potter.\n\"We need a bit of luck, to play well and hope they have a bad day,\" said the Brighton boss before the game.\nHis side's plan to frustrate and hit the champions on the break did not last two minutes as De Bruyne struck early, yet Brighton did create chances.\nEderson's save from Leandro Trossard at the end of the first half was a big moment, while the Belgian spurned another chance after half-time as Brighton tried to get back in the game.\nHaving taken four points from the first two games, they have lost two back-to-back league matches and will target a quick return to winning ways after the international break.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Man City)\n'Brighton played with courage' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"The game was tough. The result was 4-0 but the performance not because they did really well.\n\"Few teams come here to play with this courage. The difference? My players up front are incredibly good and they make the difference.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter: \"The score is not what we like, of course, but in terms of the players' effort and their courage, trying to do what we asked them to do, it was a top performance.\n\"Obviously it doesn't help when you go a goal down so early, but their courage throughout the first half especially, against a top team, was incredible.\"\n99 not out - the stats\nMan City forward Sergio Aguero has scored 99 Premier League goals at the Etihad - only Thierry Henry at Highbury (114) and Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford (101) have scored more at a single venue in Premier League history.\nBrighton remain winless in every away league match they have played against City.\nCity have won 17 of their last 18 Premier League games since losing 2-1 to Newcastle United in January.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2010, City's David Silva has assisted 87 Premier League goals - 27 more than any other player.\nCity's Kevin de Bruyne has been involved in nine goals in his last seven Premier League starts.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams have a two-week recess due to the first international break of the season, but Norwich City await Manchester City at Carrow Road on 14 September (17:30 BST) - the same day Brighton host Burnley (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-0 Aston Villa: Jordan Ayew strikes as Trezeguet sees red\nRoy Hodgson said his Crystal Palace side did not need to \"apologise\" for their 1-0 Premier League win over 10-man Aston Villa, after the visitors had a late equaliser controversially ruled out.\nJordan Ayew's instinctive finish ultimately decided the match at Selhurst Park, but Villa were incensed as Henri Lansbury's added-time effort was disallowed for what referee Kevin Friend judged to be a dive by Jack Grealish in the build-up.\nIt also prompted angry scenes off the pitch, with TV footage showing punches being thrown at security staff by spectactors in the away end. Police with batons eventually intervened, making one arrest, with video footage under review to assess if further action is necessary.\n\"It's unfortunate in some ways for us that it's all going to centre around the controversy at the end,\" said Hodgson, whose side are up to fourth in the formative Premier League table after back-to-back wins.\n\"Lucky for us the referee had made his decision before the ball had gone in the net and that was to give the free-kick,\" he added.\n\"I don't think we need to apologise at all for the fact that we won the game.\"\nVilla manager Dean Smith admitted he was bemused by the decision to deny his side a point, but accepted they would \"take it on the chin\".\nSmith said: \"I'm not sure any of us know why the referee has given the decision. We've all looked at it back and nobody can see why he hasn't given the goal.\"\nIn a statement, the Premier League said: \"The referee considered that Jack Grealish committed an act of simulation in the penalty area, and blew his whistle to stop the game before the ball went into goal.\n\"Under the Ifab protocol the video assistant referee system (VAR) is allowed to review the potential penalty situation. Having reviewed the incident the VAR judged that no 'clear and obvious' error had occurred and the on-field decision of simulation remained.\n\"The VAR was unable to check the 'goal' because the whistle went before the ball went into the net.\"\nRelive Crystal Palace v Aston Villa\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches, plus Burnley v Liverpool\nEarlier, the hosts had looked to be heading for another home blank, despite Villa's Trezeguet seeing red for a second bookable offence - the Egyptian's dismissal, for a late challenge on Wilfried Zaha, among seven bookings dished out by referee Friend.\nBut with time running out, Ghanaian Ayew, who was part of the Villa side relegated from the top flight in 2016, tricked his way past Tyone Mings and Grealish before firing low beyond Tom Heaton.\nIt means Ayew has now scored in consecutive Premier League games, having also struck in the win at Manchester United.\nBut it was another frustrating day for his Eagles team-mate Zaha, who has now scored just once in his last 17 home league appearances.\nVilla feel 'robbed' of away point\nAston Villa beat Everton at home last time out, but are now winless in 20 Premier League away games, losing their last nine in a row.\nAnd after a late collapse at Tottenham denied them any points in their only other away league game this season, Lansbury's disallowed goal was a bitter pill to swallow for Smith's side.\nDeep into six added minutes, a hand from Zaha appeared to set Grealish - making his 150th appearance for Villa - off balance as he bore down on the Palace 18-yard box.\nBut the Villa captain succeeded in completing his pass to Lansbury before running into first Gary Cahill and then the turf.\nThe decision of referee Friend prompted desperate protests from the visitors and their supporters, with Cahill holding Grealish back from the official as he was booked.\nSpeaking afterwards, Villa midfielder John McGinn said replays of the incident \"speaks for itself\" and claimed his side had been \"robbed of a point\".\nHodgson's Palace find a way to win\nMatch of the Day host Gary Lineker tweeted\n, external\n: \"The disallowed goal for @AVFCOfficial in the last minute has to be seen to be believed. Why VAR didn't correct what appeared to be an awful refereeing error is beyond me.\"\nBut in truth, Friend's decision saved Hodgson's side from ending a match which they had dominated in embarrassment, with the hosts having had 22 shots on Heaton's goal.\nCheikhou Kouyate was among the most wasteful, with just one of his six shots being on target. Captain Luka Milivojevic also went close, seeing an effort from distance pushed away from the top left hand corner of Heaton's goal straight after Trezeguet was dismissed.\nBut despite their wastefulness, victory for Palace enhances an extended run of good form in the top flight.\nIndeed, you could be forgiven for not knowing that only Manchester City (52) and Liverpool (48) have won more points than the 33 now collected by Palace since February.\nWith more than 10% of the season already complete, the south London club will now hope they can carry their momentum to the other side of September's international break.\nMan of the match - Jordan Ayew (Crystal Palace)\nHodgson keeps spell over Villa - the stats\nCrystal Palace have kept a clean sheet in both of their opening two home games in a league season for the first time since 2008-09, while it's the first time they've ever done so in a Premier League campaign.\nPalace have also now won two of their last three Premier League home games, drawing the other. It is as many wins as they had in their previous 10 at Selhurst Park.\nTrezeguet became the first Aston Villa player to be sent off in a Premier League match since Aly Cissokho against Watford in April 2016.\nCrystal Palace striker Jordan Ayew has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since December 2015, when he was an Aston Villa player.\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has won his first Premier League meeting against Aston Villa with all five of his clubs in the competition (Blackburn, Fulham, Liverpool, West Brom and Crystal Palace).\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Palace resume their Premier League season with a trip to Tottenham on Saturday, 14 September (15:00 BST).\nVilla's next fixture sees them host West Ham on Monday, 16 September (20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-3 Liverpool: Sadio Mane incident is played down by manager Jurgen Klopp\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp played down striker Sadio Mane's reaction after being substituted in the 3-0 win at Burnley, and then praised his forward line for helping the club achieve a 13-match winning run in the Premier League.\nThe incident involving the Senegal international occurred in the 85th minute with the Reds 3-0 up. As Mane walked off he made a gesture to the bench and continued to be animated as he sat down, seemingly frustrated at fellow forward Mohamed Salah's decision not to pass to him in the opposition area moments earlier.\nThe German boss laughed off the incident, and said: \"But it's good eh? He was upset, it was obvious.\n\"Sadio cannot hide his emotions, I like that. But all sorted. We spoke about it and everything is fine.\n\"We are individuals, we are emotional. It was a situation in a game. What else could have happened? It was not a phone call.\"\nMane, Roberto Firmino and a fluke own goal helped the Reds maintain their 100% start to their Premier League campaign.\nReaction from Turf Moor\nThe Clarets had fought toe-to-toe with last season's runners-up until the 33rd minute when Trent Alexander-Arnold's seemingly intended cross to the far post brushed the back of Chris Wood and sailed over the head of the stranded Nick Pope in goal.\nAnother piece of misfortune occurred soon after the restart. This time Burnley skipper Ben Mee inadvertently found Reds forward Firmino with a short pass; he then found Mane who fired low past Pope.\nThere were few chances after the break, but Liverpool converted the clearest of them when Firmino fired in from the edge of the area after he was teed up by Salah.\nKlopp said he was surprised the league leaders had extended their winning streak, because none of his front three had a full pre-season - both Mane and Salah played at the African Cup of Nations, while Firmino competed at the Copa America.\n\"If you ask me four weeks ago I wouldn't expect it would happen,\" said Klopp.\n\"We had a tricky pre-season. No pre-season for the front three but they still deliver. So far, so good.\"\nHis Reds go into the international break with as many points and in the same position as the corresponding period last season.\nBurnley, who have now won just two of their past 17 matches against Liverpool in all competitions, drop down to 11th in the table.\nReds forwards make most of limited chances\nNot too many will begrudge a team like Liverpool the rub of the green now and again.\nUp until Wood's own goal neither full-back Alexander-Arnold nor Andy Robertson had much of a chance to attack down the flanks, as they were both kept busy by Burnley's Aaron Lennon and Dwight McNeil.\nHowever, the danger posed did not deter Alexander-Arnold from pushing forward at any opportunity, and just after the half-hour mark his latest foray led to the lucky opener. As his cross nestled in the back of the net, the England defender reacted with sheepish pleasure.\nThere were, though, more lavish scenes of celebrations moments later when Mane sent his angled drive past the Burnley keeper.\nBoth he and fellow forwards Firmino and Salah were limited to scraps in the match, but when the next opportunity arose after the break they took it.\nThis time Egyptian Salah made one of his familiar marauding runs forward only to see his progress halted at the edge of the area. However, the cavalry arrived in the form of Firmino, who struck home the third for Liverpool.\nBurnley out of luck\nTwo errors in two successive games will grate on a Burnley side that prides itself on making the opposition work for their win.\nIt was Danny Drinkwater's mistake that led to Sunderland's equaliser in the 3-1 Carabao Cup midweek defeat, and against the Reds, skipper Mee suffered a rare lapse at the wrong place and against the wrong team.\nThat was an unfortunate four minutes for the Clarets, who up until the fluke opener looked good as they sparred against the European champions.\nThey came close to taking an early lead when Wood flashed a shot that Spanish keeper Adrian pushed away. And minutes later, Alexander-Arnold prevented Barnes from an almost-certain fifth of the season when he cut out Aaron Lennon's ball from the right.\nThe two first-half goals seemed to knock some of the wind out of Burnley, who failed to put up much of a fight after the break. Had James Tarkowski left a cross for Mee from a second-half corner, the captain might have atoned for his earlier error. And late in the game substitute Jay Rodriguez was denied by keeper Adrian - a sharper Rodriguez might have scored.\nHaving been competitive in almost three-and-a-half league games, Burnley boss Sean Dyche is unlikely to be too concerned about a second defeat in a matter of days.\nMan of the match - Roberto Firmino (Liverpool)\nMane the lucky charm - the stats\nLiverpool have won 13 league games in a row for the first time in their history, while they are only the second English top-flight side to win 13 in a row while scoring more than once each time (after Tottenham in 1960).\nLiverpool have gone 21 Premier League games without losing (W17 D4 L0); losing just once in their last 43 games in the competition (W35 D7 L1), a 1-2 defeat to Man City in January.\nBurnley have picked up just one victory in their last 25 Premier League games against 'Big Six' teams (D6 L18), beating Spurs at Turf Moor in February 2019 (2-1).\nLiverpool have won three consecutive away games at Burnley for the first time since August 1970 (all competitions) under former boss Bill Shankly.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has won five Premier League games versus Dyche; against no manager has he registered more victories in the competition.\nSince the start of the 2016-17 season, Burnley have scored eight own goals in the Premier League; only Bournemouth (nine) have scored more.\nLiverpool have not lost any of the last 33 Premier League games in which Mane has found the net (W29 D4 L0).\nSince the start of last season, no Liverpool player has scored more goals in all competitions Mane (30 - level with Salah).\nFirmino became the first Brazilian to score 50 Premier League goals; he is the ninth player to reach the milestone for Liverpool overall - no other club has had more (level with Manchester United).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool are at home to Newcastle on Saturday, 14 September (12:30 BST) and Burnley are at Brighton the same day (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Everton 3-2 Wolves: Richarlison the \"spirit in Everton's dressing room\" - Silva\nEverton manager Marco Silva described Richarlison as \"the spirit inside our dressing room\" after the Brazilian's two goals gave them a 3-2 win over Wolves in an entertaining game at Goodison Park.\nThe Brazilian scored the first and last goal of a see-saw game to give the Toffees a hard-fought three points and add to his first goal of the season in Wednesday's 4-2 Carabao Cup win at Lincoln.\n\"Richarlison is the type of player that needs good performances and if possible to win more confidence in the way he likes to play,\" Silva said.\n\"Last season, he did all the pre-season for us. This season, he did Copa America and after was on holiday and started the first game against Crystal Palace with 13 days working with us.\n\"He scored two really important goals for us. He will keep improving, for sure.\n\"We are talking about a fantastic football player and a fantastic boy. He is the spirit inside our dressing room.\"\nRicharlison opened the scoring in the fifth minute, converting from 16 yards, following defensive miscommunication between Conor Coady and Rui Patricio, to spark a flurry of goals in the opening stages.\nRomain Saiss pulled Wolves level from close range but Alex Iwobi converted Gylfi Sigurdsson's pin-point cross to restore the Toffees' lead before 12 minutes had passed.\nWolves thought they had earned a point when Raul Jimenez bravely headed home in the 78th minute, but Richarlison showed his own aerial prowess two minutes later to rise above Willy Boly and give Everton all three points.\nBoly capped his side's disappointing day by being dismissed in the closing seconds after receiving a second booking for a foul on the impressive Richarlison.\nWith only four Premier League games played, Everton climb to fifth in the table, while Wolves remain 17th and without a league win.\nEverton's attacking players shine\nEverton came into the game having only scored one goal in their previous three Premier League matches.\nBut with Iwobi and Moise Kean making their first league starts, the Toffees looked transformed in the attacking third.\nThe summer signings added extra verve to Everton's attack and allowed more space and time for Richarlison and Sigurdsson to work their magic.\nBehind them, Fabian Delph provided some muscle and awareness to keep the Wolves midfield in check.\nKean made a telling contribution in the build-up to Everton's first goal, his hustling causing confusion in the home defence and allowing Richarlison to pounce.\nThen, after Saiss had quickly levelled the scores, Sigurdsson was afforded too much room to whip in a delicious ball that Iwobi converted unmarked at the far post.\nWith his side pegged back for a second time, Richarlison, determined to be to on the winning side, made an excellent run into the box and leapt high above the Wolves defence to seal a hard-fought victory for Marco Silva's side.\nSpeaking about Everton's summer signings, Silva said: \"They did really well. I prefer to look at the team rather than individuals.\n\"For Fabian and Alex it is easier because they know the Premier League. We are talking about high-quality players. They know the league, intensity and the opponents.\n\"Moise did well but we are talking about a boy who was 19 in February. He worked well but he needs more time to adapt to know the players, teams and even the referees.\"\nTraore's new role\nDue to their successful involvement in the Europa League qualifiers, Wolves came into the match having already played five times more than opponents Everton so far this season.\nManager Nuno Espirito Santo shuffled the pack and made four changes following his side's victory over Torino on Thursday as he continued to manage European and Premier League commitments.\nWith Matt Doherty missing through fitness issues, Adama Traore kept his place to make his first Premier League start of the season.\nTraore, featuring in the new right wing-back role he has adopted this season, played a pivotal role in Saiss' equaliser, showing pace and power that Everton and France defender Lucas Digne couldn't handle.\nBut just three minutes later, his lack of defensive awareness was exposed when he allowed Iwobi to drift into the box unmarked to put Everton back into the lead.\nWolves have gained 16 points from losing positions since the start of last season and showed resilience to come from behind at Goodison Park.\nBut with Wolves needing to rotate players to cope with the demands of Europe, they will require regular positive contributions from players like Traore if they are to be successful this season.\n\"The fight was there,\" said manager Nuno Espirito Santo. \"It has nothing to do [with the schedule]. The Premier League is tough, it is just football.\n\"It's been a tough schedule against very tough teams and we know the next one [against Chelsea] will be tough. The assessment is good [after four games] because the players have given everything they have and we want to grow in the competition.\"\nMan of the match - Richarlison (Everton)\nRicharlison prolific at Goodison - the stats\nEverton have won six consecutive Premier League home matches, their longest winning run at Goodison Park since an eight-match streak between January and April 2017 under Ronald Koeman.\nWolves (P4 W0 D3 L1), have kicked off a top-flight campaign without a win through their opening four games for the first time since the 2003/04 season. They have gone on to be relegated at the end of their last four such campaigns when doing so (1964/65, 1975/76, 1983/84 and 2003/04).\nRaul Jimenez has scored in four consecutive games for Wolves in all competitions for the first time (four goals).\nEverton's Richarlison has scored in eight home Premier League matches (10 goals), with neither Watford or Everton falling to a defeat when the Brazilian has netted on home soil (P8 W6 D2 L0).\nRomain Sa\u00efss' goal for Wolves was the first time Everton conceded at Goodison Park in the Premier League since February last season (Gabriel Jesus for Man City), ending their run of 549 minutes without conceding at home.\nBoth of Alex Iwobi's goals for Everton this season have come via his head; one more than during his time at Arsenal, where just one of his 15 goals for the Gunners were headers.\nSince the start of last season, Everton's Lucas Digne (four goals, six assists), is one of only three defenders to have been directly involved in 10+ goals in the Premier League, along with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold (15) and Andy Robertson (11).\nEverton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has completed 90 minutes in each of his 111 Premier League appearances, meaning he holds the record, alongside Ali Al Habsi, for the most Premier League games while playing the full 90 minutes in every one.\nWhat's next?\nEverton face Bouremouth at Vitality Stadium on Sunday, 15 September (14:00 BST), while Wolves are next in action when they take on Chelsea at Molineux on Saturday, 14 September (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Aubameyang helps Gunners claim derby draw\nArsenal staged a stirring comeback to earn a point in a chaotic, thrilling north London derby against Tottenham at Emirates Stadium.\nSpurs looked to be in complete control when Christian Eriksen pounced to put them ahead in the 10th minute after Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno pushed out Erik Lamela's shot.\nLeno then saved superbly from Son Heung-min before the South Korean was senselessly hacked down in the area by Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka to allow Harry Kane to score his 10th goal in 11 derby games.\nArsenal started the revival when Alexandre Lacazette pulled one back on the stroke of half-time before they laid siege to Spurs' goal after the break.\nSpurs keeper Hugo Lloris saved superbly from Matteo Guendozi's low shot and from substitute Dani Ceballos before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang showed the poacher's instinct to turn home the equaliser with 19 minutes remaining.\nKane struck the inside of the post and Sokratis had a goal ruled out for offside - Spurs also had strong penalty claims rejected when the pair clashed late on - but neither side could make the decisive breakthrough and this entertaining encounter ended with honours even.\nThe result lifts Arsenal to fifth in the Premier League with seven points from four games, while Tottenham head into September's international break four places behind their rivals in ninth on five points.\nSunday's Premier League reaction\nListen: Football Daily podcast\nArsenal show fighting spirit\nArsenal showed real character amid the mood swings of this north London derby to fight back from a precarious position to earn a point.\nUnai Emery's side found themselves in big trouble at two goals down but never felt sorry for themselves, fighting their way back to parity and pinning Spurs back for most of the second half.\nThe Gunners were guilty of poor defending and moments of carelessness but no-one could question their heart.\nLacazette's goal with seconds left of the first half was vital, lifting the spirits of Arsenal's players and supporters and setting the perfect platform for a second half that was low on moments of high class but full of fervour and entertainment.\nThe action swung from end-to-end but Arsenal looked stronger after the break with 20-year-old Guendouzi performing with great maturity in midfield.\nGuendouzi certainly showed greater composure than his captain Xhaka, who was guilty of a moment of crass stupidity when diving into a sliding challenge on Son to concede a penalty.\nThe young Frenchman almost scored only for Lloris to make a brilliant save and it was his intelligent, probing ball into the box that was diverted in by Aubameyang.\nIt is already becoming clear the title is a two-horse race between Liverpool and Manchester City but Arsenal will feel they can make a serious top-four challenge - although once again questions must be asked about their defending.\nSpurs still looking short\nSpurs will be disappointed at only getting a draw after establishing such a position of strength at 2-0 but in the end there was almost a sense they should be grateful for a point.\nIt continues an indifferent start to the season as they have five points from their first four games, with just one win at home to Aston Villa.\nSpurs, to give perspective, have also had tough away assignments at Manchester City and Arsenal and come away with points but they are not yet back to their best.\nThe experiment of using Davinson Sanchez at right-back was not an unqualified success and on several occasions manager Mauricio Pochettino could be seen showing his exasperation, both at moments of poor defending and also when Spurs were wasteful in attack.\nSpurs were grateful for a superb display of shot-stopping by Lloris but Pochettino will be frustrated that his side looked to have Arsenal where they wanted them before the break, then ended hanging on for long periods in the second half.\n'A great job' - what they said\nArsenal manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was an amazing match. We are proud of our work and our supporters. The result isn't the best for us.\n\"The key was the first goal to give us confidence and give us more chances in the second half. We deserved it. We did a lot of good things. We made some mistakes in the first half and they have good players.\n\"Before their first goal we were playing well. Sometimes our heart is more strong than our head.\"\nTottenham striker Harry Kane, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I feel like were coming off disappointed. We expect to see the game out. The goal hurt us with momentum just before the break. It was an end-to-end game, especially last 10-15 minutes but the players left everything on the pitch.\nOn his late penalty shout: \"As a striker, if it is on halfway it is a definite foul. In the box you don't always get them. He's come through the back of me but it is 50/50. VAR would probably have backed the ref in this.\"\nMan of the match - Matteo Guendouzi (Arsenal)\nSpurs continue to stutter on the road - stats\nTottenham have dropped 42 points from winning positions in the Premier League against Arsenal - 11 more than against any other side in the competition.\nSpurs are winless in their last eight away league games, drawing two and losing six. They last endured such a run on the road in their eight games between December 2011 and April 2012.\nArsenal have lost just one of their last 27 Premier League home games against Tottenham, a 2-3 defeat in November 2010 after being two goals ahead.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2016, no player has conceded more penalties in the competition than the five by Arsenal's Granit Xhaka.\nArsenal have recorded 13 errors leading to goals in the Premier League since the start of last season - the most of any club in the competition. Goalkeeper Bernd Leno is responsible for six of those errors.\nSpurs' Christian Eriksen has now scored 50 Premier League goals - the first Danish player to reach this landmark - whilst also becoming the first Spurs player to register both 50-plus goals and assists for the club in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Tottenham resume their Premier League season with a home match against Crystal Palace on Saturday, 14 September (15:00 BST).\nA day later, Arsenal travel to Watford in the late Sunday kick-off (16:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-1 Newcastle United: Sadio Mane scores twice as leaders fight back\nPremier League leaders Liverpool shrugged off an early scare to sweep past Newcastle and maintain their 100% start to the season with another dominant attacking display.\nSadio Mane was again their go-to man, scoring twice in the first half after Jetro Willems' fine first goal for Newcastle had given Steve Bruce's side a shock early lead.\nMohamed Salah added a third after the break, with the third member of Liverpool's attacking trinity Roberto Firmino providing two brilliant assists and stealing the show with a superb performance from the bench.\nThe Reds have now won 14 league games in a row in a run that stretches back to a draw at Everton in March - the joint third-best winning run in English top-flight history - and go five points clear at the top after second-placed Manchester City lost to Norwich in the evening game.\n'Problems, what problems? Mane & Salah produce stylish show of unity'\nReaction to Liverpool v Newcastle , plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v MOTDx stars\nNewcastle never threatened to build on their surprise lead - which came via their only shot on target all day - and could not get near the European champions for large periods of a one-sided game.\nThey drop to 17th place, a point above the bottom three.\nThree-part harmony\nThe spotlight was on Salah and Mane after their apparent disagreement last time out at Burnley, when the Senegal forward was seemingly annoyed at a lack of service from his Egyptian team-mate.\nBut back on home ground Liverpool's front three were once again all on the same page and yet again proved the difference.\nFirmino played an hour for Brazil in Los Angeles in midweek in a game that finished at 06:00 BST on Wednesday morning, and the plan was to give him some rest as Divock Origi started on the left of the front three.\nBut an injury for the Belgium striker meant the Brazil forward was introduced earlier than anticipated.\nMane had already equalised by that point, collecting a pass from Andrew Robertson and curling superbly into the top corner.\nFor those paying attention, Salah celebrated with a punch of the air.\nFirmino then robbed Christian Atsu and slid in Mane with a beautiful pass. Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka should have gathered it but instead pushed it back towards Mane to allow the Liverpool forward to tap-in for his 19th goal in his last 21 Premier League appearances at Anfield.\nAfter the break Firmino was even more impressive, laying on chances for both his full-backs before setting up the previously quiet Salah with a wonderful assist.\nReceiving the ball with his back to goal, the Brazilian dragged the ball back then backheeled it into the path of Salah, who did the rest.\nManchester City's record of 18 top-flight wins in a row remains on the agenda for Liverpool - as does Chelsea's record of nine victories in a row at the start of a Premier League season.\nLimited success for Bruce\nNewcastle's sole win this season was a surprise success at Tottenham, when they had only 19.8% possession of the ball but defended a lead manfully.\nThe gameplan was the same at Anfield - where they ended with 24.4% of the ball - and looked to be a good one when Willems cut inside a hesitant Trent Alexander-Arnold to rip past Adrian with his right foot in front of the raucous travelling support.\nIt was a fabulous goal and for 20 minutes or so Bruce's flat back five looked hard to breach.\nBut when Emil Krafth thought a ball was there to be won and missed out to Robertson, the Scotland captain fed Mane and he effortlessly stroked the ball into the top corner.\nAfter the equaliser - and especially once Mane had put the hosts ahead - there was a paucity of intent from the visitors.\nKrafth had their only chance of note in the second half, collecting the ball in space at the far post but lashing high into the Kop after his slight hesitation allowed Virgil van Dijk the chance to put pressure on him.\nBy full-time Dubravka had been called on to make five decent saves and only a correct offside flag prevented Mane from bringing up his hat-trick.\nBruce, who has now won two of 39 Premier League away games against sides starting the day in the top four, will hope for easier tests ahead.\nMan of the match - Roberto Firmino (Liverpool)\n'We arrived after 35 minutes' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I started enjoying it after 35 minutes when we arrived in the game. It was difficult, Newcastle did what they did and did it well. They had the speed to go in behind on the break, it was not easy.\n\"We played them onside for the goal unfortunately and that made the game not easy. We had some time to set the rhythm, we had to play much quicker and then we had chances. We scored two wonderful goals.\n\"I'm not too pleased about coming from behind. We have to learn from the game. The challenge is always after the international break to find a common rhythm again. The boys have played in different ways for different countries and we have one-and-a-half days to work on it again.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce: \"We were OK in bits. Unfortunately we made a mistake for the second goal and we are disappointed about that. When you come to an arena like this and give the ball away in the middle of the pitch you are in trouble. Our keeper will think he should do better.\n\"Jetro will remember that, it's not often you smash into the top corner with your wrong foot. He has been thrown in at the deep end with us but the more he plays in the Premier League, you can see the ability he has got.\n\"Liverpool are as good as you get. You can understand why they are European champions and lost once last year. They are an excellent, excellent team with pace and creativity and at the top end of the pitch they damage you. They are going to be there or thereabouts.\"\nLiverpool on a roll - the stats\nLiverpool are the fourth team to win 14 consecutive English top-flight matches, after Arsenal (14, August 2002), Man City (15, August 2019) and Man City again (18, December 2017).\nFor the second consecutive season, Liverpool have won their opening five games of the Premier League campaign - the only previous two teams to do so in back-to-back seasons were Chelsea (2009-10/2010-11) and Man City (2015-16/2016-17).\nNewcastle have lost 13 of their last 14 Premier League away games against 'big six' opponents (W1), with three of those defeats coming at Anfield.\nLiverpool have won each of their last five Premier League games at Anfield when they have conceded the opening goal, with three of those comeback victories coming in 2019 (4-3 v Crystal Palace, 4-2 v Burnley and 3-1 v Newcastle).\nLiverpool have now scored 101 goals against Newcastle in the Premier League - they are the third team to score 100+ against a single opponent in the competition, and the first to do so against a side who hasn't been ever-present (Arsenal 107 v Everton, Manchester United 100 v Everton).\nLiverpool's Sadio Mane has yet to lose a Premier League home game in which he has found the net, winning 33 and drawing two of his previous 35 games in the competition when doing so.\nMohamed Salah has been directly involved in 50 Premier League goals for Liverpool at Anfield in 41 appearances, scoring 36 and providing 14 assists.\nAndrew Robertson has made 17 assists for Liverpool in the Premier League since the start of the 2017-18 season; the most of any defender in this period.\nNewcastle's Jetro Willems scored his first goal in 49 appearances (three for Newcastle and 46 for Eintracht Frankfurt) within the top five European leagues.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool begin their Champions League campaign away to Napoli on Tuesday, 17 September, kicking off at 20:00 BST before facing Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday, 22 September at 16:30 BST.\nNewcastle are next in action when they take on Brighton at home on Saturday, 21 September at 17:30 BST."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-0 Leicester City: Marcus Rashford penalty clinches victory\nManchester United returned to winning ways and ended Leicester's unbeaten start to the season by edging to a Premier League victory in a pulsating contest at Old Trafford.\nAfter thrashing Chelsea 4-0 on the opening day, United had failed to win any of their last three games but took all the points to inflict Leicester's first defeat of the campaign.\nMarcus Rashford scored the only goal from the penalty spot in the eighth minute after being tripped by Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu.\nRashford could have got another in the second half, but his wonderful free-kick from 30 yards curled over the wall and onto the angle of crossbar and post.\nIs Maguire justifying Solskjaer's faith?\nRelive the action from Old Trafford\nDefender Harry Maguire, given a torrid reception by the Leicester supporters, came close to scoring against his old side but headed straight at Kasper Schmeichel.\nLeicester grew into the contest with the lively James Maddison twice coming close and left-back Ben Chilwell saw his dipping effort tipped over by David de Gea.\nThe result means United leapfrog their opponents into fourth place, while Leicester drop down to fifth.\nMaguire silences Foxes fans\nUnited came into the game on the back of 1-1 draws at Wolves and Southampton, as well as a home loss against Crystal Palace but boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had spoken beforehand about his side performing well without the positive results.\nThey managed to hold on to victory, which was just their second in their previous 10 league games.\nEngland international Maguire became the world's most expensive defender when he joined the Red Devils from Leicester for \u00a380m in the summer and played his part as his side kept only their second clean sheet in the last 15.\nJeered by the travelling fans throughout, Maguire would have silenced those taunting him, but saw his towering header from a corner collected by Schmeichel.\nOn one occasion, he showed good pace to keep up with the fleet-footed Demarai Gray, dispossessing the winger before turning away with the ball, greeted by rapturous applause from the home supporters.\nWith the Leicester fans singing \"we don't need you, we've got Soyuncu\" from the first whistle, the Turkish defender fouled Rashford right on cue inside the box, allowing the England forward to send Kasper Schmeichel the wrong way from the penalty spot.\nOut-of-favour Nemanja Matic had a decent showing in his first start of the season - in place of the injured Paul Pogba - attempting 41 passes, the most of any home player, while the industrious Scott McTominay had two interceptions and won the ball back seven times.\nAndreas Pereira's free-kick in the opening minute, whipped towards the top corner, was brilliantly pushed away by Schmeichel, watched on by his father Peter, and Daniel James came close to equalling his manager Solskjaer's record from 1996.\nThe Welshman was looking to score in his first three Premier League games at Old Trafford with - what is turning into - his trademark skill, cutting in from the left and arrowing a right-footed strike narrowly over.\nAway day blues for Leicester\nLeicester began the day in third place, harbouring hopes of breaking into the top six for the first time since their league-winning campaign in 2016.\nBut Brendan Rodgers' side have work to do as they continued their horrific run against United, now losing 18 times against them - more than any other opponent.\nTheir frailties lie at the back away from home, failing to keep a clean sheet in their last 11 games on the road and it was a defensive error which cost them this time.\nSoyuncu has started the season in impressive fashion but was given a difficult afternoon by Rashford, sticking out a foot to trip the United forward in conceding the penalty and fouling the Englishman on three occasions in the first half. He did improve as the game wore on, winning the ball back a total of nine times.\nLeicester could have taken the lead when a long ball from Schmeichel bounced all the way through to Maddison, whose low shot was saved by David de Gea and the England midfielder also curled a free-kick agonisingly wide.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford (Man Utd)\n'We come away frustrated' - what they said\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, Man Utd manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: \"We hung in there. It was the first time this season where we have had to defend for large periods. We have dominated the other games but today we saw a team that could defend in their own half.\n\"They are a good side who want to get into the top four. To keep a clean sheet is great but let's not get too excited because we know we can play better. We defended as a proper team.\"\nOn Harry Maguire's performance: \"When you play against strikers like Jamie Vardy, you have to concentrate because if you mistime your run, he is in behind you and I thought Harry did well.\"\nOn his substitutes: \"We have a big squad and it is just about getting them ready for when they are needed. They were needed when we were struggling and they did well.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said: \"I thought we deserved something from the game. We didn't start well but we had a great chance to take the lead. We gave away a soft penalty and that ultimately decided the game. In the second half, we played well and it looked like it was coming but we couldn't find that last pass.\n\"We didn't connect the game through our midfield well enough to serve Jamie [Vardy]. He thrives on that but we were unable to make those passes. We started to get higher up the pitch after the break but nothing really dropped to him. It was a game of few chances for both sides.\n\"We intended to press the game with those two guys [Hamza Choudhury and Wilfred Ndidi] but when you go a goal down so early on, you have to think about it. We come away from here frustrated which is a good sign, knowing there is improvement in this group of young players.\"\nLeicester continue poor form at Old Trafford - the stats\nManchester United registered only their second Premier League win in their last 10 matches in the competition (W2 D4 L4).\nLeicester City have lost nine of their last 10 Premier League matches at Old Trafford against United (W0 D1 L9).\nUnited forward Marcus Rashford has scored four Premier League goals against Leicester, more than against any other opponent.\nLeicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel has conceded more goals from penalties (16) in the Premier League in 176 appearances than his dad Peter Schmeichel conceded in 310 appearances (15).\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers has now lost five of his six away Premier League matches against United (W1 D0 L5).\nUnited have been awarded five more penalties than any other Premier League team since the start of last season (16), scoring 11 of those.\nUnited are unbeaten in their last 134 home Premier League games when they have scored first (W123 D11 L0).\nWhat's next?\nMan Utd face FC Astana in their opening Europa League tie on Thursday before returning to domestic action away at West Ham on Sunday, 22 September (14:00 BST), while Leicester host Tottenham in the early kick-off on Saturday, 21 September (12:30)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 2-5 Chelsea: Tammy Abraham scores hat-trick in win at Molineux\nTammy Abraham says he hopes this can be \"his season\" after scoring a brilliant hat-trick - and an own goal - as Frank Lampard's young side destroyed Wolves at Molineux.\nThe England striker, 21, scored his treble in the space of 21 minutes to make it seven goals in his past three appearances - and is joint leading scorer in the Premier League with Manchester City's Sergio Aguero.\nAbraham joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Dele Alli in becoming only the third Premier League player aged 21 or younger to score two or more goals in three consecutive appearances.\n\"I hope this is my season,\" said Abraham, who spent last season on loan in the Championship with Aston Villa.\n\"I have to keep working hard in every training session, every game. Every game I want to prove myself to the gaffer.\"\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard said Abraham has an enthusiasm to succeed and score goals.\n\"I'm so delighted for him. I know how hard the academy works and Tammy has a fantastic approach to the game and how he wants to progress,\" added Lampard.\n\"All three goals of his goals were so different, it just shows what he can do.\"\nAbraham scored twice in the space of seven first-half minutes after Fikayo Tomori - another 21-year-old - had opened the scoring with a stunning 25-yard finish.\nAbraham doubled the lead with a shot on the turn after referee Graham Scott had played an advantage following Conor Coady's foul on Mason Mount.\nWolves, who remain without a top-flight win this season, fell further behind when Abraham headed home, before the striker became the youngest ever Chelsea player to score a Premier League hat-trick following a superb finish after beating Coady.\nIn an eventful game, Abraham then scored an own goal as Romain Saiss' header struck his right hand before crossing the line, before Patrick Cutrone added a second Wolves goal from close range.\nMount, 20, added Chelsea's fifth goal with virtually the last kick of the game.\nCan Chelsea achieve success with academy products?\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nAbraham steals the show\nChelsea have 11 Premier League goals this season - and Abraham has scored seven of them during an outstanding start to the campaign.\nHaving scored two goals in each of his previous two league games, against Sheffield United and Norwich City, the forward showed off his repertoire of skills in front of goal at Molineux.\nHungry to impress, his first was a clever, instinctive finish, while his second was a scorching header from a cross by Marcos Alonso, who was making his first league start of the campaign.\nAbraham's third, from a Jorginho assist, was perhaps the best, as he calmly beat Coady before producing an angled finish.\nHis own goal was unfortunate - Saiss' header was heading for the net when it struck the forward's hand - while Abraham was also booked for a foul on Diogo Jota.\nLater, when replaced by Michy Batshuayi after landing awkwardly, Abraham was booed by Wolves fans. He responded by showing the crowd three fingers - one for each of his goals at the right end.\nYouthful Chelsea growing up fast\nThis is the start of a huge week for Chelsea, who launch their Champions League campaign at home to Valencia on Tuesday, before entertaining Liverpool next weekend.\nYet they head into it with a spring in their step after an emphatic victory which left Lampard delighted.\nUnder his predecessor Maurizio Sarri, the Blues suffered defeat at Molineux last season, while Wolves took a point from the reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge.\nThis side might be young and a little naive - yet it is also bursting with youthful promise and energy.\n\"I'm delighted for them all but particularly for Fikayo Tomori,\" added Lampard. \"He has worked so hard from where he started to now - it's superb.\n\"We're trying to give chances to the youngsters and they are scoring and showing us why we should keep putting them in the team.\"\nTomori's goal was breathtaking, while Mount produced a finish a Premier League veteran - let alone someone making only their fifth top-flight appearance - would have been proud of.\nThe only negative for Lampard was his side's defending. They are still searching for a first clean sheet of the season while they have the second worst defensive record in the Premier League after conceding 11 in five games.\nIn addition, Germany defender Antonio Rudiger went off injured on his first appearance of the season.\nHaving already tied Mount and 23-year-old Ruben Loftus-Cheek to new deals, there are reports that Callum Hudson-Odoi,\n, external\n18, has agreed a new five-year contract worth over \u00a3100,000 a week.\nHudson-Odoi, who handed in a transfer request in January, has been injured but is close to returning - another reason for Chelsea to be optimistic about the season ahead.\nWhat's happened to Wolves?\nWolves won a legion of new admirers on their way to finishing seventh last season.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side took an impressive 16 points from the Premier League's top six yet, five games into this campaign, they remain without a win and are 19th in the table.\nIt is far too early in the season to talk about a crisis, but alarm bells must surely be ringing after conceding eight times in two games.\nA good performance and result was required after being beaten 3-2 at Everton before the international break.\nInstead, they will launch their Europa League group campaign on Thursday on the back of a dispiriting defeat.\n\"That was a bad, bad performance,\" said Nuno.\n\"We lost concentration and I am dissatisfied. There is no point being angry in them but I need them to get better.\"\nCan Wolves cope with Europa League commitments?\nWolves' Premier League campaign is 450 minutes old - yet they are the only team who have not been in front for a single minute in a game this season in the top flight.\nWolves have made 10 changes to their starting line-up across their opening five Premier League games. Last season, it took them 16 matches to make as many changes in the competition. Indeed, only Chelsea (11) have made more in the Premier League this season than Wolves.\nThe next two weeks are vital.\nAfter visiting Crystal Palace, who also suffered a hammering on Saturday against Spurs, Wolves entertain Watford - the only team below them in the table.\nMan of the match - Tammy Abraham (Chelsea)\nYoung guns make history - the stats\nExcluding own goals, Chelsea have become the first team in Premier League history to have 11 consecutive league goals scored by players aged 21 or younger.\nWolves conceded five goals in a home Premier League game for the first time since a 5-0 defeat by Manchester United in March 2012.\nThis was Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo's 300th match as a manager.\nIn Abraham, Mount and Tomori, Chelsea now have three English scorers aged 21 or younger in a single Premier League season for the first time since the 1992-93 campaign (Eddie Newton, Neil Shipperley and Graham Stuart).\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in European action in midweek. Chelsea host Valencia of La Liga in the Champions League on Tuesday, while Wolves welcome Portuguese side Braga to Molineux in the Europa League on Thursday (both 20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham 4-0 Crystal Palace: Son Heung-min stars in easy win\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said his side's \"amazing\" performance in Saturday's victory over Crystal Palace is the \"first step\" towards rediscovering the consistency of last season.\nAll four Spurs goals came before the interval, with Son Heung-min the shining light in a scintillating attacking display.\nThe victory - Tottenham's first since the opening weekend of the season - lifts them back into the top four of the Premier League.\nPochettino said last month that this was the most unsettled squad he has had at the club\n, external\n, following a summer in which the likes of Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld were all heavily linked with moves abroad.\nThe 4-0 win was Spurs' first game since the European transfer window closed on 2 September.\n\"[Today's performance] showed when you focus and concentrate and you are on the same page, working to the same objective, the quality is there,\" said Pochettino.\n\"This is the first step. We need to improve a lot, we need to be consistent.\n\"The first half was like a recovery to make our fans feel proud of us.\"\nSouth Korea forward Son capitalised on a defensive lapse from returning Palace defender Mamadou Sakho to fire the hosts into an early lead, before visiting left-back Patrick van Aanholt inadvertently directed a cross from right-back Serge Aurier into his own net.\nSon connected beautifully with another Aurier cross to make it 3-0, and Erik Lamela finished off another flowing move involving Son and Harry Kane to complete the scoring.\n\"The attitude was amazing, and the performance,\" said Pochettino. \"We were very concentrated and had tremendous quality.\n\"I'm so happy for the team. I think it's important for their confidence.\"\nSpurs hit their stride\nPochettino revealed he held an hour-long meeting with his squad this week in order to \"refocus\" his players' minds following an indifferent start to the campaign.\nSpurs had won only once in the league this season before today - at home to Aston Villa in their opening game of the campaign.\nWhatever Pochettino told his players in the meeting, it worked.\nThe hosts roared out of the traps at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, overwhelming a Palace side who had conceded only two league goals before the game.\nSon, who scored Spurs' first goal at their new stadium against Palace in April, opened the scoring with a crisp finish after Sakho misjudged Toby Alderweireld's raking cross-field pass.\nSpurs, who had fallen behind in both their home games so far this season, continued to apply pressure on the Palace rearguard and doubled their lead when Aurier's cross from the right was directed past Guaita by the unfortunate Van Aanholt.\nAurier, making his first start since February, was left in far too much space as he set up the hosts' second goal, and Palace failed to learn their lesson as the Ivory Coast defender produced another teasing ball which Son volleyed brilliantly past Guaita at the far post.\nSon was at the forefront of all that was good about Spurs' performance, starting the move that led to Lamela prodding Kane's low cross beyond the Palace goalkeeper three minutes before the interval.\nA day to forget for Palace\nPrior to the game, only Manchester City (52) and Liverpool (51) had collected more Premier League points than Roy Hodgson's side since 2 February, when the Eagles started a good run of form with a 2-0 win at home to Fulham.\nThey have taken significant scalps away from Selhurst Park in that period, including a backs-to-the-wall 2-1 victory at Manchester United last month - their eighth win in 12 Premier League away matches.\nHowever, Saturday's defeat extends their winless league run against Spurs to nine games.\nHodgson's side were second best from start to finish as the defensive organisation that earned them that impressive victory at Old Trafford appeared to desert them.\nFrance defender Sakho - making his first appearance since having knee surgery - had a poor game and was at fault for Spurs' opening goal.\nThere may have been an element of fortune about the hosts' second, but Spurs cut through their opponents with embarrassing ease in the build-up to their third and fourth goals, with Son and Lamela both left unmarked at the far post.\nPalace rarely threatened at the other end as Lloris made routine saves from Cahill and Kouyate in the first half, before thwarting Wilfried Zaha in the second.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min (Tottenham)\nJoint-biggest victory in a London derby - the stats\nSpurs recorded their biggest league victory over Palace, as well as their joint-biggest against the Eagles across all competitions (also 4-0 in January 1987 in the FA Cup fourth round).\nThis was Spurs' joint-biggest victory in a London derby in the Premier League (seventh win by four goals), having last won one by four goals in what was Pochettino's first home game in charge of Spurs (4-0 v QPR in August 2014).\nPalace's defeat was their heaviest in the Premier League since September 2017 (0-4 v Manchester United), while only once previously has Hodgson lost by a bigger margin in the competition (Crystal Palace 0-5 Manchester City in September 2017).\nSpurs have won each of their last nine Premier League games against Palace - only against Birmingham (10 in September 1964) have they had a longer winning run in top-flight history.\nSpurs scored three goals in the opening half hour of a Premier League home game for the first time since February 2012, when they beat Newcastle 5-0 at White Hart Lane.\nSon has scored in all four of his Premier League home games against Crystal Palace (five goals), with Spurs going on to win on all four occasions.\nSon is Spurs' top scorer across all competitions at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, netting four goals in seven home appearances there.\nPalace winger Zaha won eight fouls against Spurs; the most by a player in a Premier League game since November 2018 (eight for Harry Kane v Chelsea).\n'There's a lot of work to do' - what the managers said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"\"The performance showed we are a good team.\"\n\"I'm so happy for the team and happy to build for a really good 21 days, with six games ahead.\n\"We need to improve a lot and be consistent. There's a lot of work to do.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's one of those games that we will just have to write off and learn from and hold our hands up and admit we were beaten by a better team.\n\"We came here hoping to play as well as they played and we weren't capable of that. We found ourselves staring down the barrel of a gun at half-time but fortunately the scoreline wasn't aggravated in the second half and we have been beaten 4-0.\n\"The fact is we mustn't get carried away with results. For us, it's going to be a very long, hard fight to stay in this league and there will be plenty of games like this where we play teams with power and intensity.\"\nWhat's next?\nSpurs travel to Olympiakos in their Champions League Group B opener on Wednesday 18 September (kick-off 17:55 BST) before visiting Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday, 21 September (12:30 BST).\nCrystal Palace return to action at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday, 22 September (14:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Burnley: Jeff Hendrick scores in stoppage time to earn visitors a point\nSubstitute Jeff Hendrick fired in a stoppage-time equaliser to earn Burnley a point and deny Brighton their first home victory since 2 March.\nThe Seagulls were set to win it when Neal Maupay volleyed in Solly March's cross at the start of the second half.\nThe summer signing struck after March and Glenn Murray tested Burnley keeper Nick Pope just before the break.\nBut Hendrick drilled in a 20-yard strike to keep both sides looking for their first win since the opening day.\nRelive Burnley v Brighton as it happened\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nThe 27-year-old midfielder, who won his 50th cap for the Republic of Ireland in midweek, came off the bench for his 100th Premier League appearance and salvaged a point for the Clarets with their first shot on target.\nThe visitors had started stronger, with Jack Cork and Aaron Lennon having shots blocked, before Brighton finished the first half on top.\nAfter Maupay's second goal for the club since his \u00a316m move from Brentford, Davy Propper spurned a good chance to double the lead as he headed over from Murray's cut-back before the veteran English forward also skewed a 20-yard effort well wide.\nAnd 12 seconds into the four minutes of added time Hendrick, on just his second Premier League appearance of the season, made them pay from Matej Vydra's lay-off to keep the two sides level in the league table on five points.\nPotter still waiting for first home win\nAfter narrowly avoiding relegation last season, Brighton have been more expansive under new manager Graham Potter and took four points from their first two games.\nAnd despite then losing to Southampton and Manchester City, the Seagulls looked comfortable against their south coast rivals until Florin Andone's red card and were more adventurous than most teams at Etihad Stadium, having 46.5% possession and creating chances of their own.\nBack at the Amex, they took time to get a foothold in the game before putting together some positive build-up play.\nInitially, March was their biggest outlet on the left. He even popped up on the right wing to whip in a teasing cross which the recalled Murray glanced beyond the far post.\nPascal Gross also got into some promising positions down the right channel, squaring for Murray to test Pope with a low shot, and that expansive play continued after the break.\nBurnley defender Matt Lowton deflected Murray's cut-back just wide while Maupay tested Pope at his near post before swivelling to fire in the opener.\nShane Duffy returned for Brighton and despite facing in-form striker Ashley Barnes and his partner Chris Wood - so often the scourge of Albion since helping them win the League One title in 2010-11 - the Seagulls' defence kept Burnley's front two quiet.\nThey only had one chance to equalise which Wood, who scored twice in the Clarets' win here last season, sidefooted wide from close range before Brighton's late lapse cost Potter his first win.\nClarets clinical at the death\nBurnley's opening-day win over Southampton had Clarets fans dreaming of another top-seven finish after qualifying for last season's Europa League and it took a stoppage-time penalty to deny them another victory at Wolves.\nManager Sean Dyche was happy with his side's performance in defeat at Arsenal and they matched Liverpool until two goals late in the first half set the European champions on course for a 3-0 win last time out.\nThe Clarets again started positively, with Dwight McNeil winning a string of corners down the left wing, but were firmly on the back foot after Lennon went close on 37 minutes.\nThey were stretched by the hosts and despite Barnes' best efforts up front, a chance never fell for the striker to add to his four goals so far this season.\nWood had one of his off days yet, just as Burnley looked set to return from the south coast empty handed, they showed the quality they possess by pouncing when the opportunity arose.\nWith Brighton adjusting to a substitution moments earlier, McNeil ran at the home defence before playing it into Vydra, who teed up fellow sub Hendrick to hit a crisp first-time strike which veered away from keeper Mat Ryan into the bottom corner.\n'We did enough, but one thing can hurt you' - what they said\nBrighton manager Graham Potter said: \"It was frustrating. I feel for the players because they put a lot into the game. For the first 20 minutes, Burnley were the better team but then we grew into it. It would have been nice to hang on but that's the Premier League - one thing can hurt you and that's what happened.\n\"We limited them to not too much and they are hard to play against. Overall, I was happy with the performance but we would have liked three points of course.\n\"We did enough in the game in relation to chances. You need to add those goals to kill off the game. There is always a chance the opposition can do something with a bit of quality.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche said: \"You come back from the break and you never know how that is going to affect you.\n\"The first 20 minutes I thought were excellent. We mixed the play well and were effective. We didn't get to grips with it all after the first 20 minutes but the lads who came on changed the game. We found more passes and asked a few questions as the game came to a close. It was a real strong finish.\n\"Jeff Hendrick took his goal well and I told him he has been excellent in training. He is a bit unlucky. The margins for picking a team are so tight. Jeff has been knocking on the door. He is a very good player and I am pleased for him because he deserves it.\"\nMan of the match - Pascal Gross (Brighton)\nSeagulls' winless run goes on - the stats\nBrighton are winless in their last eight league meetings with Burnley (D6 L2), losing both matches in the Premier League last season.\nBurnley are unbeaten in their last seven Premier League games on the south coast (W4 D3).\nBrighton have not scored more than once in any of their last 15 Premier League home games (nine goals in total) and are winless in their last eight at the Amex Stadium (D3 L5).\nBrighton striker Neal Maupay has scored seven goals in 11 league games (two for Brighton, five for Brentford).\nSolly March registered his seventh Premier League assist for Brighton, with only Pascal Gross (11) managing more for the Seagulls.\nBurnley midfielder Jeff Hendrick has scored two Premier League away goals in his last four games on the road, as many as in his previous 49 such appearances.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host newly-promoted Norwich next Saturday (15:00 BST) while Brighton visit Newcastle (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 0-1 Southampton: Moussa Djenepo solo goal wins it for Saints\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder says his side \"have to wise up quickly\" after they were beaten by Southampton in a tight game at Bramall Lane.\nSaints summer signing Moussa Djenepo scored the deciding goal as he brilliantly weaved through the Blades defence before firing home midway through the second half.\nBut prior to falling behind, the hosts saw a goal ruled out for offside by the video assistant referee when Oliver McBurnie thought he had put them in front shortly after the break.\nThe Blades have now won just one of their opening five games on their Premier League return.\n\"This is a game we should have definitely got something from - at minimum a draw,\" Wilder told BBC Sport.\n\"We have got to wise up quickly. With the amount of chances we created, we can't come away not scoring - it is absolutely ridiculous.\n\"We want to win games and we have to open up, so for us to create 17 chances shows we're playing in a way to try and win games of football. We will always do that.\"\nAs well as seeing a goal disallowed, the hosts also saw second-half substitute Billy Sharp sent off late on for a rash challenge on Stuart Armstrong, while they were denied a penalty when James Ward-Prowse appeared to handle the ball in the area.\nThe hosts were the better team for large periods and Blades striker David McGoldrick will rue a string of missed chances, although Angus Gunn was impressive in the Saints goal, making four good saves.\nHowever, Ralph Hassenhuttl's team held firm and had chances of their own before summer signing Djenepo broke the deadlock, notably through Che Adams, who saw his headed effort acrobatically saved by home keeper Dean Henderson.\n\"I have got to get used to the Premier League, it seems a different game we are involved with. I thought he was correct with the VAR decision [to disallow McBurnie's goal],\" Wilder added.\n\"But I don't understand the handball one, I think Ward-Prowse has handled it when three of our boys are right round it. That has gone against us today but in about four weeks' time we will have someone come out and say 'we got that one wrong'.\n\"Other bits and pieces I have got to get used to; players going down before there is contact, looking to give the referee a difficult decision. But I have no qualms about Billy's sending off - it was just disappointing because his impact on the game was great.\"\nVictory for Saints means they have claimed back-to-back away league wins for the first time since March 2017 following their win at Brighton prior to the international break.\nIt also sees them climb to 10th while the Blades slide to 13th.\nAs it happened: Sheffield United 0-1 Southampton\nLive reaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nDjenepo's moment of magic\nFor two sides so closely matched, it is perhaps fitting that it took a moment of magic to separate them, supplied by Djenepo.\nThe tricky forward displayed his strength to hold off Blades skipper Norwood before exhibiting impressive agility to go past both John Egan and Jack O'Connell, to leave him in space inside the opposition penalty box.\nThen, all that was left was the finish, and he delivered it emphatically.\nBut Hassenhuttl's side were made to work hard for their win, which was only their second in their past nine league games, and central defenders Jannik Vestergaard and Maya Yoshida more than played their part as the hosts applied heavy pressure as the game drew to a close.\n\"We showed we can switch the shape immediately and key today was we were good from the beginning,\" Hassenhuttl told BBC Sport.\n\"We had two big chances in the first half, a bit unlucky and first 15 minutes of the second half the pressure was high from Sheffield. After that we were a little bit better and we tried to calm the game down with possession.\n\"VAR did a fantastic job, it's fantastic that such a technique is available in the league. Moussa - I must say a big compliment to our physios, they did everything they could for him to play today and he scored a fantastic goal so everybody loves him.\"\nBlades lack finishing touch\nThe foundations of United's success on their return to the Premier League have been built on hard work and they had that in abundance on Saturday.\nThey could not, however, find a goal.\nIn the first half, McGoldrick was denied by Gunn after being sent clear by his strike partner McBurnie.\nAnd then the Republic of Ireland striker put wide from close range when sliding in to meet Norwood's deep free-kick.\nMidfielder John Fleck was also guilty of spurning chances, the Scotsman heading over and hitting the side-netting in the opening 45 minutes.\nAnd while they looked to have opened the scoring on 52 minutes, McBurnie's effort was rightly ruled out as VAR showed Egan to be in an offside position when the ball came into the box.\nThey did not let that setback dampen their spirits, though, and they continued to put Southampton under pressure even after Djenepo's goal.\nBut it was not to be for Wilder's side, who had four recognised attackers on the pitch at one stage as they pushed for an equaliser, before Sharp's reckless lunge saw him receive the second red card of his career.\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Southampton)\n'The guys believe in what we are doing' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hassenhuttl on BBC Sport: \"We had a difficult start at Burnley then Liverpool, but the guys believe in what we are doing. We knew we could play better than in their first two games but these seven points are very important for us.\n\"Two away wins in a row is good for us and gives us self-confidence. We have more quality in front this season, we have more options and even Nathan Redmond is injured and he can make a difference.\"\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder on BBC Sport: \"I was unhappy with the first half performance because it wasn't us, was not us but that is our performance today. It's risk and reward, the goal we conceded is nothing to do with shape or tactics, it is a ball given away in the middle of the park.\n\"We are an open side, that's why we created 17 chances and should have scored, no doubt about it.\"\nFirst-half droughts continue for both sides - the stats\nSheffield United have lost consecutive home Premier League matches for only the second time, also doing so in March 1993 under Dave Bassett.\nSouthampton have won three away games in a row in all competitions without conceding a goal for the first time since March 1986.\nSheffield United and Southampton remain the only two sides in the Premier League yet to score a first-half goal this season.\nSummer signing Moussa Djenepo's second Premier League goal for Southampton came courtesy of just his third shot on target in the competition.\nSouthampton's Sofiane Boufal has registered two assists in his last three Premier League appearances, as many as he managed in his previous 51 in the competition.\nNext up\nThe Saints will now prepare for the visit of Bournemouth on Friday night (20:00 BST) while the Blades travel to Goodison Park to face Everton the next day (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Norwich City 3-2 Manchester City: Canaries end champions' unbeaten run\nNorwich City produced a magnificent all-round display to inflict Manchester City's first Premier League defeat since January at an ecstatic Carrow Road.\nThe Canaries were missing eight players but made light of those injuries and took full advantage of a performance from the reigning champions that was careless in the extreme and characterised by chaotic defending.\nNorwich were 2-0 ahead within 30 minutes after Kenny McLean rose unmarked to meet Emiliano Buendia's corner and then Todd Cantwell finished a flowing move involving Marco Stiepermann and Teemu Pukki.\nSergio Aguero's header just before the break hinted at a Manchester City comeback but a misunderstanding between John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi saw Buendia rob the Argentina centre-back and set up Pukki to score.\nRodri scored his first goal for Manchester City with two minutes left before referee Kevin Friend's final whistle was the cue for wild celebrations for the home side.\nThe rare defeat, meanwhile, leaves Pep Guardiola's side five points behind Liverpool.\nManchester City upset typical of Canaries' bold approach\nReaction to Norwich's stunning win over Man City\nLawro v MOTDx stars Chelcee Grimes, Craig Mitch and Reece Parkinson\nMan City flounder in Laporte's absence\nIt was inevitable City would miss the class and composure of Aymeric Laporte - set to be out for six months with a knee injury - but this display suggests the gap he leaves is even bigger than Manchester City may have feared.\nGuardiola has lost quality and influence with Laporte's injury, as well as Vincent Kompany's departure, and his nightmare scenario unfolded at Carrow Road.\nStones and Otamendi had a harrowing time and City's manager will know he must now rely on the pair at least until January.\nGuardiola himself should not escape criticism for the defeat though after he left Kevin de Bruyne out of his starting team then delayed his arrival until after Norwich had re-established their two-goal lead.\nThey were mystifying decisions and a heavy price was paid.\nGuardiola will also be concerned by the manner of Norwich's goals, which ranged from poor marking at set pieces - a recurring theme - to catastrophic attempts to play out from the back.\nStones and Otamendi were nervous throughout and their lack of understanding reflected the fact they had only played together at centre-back six times in the past 20 months.\nIt would be ludicrous to start writing off the title hopes of a team so rich in quality but that five-point gap to Liverpool looks large when you consider Jurgen Klopp's team only lost once in the league last season, to City, and have won their opening five games this term.\nNorwich defy the odds\nNorwich City's resources were so thin that manager Farke made up the numbers by naming two goalkeepers on the bench as eight players were removed from his squad by injury.\nHe said he could not \"park the bus\" because he did not have enough defenders and instead the German relied on his customary intense approach - and what an occasion it gave the Canaries fans inside a bouncing Carrow Road.\nNorwich were fiercely disciplined in defence but also ambitious and confident when they had the ball, not afraid to play out from the back.\nThey had 11 high-class performers but special mention should go to Ibrahim Amadou at the back and the creative brilliance of Buendia, who pressed City into submission as he proved with the third goal.\nAt the head of it all was Pukki, on the mark once more with a poacher's strike but also unselfish when he passed across the face of goal for Cantwell.\nWhen City's inevitable charge came, Norwich were almost out on their feet but hurled their bodies around the penalty area to block shots while goalkeeper Tim Krul performed heroics when called upon.\nThis was a complete performance that will send self-belief surging through Farke's side and indeed the supporters who kept up relentless noise throughout an occasion they will remember for a very long time.\nMan of the match - Ibrahim Amadou (Norwich City)\n'A special day for us' - what they said\nNorwich City manager Daniel Farke, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Of course it is a special day for us and for the club, against one of the best teams in the world and when we have so many injuries.\n\"We had to be special in our plan for City because they are the best team in the world but we had setbacks too with our injuries. We deserve the win, we were exceptional.\n\"[Ibrahim] Amadou was beautiful today, playing in an unusual position, and a debut for Alex Tettey and Sam Byram too. I can't praise the lads enough. We had so many things to overcome.\n\"Teemu [Pukki] was brilliant, not only because of his goals but for his work rate too. Teemu always thinks about the team first, which is why he deserves all of the praise.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola on BBC Sport: \"Congrats to Norwich. The first goal was from a set-piece and the second on the counter, so credit to them. It is what it is. We have to learn from this and carry on.\n\"Our passing was not bad. We created chances but we could not score them. They are a really good team with good players with quality, we saw that in the Championship last year. They were clinical today.\n\"We did not have the urgency in the final third we normally have. In football you can't always avoid mistakes. I don't know how many shots we had or how many they had, but football is about goals and about what you do in the boxes.\"\nMan City's rare slip-up - the stats\nNorwich registered only their second win in their last 15 Premier League meetings with the reigning champions (W2 D1 L12) - their other win was also against Man City in May 2013.\nManchester City suffered a Premier League defeat against a newly-promoted opponent for the first time since March 2015 against Burnley - they had been unbeaten in 25 such matches before today, including all 18 under Pep Guardiola.\nNorwich's Teemu Pukki has been involved in eight goals (six goals, two assists) in his first five Premier League appearances - only Sergio Aguero has been involved in more goals in a player's first five appearances in the competition's history (nine).\nMan City striker Aguero became the third player to score in a team's first five Premier League matches of a season, after Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes for Arsenal in 2004-05 and Wayne Rooney for Manchester United in 2011-12.\nManchester City conceded three goals in a league match against a newly-promoted team for the first time since August 2013, when they lost 3-2 away at Cardiff City.\nNorwich's Emiliano Buend\u00eda is the first midfielder to assist as many as four goals in his first five Premier League appearances since Eden Hazard in 2012.\nManchester City conceded twice in the opening half-hour of a Premier League game for only the second time under Pep Guardiola, also doing so in December 2016 against Leicester City, when they conceded three times.\nNorwich striker Pukki is the first player to score in his first three home Premier League appearances since Alexandre Lacazette in 2017, and the first Finnish player to do so since Jonatan Johansson in 2000.\nWhat's next?\nMan City open their Champions League campaign away to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday, 18 September at 20:00 BST, before facing Watford at home in the Premier League on Saturday, 21 Septembr at 15:00.\nNorwich are back in action at the same time next Saturday when they travel to Turf Moor to play Burnley."

The Cherries are still chasing a first clean sheet of the season - that despite an impressive contribution by 21-year-old keeper Aaron Ramsdale - and it was Everton's mistakes at the back which propelled Howe's team to victory.\nThe visitors failed to deal with a corner for the first, while they were undone by another set-piece as Fraser steered his free-kick low and hard beyond a two-man wall and past Pickford.\nWilson, who scored against the United States on his England debut in November 2018, still had work to do after racing clear for the third but the composure he showed to finish will not have gone unnoticed by Southgate.\nThe England boss last played the former Coventry player in the Nations League against Switzerland on 9 June, with Wilson an unused substitute in the two games since, the European Championship qualifying wins against Bulgaria and Kosovo.\n\"Callum took his goals really well and he pressed really well,\" added Howe. \"He was an all-round threat and his second goal was a brilliant finish.\"\nAfter back-to-back 3-1 defeats by Leicester and Manchester City, this was a timely win for Bournemouth, who welcomed Lewis Cook back to the midfield for the first time since December following his recovery from a knee injury.\nHowe gave a league debut to 23-year-old defender Jack Stacey, a \u00a34m buy from Luton in the summer, as he fielded a side with an average age of 24 years and 195 days, Bournemouth's youngest starting line-up the Premier League.\nSoft under-belly hampering Everton\nEverton would have climbed above Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal into third spot with a win on the south coast.\nInstead, their season is back to square one with a top-six challenge looking some way off unless they can find greater consistency.\nMarco Silva's side flattered to deceive and were ultimately well beaten.\n\"There's a big frustration because we lost the game and gave some things too easily to our opponent,\" said Silva.\n\"Bournemouth not only won the first ball, they won the second and the third.\n\"We have a lot of work to do - we have to be more clinical, more aggressive and more solid because we cannot concede goals as easily as we did.\"\nSilva had opted to drop Moise Kean, the 19-year-old Italy forward signed for an initial fee of \u00a325.1m in the summer.\nHis replacement, Calvert-Lewin, was denied by Ramsdale when the game was goalless and cancelled out Wilson's opener with his first goal in 971 Premier League minutes following Richarlison's cross.\nRicharlison also hit the bar before the opening goal and had one final chance to score after Wilson made it 3-1.\nThe Brazilian forward had the chance to ensure a nervous finish for Bournemouth after Ramsdale had beaten away Alex Iwobi's attempt but, on an afternoon to forget for the Toffees, put the opportunity wide.\nMan of the match - Aaron Ramsdale (Bournemouth)\nDefensive worries for Everton - the stats\nEverton have conceded seven goals in their past three league games, as many as they had in their previous 13 Premier League fixtures.\nBournemouth have scored directly from a free-kick for the second time in three Premier League games - they had done so just once in their previous 154 games in the competition.\nRyan Fraser has scored three goals in three Premier League appearances against Everton at Vitality Stadium.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth return to Premier League action on Friday when they meet Southampton at St Mary's (20:00 BST) while Everton host newly promoted Sheffield United on Saturday (15:00)."

Kolasinac burst down the other end and fed Aubemeyang to rifle home.\nEven after Aubemeyang doubled Arsenal's lead Watford still sensed the visitors' weakness was in playing out from the back and they crowded around Leno and his defenders, with the high press eventually leading to Sokratis' mistake.\nThe record 31 shots Watford produced was also a record for Arsenal, who have never faced more shots since Opta began collecting records.\nThe problem for Watford is that only 10 of their shots were on target and the return of injured talisman Troy Deeney cannot come soon enough they look to climb away from the bottom of the table.\nMan of the match - Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang (Arsenal)\n'They were stronger than us' - what they said\nArsenal boss Unai Emery: \"Physically they are stronger than us so we want to break the lines from the goal-kick and connect to Mesut Ozil, like we did with the first goal.\n\"We have young players, we are working to improve and they will gain experience from matches like today. We can grow up and learn with these mistakes.\n\"We knew that 2-0 was not enough at half-time. \"\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores to Match of the Day: \"Have I missed the Premier League? Yeah. I miss all these kind of emotions - I love it.\n\"I was really happy with the performance of the players. We have one point against a very tough team. It's good for our confidence. We are positive.\"\nError prone Arsenal - the stats\nThis was the first time in 22 meetings across all competitions that Watford and Arsenal have drawn against each other, having last done so in December 1984 (1-1).\nNew Watford manager Sanchez Flores has only lost one of his eight managerial meetings with Arsenal's Unai Emery in all competitions (W3 D4 L1).\nThis was the first time that Arsenal failed to win a Premier League match in which they were at least two goals ahead since April 2016 when they drew 3-3 with West Ham, and the first time Watford avoided defeat in the league after being at least two goals behind since January 2018 v Southampton (2-2).\nSince his Premier League debut in February 2018, Arsenal forward Aubameyang has been directly involved in 46 goals in the competition (37 goals, 9 assists); only Mo Salah (53) has had a hand in more in this time.\nAubameyang has been directly involved in five goals in his four Premier League appearances against Watford, scoring four times and assisting once.\nCleverley scored his first home league goal for Watford since October 2017, which also came against Arsenal, 701 days ago.\nSince the start of last season, Arsenal's players have made a combined 14 errors leading to opposition goals in the Premier League, at least two more than any other club in this time.\nSince the start of last season, no side has conceded more goals via penalties in the Premier League than Arsenal (10 - level with Brighton), with the Gunners already having already conceded three this season alone.\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to Manchester City on Saturday, 21 September (15:00 BST), while Arsenal face Eintracht Frankfurt away in the Europa League on Thursday before hosting Aston Villa on Sunday, 22 September (16:30)."

He could have been sent off, but referee Mike Dean and the video assistant referee decided the contact was not sufficient to produce a red card.\nElsewhere, the physios were busy, as Hammers keeper Lukasz Fabianski flattened El Ghazi as he punched a cross clear, and McGinn hurt himself after tackling Sebastien Haller when Angelo Ogbonna accidentally stood on him.\nThere were five yellow cards in the game, and two of them landed to Masuaku - one in each half. The first was more straightforward, with a heavy challenge on Frederic Guilbert, who needed treatment.\nBut the second tackle to produce the red card - Dean's 102nd as a Premier League official - was a tackle on substitute Ahmed Elmohamady, who went down easily.\nBBC Radio 5 Live pundit Chris Sutton was in no doubt that it was the right decision, calling the tackle \"reckless and brainless\".\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini disagreed with the decision to send off his left-back. \"It was a typical sending off when you play away, with the pressure of the fans in every foul,\" he told BBC Sport.\nVilla captain Jack Grealish said his side \"got worse when they went down to 10 men\", adding: \"We tried to rush things and force things and gave the ball away.\"\nHis manager Dean Smith agreed, saying: \"I thought 11 v 11 we were really good and created the best chances. I expected a little better of us when they went down to 10.\n\"We never used that extra man and got rushed on the ball rather than keeping our structure.\"\nBoth sides miss decisive touch\nBoth sides had grand plans for a win - Villa had the opportunity to move two points clear of the bottom three, while West Ham could have gone third in the table.\nThe visitors had more chances, but Villa had the better ones.\nThe best opening probably fell to Villa striker Wesley, who headed wide from about six yards out after a fine Grealish cross.\nMcGinn was his usual classy self and went close with several shots from outside the box.\n\"We were brilliant defensively, with our second clean sheet in row at Villa Park,\" said Grealish. \"We need to be deadlier in front of goal. As soon as we are, everything will click into place.\"\nWest Ham's much-hyped attacking quartet of Haller, Andriy Yarmolenko, Manuel Lanzini and Felipe Anderson struggled to create many opportunities.\nMark Noble's seventh-minute snap shot, which was straight at goalkeeper Tom Heaton, proved to be their only shot on target.\n\"We played with 10 men exactly the same as 11,\" said Hammers boss Pellegrini. \"I'm very happy with the personality and performance. If you cannot win, don't lose it.\n\"We did a complete game. I want to see in every game the attitude we saw tonight. I'm happy with the way we're improving.\"\nVilla move out of the bottom three on goal difference, while West Ham are eighth.\nMan of the match - Issa Diop (West Ham)\nMatch stats - Villa's second worst start\nOnly in 1997-98 did Aston Villa accrue fewer points after the opening five games of a Premier League campaign (three) than they have managed this season (four).\nWest Ham have suffered just one defeat in their past nine top-flight games (W5 D3), after losing five of the seven before that.\nEight of the 41 Premier League meetings between Aston Villa and West Ham have ended goalless, the highest proportion (19.5%) of any fixture in the competition that's been played 30-plus times.\nSince their return to the Premier League in 2012-13, West Ham have picked up 22 red cards in the competition (level with Arsenal), with only Newcastle managing more during this period (26).\nMike Dean racked up his 102nd red card in the Premier League, 35 more than any other referee has awarded in the competition (Phil Dowd is next on 67).\nSince the start of last season, Aston Villa's Jack Grealish has been fouled 179 times in league football (including play-offs), 49 more than any other player in the top four tiers.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides play 'big six' teams on Sunday.

King played in Billing, whose perfect reverse pass was met by the youngster arriving with perfect timing to complete the job to score for the third time since joining on loan from Liverpool.\nBournemouth were resolute when Southampton finally roused themselves after the break, as they had to do, but that ever-present threat on the counter was their most potent weapon and was evident even before that communication breakdown between Gunn and Bednarek left Callum Wilson to complete the formalities.\nThis was impressive stuff from Bournemouth, who deserve to enjoy what may be a brief spell in the top three - but the fact they are never even mentioned as a club that may struggle in the Premier League is simple testimony to Howe's work.\nUnbalanced Saints deserved nothing\nSouthampton gamely battled their way into contention in the second half and occasionally threatened to grab what would have been an undeserved draw but they paid the price for a mess of a first 45 minutes.\nManager Ralph Hasenhuttl has had plenty of praise since arriving on the south coast but only he can explain the muddled thinking that left Saints totally unbalanced and a shambles for that crucial period.\nThe Austrian mysteriously played Soares, a Portugal right-back, at left-back and a central defender in Kevin Danso at right-back - with an England left-back in Ryan Bertrand on the bench.\nThe results were predictably chaotic as King ran Danso ragged and Soares, understandably, looked out of sorts in his accustomed position.\nSquare pegs. Round holes.\nHasenhuttl made the predictable adjustments at half-time, sending on Bertrand for Danso and putting Soares on the right, where he performed admirably.\nSadly for Southampton, the damage had been done and Hasenhuttl must take his share of responsibility for this disappointing defeat.\nMan of the match - Joshua King (Bournemouth)\nMatch stats - Cherries' first win at Saints\nBournemouth earned their first ever win away at Southampton in any competition, on their 16th visit (D6 L9).\nOf ever-present Premier League sides since the start of last season, Southampton have kept fewer clean sheets at home in the competition (three in 22 games at St Mary's) than any other side.\nBournemouth have won four of their last eight away league outings (D1 L3), this after having previously lost nine in succession on the road.\nBournemouth have scored more goals from set-pieces (five) than any other team in the Premier League this season (excluding penalties).\nHarry Wilson's strike was his 25th goal in English league football (excluding play-offs), with three of those coming in just five Premier League games for Bournemouth.\nSince the start of last season, no player has scored more Premier League goals for Southampton than midfielder James Ward-Prowse (eight, level with Danny Ings).\nSince the start of last season, Callum Wilson has been directly involved in 16 goals away from home in the Premier League (11 goals, 5 assists), more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nNext up for Southampton is the 'proper' South Coast derby, at Portsmouth in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday. Bournemouth go to Burton the following day.\nBoth sides have 15:00 BST kick-offs in the Premier League next Saturday, Bournemouth are at home to West Ham and Southampton are at Tottenham."

Christian Eriksen, Lucas Moura and Eric Dier all had to settle for places on the bench.\nPerhaps as a result, the visitors looked disjointed in the early stages and were fortunate not to fall behind when Ndidi's effort was chalked off.\nThere was nothing fortunate about Kane's opener 13 minutes later, however.\nThe England striker managed to latch on to Son's back-heel and despite losing his balance under Soyuncu's challenge, he somehow managed to knock the ball past Jonny Evans before lifting it over Schmeichel into the far corner.\nSpurs thought they had doubled their lead when Aurier drilled a powerful drive into the far corner, but Son was adjudged to have been marginally offside in the build-up and the goal was chalked off.\nBuoyed by that narrow decision, Leicester threw bodies forward and restored parity through Pereira, before Maddison struck with five minutes remaining to extend Spurs' winless league run away from home to nine games.\nLeicester prove top-six credentials\nAfter watching the Foxes slip to their first defeat of the campaign at Old Trafford last weekend, Leicester fans were hopeful that their team could continue their impressive home form against a Spurs side who have looked vulnerable on their travels of late.\nThey had lost their last three meetings with Tottenham in the Premier League prior to today's game, but this latest performance provided further compelling evidence that Rodgers' team can mount a serious challenge for a top-six finish this season.\nMaddison was heavily involved early on, the 22-year-old curling an effort narrowly off target from the edge of the box before firing straight at Gazzaniga from a tight angle after twisting and turning to find room for the shot.\nRodgers' side did not let their heads drop after falling behind, with Harvey Barnes and Jamie Vardy both going close to equalising before Pereira's strike midway through the second half.\nJust as the game appeared destined to end in a draw, Maddison collected Hamza Choudhury's pass before firing low into the bottom corner from a central position - all in front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate.\nThe result was no less than Maddison and his team-mates deserve and lifts the Foxes - temporarily at least - to second in the Premier League.\nMan of the match - James Maddison (Leicester)\nVAR takes centre stage - the stats\nThere were two goals disallowed by VAR in this match, while no other game in the Premier League in 2019-20 has had more than one chalked off.\nTottenham have failed to win three consecutive away Premier League games when they were leading at half-time for the first time since March 2008.\nLeicester have suffered just one defeat in their last nine Premier League home games (W6 D2), after losing four in a row directly before that.\nTottenham are without a win in their last nine away games in the Premier League (W0 D2 L7) - they last had a longer winless away run between April and December 2006 (10).\nLeicester's Ricardo Pereira scored his third goal in 41 Premier League appearances - all three have come at the King Power Stadium.\nTottenham striker Harry Kane has scored 14 goals in 13 games in all competitions against Leicester, four more than he has versus any other side in his professional career.\nSince the start of last season, Kane has scored 13 Premier League away goals, more than any other player in this period.\nLeicester's James Maddison ended a run of 31 shots in the Premier League without a goal, since netting versus Huddersfield in April.\nSpurs' Son Heung-min has been directly involved in seven goals in his last six Premier League appearances versus Leicester (4 goals, 3 assists).\n'A wonderful performance' - what the managers said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers on BBC Sport: \"It was a wonderful performance. I thought the players were outstanding. We started the game with a great tempo, which sets the emotion in the stadium.\n\"It was just a case of preparing the players mentally for the second half. We had to adapt the system at half-time. The players deserve huge credit. The quality we showed was top-class against an outstanding team.\"\n\"Some of the offside decisions - it's fine margins. Whatever the decision, you have to adapt and keep your focus on the game. The players did that very well.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino on BBC Sport: \"We dominated the game and we deserved more but that's football. It can change quickly. We need to keep working. We have a lot of games coming and we need to be ready.\n\"I'm always saying that sometimes it (VAR) benefits you and sometimes it goes against you. You can't complain afterwards. You have to accept it.\n\"Today, we were the better side but I hope they (Leicester) have a very good season. I admire Brendan Rodgers and wish them the best.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Luton Town in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, 25 September (19:45 BST), while Spurs visit Colchester United at the same time."

        "article_text": "Burnley 2-0 Norwich City: Wood double lifts the Clarets to seventh\nTwo Chris Wood goals in four first-half minutes helped Burnley to a comfortable Premier League win over Norwich at Turf Moor.\nWood's goals ensured the Clarets recorded their first win since the opening day of the season as they climbed up to seventh in the table.\nIn an opening period characterised by Norwich playing themselves into trouble at the back, Wood capitalised on some slack marking to head the hosts in front from Ashley Westwood's near-post corner.\nThe forward, who had to wait until November for his first league goal last term, then doubled his and Burnley's tally four minutes later, stroking Dwight McNeil's driven cross into the roof of the Norwich net from five yards.\nAlex Tettey's first-half withdrawal due to a groin injury compounded a bad day for Norwich, who started the day without a clutch of first-team regulars.\nThe Canaries remain on six points in 15th, two points above the bottom three.\nFollow all the Premier League action\nPragmatism wins the day\nGoing into their sixth match of the season last term, Burnley were bottom of the Premier League after collecting a solitary point as they struggled to contend with Europa League commitments, that added six games and trips to Greece and Turkey to their schedule.\nBut even without that added strain this time around, a slow start meant that this was a fixture the Clarets could ill afford not to win.\nIt was also one that was perfectly suited to their tactics and the pragmatic football manager Sean Dyche prides himself on.\nDyche, taking charge of Burnley for the 313th game to become the fourth-longest-serving manager in the club's history - encouraged his team to press their opponents from the off.\nAnd it yielded immediate dividends as Norwich's determination to play out from the back at all costs played into Burnley's hands.\nBen Godfrey's concession of a first-minute corner after sloppily losing the ball on the edge of his own penalty area was a precursor of what was to follow.\nBoth Burnley's goals came after the Canaries were caught out in a similar manner, though the first was also augmented by allowing Wood a free header a yard from goal from Westwod's delivery.\nJack Cork, Jeff Hendrick and Ashley Barnes also had chances to increase Burnley's lead before the interval as Norwich repeatedly ignored the warnings of the first 15 minutes of play.\nNorwich injury woes continue\nWhile Norwich's injury-ravaged squad defied the odds to surprise Manchester City last weekend, a trip to east Lancashire represented a totally different type of challenge for Daniel Farke's side.\nBurnley's up-and-at-them style can cause problems for the best of teams and as Norwich found to their cost, they have the capacity to clinically unpick opponents' mistakes.\nThe Canaries were also not helped by their chronic injury list, with 10 senior players unavailable and others like midfielder Ibrahim Amadou deployed out of position.\nCameroon-born Amadou, who endured a difficult afternoon throughout exposed to the bustling presence of both Wood and Barnes, was fortunate to escape a second yellow card after fouling Jay Rodriguez late on.\nWhile former Borussia Dortmund midfielder Moritz Leitner showed some nice touches on his return from a calf complaint after replacing Tettey, a concern to Farke is the condition of goalkeeper Tim Krul.\nThe 31-year-old Netherlands international managed to get through the game but could now be set to join Norwich's casualty list after injuring his back in the warm-up.\nMan of the match - Chris Wood (Burnley)\n'It was a very dominant performance' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I feel very happy with the display, not just with the win. It was a very dominant performance from the first whistle to the last.\n\"We broke their play up early and scored two good goals. We didn't look in any trouble and a small gripe would be that we should have scored more on the counter.\"\nOn Chris Wood's first goals of the season: \"There is a lot of competition for places up front here. Ashley Barnes has been among the goals, Chris has probably been a bit unlucky but I'm really pleased for him. His second today was an excellent goal after a great run and finish.\"\nOn becoming the fourth longest-serving manager in Burnley's history: \"I'm proud of it and on behalf of my staff too. There have been lots of great managers at this club so I'm delighted to make that list.\"\nNorwich boss Daniel Farke: \"It was a close game - we had more possession, they had a few more shots. We had a good first chance and if we had taken the lead it would have changed the game. Our attitude was reactive, and not proactive and we invited pressure in the first 15 minutes. We were one step too late.\n\"We have a lot of injuries which is not easy but we should have started more on the front foot. My captain was injured after just a few minutes and that influenced us.\"\nWood's aerial threat - the stats\nBurnley have won five consecutive Premier League games against newly-promoted sides, their joint-best winning run against such opposition in the top flight, having also won five in a row in October 1898, September 1921 and September 1956.\nNorwich have conceded 14 goals from their opening six Premier League games this season, their highest such tally at this stage of a league campaign since 1963-64 in the second tier (also 14).\nBurnley have won six consecutive league meetings with Norwich at Turf Moor, their best winning streak at home against the Canaries in the top four tiers of English football.\nNorwich have now lost 16 of their last 18 away outings in the Premier League (W2), conceding 38 goals in this run while scoring only eight in reply.\nFive of Chris Wood's last six Premier League goals for Burnley have been headed, with four of those coming via corners.\nWood scored his first Premier League goals for Burnley since he also bagged a brace against Cardiff in April, ending a run of nine league appearances without scoring for the striker.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Aston Villa for their next Premier League game on Saturday 28 September (15:00 BST). Norwich are also on the road for their next Premier League fixture, visiting Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace, also on Saturday 28 September (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Everton 0-2 Sheffield United: Blades hold firm to stun Toffees\nSheffield United won away for the first time on their return to the Premier League as a Yerry Mina own goal and a late Lys Mousset strike condemned Everton to defeat at Goodison Park.\nThe Toffees had won their first two games on home soil this season and dominated for large periods of this game as they looked to bounce back from defeat at Bournemouth last time out.\nHowever, they fell behind five minutes before the break when a ball from an Oliver Norwood corner deflected off Mina to land in the back of the net.\nThe Blades withstood huge pressure as the home side looked to rescue something from the game and, although Bernard had a penalty appeal waved away, Everton struggled to find a way through a resolute defence.\nChris Wilder's side made certain of a superb away victory when substitute Mousset raced through before calmly slotting beyond Jordan Pickford for his first Sheffield United goal.\nThe win means Sheffield United move up to eighth with eight points, four clear of the relegation zone. Everton, who were booed at the final whistle, are 14th with six points.\nResolute Blades enjoying life on the road\nSheffield United made a strong start to life back in the Premier League, with four points from their first two games. But home defeats to Leicester and Southampton suggested the early momentum was on the wane.\nThe Blades have, however, been a tough side to defeat on the road, with Chris Wilder's side unbeaten away from home since the middle of January.\nThey showed great resilience to come back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Chelsea in their last away game, and they executed their game plan superbly against an Everton side that until Saturday had a 100% record on home soil this season.\nThe visitors' back three of John Egan, Jack O'Connell and Chris Basham were superb throughout, limiting Everton to mostly half-chances. On the few occasions the home side did get through, Dean Henderson put in a commanding performance in the Sheffield United goal.\nHome form is always key to a side's hopes of avoiding relegation, but the South Yorkshire club's strong away displays will stand them in good stead to avoid an immediate drop back to the Championship.\nConsistency key for up-and-down Everton\nInconsistency has been a concern for Everton this season, with the Blues following up good performances with disappointing ones.\nThey have collected just one point from a possible nine on the road, but at Goodison the Toffees had been strong, and this game presented an opportunity for Marco Silva's side to make it three wins from three.\nEverton dominated from the outset with their attacking quartet of Richarlison, Moise Kean, Bernard and Gylfi Sigurdsson at times linking up excellently.\nHowever, their defence had shipped seven goals in their previous three games and they were once again suspect at the back on the rare occasions Sheffield United got into the Everton half. Passes often went astray while they dithered on the ball inside their own box for far longer than the home fans were comfortable with.\nUnder Silva, Everton have conceded more goals from set pieces than any other side in the Premier League, so for Sheffield United's goal to have come from a corner perhaps came as little surprise.\nBut a concerning statistic for Everton fans is that their side has never come from behind to win during Silva's tenure, and as this game wore on they became increasingly desperate in their search for an equaliser.\nMan of the match - John Egan (Sheffield United)\nBlades maintain impressive away run - the stats\nEverton have conceded at least two goals in each of their last five games, something Silva will need to rectify soon, particularly with free-scoring Manchester City their next opponents at Goodison Park.\nEverton have lost four of their last five Premier League games against promoted sides (W1), as many as they had in their previous 45 in the competition (W25 D16).\nSheffield United are unbeaten in 12 away league games, stretching back to last season (W5 D7). Only once before have they enjoyed a longer run on the road without defeat in the league (a 15-game streak ending in April 2009).\nEverton's defeat ended a run of six straight Premier League home victories, with the Toffees conceding at Goodison Park in consecutive league games for the first time since February.\nSince the start of last season, only Wycombe Wanderers (6) have benefited from more own-goals in English league football than Sheffield United (5).\nSheffield United had to wait until the 73rd minute for their first shot of the game, courtesy of an off-target effort from Chris Basham.\nLys Mousset's goal was just his fourth in his 61 Premier League appearances and his first for Sheffield United (3 appearances).\n'Not good enough' - what the managers said\nEverton manager Marco Silva, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was a tough game for us. Of course we didn't deserve the result but when you make mistakes like we did this afternoon you don't get what you deserve.\n\"For the second goal it should have been easy for our defenders to clear the ball. The second half was bad - not good enough. We need to show more and try new things.\n\"Some individual performances were not at the level we expect, but that's part of the game. The key moment for me was the mistake we made in the first goal.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder, speaking to MOTD: \"We're delighted. It was just a ridiculous game. That's possibly the worst we've played all season. We didn't play anything like our best today but managed to win the game.\n\"Everton put a lot of balls in our box, which opened us up a bit in the first half. Out of possession we were really good. The goalkeeper and our three defenders did really well. I think they had a million corners today.\n\"We rode our luck a little bit - we certainly didn't have any last week. Everybody says that to stay in the Premier League, your home form has to be spot on. We've reversed that thought process.\"\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup on Tuesday (19:45 BST), while Sheffield United are at home to Sunderland in the same competition on Wednesday (19:45 BST)."

        "article_text": "Man City 8-0 Watford: Pep Guardiola's side silence critics in emphatic style\nEven by Manchester City's standards, Saturday was quite a statement.\nAt the start of the week, the defending champions were supposedly in crisis - falling five points behind Liverpool after the shock of being beaten at Norwich, then losing one of their two remaining fit senior centre-halves to injury.\nIt was only one defeat but suddenly there were major doubts about City's defending and, with it, their prospects this season were supposedly fading fast.\nFor some observers, it was easy to see what had gone wrong - they should have replaced Vincent Kompany, they would not cope without Aymeric Laporte and now John Stones too, and, even in mid-September, they had already conceded too much ground in a title race where even the smallest margins matter.\nAt least, that is how the discussions went. Typically, Pep Guardiola's side reacted by silencing their critics, and in emphatic style.\nWednesday's 3-0 away Champions League win over Shakhtar Donetsk was an impressive start, in what was City's toughest fixture in Group C.\nWatford were next. But while the visit of the bottom-of-the-table Hornets on Saturday was expected to be straightforward enough, nobody anticipated the total destruction that followed.\nEven Guardiola, who is notoriously hard to please, admitted his side were a \"joy to watch\" in their 8-0 victory, their biggest in the league in his time at City.\nThere are tougher tests to come, of course, but this was exactly the response he was looking for - and a message to Liverpool too.\nThe Reds can restore their advantage at the top by beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, but they will go into that game knowing City are back at their best, and on their tail again.\nCriticism flows for 'pathetic' Watford after Man City mauling\n'The important thing is how we react'\nWe have seen before that City know how to deal with defeats, no matter how rarely they happen.\nAfter their only previous Premier League loss in 2019, against Newcastle on 29 January, they responded by winning all 15 of their remaining league games to clinch the title.\nThat run demonstrated City's resolve and mental strength - this week has just been another example.\n\"People still don't understand - journalists, pundits, former players - that losing games is part of life,\" Guardiola said after his side had taken Watford apart.\n\"Opponents always deserve respect. The same feeling I have now, I had after Norwich, so it was not a bad performance last week.\n\"We can lose the games, but the important thing is the approach and how we react.\"\nCity play with a point to prove\nRight from the start on a sunny afternoon at Etihad Stadium, City played like they had a point to prove.\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores neatly summed up his side's painful afternoon afterwards, saying \"after 30 seconds we realised it would be tough, after 10 minutes really difficult and after 15 minutes it was impossible\".\nSome City fans were not in the stadium by the time David Silva slid his side ahead inside the first minute, and with five goals to celebrate, none of them were ever in their seats for long in the first 18 minutes of the match.\n\"It is not normal to score five goals with five shots like we did,\" Guardiola said afterwards. \"But the quality of the players up front made a difference.\"\nThey certainly did. Even without Raheem Sterling, who was rested and left on the bench after previously playing every minute of the season, City were in unstoppable mood.\nWith Kevin de Bruyne pulling the strings, Bernardo Silva and David Silva turning on the style and Sergio Aguero finding space behind the Watford defence, more chances and goals followed.\nIn truth, City should have ended up with more than eight given the barrage they launched on the Watford goal - it was easy to lose count of the opportunities they spurned, but Aguero missed the target when clean through and hit the post with a header, while Riyad Mahrez also nodded against the woodwork.\nEven so, it was a sign of the appetite of this City side that they were pushing forward for more goals in the final minutes, apparently without knowing that they were close to the Premier League record win, Manchester United's 9-0 demolition of Ipswich in 1995.\nGuardiola was seemingly unaware of it afterwards, saying: \"I didn't know the record. Who is it? They deserve it, congratulations.\"\nPositives at the back for City too\nAs formidable as City's attack was, they were far from flawless at the back, the way Gerard Deulofeu danced past Nicolas Otamendi to force a fine save from Ederson with the score at 1-0 being a case in point.\nBut there were still positives to take from their defensive display, and not just because they emerged with another clean sheet.\nGuardiola gave more game-time to Otamendi and Fernandinho together, his first-choice pairing at the back for the foreseeable future, and was able to bring highly rated teenage defender Eric Garcia off the bench for his Premier League debut too.\nThe 18-year-old Spaniard replaced Otamendi for the final 30 minutes, will start against Preston in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night, and looks set to play a bigger role in the coming weeks, whether City get more injuries or not.\nHe seems to have impressed his manager, even before he stepped on to the pitch.\n\"Eric is so clever,\" Guardiola said afterwards. \"I did not know before the game whether Watford would play four or five at the back, but he came and told me after the warm-up that they had made movements with a four.\n\"He was the guy who was looking at the opponent and paid incredible attention. He played well and with the problems we have at the back, he is going to play a lot of minutes because I trust him a lot.\""

Empty seats could be seen all round St James' Park, a mix of protests against Mike Ashley's ownership and apathy at how the club are playing.\nThey had four efforts on target, all routine saves for Mat Ryan. The two loudest roars before the 80th minute were for two Miguel Almiron shots, which Brighton's keeper dealt with easily. Their former record signing at \u00a320m has yet to score since his January arrival from Atlanta United.\nBut the roof came off when Carroll came on for his first appearance for his hometown club since a \u00a335m move to Liverpool almost nine years ago.\nBruce's side had the more attacking intent in the closing stages, Brighton were hanging on at the end, but at the same time the Magpies never really looked like adding to their four Premier League goals this season.\nThey continue their record of having the least amount of possession among all Premier League clubs. Their 29.3% of time on the ball took their average down from 33%.\nBrighton toothless once again\nSame old story for Brighton this season. They are a completely different side under Graham Potter than they were under Chris Hughton despite having most of the same players - demonstrated by Hughton's old favourite Shane Duffy being left on the bench.\nBut they struggle in front of goal. They had so much of the ball but Neal Maupay's ninth-minute effort, where he tried to beat Martin Dubravka at his near post, and Yves Bissouma's low drive in the 86th minute were the only saves the Newcastle keeper had to make.\nPremier League debutant Steven Alzate was bright up front and Irish youngster Connolly was lively when he came on. The substitute was so unlucky to see his shot acrobatically cleared away by Schar millimetres away from crossing the line.\nBut it was all style and little substance and they were hanging on at the end. A better team than Newcastle would have put them away.\nThe football was attractive - all three centre-backs were involved in moves all over the pitch - but the fact remains that they have won once in the league, the same as Newcastle.\nMan of the match - Lewis Dunk (Brighton)\n'We got away with one' - manager quotes\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce: \"We found it very difficult. We knew Brighton would come and want to take the football and basically we couldn't get after it well enough. In the second half we changed a few things and if anyone was going to win the game I thought it would be us.\n\"The Achilles heel is that we have to take big chances when we get them.\n\"We couldn't wait to get them in at half-time. We didn't deal with Brighton who kept the ball very well and they made it a difficult evening for us. We got away with one.\"\nBrighton manager Graham Potter: \"I'm a bit frustrated. I thought our performance was really good. We had one cleared off the line and got into their box often.\n\"Andy Carroll came on and made things frantic at the end, but I'm delighted with the performance and felt we deserved three points.\n\"We need to maintain that and try and improve. We've been playing quite well. We're disappointed with the points tally and disappointed with the result today.\n\"The players have got a resilience, character and organisation to defend the box when they need to. We're lucky that we've got that foundation. They try their best every day, which away in the Premier League is not so easy to do.\"\nMatch stats - Brighton's struggle for goals\nAfter winning five consecutive home Premier League games between January and March, Newcastle have enjoyed only one win in their last six at St James' Park (W1 D2 L3).\nBrighton are unbeaten in all five of their Premier League meetings with Newcastle (W2 D3), their joint-best record without defeat against an opponent in the competition (also five v West Ham).\nBrighton have won just one of their last 15 Premier League matches (W1 D6 L8), scoring eight goals and drawing a blank on nine occasions.\nBrighton have failed to find the back of the net in 33 Premier League games since the start of the 2017-18 season, the most of any ever-present side in that time.\nFour of Brighton's six Premier League games this season have been goalless at half-time, the most of any side in the division.\nSince their promotion to the Premier League for the 2017-18 season, Brighton have seen eight of their games finish goalless, with only Crystal Palace and Southampton involved in more 0-0 fixtures.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle go to in-form Leicester in the Premier League next Sunday (16:30 BST).

United's match-winner against the Kazakh side - unavailable due to tonsillitis.\nRashford, who had gone five matches without a goal in open play before today, looked short on confidence throughout, failing to register a single shot before going off injured just after the hour mark.\nThe injury capped a deeply frustrating afternoon for Solskjaer, whose side looked lacklustre, lethargic and short of ideas in the final third.\nMatic's long-range drive, which was easily held by Lukas Fabianski, was the closest they came to a goal in a forgettable first half.\nThe visitors improved marginally in the second and should have restored parity when Mata got on the end of Pereira's delivery, but the veteran midfielder somehow managed to steer the ball wide from point-blank range.\nHarry Maguire also went close to bringing the visitors level before West Ham's second goal, firing straight at Fabianski after the Hammers had failed to clear a corner.\nThe defeat extends Manchester United's poor away form - their last league victory on their travels came at Crystal Palace on 27 February.\nYarmolenko stars for Hammers\nPellegrini's charges were bottom of the table after four matches last season, but Sunday's result lifts them three points above Solskjaer's side in the standings - a mark of their progress under the Chilean's stewardship.\nThe Hammers have now kept four successive clean sheets in all competitions, while summer signing Sebastien Haller and fit-again Yarmolenko have shown considerable promise up front in recent weeks.\nYarmolenko was a constant menace, breaking the deadlock with a composed finish and registering more shots than anyone else on the pitch.\nThe Ukrainian nearly set up West Ham's second midway through the second half, but Felipe Anderson - who endured a disappointing afternoon - fired straight at De Gea from a tight angle.\nThe game remained on a knife edge until the 84th minute, when Cresswell's sublime free-kick - his first goal since April 2018 - sealed the points for the home side.\nThe result moves Pellegrini's team level on points with third-placed Leicester.\nMan of the match - Andriy Yarmolenko (West Ham)\nMan Utd vulnerable on their travels - the stats\nAfter winning each of his first nine away games in all competitions as Man Utd boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has failed to win in the following nine (D3 L6).\nWest Ham have won three of their last five Premier League home games against Man Utd (D1 L1), as many as they had in their previous 23 home games against them in the top flight (W3 D11 L9).\nManuel Pellegrini is the first manager to win a Premier League game against four different Manchester United managers (David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer).\nMan Utd have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their last 11 away matches in all competitions, their worst run since conceding in 14 consecutive matches between April and December 2002.\nMan Utd have lost seven of their last 15 Premier League games (W4 D4 L7), as many defeats as they had recorded in their previous 40 matches in the competition (W25 D8 L7).\nSince the start of the 2011-12 season, David de Gea has conceded more Premier League goals from direct free-kicks than any other goalkeeper (12).\nFelipe Anderson has been directly involved in 15 Premier League goals for West Ham since the beginning of last season (9 goals, 6 assists) - more than any other Hammer in that period.\n'We're just all very flat' - what the managers said\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The international break was important for us because we had all the defenders and worked a lot to be more concentrated, to make better tackles and better movements.\n\"I think we must try to beat Bournemouth 1-0 in our next league game and then see what happens. We're not thinking about the future.\"\nMan Utd manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm very disappointed. You're always disappointed when you lose games. This was a game that we could have won. Going home tonight we'll go through the game again. At the moment we're just all very flat.\n\"Key moments went against us. They had some great finishes. We just didn't have the quality when we had those big moments. In the Premier League if you don't take them you won't get any points. It tipped in their favour and we just have to accept that.\n\"I'm disappointed we didn't win today, but apart from that I'm being very positive. I've said many times that there will be highs and lows. We've had some highs along the way, today we just have to accept we got no points and look forward to next week.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to Oxford United in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, 25 September (19:45 BST) before visiting Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, 28 September (15:00 BST).\nAfter hosting Rochdale in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday (20:00 BST), Man Utd welcome Arsenal to Old Trafford in their next league game on Monday 30 September (20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Diogo Jota's late goal rescues point for visitors\nWolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo says his team's dramatic draw at Crystal Palace is the \"starting point\" for their Premier League recovery.\nWolves appeared set for a fourth consecutive defeat across all competitions until Diogo Jota's stoppage-time goal rescued a point.\nDespite the draw, they remain 19th and remain winless after six top-flight matches but the nature of their fightback - completed in the 96th minute and made more difficult by Romain Saiss's dismissal for two yellow cards - has given Nuno optimism.\n\"This is football. We have the spirit, the heart and the character to believe until the end,\" said Nuno, whose side have regular Thursday night Europa League matches adding to their fixture list this season.\n\"The boys were running up and down and tired. The growing of the team relies on these kind of aspects. We are in the situation where we play Thursday and Sunday.\"\n\"This is a starting point. What we did in the first half, lets try to do over and over again.\"\nLeander Dendoncker's own goal had put Palace in front, with the unfortunate Belgian midfielder diverting Joel Ward's wayward shot past Rui Patricio.\nBut Wolves, who enjoyed the better of the first half with Dendoncker, Matt Doherty and Jota all having chances to open the scoring, merited their point.\nThe equaliser came through Wilfried Zaha's failure to maintain possession for Palace, Adama Traore galloping clear on the right, with his far-post cross poked home by Jota from four yards as defender Ward lost his balance.\nThat denied Roy Hodgson's Palace side, who move up to 12th in the table, a fourth win in five matches against Wolves, a win could also have moved them into the top six.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nWolves show quality needed to get out of trouble\nWhile Nuno has not shown signs of being a man under pressure, the way in which the visiting bench exuberantly celebrated Jota's last-gasp goal told a different story.\nIt had looked like being another miserable afternoon for the Black Country side, who had arrived in London having failed to win any of their opening five top-flight fixtures.\nOn every occasion that has happened to them in the past, relegation has followed - 2003-04, 1983-84, 1975-76, 1964-65, 1905-06 - but the way in which his side rallied suggests Nuno's team have the quality and heart to avoid the same fate.\nWith Ruben Neves relegated to the substitutes bench, captain Conor Coady assumed the early responsibility for orchestrating Wolves' attacking play from the centre of defence.\nThe former midfielder, who was converted into the central figure of Wolves' three-man defence when Nuno arrived in 2017, sprayed several raking cross-field passes to initiate openings.\nIn the first half, there were few signs of a lack of confidence or fatigue - Wolves have now completed 13 matches this season, almost double the number of most of their domestic rivals.\nDoherty's header forced Palace keeper Vicente Guaita into a fine stop, while Dendoncker's close-range strike was blocked close to the Palace goalline.\nBut it was their attitude to adversity which stood out, as they persevered despite being a man and a goal down in the last 20 minutes.\nSubstitute Neves curled a right-footed shot just wide while Jota and Traore both saw efforts blocked by a posse of home defenders before Jota's goal.\nPalace revert back to type\nAfter a humbling 4-0 reverse at Tottenham this was very much a Palace performance that reverted back to Roy Hodgson's blueprint of defensive discipline and organisation.\nForward-thinking midfielder Andros Townsend was sacrificed for James McArthur in the starting XI as the former England manager again deployed a five-man midfield but this time with personnel capable of stifling the opposition.\nAnd that strategy worked during the first period - albeit aided by some errant Wolves finishing - as the teams largely cancelled each other out.\nThe problem for Hodgson arrived once Ward's deflected strike and Saiss' dismissal put Palace in complete command.\nLuka Milivojevic and Kouyate both saw shots from distance deflected behind while substitute Christian Benteke and Jeffrey Schlupp forced Patricio into one-versus-one saves.\nBut they were simply unable to kill off the game and in committing men forward to do so they showed a lack of game management as they left themselves open to Wolves on the counter-attack.\n\"I am bitterly disappointed,\" Hodgson said.\n\"It feels like a defeat. I didn't expect them to get such a clear goal chance. You want game management and players to use experience to see games through but the feeling is one of disappointment and anguish that we weren't able to see the game through. We have surrendered two points.\"\nMan of the match - Diogo Jota (Wolves)\nCapital gains for Wolves - the stats\nCrystal Palace haven't lost any of their last 10 Premier League games against sides starting the day in the bottom three (P10 W7 D3 L0) since a 0-4 defeat to Sunderland in February 2017.\nFollowing Diogo Jota's late equaliser, Wolves remain unbeaten in their seven Premier League games in London since their promotion back to the top-flight in 2018, winning three and drawing four of those games.\nCrystal Palace (P6 W2 D2 L2) have won eight points from their opening six Premier League games this season, their most after six games since the 2016-17 season (10 points).\nWolves have conceded five own-goals in the Premier League since their return to the competition in August 2018, the joint-most alongside Burnley in that timeframe (Conor Coady (3), Matt Doherty (1) and Leander Dendoncker (1).\nSince making his Premier League debut in December 2013, Wilfried Zaha has induced six opposition red cards - the most of any player. Romain Sa\u00efss became the eighth Moroccan to receive a red card in the competition.\nLeander Dendoncker's own goal was Crystal Palace's 100th goal in the Premier League under Roy Hodgson - the first time the Eagles have scored as many under one manager and the first club he has managed in the competition to reach this total.\nWolves have made one more change to their staring XI after six Premier League games this season (12) than they did through their first 16 games in the competition last season (11).\nDiogo Jota's goal for Wolves (94:53) is the latest Crystal Palace have conceded at Selhurst Park in the Premier League since March 2016, when current striker Christian Benteke netted for Liverpool (95:10).\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace face Norwich at Selhurst Park in their next Premier League fixture on Saturday 28 September (15:00 BST).\nWolves host Reading in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday 25 September (19:45 BST) before resuming their Premier League duties at Molineux against Watford on Saturday 28 September (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-2 Aston Villa: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's late free-kick seals comeback win\nUnai Emery praised Arsenal's \"amazing\" team spirit but admits his side have to improve defensively after twice coming from behind to beat Aston Villa in a pulsating encounter at Emirates Stadium.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang's stunning free-kick with six minutes remaining completed an unlikely turnaround for the Gunners, who had Ainsley Maitland-Niles sent off in the first half and were still trailing going into the final 10 minutes.\n\"The team spirit was amazing, we need to continue working and improving things,\" said the Arsenal boss.\n\"Aston Villa is a good team and an organised team. After this I hope we can improve and be strong. Together with the supporters we will be strong for the matches and hopefully improve.\n\"It is our challenge to improve defensively. They didn't have a lot of chances to score.\"\nJohn McGinn flicked home Anwar El Ghazi's cross to put Villa ahead in the first half before Maitland-Niles was shown a second yellow card for a rash challenge on Neil Taylor four minutes before the break.\nArsenal levelled early in the second period thanks to Nicolas Pepe's first goal for the club from the penalty spot only for Wesley to restore Villa's lead from Jack Grealish's low cross less than two minutes later.\nBut in a thrilling conclusion, substitute Calum Chambers' close-range finish brought the Gunners level on 81 minutes before Aubameyang's late strike secured their third Premier League win of the season to lift Emery's side back into the top four.\nThe result was harsh on Villa, who impressed for long periods but paid the price for dropping far too deep in the closing stages and inviting Arsenal pressure. A fourth defeat from six league games means they remain in the bottom three.\nFollow all the reaction to Sunday's Premier League games\nThrilling finish masks Arsenal's defensive shortcomings\nAfter opting for a mix of youth and experience for Thursday's Europa League win at Eintracht Frankfurt, Emery recalled the bulk of his senior stars for the meeting with Villa.\nThat meant the Spaniard went with the same back four that lost a two-goal lead at Watford last weekend, and another shaky performance here means they have still not kept a clean sheet in the league since the opening day of the season, conceding 10 goals in five games.\nThe defensive problems ultimately did not cost them the result against Villa, but Emery cannot rely on his attacking players to bail out his team all the time if they are to make a sustained challenge for the top four.\nA lack of urgency and desire to close the Villa players down led to the opening goal, with El Ghazi given plenty of time to cross for McGinn, who found himself completely unmarked after ghosting ahead of Matteo Guendouzi.\nGuendouzi summed up Arsenal's performance, he was often sloppy in possession and his failure to track McGinn led to the first goal, but he led by example in the closing stages with a series of driving runs into the penalty area.\nOne of those runs resulted in a sloppy tackle from Bjorn Engels, allowing Pepe to equalise from the spot early in the second half.\nAfter Arsenal went behind again Guendouzi drew a fine save from Tom Heaton, who pushed his low drive from the edge of the box on to the post.\nWith Villa seemingly unable to get out of their final third, Arsenal's pressure finally told.\nA mistake by Tyone Mings allowed Chambers, brought on in response to Maitland-Niles' dismissal, to stab a looping effort beyond Heaton.\nThen, after Aubameyang was brought down just outside the area, the Gabon striker curled beyond an unmoved Heaton to send the Emirates crowd, who were frustrated for much of the afternoon, into raptures.\nEmery defends Xhaka\nEmery also defended midfielder Granit Xhaka, who was jeered by some sections of the home support when he was substituted after 72 minutes.\n\"My opinion is we need our supporters and we need our supporters helping each player,\" added the Gunners boss. \"Today I changed him because he played 90 minutes on Thursday. I preferred a fresh player. But for me he is a very important player for us.\n\"He has a big commitment here. I am sure he is going to achieve the best things. We are professional. He is an experienced player.\n\"He knows sometimes we are criticised. We need to be mature and continue working. I am going to support him. He's a good player.\"\nVilla left to rue late collapse\nWhile Arsenal went into the game with concerns about their defence, Aston Villa had worries about their attack after failing to score in each of their last two matches.\nThey looked much more potent here, but were left to rue defensive mistakes that led to all three Arsenal goals.\n\"I am bitterly disappointed,\" said Villa boss Dean Smith. \"We lost our structure for periods in the second half. First half we were on the front foot and looked solid. It is always going to be a tough game but we will never get a better chance to win.\"\nAnwar El Ghazi and Trezeguet, playing either side of striker Wesley, found plenty of space on the flanks, with Arsenal full-backs Maitland-Niles and Sead Kolasinac regularly exposed.\nEgypt international winger Trezeguet, back in the side after a one-match ban, set up McGinn for an early effort on target while it was El Ghazi's delivery from the other flank that led the opening goal.\nAfter Pepe's penalty brought Arsenal level, Villa showed great spirit to immediately go up the other end to re-take the lead thanks to some fine work by Grealish down the left and a smart finish by Wesley, his second goal for Villa since joining from Club Brugge in the summer.\nWith Arsenal pushing forward, Villa nearly caught them on the counter when Trezeguet was played in the right-hand side of the area, but he could only fire straight at Leno.\nFour minutes later, Smith replaced Trezeguet with the more defensively minded Ahmed El Mohamady in an attempt to shore things up, but that only served to invite Arsenal pressure.\nMings, whose form this season saw him called up to the England squad, was punished for a poor header on the edge of his six yard box for Chambers' equaliser.\nHis defensive partner Engels, whose foul also led to Arsenal's penalty, then hacked down Aubameyang right on the edge of the penalty area, with the Gunners forward converting the free-kick to put the home side in front for the first time in the game.\nVilla had a penalty claim turned down by Jonathan Moss in the 89th minute when substitute Conor Hourihane's shot hit the arm of Sokratis, with a VAR check backing the referee's decision.\n\"The game became too open with them at 10 men,\" added Smith. \"We lost our fearlessness but for some reason we retracted second half and put us under pressure. We scored again and had a good five minute spell but retracted again.\n\"The players lost a bit of belief and that is what disappointed me the most.\"\nMan of the match - Matteo Guendouzi\nWe have had a real good go - what they said\nArsenal boss Unai Emery, speaking to BBC MOTD: \"In 90 minutes a lot of things happened. When it was 11 v 11 we didn't control the match how we wanted because we lost a lot of balls in the middle and gave them chances in the transition. When we could attack and get the ball in the box we weren't bad really and we were also creating chances to score.\n\"After the goal we could be calm and improve and the red card changed the idea. For the second half we needed to play first with the head but also with our heart. We needed supporters pushing us and us to take some risks.\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith, speaking to BBC MOTD: \"You look at the goals we conceded and they are sloppy. We concede a penalty and give a free-kick away. Second goal, Tyrone Mings has cushioned a header to Neil Taylor and should have put it out for a corner.\n\"I thought it was penalty [for handball against Sokratis]. He leant towards the ball, which was going towards the goal. It has hit his arm so I don't know why it wasn't. But if you're asking about handballs in the box these days, I don't know and I don't think anyone knows. We have seen some subjective ones. If they get a good view on the TV screens they need to overrule the on-field referee.\"\nOn his side's form: \"There is no big concern. We have had a real good go. Apart from Man City and Liverpool I don't fear anyone in this league.\"\nVilla score first but lose again - best of the stats\nArsenal's 3-2 win over Aston Villa was only the ninth occasion in Premier League history a team has won a match after receiving a red card while losing - three of those wins have been by Arsenal (also v Derby in 1997 and Bolton in 2008).\nArsenal won a Premier League game they were trailing in at half time for the first time since December 2018 (4-2 v Spurs at the Emirates).\nAston Villa haven't won any of their last five Premier League away games when scoring first (D1 L4), suffering defeats in each of their two such games in 2019-20 (1-3 v Spurs and 2-3 v Arsenal).\nArsenal have only kept one clean sheet in their last 10 games against newly-promoted teams in the Premier League (1-0 v Huddersfield in May 2018), including none in their seven such games under Unai Emery.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored 16 goals in his last 16 games across all competitions for Arsenal, including in each of the last four games in a row (five goals).\nArsenal's Nicolas Pepe has converted 10 penalties since the start of last season within the top five European leagues; the joint-most of any player in this period, along with Luka Milivojevic and Fabio Quagliarella.\nSince making his debut for Aston Villa in August 2018, John McGinn has scored nine goals in league competition - no other current player at the club has netted more (Jonathan Kodjia also with nine).\nBukayo Saka became the third-youngest player on the day of his first Premier League start for Arsenal, with only Cesc F\u00e1bregas (17y 104d) and Theo Walcott (17y 212d) doing so at a younger age.\nAinsley Maitland-Niles has now been sent off twice in the Premier League in 2019; the first Arsenal player to receive multiple red cards in the competition in the same year since Laurent Koscielny in 2013 (also two).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host Nottingham Forest in Carabao Cup third round on Tuesday with Aston Villa travelling to Brighton the following day (both 19:45 BST kick-offs).\nVilla then return to Premier League action at home to Burnley next Saturday (15:00 BST) with Arsenal taking on Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday 30 September.

It's a big win,\" Klopp added.\n\"The boys did really well, they fought really hard. I don't think there is any other way to win here.

Liverpool's bandwagon rolls on.\nChelsea and Lampard can take heart\nChelsea have still to win at home in the Premier League and Champions League this season, and no defeat by Liverpool is anything other than an acutely painful experience.\nAnd yet, despite this loss coming hard on the heels of the home defeat by Valencia in their opening Champions League group game, Chelsea manager Frank Lampard will take great comfort and confidence from the performance of his team.\nThis is a new Chelsea, leaning heavily on youngsters such as Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Abraham, and being built in a new style by Lampard.\nWhen Liverpool went two up through Firmino's header after poor marking at a free-kick, the goal coming moments after Azpilicueta's apparent equaliser had been overruled by VAR, it would have been easy for Chelsea's heads to drop.\nNothing could have been further from the truth as they pressed and pressurised Liverpool until the final whistle before receiving a warm and appreciative ovation from the Chelsea supporters.\nGoalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga may have kept them in it with a magnificent save from Firmino but Chelsea, driven by the magnificent Kante, were left cursing those late missed opportunities for Batshuayi and Mount that could have earned them a point.\nNo Chelsea defeat is easy to take, especially against Liverpool, but this was a performance that will give Lampard hope and encouragement.\nMan of the Match - N'Golo Kante (Chelsea)\nWe have to carry on - what they said\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard: \"Performance-wise we were the better team.

But the boys worked so hard for it.\"\nKlopp's side were far from their best in South Yorkshire - and left thankful that the hosts could not find a way through in a game where they matched the European champions in many respects.\nSubstitute Leon Clarke, making his Premier League debut at the age of 34, should have levelled it late on, but blazed over.\nLiverpool have won their first seven league games of the season, and have a five-point lead at the top of the early season table.\nReaction to Sheffield United v Liverpool, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v former Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas\nWhen the story of the 2019-20 season is told, this may be looked back on as one of Liverpool's most crucial but most fortunate victories.\nThe first half, though goalless, was thrilling. For all of the visitors' early pressure, it was Chris Wilder's side who had the first sight of goal when Ollie McBurnie stung the palms of Adrian.\nLiverpool's first clear chance came as a result of a long ball over the top from Virgil van Dijk, but Sadio Mane's finish when through on goal was wild and wayward, while the Senegal forward later struck the post.\nAfter the break, United may have hit the front, but for alert defending from Joel Matip and Andrew Robertson to frustrate the enthusiastic John Lundstram.\nAt the other end, when a penalty appeal for Lundstram's challenge on Mane was denied, it seemed that Liverpool may have to settle for a point.\nWith time running out, the Merseysiders withdrew Jordan Henderson for Divock Origi, and the move to a 4-2-3-1 formation ultimately paid off when Wijnaldum's shot snuck in.\nReds ride their luck\nEarlier this week, the Champions League winners were told they had failed in their attempt to copyright the word Liverpool. This performance lacked their usual trademarks too.\nIndeed, they were lucky not to be punished when Matip and Trent Alexander-Arnold coughed up possession early on.\nThere's no questioning the relentless force that is this Liverpool side, but for the second weekend in a row they rode their luck to notch up a league win on the road. But where the Reds were clinical in the 2-1 win at Chelsea, they were wasteful in the Steel City.\nWhether it was Mane blazing over or against the post in the first 45 minutes, or Mohamed Salah's spurned effort one-on-one with Henderson after they had taken the lead, they were not at their flowing best.\nHowever, few if any of their supporters will now lose sleep over the fact Wijnaldum's goal on 70 minutes was their first shot on target at last season's Championship runners-up.\nThey arrived for this match amid news that they could be kicked out of the Carabao Cup for allegedly fielding an ineligible player in the 2-0 win at MK Dons on Wednesday.\nAs far as their quest for that elusive first Premier League title goes, it remains full steam ahead - although ex-boss Brendan Rodgers and his Leicester City side will provide another stern test in their next league game.\nWilder's side show their worth\nAhead of kick-off, the sides emerged to the sound of a near 32,000 crowd that shook the very foundations of what is one of the oldest stadiums in the country.\nAnd although they were cruelly denied a deserved point for their efforts in this match, there's much to hearten the Blades. The legacy of this performance should be that lazy stereotyping of Sheffield United as being tactically basic from some pundits must end.\nIn this game, they not only matched Liverpool's passing style, but took the game to their revered opponents, pressing high and chasing everything - with the Reds often forced to pass back to goalkeeper Adrian.\nUnfortunately, there are no points for effort.\nHenderson's decisive mistake will prompt grimaced faces, and perhaps the hosts could and should have scored... but this defeat does not necessarily need to be attributed to a villain.\nIn his pre-match press call, Wilder said \"the long-term challenge\" was for this kind of game to become a regular fixture at Bramall Lane. The way they have started life back in the top flight suggests they're more than capable of fulfilling that aim.\nMan of the match - John Fleck (Sheffield United)\n'He needs to do better' - what they said\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder:\n\"I am not bothered about pride, I am bothered about the result. Liverpool had an off day and I think we missed an opportunity. In pressurised situations we need to remain composed. We were delighted with the shape but their chances came from our mistakes.\n\"We have had big moments in the game but we did not take them. We had to jump all over it and we didn't. We had enough to get something out of this game but we did not take our opportunities. Points are the most important thing and we did not get the points we deserved today.\"\nOn Dean Henderson: \"If he wants to be a professional footballer, these things are going to happen. But if he wants to play for the top teams, he wants to play for England, then he needs to do better, he needs to concentrate more. It's a disappointing day for him. I am not going to put my arms around him, simply he needs to do better.\"\nReds closing in on top flight records - stats\nLiverpool have won their first seven games of a league season for only the second time, after 1990-91.\nSheffield United have lost three consecutive home games in the top-flight for the first time since October 1990.\nKlopp's side have won their last 16 Premier League games, their best ever top-flight winning streak and one bettered only by Manchester City in the Premier League (18 between August and December 2017).\nLiverpool are also unbeaten in their last 24 Premier League games. Only between May 1987 and March 1988 have they had a longer unbeaten run in the top flight (31 games).\nWijnaldum's goal on 70 minutes was Liverpool's first shot on target of the game, the longest the Reds have had to wait for a shot on target in the Premier League since 6 December 2015, courtesy of Dejan Lovren's effort against Newcastle on 89 minutes.\nSheffield United's Leon Clarke (34 years and 230 days) became the oldest Englishman to make his Premier League debut since Chris Lucketti (35 years 107 days), also for Sheffield United, against Portsmouth in January 2007.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool resume their Champions League campaign against Austria's Red Bull Salzburg at Anfield on Wednesday, 2 October (20:00 BST). Klopp's side then return to league action at home against Leicester City on Saturday, 5 October (15:00 BST).\nOn the same day, Sheffield United travel to Watford (also 15:00) in the final round of matches before October's international break."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-2 West Ham United: Late equaliser for Hammers' Cresswell\nLeft-back Aaron Cresswell fired in a late equaliser at the Vitality Stadium as West Ham stretched their unbeaten Premier League run to six matches.\nThe two sides came into the game in the top six and produced a pulsating match, with Andriy Yarmolenko opening the scoring with his third goal in six Premier League games this season.\nBut the lead lasted just seven minutes as Joshua King struck from close range. Although the goal was initially flagged offside, the video assistant referee overturned the decision after a lengthy stoppage.\nWest Ham then kicked off the second half yet fell behind just 27 seconds later as Callum Wilson swept in his fifth goal of the season.\nBut the England striker spurned a great chance to make it 3-1 and within 90 seconds Cresswell volleyed home to deny Bournemouth a third straight Premier League win.\nHaving failed to score at all in the 2018-19 season, the former England defender, 29, has scored twice in a week after sealing last Sunday's 2-0 win against Manchester United.\nThe Hammers were then humbled 4-0 by Oxford in the Carabao Cup in midweek, while Bournemouth were also knocked out by League One opposition, the two sides having made a combined 19 changes.\nIt would have been harsh for either to lose, having produced much-improved performances after reverting to the same starting line-ups they had for their last Premier League game.\nRelive a pulsating match at Vitality Stadium\nIn-form Wilson punished for late miss\nBournemouth claimed their first ever win at Southampton last Friday to go third in the table - if only temporarily - and despite falling behind to Yarmolenko's well-taken opener, they made a positive response.\nA short corner resulted in Diego Rico delivering an outswinging cross which deflected off Nathan Ake's thigh into the path of King. The Norwegian forward swept the ball in and his initial disappointment at seeing the offside flag turned to delight as the decision was overturned.\nDominic Solanke headed over from a corner and the Cherries were handed a boost when West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski injured his thigh taking the goal-kick.\nHe had to be replaced by Roberto Jimenez on 34 minutes and although the hosts failed to test the Premier League debutant before the break, Wilson was clinical immediately after the restart.\nThe Hammers swiftly lost possession and Solanke cut in from the left before finding King. He poked the ball to Wilson, who gave Roberto no chance by firing into the bottom corner from just inside the box.\nIt was the first time Wilson, who was named in Gareth Southgate's latest England squad, has scored in four straight Premier League games - and his seventh in seven Premier League games against West Ham.\nThe 27-year-old scored a hat-trick at West Ham in August 2015 to give Bournemouth their first Premier League win and he could have had another as, after Ake rightly had a goal disallowed for offside against Solanke, he fired a 20-yard effort straight at Roberto before being denied by the Spanish veteran after being played in by Harry Wilson.\nCallum Wilson may have had the opportunity to make amends from the penalty spot as Cresswell appeared to pull King's shirt late on but the referee turned down the Cherries' appeals - and the VAR agreed.\nYarmolenko, the Hammers' game-breaker\nLike Cresswell, Yarmolenko was also on target last week, and the Ukraine winger again showed he could be a game-breaker capable of keeping West Ham in contention for a European place.\nAn early foul left the 29-year-old hobbling but he shrugged it off to collect Sebastien Haller's lay-off, after the striker brought down a lofted ball by Felipe Anderson, before turning Ake and firing a left-footed effort beyond Aaron Ramsdale.\nKing scored the first goal West Ham had conceded in 360 minutes of Premier League action before the Hammers lost Fabianski, but it was the visitors who went closest to going in front before the break, with Anderson's volley forcing Ramsdale to turn the ball over.\nAlthough they handed Bournemouth the initiative at the start of the second half, Yarmolenko remained the Hammers' biggest threat, curling a low effort just wide from Anderson's lay-off.\nAnother right-wing cross by Yarmolenko found Anderson at the back post and although his downwards header was parried by Ramsdale, there were defenders on hand to clear the rebound.\nThen, moments after Wilson's miss Yarmolenko again picked out Anderson in the box and the Brazilian cushioned the ball down for Cresswell to volley into the turf and past Ramsdale, nudging the Hammers into the top three - at least until Leicester play on Sunday.\nMan of the match - Andriy Yarmolenko\nDiscussing VAR at final whistle - or were they?\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was another for the neutral, who'd have loved it. It was an end-to-end game, very open. For the respective managers it was probably not so easy to watch.\n\"We had a slow start, we were a bit lethargic, but we showed really good character to stay in the game, so good that we found ourselves 2-1 ahead, and that was probably the key spell of the game. Could we get the two-goal cushion? We didn't and that let West Ham back in it to get a point.\n\"It's too early to make assumptions about where we'll finish, but in terms of our general play and how the team sets up, I do think there's more to come from us.\"\nOn the Callum Wilson miss: \"It was a good chance, a really good team move - my only thought at the time was, could he square it maybe to Joshua King or Harry Wilson, which would have been the easier thing to do? But he's taken it on, he's in confident mood and the goalkeeper's made a good save.\n\"It doesn't mean we have to concede at the other end, it's not an excuse for conceding. We have to tighten up in that respect as we can't have to score three to win.\"\nOn speaking to Manuel Pellegrini at length at the final whistle: \"It wasn't heated, we were just discussing the VAR calls and obviously everyone's got their different opinions on the decisions, so there's no problem.\"\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"I'm not disappointed because I think we played a good game and had more options than Bournemouth to score. But it's not the game you are sure you should win because they also had chances.\n\"I'm very happy because I think we played the way I like to see my team play, with the personality to come here and try to win the game from the first minute.\"\nOn speaking to Eddie Howe: \"I never talked about the VAR decisions. I talked about the assistant coach who, for the complete game, had been trying to pressure the referee in every decision. I think Eddie has done some very good work here. His assistant doesn't need to do that kind of thing because I don't think it's fair for the referee.\n\"Third is a good position, we must defend that position playing the way we did today and in all the last games. In this league you can beat everyone, so it's important to trust in what we're doing and try to improve in every game.\"\nOn Andriy Yarmolenko: \"He's a very special player, he's always had goals in his complete career. He was very unlucky that at his best moment last season he had an Achilles tendon injury but he's returned and worked very hard. I'm very happy for him as he's not only scoring but working very hard.\"\nCherries continue to frustrate the Irons - the stats\nBournemouth are unbeaten in six Premier League matches against West Ham (W3 D3 L0) since losing 1-0 in August 2016.\nWest Ham are unbeaten in six away Premier League games (W3 D3), after losing seven of the eight before that (D1).\nNathan Ake has been directly involved in two goals in his last two Premier League games (one goal, one assist) - as many as he managed in his previous 23 (two goals).\nAaron Cresswell has scored in consecutive league appearances for the first time in his professional career.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham have a London derby at home to Crystal Palace next Saturday (17:30 BST) before Bournemouth visit Arsenal next Sunday (14:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 2-0 Watford: Wolves beat Watford for first Premier League win\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo has called on his side to \"embrace the challenge\" of matching England's top teams by combining domestic and European success, after winning their first Premier League game of the season against Watford.\nThe home side claimed all three points with a 2-0 victory at Molineux to move up to 14th in the table, while winless Watford remain bottom.\nA Matt Doherty strike followed by a Daryl Janmaat own goal either side of half-time was enough to secure the three points.\nWolves are in the Europa League alongside Arsenal and Manchester United following their impressive seventh-placed finish last season and have already played 15 games in this campaign. They next travel to Turkey to face Besiktas on Thursday.\nSanto said: \"We play on a Thursday, we have to travel. But this growing is a natural thing. We started off in the Championship, then we had more difficulties in the Premier League.\n\"Now we are competing Thursday and Sunday. It is harder. We are growing. We are embracing the challenge and trying to improve.\n\"We don't have time to work on the training ground - we are recovering, so we have to do other things to improve our performance. This is a new thing for a lot of the players.\n\"It is very tough but big teams do it, we are doing it this season. We have to embrace it. We are doing well - it is difficult.\"\nUnlike in the FA Cup semi-final between these sides at Wembley in April, when Watford memorably fought back from two goals down to win the tie in extra time, there was limited response from the visitors once Rui Patricio had denied Danny Welbeck with a full-length save.\nMatt Doherty's close-range first-half effort was doubled by a woeful own goal from Watford defender Daryl Janmaat, who reacted to Morgan Gibbs-White's flick by turning a header into an empty net after 61 minutes.\nWatford have conceded 12 goals in three league games since Quique Sanchez Flores returned to the club to replace Javi Gracia on 7 September.\nAnd the Hornets have now gone 11 league games without a win, their worst run since the 1999-2000 campaign, which ended in relegation from the top flight.\nIn contrast, Wolves' first win of the season moves them clear of the bottom three.\nFollow all the action from the Premier League here\nWolves end winless league run\nIt has been an unexpectedly difficult start to the Premier League season for Wolves.\nSeventh last term, this time around they have struggled as manager Nuno Espirito Santo tries to manage the twin demands of domestic and European campaigns.\nSix league games without a win represented their worst run under Nuno - and a return to the disappointment Wolves' Chinese owners experienced in their early months in charge during 2016.\nUnder the chairmanship of Jeff Shi, the Fosun Group has since presided over a phenomenal rise in fortunes at Molineux, but this week Fosun have been grappling with a sharp downturn in fortunes at another of their businesses, Thomas Cook, in which they have an 18% stake.\nWolves say they will not be affected by the travel company's collapse, while Fosun themselves say their financial exposure is nowhere near the \u00a31bn reported and is actually about \u00a337.6m.\nNevertheless, it remains to be seen what view the Chinese government take over Fosun's overseas investment. The group made it known a few weeks ago they were looking at an injection of funding from a third party.\nEvidently, Wolves are a better side than their recent form suggests - when Doherty scored the opener it was the first time they had been ahead in a league game all season.\nRaul Jimenez had already gone close by that point and 19-year-old winger Pedro Neto impressed on his first league start.\nWatford must cut out costly errors\nIf there was some consolation for Watford, it came from the knowledge that at the same time Doherty was scoring the opener for Wolves, seven days previously they had been about to go 5-0 down at Manchester City.\nSanchez Flores is not the most demonstrative coach and he tended to watch the game unfold from the edge of his technical area with his hands behind his back whether Watford were doing well or badly.\nMaking his first Premier League start, England striker Welbeck worked hard enough but was limited to a single chance in the first half, from an acute angle, which Jonny blocked.\nA double save from Rui Patricio to deny Jose Holebas and Tom Cleverley came at the expense of a corner, which substitute Roberto Pereyra - on for a disappointing Gerard Deulofeu - curled straight out of play.\nIt was the kind of basic error Watford can ill afford if they are to get themselves out of trouble and much worse was to come as Janmaat seemingly had time to do many other things with Gibbs-White's header rather than turn it into his own goal.\nIt completed another bad afternoon for Watford, with goalkeeper Ben Foster having to endure the gleeful taunts of the home fans at the end because of the six years he spent at Wolves' fierce local rivals, West Brom.\nMan of the match - Matt Doherty (Wolves)\n'We were looking to improve and we did' - what they said\nWatford manager Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Sport: \"It was a good performance. We started very well, created good problems and played with good lines. We did not allow many situations to worry us. We had clear chances to score so I am happy for the players and the fans.\"\nOn Pedro Neto's first start: \"He was good. He is 19 years old, all the talent that he has has to be organised and used well. He is growing with the game and that's important that we use him the right way.\"\nWatford midfielder Etienne Capoue: \"We had to play much better than last week. We had to improve. We are not in a good run. We created chances to score but we need to work harder.\n\"We are not lazy people, we are pushing each other which is a good sign and we need to keep going. This is football, sometimes things happen but we know we will get points real soon.\"\nWatford's unwanted own goal record continues - the stats\nWolves have ended a run of seven Premier League matches without a win, earning their first victory in the competition since beating Fulham 1-0 at Molineux in May of last season.\nWatford are winless in 11 Premier League games (D3 L8) - equalling their longest run without a win in the competition (also 11 ending in January 2007 and December 1999).\nWatford are the fourth side to concede as many as 20 goals after their opening seven Premier League games of a season, after Bolton (21) in 2011-12, Derby (20) in 2007-08 and Southampton (20) in 2012-13.\nDaryl Janmaat's own goal was Watford's fifth in the Premier League since the start of last season - no side has put the ball past their own keeper more in the competition since then.\nWatford goalkeeper Ben Foster has conceded 24 Premier League goals via own goals - only Mark Schwarzer (28) has conceded more (Tim Howard also conceded 24 in his career).\nSince the start of last season, Matt Doherty (five goals, five assists) is one of only four defenders to have been directly involved in 10+ goals in the Premier League, after Trent Alexander-Arnold (16), Andrew Robertson (13) and Lucas Digne.\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores is winless in his last 12 games on a Saturday in all competitions (D2 L10) since his Espanyol side beat Alaves 1-0 in a La Liga tie in April 2017.\nWhat's next?\nWatford have a crucial game against newly-promoted Sheffield United at Vicarage Road on Saturday, 5 October (15:00 BST). Wolves go to Besiktas in the Europa League on Thursday (17:55 BST) before travelling to champions Manchester City on Sunday, 6 October (14:00 BST)."

in this action I want the blame because I demand him to do what he was doing.\"\nAfter a week where they had lost to Leicester before being beaten by League Two Colchester in the Carabao Cup, Spurs' spirits were lifted as \u00a353.8m club record signing Tanguy Ndombele scored with a powerful deflected finish.\nSerge Aurier, who had already been booked, was sent off in the 32nd minute for a foul on Ryan Bertrand after Spurs felt the ball had gone out of play just before.\nBut within five minutes of Ings' leveller, Harry Kane swept home what proved to be the winner after an assist by Christian Eriksen.\n\"He [Lloris] is so strong mentally,\" Pochettino added. \"and of course showed that he wasn't affected by this situation.\"\nReaction from all today's Premier League games\nRelive the action from Spurs v Southampton\nSpurs captain Lloris went someway to redeeming himself for his howler with two excellent second-half saves.\nHe flung himself across his line to keep out James Ward-Prowse's free-kick before producing an acrobatic leap to block Maya Yoshida's header following a corner.\nRelief for Spurs - but problems still exist\nHaving made a slow start to the season, this was a welcome victory for Pochettino's side, who had started the day closer to the bottom three than the top two.\nAfter dropping 10 points from their previous six matches, they will be relieved to have returned to winning ways even if it was a far from convincing performance.\nLloris had been forced to save from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg before France midfielder Ndombele lashed home his second goal since joining from Lyon in July.\nSpurs' season has been anything but straightforward and, having developed a nasty habit of throwing away leads, they once again gifted their opponents a way back at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nAurier's needless lunge on Bertrand as the Southampton player charged forward, resulting in a second yellow card for the Ivory Coast defender, lifted Southampton's hopes - and eight minutes later they were level.\nLloris, back in the side after missing the Leicester defeat to be with his wife as she gave birth, was embarrassed after losing possession inside his own six-yard area to Ings, who then managed to bundle the ball over the line.\nYet Tottenham managed to get themselves back in front, Kane finishing from 12 yards after a sweeping move involving the impressive Son Heung-min and Eriksen, whose pass allowed the England striker to score his 10th goal of the season for club and country.\nEriksen keeps cool to inspire Spurs\nThis was a big day for Eriksen, who started September by being linked with a move away from Tottenham before the European transfer deadline.\nHe ended it by marking his recall to Pochettino's Premier League starting line-up with a busy performance which he capped by providing the assist for the winning goal.\nWith his contract set to expire next summer, the Denmark midfielder continues to be linked with a move away after six years at the club.\nYet while Aurier was sent off and Lloris committed a horrible mistake, Eriksen kept a cool head as he played a significant part in helping put Tottenham's season back on track.\nWith the game goalless, his free-kick took a deflection and resulted in a chance for Kane, who slipped as he attempted to volley home from close range.\nSaints fail to capitalise after Aurier dismissal\nSouthampton have found playing away from home a much more comfortable experience than performing at St Mary's this season.\nThey arrived in north London seeking a fifth straight league and cup away win - and for spells they looked like they might extend that run.\nDespite losing Portugal defender Cedric Soares in the warm-up, which resulted in Jannik Vestergaard being promoted from the substitutes bench, they took the game to Spurs.\nWithout \u00a315m striker Che Adams and Mali winger Moussa Djenepo, who had scored in the previous two league away wins, Southampton relied on Nathan Redmond's pace to cause problems.\nHe teed-up a chance for Hojbjerg, who tested Lloris, before Ndombele scored - the first goal Southampton had conceded on their travels for more than six hours.\nAurier's red card and Lloris' howler saw the momentum swing in Southampton's direction yet, after Kane had restored Tottenham's lead, the visitors found themselves frustrated by the goalkeeper's fine performance in the second half.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min (Tottenham)\nWhat they said\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"We needed to work a lot with 10 men. We showed our spirit, that is the way we need to work to work together.\n\"We have worked very hard for five years to put the club in the level that no-one expected. That is why now for some results that were not in the way people expected, we don't give up, so we need to be strong to be stronger.\n\"I think it was completely unfair for Serge to be sent off, but I accept the decision of the referee.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"When you get the chance to come back twice and don't take it, you must be frustrated.\n\"We tried to move them around, find space behind the last line. It's tough but we had fantastic chances, Maya Yoshida's header and shots outside the box but not enough to get Spurs struggling.\n\"I wasn't happy with my subs today, it was not enough when we get weaker in the last 20 minutes instead of more pressure on the opponents. In the last 15 minutes was not enough.\"\nSpurs enjoy home rule over Saints - the stats\nTottenham have won eight of their past nine Premier League home games against Southampton, losing the other in May 2016.\nSpurs won a Premier League game when having a player sent off for the first time since September 2017 against West Ham.\nSouthampton had 58.8% possession against Tottenham, the most by a non 'big six' side in an away league game against them since Everton in November 2014 (61.4%).\nSince the start of last season, Southampton have both scored and conceded goals in 29 different Premier League games - only Arsenal (31) have done so in more.\nTottenham striker Harry Kane scored in his sixth consecutive Premier League appearance against Southampton - only Robin van Persie against Stoke (eight), Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink against West Ham (seven) and Romelu Lukaku against West Ham (7) have had longer scoring streaks against an opponent in the competition.\nTanguy Ndombele has scored more goals in his first five Premier League appearances for Tottenham (two) than he managed in 69 Ligue 1 appearances for Amiens and Lyon combined (one).\nSerge Aurier became the first Tottenham player to be sent off in a Premier League home match since Kyle Naughton against Stoke in November 2014.\nWhat's next?\nGerman champions Bayern Munich are in town on Tuesday as Tottenham look for their first Champions League Group B win (20:00 BST), while Southampton have a full week to prepare for Chelsea's visit to St Mary's on Sunday, 6 October (14:00 BST)."

Mount went closest when his free-kick from the left wing evaded everyone and hit the post, while Pedro and Tammy Abraham managed five shots each - both had three of them on target without finding the net.\nBut the Blues kept going and got their reward when Webster fouled Mount, with Jorginho scoring his second goal of the season from the spot.\nThey dominated for the entire game, bar a short period, and Willian blasted home his first Premier League goal since January, albeit with the help of a deflection.\nEnglish youngsters Abraham - the league's second top scorer with seven goals - Mount and Fikayo Tomori have scored 11 of Chelsea's 14 Premier League goals, and Lampard was impressed again despite none of them managing to score.\nHudson-Odoi came on for his first Premier League game of the season after recovering from an Achilles problem.\n\"It is great for the club and a long time coming,\" Lampard said. \"The work is done in the academy. The mentality is great. They want to play for this club.\n\"At the moment they are earning it and setting a level for others. I have complete confidence in the lads. They are there on merit. Whatever game, they take it on board and long may it continue.\"\nBrighton's struggles continue\nNice football but no end product is the story of Brighton's season under Graham Potter. This was never a game they were likely to win.\nThe Seagulls have now only taken one point from 14 Premier League games against the usual top-six sides. And their only win over Chelsea came in their first meeting, a 1933 FA Cup tie.\nAfter the game Potter, whose team have scored only two league goals since the opening day and are one point above the relegation zone, openly conceded \"the better team won\".\nHe added \"we rode our luck in the first half\", with goalkeeper Mat Ryan making four of his eight saves, including a brilliant instinctive stop to keep out Ross Barkley's close-range effort.\nBrighton, who kept trying to play from the back, were architects of their own downfall for the opener. Webster took a heavy touch, or perhaps played a weak backpass, instead of just clearing, and he fouled Mount as he tried to win the ball back.\nThey kept that philosophy going and Dale Stephens gave Tammy Abraham a chance to score with a shoddy backpass, but Ryan denied him.\nTeenage striker Aaron Connolly's introduction sparked a good 10 minutes or so for Brighton, with Burn heading off the crossbar from Pascal Gross' corner.\nBut Willian's goal wrapped the game up - and Stephens' weak 25-yard shot in injury time was Albion's only effort on target.\n\"We gave a goal away cheaply and then grew into the game but then gave a goal that killed the game,\" said Potter. \"We are disappointed but credit to the opposition. Chelsea were good and we could not sustain any pressure.\n\"There are always things you can improve. You have to be clinical when the moments come. But the players gave everything and Chelsea were just better today.\n\"We have had a settled way of playing. Personnel have to change in the game if things are not working. The boys have been positive to what we want to do.\"\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\nMatch stats - one win in 16 for Brighton\nIt was Chelsea's first clean sheet in 11 games since a goalless draw with Leicester on the final day last season.\nThis was the 34th Premier League game that Brighton have failed to score in since joining the division in 2017-18, more than any side currently playing in the competition.\nBrighton have won just one of their past 16 Premier League matches (D6 L9), winning none of their past six games in the league (D3 L3) since beating Watford 3-0 on the opening day.\nJorginho has scored as many goals in nine appearances for Chelsea this season (two) as he did in 54 games last season - three of those four goals have been penalties.\nWillian scored his first goal in 17 Premier League appearances for Chelsea since he last found the net against Newcastle in January - he had tried 32 shots since then.\nChelsea attempted 17 shots in the first half, their highest total in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game since August 2013 against Hull (18), and highest without scoring since November 2010 against Birmingham (18).\nPascal Gross' attempt in the 60th minute was Brighton's first shot - this is the longest they have had to wait to have their first shot of a Premier League fixture.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea's next game is at Lille in the Champions League on Wednesday (20:00 BST). They are back in Premier League action at Southampton on Sunday, 6 October (14:00 BST).\nBrighton host Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, 5 October at 12:30 BST."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-0 Norwich City: Luka Milivojevic scores on 100th appearance\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke said he \"expected there would be difficult times\" in the Premier League as his injury-hit side were beaten by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.\nPalace captain Luka Milivojevic scored a first-half penalty on his 100th appearance for the club before Andros Townsend sealed the win for Roy Hodgson's side.\nSerbia international Milivojevic struck confidently into the top corner after 21 minutes after Norwich defender Ibrahim Amadou fouled James McArthur.\nSubstitute Townsend then finished neatly in the bottom corner in second-half injury time as the Eagles equalled their Premier League record of six unbeaten home matches.\nIn for injured first-choice Norwich goalkeeper Tim Krul, Schalke loanee Ralf Fahrmann was himself replaced by fellow debutant Michael McGovern following Milivojevic's penalty, while defender Jamal Lewis suffered a possible broken arm as the promoted side's injury problems continued to mount.\nCrystal Palace v Norwich as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's other Premier League matches\n\"We expected that there would be difficult times. Right now, especially because of the injury situation, we have a difficult period. We must stick to our guns to improve this,\" said Farke.\n\"At this level, as a newly promoted side and with so many players injured it's difficult to dominate a game. You have to help yourself when you're on the front foot.\n\"Each and every game is important. Of course our biggest concern is the injury situation. It is a difficult situation but we must work on the small details. The only way is hard work.\"\nIn a lively encounter, the hosts almost led after two minutes but Zaha's curling shot narrowly missed the target, while Jordan Ayew forced Fahrmann into action.\nThe visitors ended the first half in the ascendancy, with Emiliano Buendia drawing a fine save from Vicente Guaita. But they struggled to impose themselves after the interval as they fell to a fourth defeat in five matches.\nFortress Selhurst?\nPalace's unbeaten top-flight home run stretches back to April, when they lost to eventual champions Manchester City.\nTheir home record would have been even better if Wolves had not scored a 95th-minute equaliser last weekend, but the reasons for their nonetheless impressive home run were evident once more in this astute victory.\nAlthough Palace had scored the joint-fewest Premier League goals this season prior to kick-off, their steely, regimented defence has conceded just once in four home games.\nMartin Kelly came in for the injured Mamadou Sakho, and his excellent sliding block to deny Todd Cantwell at a crucial stage of the match - as Norwich began to dictate the play - epitomised the defensive platform from which Hodgson's side are able to go and win matches.\nZaha, oozing confidence, may have scored just once in his past 19 home league games, but he played a notable part in this win, which takes Palace up three places to ninth in the table.\nThe Ivory Coast international cut inside and found McArthur before the foul that rewarded Palace for their early dominance with a spot-kick. The tricky winger later wriggled free of his marker to set up Townsend in the closing stages as the substitute calmed the home fans' nerves following last week's late sucker-punch.\nQuestions undoubtedly remain over Palace's profligacy, as McArthur, Patrick van Aanholt and Zaha all blazed over the bar when in good positions during the second half. McArthur and Milivojevic join Ayew and van Aanholt as their side's only league scorers this term - but, with their sturdy defence, the Eagles will fancy their chances against anyone at Selhurst this season.\n\"When you see the five minutes go up on the board it was a bit of a deja vu situation. Norwich are a good team with good, quality players and they came back into in the first half which made our one goal lead look fragile,\" said Hodgson.\n\"The second goal was coming but we couldn't produce the last pass or last shot and it was nice when it eventually came.\"\nOn captain Milivojevic, he added: \"He's enormously valuable, that's why he's captain of the team. He's been a massive influence on and off the field, particularly on the field, with the way he plays and his understanding of the game.\"\nInjury-struck Canaries stutter\nLife had not become any easier for Daniel Farke following his side's 2-0 defeat at Burnley last weekend, as first-choice goalkeeper Krul and captain Alexander Tettey joined Norwich's already lengthy injury list this week.\nUnable to rediscover the level of performance that saw them stun Manchester City two weeks ago, the Canaries struggled with the challenge posed by a trip to Turf Moor and it was a similar story at Selhurst Park.\nSecond best for much of the opening half hour, Farke's visitors closed out the first half with a breathless spell that at its peak saw Buendia force Guaita into a fine save.\nThe increasing influence of attacking trio Buendia, Cantwell and Marco Stiepermann temporarily flipped the momentum - but the visitors were ultimately unable to capitalise.\nIn sharp contrast to the hosts' solidity, last season's Championship winners have conceded at least twice in six of their opening seven fixtures and can ill afford to be so wasteful.\nTeemu Pukki, kept quiet by Palace pair Kelly and Gary Cahill, has won his side five points with his goals this season but cannot be expected to deliver in every game as sides begin to pay the Finnish striker special attention following his electric start in the top-flight.\nWhile Farke did not want to blame Norwich's \"unlucky\" injury situation, he will be keen to have bodies back for the arrival of fellow promoted side Aston Villa next Saturday.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha\nNo luck in London for Canaries - the stats\nCrystal Palace's six-game unbeaten Premier League home run is their longest at Selhurst Park since 1993.\nThe Eagles have kept more home clean sheets than any other Premier League side this season.\nLuka Milivojevic's goal was his 25th in the Premier League, with 20 of those coming from the penalty spot.\nOf all Premier League players to have scored 25 or more goals, Milivojevic's ratio of 80% from the penalty spot is the highest.\nNorwich are winless in 20 away Premier League games in London, the longest run in the competition since Leicester between November 2000-March 2015.\nThe Canaries have scored just once away from home from 13 shots on target in the Premier League this season. At home, they have scored eight from 16 shots on target.\nNorwich gave Premier League debuts to two goalkeepers in this game - only the second time in Premier League history that has happened.\nWhat's next?\nNorwich host Aston Villa on Saturday (15:00 BST), while Crystal Palace travel to West Ham later that day (17:30 BST)."

It was always a risk playing him two games in a row but he played really well,\" Smith told Villa's website.\n, external\n\"El Ghazi will be fine - he just had a clash with their guy and caught one in the face and had to come off.\"\nNever-say-die Clarets fight back\nWhile Sean Dyche's Burnley have not made an eye-catching start to their 2019-20 Premier League campaign, they sat on eight points from their opening six games - the same total as Tottenham and Manchester United.\nThat total represents a very solid start to the campaign for the Clarets, especially considering they have already travelled to Arsenal and faced leaders Liverpool at home.\nAnd in a word, solid sums up their performance at Villa Park.\nThey managed to weather the storm in the first half, and they more than matched the hosts in the second half.\nRodriguez, who came on at half-time for the injured Jack Cork, did well to get in-between two defenders to head home Erik Pieters' cross for their equaliser.\nAnd they could have had a couple more in the second half as Jeff Hendrick blasted over from close range while Ben Mee headed into the side netting from a corner.\nBut the fact that Wood's powerful header from Matthew Lowton's cross came just one minute and 32 seconds after McGinn's goal will please Dyche no end as it illustrates the Clarets' never-say-die attitude perfectly.\nMan of the match - John McGinn (Aston Villa)\n'Our desire was outstanding' - what they said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"The will, desire and mentality was outstanding again. There are never any disappointments with this group and we delivered a good second-half performance.\n\"It was a game of four great crosses and four great finishes. Overall it was a good spectacle, but not as a manager when you see some of the things going on with your team.\"\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith: \"We knew the dangers Burnley posed. We dealt with them well in the first half and we dominated in the first half. It was probably our best first-half performance of the season.\n\"We started the second half scrappy and sloppy. But our response to their goal was good. We took the game by the scruff of the neck.\n\"It was a great bit of work by Trezeguet for John [McGinn]'s goal, which was a goal his performance deserved. But to concede so soon after that goal was criminal. I believe they probably came for the draw and will be happy they've come away with the draw.\"\nLeaky Burnley fail to keep clean sheet again - the stats\nAston Villa have already dropped eight points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nBurnley have lost only one of their last nine top-flight meetings with Aston Villa (W3 D5 L1).\nBurnley are without a clean sheet in their last 11 Premier League away games, since a goalless draw with Watford in January.\nAnwar El Ghazi has netted two goals in his last three home league games for Aston Villa, as many as he scored in his previous 17 at Villa Park (including play-offs).\nJay Rodriguez scored for Burnley in the league for the first time in 2758 days, since netting for the Clarets against Crystal Palace in the Championship on 10 March 2012.\nChris Wood has scored three goals in his last two Premier League games for Burnley, after failing to find the back of the net in the nine before that.\nNext up\nNext up for the Villans is a trip to Carrow Road to face fellow Premier League newcomers Norwich City next Saturday (15:00 BST), while the Clarets host Everton the same day (also 15:00)."

        "article_text": "Everton 1-3 Manchester City: Champions hold off resilient Toffees\nManchester City had to work hard to see off a spirited Everton side and stay five points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.\nRiyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling both struck in the final 20 minutes to give City victory after they had wasted some good chances, but they needed two excellent saves by Ederson to hold off the Toffees.\nIt was a convincing end to a tense evening, with Pep Guardiola's side going to a murky Merseyside knowing only victory would suffice after seeing the Reds maintain their flawless start earlier on Saturday.\nThe defending champions started well and, after Ilkay Gundogan somehow hit the bar from point-blank range, they took a deserved lead thanks to another moment of genius from Kevin De Bruyne.\nHis trademark whipped cross from the right was nodded home by Gabriel Jesus, giving the Belgian his eighth assist of a stellar campaign.\nThat spelled trouble for Everton, whose boss Marco Silva was under pressure before kick-off after back-to-back league defeats, but they responded well and were soon level.\nSterling defends Bernardo Silva after tweet\nReaction to the match and more from around the Premier League\nToffees substitute Alex Iwobi fought his way into the box and the ball dropped for Seamus Coleman, who beat Ederson with a dinked shot before Dominic Calvert-Lewin made sure of the equaliser with a diving header on the line.\nCity were playing some neat football but with top scorer Sergio Aguero starting on the bench along with David Silva and Bernardo Silva, they could not make it count in the final third.\nSterling should have restored their lead at the start of the second half when he ran clear from a delightful Mahrez pass, but his first-time finish fizzed wide.\nEverton were asking questions too, particularly from set-pieces, before Mahrez provided the spark City had been waiting for when he curled home a stunning free-kick into the bottom corner from 20 yards out.\nThe home side refused to lie down and Ederson made vital stops from Calvert-Lewin then Yerry Mina, but Sterling made sure of the points when he forced the ball home after Aguero's cross-shot was saved.\nEverton deserve plaudits despite defeat\nEverton were booed off the Goodison Park pitch after losing here to Sheffield United seven days ago but they deserve some plaudits for responding with a much-improved performance this time.\nYes, it was still a fourth defeat in their past five league games, but they played with passion, passed with purpose - and were close to claiming a surprise point.\nA lack of cohesion in the Toffees attack despite a \u00a3125m summer spending spree has been one of the reasons Silva's job is supposedly under threat, but they gave City's defence a thorough test.\nThat was despite losing Theo Walcott to concussion in the first minute of his first start of the season, with the former England forward unable to continue after being hit in the face by a Raheem Sterling cross.\nHis replacement, Iwobi, was one of those who impressed, along with the industrious Richarlison and Fabien Delph, a calming influence in midfield against his old club.\nThere were spells in the second half with the score at 1-1 when it appeared Silva might finally lay to rest one of the statistics that haunts him here - his team's inability to ever come back from behind to win in a league game.\nThat feat eluded him for the 22nd time in his reign as Toffees boss, but this was still a display that offered some encouragement.\nCity's defence has a difficult evening\nSince being beaten at Norwich and suffering their first defeat of the season, City had enjoyed three straight wins in three different competitions, scoring 14 goals and conceding none.\nThis, however, was a far more difficult day for their defence as Everton's previously shot-shy front-line offered a far sterner test than Shakhtar Donetsk, Watford or Preston had managed.\nAnd, while City survived and left with the three points, that was more down to Ederson's brilliance than his creaking back-line, which was exposed again - particularly from set-pieces.\nA succession of corners and free-kicks from the right caused them problems in the second half, with Richarlison heading wastefully over at the near post from one, and Mina's bouncing effort bringing the best out of Ederson soon after.\nWorryingly for City, Everton were finding a way through them in open play too, and the result might have been very different had Ederson not rushed from his line to deny Calvert-Lewin with the score at 2-1.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez (Man City)\n'Positives despite defeat' - what they said\nEverton boss Marco Silva: \"The first 20 minutes our performance wasn't good enough but after their goal we responded strong. We had some good moments. We were faster and quicker and made problems for them and equalised.\n\"We created problems for them and had a good moment with Gylfi Sigurdsson. They had a bit more possession, which is normal against most teams.\n\"But we had a good attitude from our players and, to be honest, we had the best chances before they scored to make it 2-1, through Mina and Calvert-Lewin. There was a big save by Ederson.\n\"It was a good game, a competitive game. We didn't get the points but there were lots of positives.\"\nMan City boss Pep Guardiola: \"At Goodison Park it is always difficult, at this stadium but we started incredibly well as usual and we created chances and scored a goal.\n\"But we created from wide areas in the second half and we had the quality of Riyad Mahrez for the goal.\n\"Everton have fast players, they caused a lot of problems at the back, so I'm delighted because we want to go for this league and try to win it again.\"\nCity feast on Toffees again - the stats\nEverton have won just one of their last 13 Premier League matches against Manchester City (W1 D4 L8).\nManchester City have scored 27 goals in their opening seven league games this season - the most by a top-flight team in the opening seven matches of a season since Everton in 1894-95 (27).\nEverton directed eight shots on target against Manchester City, the most any side has managed in a Premier League clash with the Citizens since November 2015, when Southampton also fired in eight.\nGabriel Jesus has scored 22 goals in his last 21 starts for club and country, netting in each of his last six starts for Manchester City.\nKevin De Bruyne has provided eight assists in the Premier League already this season - only Cesc Fabregas in 2009-10 has provided as many in his side's first seven games in a single campaign.\nEverton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored in back-to-back Premier League appearances for the first time in his career, and in back-to-back league games for the first time since October 2015 whilst playing for Northampton in League Two.\nRiyad Mahrez has been directly involved in 17 goals in his last 17 starts for Manchester City in all competitions (seven goals, 10 assists), including nine in his last seven (four goals, five assists).\nManchester City winger Raheem Sterling scored his 100th goal in all club competitions, with 77 coming for the Citizens and 23 for Liverpool.\nManchester City's victory over Everton earned David Silva his 200th Premier League win in his 289th game in the competition, making him the quickest ever player to reach this total.\nWhat's next?\nCity have two home games coming up, on Tuesday 1 October against Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League (20:00 BST) and then on Sunday 6 October against Wolves in the Premier League (14:00 BST).\nEverton hit the road next weekend, travelling to Burnley on Saturday (15:00 BST)."

We are only really focusing on how we play, looking at our performance levels.\"\nNewcastle's 'complete surrender' angers Bruce\nNewcastle are anchored in the relegation zone after Leicester took full advantage of Isaac Hayden's straight red card for a terrible tackle on fellow midfielder Dennis Praet by running riot.\nLeicester were already leading through Ricardo Pereira's outstanding low finish before the hosts made the extra man advantage count with three goals in 10 second-half minutes.\nVardy beat Martin Dubravka at his near post to double the lead and, after Paul Dummett had deflected Praet's cross into his own net to make it 3-0, headed the fourth.\nOn a shocking day for Newcastle, Wilfred Ndidi added a late fifth goal with a shot on the turn.\nReaction from King Power Stadium as Leicester hammer Newcastle\nRodgers' side, who started the weekend third but dropped to fifth following Saturday's games, are two points off second-placed Manchester City and seven behind leaders Liverpool, who they visit next Saturday.\nLeicester thriving under Rodgers\nRodgers will have a spring in his step when he makes his first return to Anfield since being sacked by Liverpool in 2015.\nThis was Leicester's 10th - and almost certainly easiest - top-flight win in 18 games since they announced his appointment in February.\n\"I'll give my life to make the supporters proud of this club,\" said Rodgers on the day he was unveiled as Leicester's fourth permanent boss in 23 months.\nRejuvenated and full of energy, they have been transformed by the former Celtic manager who took over a team drained of confidence and starved of wins seven months ago.\nOnly Manchester City and Liverpool have accumulated more Premier League points than Leicester since Rodgers' appointment, and Newcastle can count themselves fortunate not to have been on the end of an even heavier drubbing.\nLeicester produced a clinical performance and scored from all five of their shots on target.\nPortugal defender Pereira's second goal in as many top-flight games set the tone for an utterly dominant performance - the former Porto player starting the move inside his own half before finishing after a neat one-two with former Newcastle player Ayoze Perez.\nAfter Hayden's red card, Leicester swarmed their opponents yet Dubravka should have kept out Vardy's first goal.\nDummett's own goal added to Newcastle's woes yet Leicester were not done as Vardy was left unmarked to make it 4-0 with a close-range header before Ndidi piled on the embarrassment for the visitors.\nProblems mounting for Bruce\nNewcastle started the weekend in 17th spot but end it rooted in the bottom three after a spineless performance devoid of fight and character.\nSteve Bruce talked about \"a huge challenge\" when he was appointed head coach in the summer yet, just seven games in, the problems are piling up.\nBruce already knew before this game his side had serious issues in front of goal after scoring just four times in six matches - as many as they managed in the last match under Rafael Benitez in May.\nNot only did they fail to find the net against Leicester, they did not muster a single shot on target.\nWith the game goalless, Hayden's shot from distance almost found Yoshinori Muto in a scoring position, while Christian Atsu - one goal since December 2017 - lifted another attempt over the bar.\nHayden did his side no favours with his out-of-control challenge, while Dubravka's failure to stop Vardy from scoring Leicester's second left the visitors demoralised with more than half an hour remaining.\nWhile Perez - Newcastle's leading scorer in the Premier League last season - is thriving at Leicester, the goals have dried up for the Magpies.\nThey invested a club record \u00a340m in the summer to sign Brazilian striker Joelinton yet he has found the net once, as many times as Netherlands defender Jetro Willems who joined on loan from Eintracht Frankfurt.\nIt does not get any easier for Bruce or Newcastle. After next Sunday's home game with Manchester United, their first game after the international break is at Chelsea on 19 October.\nMan of the match - Wilfred Ndidi (Leicester)\n'No complaints about red card' - what they said\nLeicester City boss Brendan Rodgers: \"It was an outstanding performance and result. Going down to 10 men can work for or against you but I thought how the players dealt with that and managed the game was outstanding.\n\"In the second half the players showed a wonderful appetite. We pressed it so hard, were hungry in the game and hungry for goals. A clean sheet, five really good goals and a really good day for us.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce on Isaac Hayden's red card: \"I've got no complaints, the red card was a poor challenge.\n\"Maybe back in my day you might get away with that but in today's game then I've got no argument.\"\nDay to forget for Bruce - the stats\nThis was Steve Bruce's joint-heaviest defeat in the Premier League, alongside losing 2-7 v Chelsea in January 2010 and 0-5 v Manchester City in April 2011 as Sunderland manager.\nNewcastle failed to land a shot on target in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2018.\nSince Brendan Rodgers' first match with Leicester, Jamie Vardy has scored more Premier League goals than any other player (14 goals, 17 appearances).\nIsaac Hayden's red card was the 52nd occasion on which Bruce has seen one of his players dismissed in the Premier League. Only former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (78) has seen more of his players sent off in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester now begin preparing for next Saturday's game at Premier League leaders Liverpool (15:00 BST), while Newcastle are at home to Manchester United next Sunday (16:30) - the final league game before the international break."

        "article_text": "Man Utd 1-1 Arsenal: Aubameyang earns Gunners a point\nManchester United and Arsenal played out a grim stalemate at Old Trafford that provided compelling evidence to illustrate just how far away from a Premier League challenge both clubs are.\nIn a disappointing encounter that was a pale shadow of their mighty clashes of years gone by, Scott McTominay gave Manchester United the lead at the end of an attritional first-half with a rising drive from the edge of the area.\nArsenal equalised just before the hour courtesy of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's cool finish. It was originally ruled out for offside but the video assistant referee confirmed the striker had been played onside by Harry Maguire.\nGoalkeeper Bernd Leno excelled for Arsenal with fine saves from Maguire and Marcus Rashford's late free-kick, while Bukayo Saka's goalbound shot crucially struck Victor Lindelof and flew over the top.\nMcTominay also headed a great chance well over from Ashley Young's corner but neither side could force a winner.\nThe result takes Arsenal into the top four but Manchester United are now down in 10th after an outcome that means they have made their worst start after seven games in 30 years, failing to reach double figures for the first time since 1989-90, a season in which they finished 13th.\n'A rivalry drowned in a downpour of mediocrity'\nHow you rated the players\nCan Leicester gatecrash top four? BBC analysis\nHow times have changed\nThe current circumstances of both clubs was instantly demonstrated by the two captains who led out the sides.\nManchester United's captain was 34-year-old Ashley Young, pressed into defensive service by Aaron Wan-Bissaka's absence through injury, and Arsenal were led by Granit Xhaka, newly appointed and a divisive figure among supporters.\nYoung led from the front in a fashion by regularly contesting decisions, showing a remarkable knack of getting to referee Kevin Friend in an instant on numerous occasions.\nXhaka's night will be best remembered for his contribution to United's goal - getting away with a foul in the build-up before appearing to take evasive action as McTominay's drive made its way into the top corner.\nThere was no shortage of effort but this was a scrappy mess of a game, lacking any cohesion or quality.\nUnited had the edge on chances, although they were grateful to David de Gea for a fine double save from Saka and Matteo Guendouzi in the first half and they also felt they had a respectable appeal for handball against Sead Kolasinac ignored by referee Kevin Friend.\nArsenal boss Unai Emery will be more satisfied than counterpart Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with a point but this showed just how far away both are from leaders Liverpool and reigning champions Manchester City - and just how much work they have to do to catch up.\nTough night for Pepe\nIt was no surprise when Arsenal's club record \u00a372m signing Nicholas Pepe failed to last the course, being substituted for Reiss Nelson after 72 minutes.\nThe 24-year-old signing from Lille had struggled desperately throughout and looks worryingly short of confidence so soon after his introduction into the Premier League.\nPepe had one clear shooting opportunity in the first half but skied his effort hopelessly into the Stretford End. He was on the periphery of the action in a laboured performance also littered with poor decision-making.\nIt was left to the lethal Aubameyang to provide the finishing touch for Arsenal, correctly assisted by VAR after technology showed he was clearly onside.\nSolksjaer appeared to think the linesman's raised flag made his players stop but it was clearly the correct decision as Maguire loitered yards behind his defensive colleagues.\n'It is a steep learning curve'\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"How many times have we have been 1-0 up and not got the second goal? This is a steep learning curve for us and we'll keep working hard and, with more experience, we'll make the right decisions.\n\"We didn't get out of the blocks quick enough at the start of the second half. It felt like Arsenal were the more proactive until they scored their goal.\n\"I felt we could get a goal at the end and we sent men forward. I've been in that situation as a player when you come off and think you could've got more out of a game, but we'll learn from this.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"I want more - more in the result and in the performance but we are progressing. We were competitive but we can do better. We can control moments with the ball better and take more chances in the box.\n\"We have young players who can take confidence. Bukayo [Saka] is progressing well but we need other players too. This is not the best in terms of points but one point can be good if we win next Sunday against Bournemouth.\"\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal)\nThe best of the stats\nManchester United's haul of nine points after seven games is their worst tally at this stage of a top-flight season since 1989-90 (7 points).\nArsenal are unbeaten in consecutive Premier League games at Old Trafford (D2) for the first time since January 2000.\nArsenal (5) had more shots on target than Man Utd (4) in a Premier League game at Old Trafford for the first time since May 2009 (4-0).\nManchester United have won 49 points from their 28 Premier League games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - two fewer than they won in their final 28 games under Jose Mourinho.\nMcTominay's goal was his first for Manchester United at Old Trafford, in his 25th home game for the club in all competitions.\nSince his Manchester United debut in February 2016, Rashford has been directly involved in 71 goals for the Red Devils in all competitions (48 goals, 23 assists), eight more than any other player.\nSaka has registered four goal involvements in just three starts for Arsenal in all competitions this season (1 goal, 3 assists)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 3-0 Tottenham Hotspur: Aaron Connolly scores twice in win over Spurs\nTottenham's miserable week continued as they followed their Champions League humiliation at the hands of Bayern Munich with a damaging defeat at Brighton.\nAfter their 7-2 drubbing in midweek, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino was expecting a response from his players, only for goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to gift Neal Maupay a bizarre opener.\nThe Spurs captain suffered a freak arm injury in the process, and Aaron Connolly compounded Tottenham's problems by doubling Brighton's lead on his first Premier League start.\nAnd although Spurs made a positive start to the second half, Connolly killed off any hope of them launching a fightback as the 19-year-old Irish striker produced a well-taken strike for his second goal to seal Brighton's first home win since March.\nTottenham have now failed to win in their last away 10 games in the Premier League, stretching back to a 2-1 victory at Fulham on 20 January, and have lost 17 in all competitions in 2019 - more than any other top-flight side.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action\nPochettino 'not worried' about the sack\nLast week's home win against Southampton offered Spurs some relief after being dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Colchester but the pressure is mounting on Pochettino with his side having now taken 11 points from a possible 24 this term.\nNot only was it Brighton's first win since the opening day but it was Graham Potter's first at the Amex, lifting the Seagulls to 12th before the afternoon kick-offs, with Tottenham set to slip out of the top six.\nTottenham in crisis?\nQuestions were being asked after Tottenham's Carabao Cup exit but having conceded 10 goals in five days, Spurs are now bordering on a crisis.\nPochettino has become one of the most coveted managers in Europe during his first five years in charge, with his side gradually improving each year and reaching last season's Champions League final.\nYet just four months on, Spurs were jeered off at their palatial new home after the defeat to Bayern.\nPochettino is facing the most searching questions of his Tottenham tenure, admitting that \"sometimes critics can make you realise you need to wake up\".\nAnd if that second-half capitulation against Bayern wouldn't act as a wake-up call, then what would?\nLloris' early howler hardly helped their cause and it then took time for them to regroup.\nOn Friday, Pochettino said he has no doubt over the commitment of his players, particularly those in the final year of their contract such as Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, the latter pair retaining their places despite shortcomings being ruthlessly exposed in midweek.\nThere was no questioning Vertonghen's desire to put his body on the line, blocking Dale Stephens' goalbound volley with his head before needing treatment after a clash of heads with Maupay.\nBut just as it looked like Spurs had got a foothold in the game, they conceded a second.\nAlderweireld was then found wanting after the break as he stood off Connolly, turning his back as the youngster cut inside before firing into the bottom corner.\nAnd while Eriksen had another quiet game in midfield, he was not alone.\nHis tame long-range strike was Tottenham's only shot on target in the first half, and although Spurs won three corners in quick succession at the start of the second half, they still couldn't muster an effort on goal.\nLater on, the ball squirmed away from Son Heung-min in the box while Harry Kane fired over, before substitute Lucas Moura was twice denied by Mat Ryan as Spurs failed even to claim a consolation, seemingly leaving Pochettino and Spurs at a crossroads.\n'Embarrassing, abject, pitiful - make no mistake, Spurs and Pochettino are in trouble'\nWelcome win for Potter\nWhile the football Brighton have played since Potter's appointment in May has been admirable, some had begun asking if the Seagulls would need to adopt a more pragmatic approach to avoid another relegation battle this season.\nThey came into the game with two points from their previous six games and could not believe their luck as Lloris gifted Maupay his third goal since joining from Brentford in the summer.\nWith Spurs reeling and Brighton gaining an early advantage, the hosts had the freedom to play as Potter prefers, and Connolly had a strong shout for a penalty turned down as stand-in right-back Moussa Sissoko nudged the youngster as he raced into the box.\nBut moments later, Connolly got in front of Ben Davies to flick Dan Burn's cross goalwards and slam in the rebound, before side-footing wide from Pascal Gross' squared ball.\nThe Seagulls remained comfortable for most of the second half, with Gross going for goal from a tight angle and curling a free-kick against the crossbar, before Lewis Dunk released Connolly down the left for his second goal.\nGross then spurned a late chance to make victory even more emphatic, firing straight at substitute Paulo Gazzaniga from the edge of the box.\nInjury added to insult for Lloris\nAfter being at fault for Southampton's goal last Saturday, Lloris committed another glaring error in just the third minute at the Amex as he tried to catch Gross' inswinging cross instead of tipping it over the bar and his momentum saw him stagger backwards into his own goal.\nThe France captain dropped the ball before he crossed the goal-line, allowing compatriot Maupay to head home, but injured his arm as he tried to break his fall and had to be replaced by Gazzaniga.\nThe 32-year-old had treatment for several minutes and needed oxygen before being carried from the field so looks set for a lengthy lay-off, but that should not mask the fact it was a mistake you do not expect a keeper of his standing and experience to make.\nAnd while he got away with it last week, this one proved costly as Spurs never recovered in what is shaping up as a pivotal month for the future of Pochettino and Spurs, which ends with a trip to Premier League leaders Liverpool on 27 October.\nMan of the Match - Aaron Connolly (Brighton)\n'We haven't got the results we could have' - what they said\nBrighton manager Graham Potter: \"Overall I was really, really happy with the performance. Great personality on the pitch, we attacked well, defended well.\n\"When we made mistakes we recovered, we created chances and played on the front foot as much as we could.\n\"I am delighted for the players, we have worked really hard and haven't got the results we could have got but that is life in the Premier League. The margins are small.\"\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was difficult to assess the team. In the first few moments we conceded and then lost our goalkeeper.\n\"It was very negative for the team, the emotion was massive. We did not play well. We are disappointed about that. Brighton played well.\n\"We cannot say that they did not deserve the three points. We never recovered from those opening few minutes. We could not change the dynamic of the game.\"\nEarly drama at the Amex - the stats\nHugo Lloris was subbed off after eight minutes - the quickest a keeper has been replaced in a Premier League match since Lloris against Leicester in April 2015 (four minutes).\nAt two minutes 30 seconds, Neal Maupay's opener for Brighton was their fastest goal in the Premier League.\nBrighton ended a run of eight Premier League home games without a win (D3 L5).\nBrighton equalled their biggest margin of victory in a top-flight game and scored more than once in a Premier League home game for the first time in 16 games, since beating Crystal Palace 3-1 in December 2018.\nAt 19 years 250 days old, Aaron Connolly is the first teenager ever to start a Premier League game for Brighton and the first to score in the league for the Seagulls since Jake Forster-Caskey against Charlton in April 2014 in the Championship.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides return to action after the international break, with Brighton visiting Aston Villa on Saturday, 19 October, while Tottenham host Watford (both 15:00 BST)."

You can take confidence and grow from that.\n\"We are not exactly the team we want, but we are on the road to finding it.\"\nWatford move on to three points but remain bottom of the table, while Chris Wilder's side climb to 12th place after stretching their unbeaten away run to four matches.\nHornets made to rue profligacy\nFlores said during the week he wants to \"improve and define\" Watford's style of play, but Hornets fans would have settled for any kind of victory against a Blades side who have picked up more points on their travels this season than at Bramall Lane.\nThe Vicarage Road club have now gone 12 matches without a victory in the league - their worst run since their relegation season in 1999-2000.\nThey may have registered their first Premier League clean sheet of the campaign against Wilder's team, but they failed to make the most of three golden opportunities to earn themselves a precious victory, the first of which fell to Gray inside the opening 10 minutes.\nTom Cleverley's pass down the right-hand side caught the Blades' defence asleep, allowing Pereyra to run on to the loose ball unchallenged.\nThe Argentine picked out Gray on the edge of the six-yard area, but the striker could only scoop the ball over the crossbar.\nGray's miss was the hosts' only clear-cut opportunity of the first half as United enjoyed the lion's share of possession without creating any major chances of their own.\nWatford started the second half brightly, however, and should have broken the deadlock when Welbeck was played through following a swift counter-attack, but the former England international was denied by Henderson's right leg.\nThe impressive Henderson then produced a fine one-handed save to deny Dawson late on as the Blades held on for a hard-earned point.\nHenderson makes amends for Liverpool blunder\nHaving been denied a point in cruel circumstances against league leaders Liverpool last weekend when Henderson let Georginio Wijnaldum's tame shot into the net, the trip to Vicarage Road presented an altogether different challenge for Wilder and his players.\nThey struggled to create meaningful opportunities despite enjoying more than 60% possession, but the point extends their unbeaten start away from home to four games - a feat they last achieved in the top flight in 1972.\nTheir best chance of the encounter came via Watford skipper Cathcart, who had his goalkeeper to thank for preventing his attempted clearance from nestling in the far corner in the first half.\nCallum Robinson shot straight at Foster from the edge of the box in the second half, while Enda Stevens and John Lundstram both fired over the bar from promising positions.\nBut the afternoon belonged to Henderson, who delivered the perfect response to his costly mistake against Jurgen Klopp's side a week ago when Wilder said he \"needs to do better\".\nThe Blades goalkeeper - on loan from Manchester United - did brilliantly to deny Welbeck early in the second half, while Dawson's low header looked destined for the back of the net until the 22-year-old palmed the ball to safety with a strong right hand.\n\"He's a really good keeper and he's reacted the right way,\" said Wilder. \"He was always going to play and he was pivotal to the clean sheets we had last year.\n\"It's a tough old changing room but he's come through it. There's no hiding place at international level or the likes of Manchester United, so that's what he's got to get used to.\"\nMan of the match - Dean Henderson (Sheffield United)\nA rare clean sheet for Watford - the stats\nWatford are winless in their eight Premier League games this season (D3 L5), their longest run without a victory from the start of a campaign in any division since 2006-07 (10 in the Premier League).\nWatford have failed to score in five of their eight Premier League games this season - the most of any side in the competition.\nSheffield United have kept 24 clean sheets in the league since the start of last season; no side has recorded more shut-outs in this time in the top four tiers (excluding play-offs).\nWatford have ended a run of 19 Premier League games without a clean sheet (45 goals conceded), their first shut-out since February.\nSheffield United are unbeaten in their opening four games to a season on the road (W1 D3) in any division for the first time since 2012-13, and in the top flight since 1972-73.\nWatford have failed to score in each of their last three Premier League games, the Hornets' longest goalless run since April 2018 (three games).\nWatford missed all three of their big chances against Sheffield United; in fact, no Premier League side has a worse big-chance conversion rate than the Hornets this season (21% - 3/14).\n'We need to support the players' - what the managers said\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"We tried to go for the win but Sheffield United are a very confident and physical side. We didn't concede in a long time, so that's a good thing.\n\"The players responded really well and we need to support them. They were a little nervous with decision-making, everything is so fast, but I think we had opportunities that we can work on.\n\"A clean sheet is a good thing and we talked last week about not conceding. We're working hard together to get more confidence for the future.\n\"We have the break now with a lot of nationalities in our team, so we will come back and continue to work hard.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder: \"When you come away from home in the Premier League and play the way we did it is good, but we couldn't really find that final pass.\n\"If we can't win then we need to take something from these games. The balance of the team is good with the amount of possession and chances we had, the players were outstanding.\n\"I think we're a couple of points light, but nine points is a decent start. We've got a nice tasty game against Arsenal to look forward to after the international break.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to Tottenham Hotspur after the international break on Saturday, 19 October (kick-off 15:00 BST), while Sheffield United welcome Arsenal to Bramall Lane on Monday, 21 October (20:00)."

However, it was no surprise Mane was involved in the decisive incident the Foxes players contested so hotly.\nMane was not just his usual attacking threat - scoring his 50th top flight goal for the Reds after racing on to Milner's pass and expertly beating Schmeichel in the first half - he also worked tirelessly in his defensive duties to subdue the threat of Leicester full-back Ben Chilwell in the first half.\nThe Senegal forward now has world-class status and came to Liverpool's aid once more when it looked like the visitors would repeat their feat of last season and leave Anfield with a draw.\nLiverpool are now on a run of 17 Premier League victories, bettered only by Manchester City's sequence of 18 wins between August and December 2017.\nThey are also unbeaten in 44 league games at home - 34 wins and 10 draws - which is the longest current run in Europe's top five leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain).\nThe hosts were not at their fluent best but, like at Sheffield United last time out, they got a break when needed and cashed in.\nLeicester show top-four steel\nLeicester City arrived at Anfield with many tipping them as serious top-four contenders given the crisis at Tottenham and the transitions taking place at Chelsea and Manchester United.\nNothing on view here suggested this is a false claim. This is a very impressive side superbly organised by Rodgers.\nRodgers may feel they took too long to crank up the attacking threat on Saturday - but the manner in which they remained calm, composed and frustrated Liverpool's world-class attack for long periods bodes well for the season ahead.\nJamie Vardy only had one chance in behind the Reds defence but his touch let him down, while Maddison was relatively quiet until he stole in on the end of Perez's pass to shoot under Adrian, although Liverpool's keeper surely should have done better.\nIt was the overall look of Leicester that suggested they will be a top-four force this season - a good blend of youth and experience, pace and resilience.\nIt says a lot about them that they will leave so Anfield so bitterly disappointed. They were not in awe of a team that have carried all before them in the Premier League this season.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\n'We knew it would happen' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a super game. We upped the tempo. The football we played was so important. Leicester's goal really stopped us but then we wanted to go forwards.\n\"The penalty was obviously a penalty. We knew it would probably happen, we knew we were going to fight for the win - and we did. Without luck, we cannot win the amount of games we have won, but over the 90 minutes we deserved it - we deserved the three points. Milner held his nerve and that was superb.\nOn the late challenge on Mohamed Salah by Hamza Choudhury: \"How can Mo be OK? How did he only get a yellow card? Mo limped off the pitch. That's hard. It was done to slow Mo down and that is not OK.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers on Sky Sports: \"I thought we deserved more than that. It's cruel to concede so late. I am very proud of the team. We're playing against the European champions and we looked like we could get goals. We were always a threat in the game, we had the confidence to pass the ball. We are showing our personality in how we played.\n\"We are bitterly disappointed to concede the penalty and it did not look clear and obvious to me. I think Mane made the most of the contact. I don't think if it had not been given by the referee it would have been overturned by VAR. When the referee gives decisions it is hard for them to overrule it.\"\nLeaving it late - the best of the stats\nMilner's penalty was the 34th time Liverpool have scored a 90th-minute winning goal in a Premier League match - at least nine more than any other side.\nLiverpool are the first side to win their opening eight matches of an English top-flight season twice, having also done so in the 1990-91 season.\nSince the start of last season, Leicester City have conceded four 90th-minute winning goals in the league - at least twice as many as any other club.\nMane, making his 100th league appearance for Liverpool, scored his 50th Premier League goal for the Reds. He is the 10th player to reach the milestone for the club in the competition, more than any other side.\nMaddison's equaliser came from Leicester's only shot on target of the match and the midfielder has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since December 2018.\nWhat's next?\nIt is now an international break meaning Liverpool are not back in action until Sunday, 20 October when they travel to Old Trafford to take on rivals Manchester United in the Premier League (16:30 BST). Leicester play a day earlier at the King Power against Burnley (15:00)."

Instead, they find themselves just one place outside the relegation zone with two wins from their opening eight games this term.\nThey will drop into the bottom three at the end of the weekend if Newcastle beat Manchester United at St James' Park on Sunday.\nThis was the first time since January 2015 under Roberto Martinez that Everton had lost four in a row in the league and after keeping back-to-back clean sheets at the start of the season, Everton have now gone without one for six games.\nIt is evident where their problem lies.\nSince Silva came to England in January 2017 as Hull manager, his sides - which also include Watford - have conceded 45 goals from set-pieces, including six this campaign - a league high.\nFailing to pick up Hendrick proved vital on this occasion and the home fans chanted \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" in Silva's direction.\nSilva stood inside his dugout for the duration of the game - slipping his hands into his pockets after his side conceded and looking forlornly at the turf.\nEverton failed to create any real clear-cut chances. Richarlison thumped a strike from the angle straight at Pope, while Alex Iwobi should have done better from eight yards out but his scuffed effort was blocked by Matthew Lowton.\nThe Toffees may feel aggrieved about Coleman's red card but the sending off was preventable.\nHis first yellow was awarded for a late challenge on Erik Pieters in the first half and, needing to keep his composure while on a caution, he barged in high on Dwight McNeil to be dismissed on 56 minutes.\nDyche shows Everton what they missed out on\nIf Everton are in trouble, Burnley are experiencing the opposite as their unbeaten run takes them above the likes of Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea.\nSean Dyche could easily have been in the opposite dugout for this game, having missed out on the Toffees job to Silva, and he showed Everton what they might have won.\nBurnley are a solid outfit with industrious, hard-working players across the pitch, assembled at a fraction of the cost of their opponents.\nHendrick gave warning signs of what was to come in the first half when his effort from the angle was stabbed away by Pickford's boot and the Clarets could have gone ahead immediately after Coleman's red card but Ashley Barnes fired wide.\nIn defence, meanwhile, James Tarkowski and Ben Mee worked as one unit, regularly throwing themselves in front of Everton players to make crucial blocks or vital last-ditch challenges.\nIt was Hendrick who settled it though, with a fine finish, meaning Burnley head into the international break in fine form.\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski\nSet-piece struggles for Everton - the stats\nBurnley are unbeaten in four Premier League games (W2, D2), after losing five of their seven before that (W1, D1).\nEverton have lost four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since January 2015.\nSince the start of last season, Everton have shipped 22 goals from set-piece situations (excl. pens) in the Premier League, more than any other side.\nSince the start of last season, Everton have picked up six red cards in the Premier League, more than any other side.\nEverton full-back Seamus Coleman picked up just his second red card in the Premier League and his first since May 2011 against Chelsea.\nJeff Hendrick has netted two goals in his last four Premier League appearances for Burnley, as many as he managed in his previous 30.\nWhat they said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"I thought the mentality was good from my players again. The first half was tight - two sides trying to open each other up and not give much away. When they went down to 10 men, Everton went more expansive and threw caution to the wind and then it was about game management.\n\"It is great for the club but we are certainly not getting carried away. The players deserve a lot of credit. It was a tough season last season and we have learnt from that.\"\nEverton boss Marco Silva: \"When you lose a football game it is always like that [disappointing]. I think we did more than our opponent but they are always a difficult team to play against. First half we were the better team on the pitch.\n\"The game was balanced and after 55-60 minutes the second yellow made things more difficult on the pitch. From set-pieces they were more brave than us. We have to be more brave.\n\"It is important to keep the faith in ourselves. Of course it is not easy for them [the fans]. They want more and deserve more and it is up to us to stick together.\"\nWhat next?\nEverton host West Ham after the international break on 19 October (kick off 12:30 BST), while Burnley travel to Leicester on the same day (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Norwich City 1-5 Aston Villa: Visitors out of bottom three after superb display\nAston Villa's club record signing Wesley showed his \"massive\" potential with a \"colossus\" display in the ruthless win at injury-hit Norwich City, says manager Dean Smith.\nThe 22-year-old striker scored twice as Villa moved out of the bottom three and leapfrogged their opponents in the Premier League table.\nWesley, who has been criticised by some Villa fans, opened the scoring with a neat control and finish, doubling the tally with a tap-in before missing a penalty.\nNorwich continued to defend woefully after the restart, Jack Grealish allowed to sweep in a third to effectively end the home side's hopes.\nConor Hourihane and Douglas Luiz added more as Canaries boss Daniel Farke's 100th league game at the helm headed towards humiliation, before Josip Drmic tucked in a meaningless consolation which few inside Carrow Road even celebrated.\nVilla's stunning win moved Smith's side up to 14th, with Norwich sliding down to third-bottom with their fifth defeat in six games.\n\"Wes was a handful for their two centre-halves, we got the ball into him, he kept it and it allowed us to break from him,\" Smith said.\n\"I thought he was a colossus up front.\"\nHow Norwich v Aston Villa unfolded\nWesley goes some way to silencing the critics\nAmong many positives for Aston Villa, the \u00a322m summer signing's performance was arguably the biggest plus-point.\nThe Brazilian arrived under the weight of a big price tag, and therefore much expectation, but had not bowled over many Villa supporters with his performances in the opening weeks of the season.\nSocial media, as often the case, was the main platform for criticism of his displays, particularly after Villa twice threw away leads to draw 2-2 against Burnley last weekend.\nThe level of discontent forced Smith to face questions about Wesley's pedigree going into the trip to Norwich, with the Villa boss urging patience towards the young player and backing him to become a success.\nScoring the two goals that put Villa on the path to a comfortable win certainly showed what he is capable of.\nAllowed acres of space for both goals, Wesley coolly controlled Anwar El Ghazi's cross with his chest before slotting in the first and then evaded his marker to tap in Hourihane's low cross for the second.\nA first hat-trick in English football evaded him, however, after a superb penalty save by Norwich keeper Michael McGovern.\nThe Northern Irishman, making his first Premier League start aged 35, dived low to his right to stop the spot-kick, reacting quickly to spread himself and push Wesley's shot on the rebound over the bar.\n\"He's a young player, he's only 22, he's been in Belgium for a year or two and then Slovakia before that. So it's a new culture, a new team a new group of players, and a big price tag,\" said Smith\n\"But he handles it well and I saw a big response from him this week.\"\nAsked about the criticism, Wesley added: \"I don't care about this. I keep calm, the manager and my team-mates know me. I will keep working hard and the goals will come.\"\n'Loads of things went wrong' - Norwich undone by dismal defending\nApart from the seismic home win over champions Manchester City, Norwich's return to the Premier League has largely been a difficult one.\nThe Canaries, who finished 18 points above Villa last season, did not have the spending power of their Midlands rivals in the summer and their hopes of maintaining momentum to quickly put points on the board have been hampered by intense injury problems.\nFarke has more players in the treatment room than the changing room at the moment, with 10 first-teamers - including goalkeepers Tim Krul and Ralf Fahrmann - ruled out of the Villa match.\n\"If I am honest it is really difficult to repeat miracles on a weekly basis. We had too many problems for this game to be really there and gain some points,\" the German manager said.\n\"There were also so many players on the pitch who not able to train and had painkillers because we had no other options. Two or three key players didn't have the best game and if this comes together you will not be competitive.\"\nThat meant third-choice stopper McGovern, the 35-year-old Northern Ireland international who spent all his career in Scotland before moving to Carrow Road three years ago, made his first Premier League start and he was left horribly exposed by his defence.\nThe home side were unorganised and lacked leadership at the back, leaving Villa players with too much time and space throughout, while also sloppy in possession when trying to play out from the back.\nThe thumping defeat means Norwich have conceded 21 top-flight goals this season, more than any other Premier League side.\n\"Losing any football game by conceding five goals is not very nice,\" Canaries skipper Ben Godfrey said.\n\"There are loads of things that we can go through about what went wrong, I'd be here all day if I go through every bit that went wrong. As you can see by the scoreline there was not a lot that went right.\n\"We will take a good look at ourselves.\"\nRoyal seal of approval for Villa\nVilla had not earned a Premier League away win in 21 matches - a run going back to August 2015 - and ended that joyless sequence with a performance that will live long in the memory of the travelling fans.\nThe Villa fans were in a jubilant mood throughout as Smith's side clinically brushed aside a team that came up from the Championship alongside them last season.\nPrince William, one of Villa's most famous fans, was among the Carrow Road crowd as he watched with his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, and their young family.\nPrince George was particularly impressed by Hourihane's slick finish, the six-year-old jumping around in his Villa T-shirt in celebration.\n\"I'll be getting them tickets for every game now if they need them,\" Villa manager Smith joked afterwards.\n\"I hope they can get here every game if that is what it needs, I might even get them on the team bus.\"\nMan of the match - Jack Grealish (Aston Villa)\nHourihane haunts Canaries again - stats of the day\nAston Villa scored five goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since April 2008 - a 6-0 win at Derby.\nNorwich suffered their biggest home defeat in the Premier League since April 2012, when they lost 6-1 against Manchester City.\nAston Villa became the first promoted side to score five goals away from home in a Premier League match since Bolton at Leicester in August 2001.\nNorwich (21) v Aston Villa (22) became the first Premier League match to see both teams have at least 20 shots since QPR (24) vs Swansea (25) in January 2015.\nJack Grealish's last six goals for Aston Villa in all competitions have been away from home. This was his first Premier League strike since September 2015 (v Leicester).\nConor Hourihane has been involved in seven goals in his last five league matches for Aston Villa against Norwich, four goals and three assists.\nNorwich's Michael McGovern became the seventh goalkeeper to save a penalty on their first ever Premier League start, and the first since Neil Etheridge for Cardiff against Bournemouth last season.\nWhat's next?\nNorwich, who have lost all four away league matches this season, return to the road after the international break when they go to Bournemouth on Saturday, 19 October (15:00 BST).\nVilla will look to build on this result when they host Brighton at Villa Park on the same day (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "West Ham 1-2 Crystal Palace: Jordan Ayew's late VAR-awarded goal gives Palace victory\nCrystal Palace snatched victory at West Ham as Jordan Ayew had an 87th-minute goal awarded by the video assistant referee at the London Stadium.\nThe strike was initially ruled offside by the linesman after Ayew stabbed in from Martin Kelly's header but the decision was overturned after a lengthy VAR review.\nSebastien Haller had given West Ham the lead when he swept home.\nBut Palace equalised through Patrick van Aanholt's penalty before Ayew's goal secured all three points.\nThe win moved Roy Hodgson's side into the top four of the Premier League while ending West Ham's six-game unbeaten run.\nVAR takes centre stage again at the London Stadium\nThe addition of VAR in the Premier League has been a much debated subject this season and the London Stadium has now played host to some of its most controversial moments.\nIn West Ham's opening game of the campaign against Manchester City, VAR ruled out a goal for the visitors after Raheem Sterling's shoulder was adjudged offside, and this was a similarly close call.\nWhen Ayew turned home from Kelly's knockdown, the linesman's flag was immediately raised and all but the most eagle-eyed would have disputed the decision.\nHowever, VAR intervened, leading to a lengthy delay and after examining many angles it was deemed that Ayew had just been played onside.\nIt was tight but ultimately the correct decision and Palace now have two additional points that could prove vital at the end of the season.\nMissed chances prove costly for West Ham\nThis was West Ham's first defeat in the Premier League since they were thumped 5-0 by Manchester City in their season opener but they arguably only had themselves to blame for not extending their unbeaten run to seven games.\nMuch of their good form has been down to an attack that will be the envy of many of their opponents in the Premier League, with Haller, Andriy Yarmolenko, Felipe Anderson and Manuel Lanzini offering a combination of pace, power and creativity.\nHowever, they were all uncharacteristically off key in the final third in this game.\nHaller - West Ham's record signing in the summer - fluffed a golden chance in the first half when he shot straight at Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita from only a couple of yards out while Anderson mis-hit a volley before seeing a header saved.\nEven after Palace had got back on level terms they again had a golden chance to win it late on but Haller took too long to shoot from a good position and was closed down by Van Aanholt.\nIn the end, five of West Ham's nine shots on goal failed to hit the target. However, they had scored two more goals in four of the five games prior to Palace's visit meaning this was likely just to be a bad day at the office for the Hammers' usually sharp shooters.\nMan of the match - Patrick van Aanholt\n'We need to play better' - what they said\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's hard to accept. We were a bit unlucky with the decisions.\n\"We scored a goal and took the lead but we had other chances, especially in the first half. I said before we started the season that the way we use VAR is the most important thing. We have nothing to complain about.\n\"Maybe a second goal would have decided the game. We had three good chances to score but didn't manage to. I don't think we played a bad game but we need to play better and keep improving. It was a good chance to be in the top three in the table.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I thought we were a bit unlucky to fall behind. The first half we were very satisfied with, we were a constant threat.\n\"I wouldn't say Haller's goal came against the run of play but we felt it wasn't in the offing at that stage. We were then fortunate that the two decisions that had to be made went our way.\n\"The one area we've been constantly strong in is central defence, but we've been working on our attacking play as well. That's why we've managed to amass a good tally of points so far.\"\nPalace loving life on the road - the stats\nOnly Manchester City (33) and Liverpool (30) have won more away points in the Premier League in 2019 than Crystal Palace (25).\nOnly Aston Villa (8) have lost more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than West Ham United (7).\nOf all teams to have scored at least 100 goals in Premier League history, Crystal Palace have scored the highest ratio of them from the penalty spot (12% - 52/432).\nSince they were promoted back to the Premier League in 2013, Crystal Palace have won (47) and scored (38) the most penalties of any side in the division.\nSebastien Haller has been directly involved in 14 goals in his last 15 home league starts at West Ham and Eintracht Frankfurt combined (7 goals, 7 assists).\nSince his debut for Crystal Palace in January 2017, no defender has scored more Premier League goals than Patrick van Aanholt (12, level with Marcos Alonso).\nWhat next?\nWest Ham are away to Everton in their first game after the international beak on Saturday, 19 October (12:30 BST) while Crystal Palace are at home to Manchester City later on the same day (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-4 Chelsea: Blues climb to fifth after comfortable win\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard says his Blues side can get \"a lot better\" after they swept past Southampton to move up to fifth in the Premier League.\nTammy Abraham's looping finish from Callum Hudson-Odoi's pass gave the visitors the lead, before Mason Mount doubled Chelsea's advantage from close range.\nDanny Ings reduced the arrears from Yan Valery's cut-back, but N'Golo Kante's deflected effort off Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Michy Batshuayi's neat finish put the seal on a comfortable victory for Lampard's side.\n\"I didn't think we started that well, even though doing so had been something we'd talked about before,\" said the former England midfielder. \"[Abraham's] goal came at the right time and after that I felt pretty comfortable.\n\"Getting four away from home - we're scoring - so it's a nice afternoon.\n\"Let's not get carried away, it's a long season and we feel we might have picked up more points than we've actually got. We've not been at our absolute best and we can be a lot better.\n\"We shouldn't be sloppy, and after going 2-0 up we should make it 3-0. We're scoring goals, but can we tighten up? Yes.\"\nPlain sailing for in-form Blues\nAfter a stuttering start to the campaign, there are signs that this youthful Chelsea side are beginning to build up a head of steam under Lampard.\nThis was the Blues' fourth successive win in all competitions - a result which lifts them level on points with fourth-placed Leicester City and only two behind champions Manchester City, who lost 2-0 at home to Wolves.\nYoungsters Abraham and Mount have taken the top flight by storm after spending last season on loan at Aston Villa and Derby County respectively, and the duo were heavily involved here as the visitors raced into an early lead.\nHudson-Odoi - making his first league start under Lampard - sent a long ball over the top of the Southampton defence and Abraham was first to it, his looping finish over Gunn crossing the line before Yoshida could clear the ball to safety.\nChelsea capitalised on a poor piece of Southampton defending to double their lead seven minutes later, Mount latching on to Willian's precise pass before slamming home his fourth goal of the campaign.\nThere appeared to be no way back for the Saints at that stage as Chelsea continued to lay siege to the home goal, but Ralph Hasenhuttl's side pulled a goal back out of nothing when Valery wriggled his way past several Blues defenders before setting up Ings, who was left with an easy finish.\nThere was an element of fortune about Chelsea's third - Kante's speculative drive deflecting off Hojbjerg and wrong-footing Gunn - but the dominant visitors could have won by a higher margin.\nHudson-Odoi was thwarted by Gunn four minutes after the restart, before Batshuayi eventually completed the scoring in the final minute of normal time with a confident finish from Christian Pulisic's through-ball.\n\"It's a transitional team but we don't have that in our heads,\" Mount told Match of the Day afterwards. \"We want to get as high in the table as we can.\n\"A lot of the young boys around us have played together for a long time. It's good having these boys around you in the senior team - it's a massive achievement and now we're looking forward to the international break.\"\nSloppy Saints leave Hasenhuttl with plenty to ponder\nThe last time Southampton suffered five defeats in their opening eight league games, they were relegated from the Premier League.\nHasenhuttl reverted to a four-man defence at St Mary's, with Ryan Bertrand dropping to left-back and Yan Valery replacing the absent Jannik Vestergaard.\nThe tactical switch did little to solidify the Saints' rearguard, however. Nathan Redmond sent a dipping effort inches over Kepa Arrizabalaga's crossbar within the opening minute, but it proved to be a false dawn for the hosts as Chelsea quickly gained a stranglehold on proceedings.\nSouthampton were culpable in their own downfall, giving the ball away on numerous occasions in the first half in particular. Indeed, it was Jan Bednarek's poor header to Oriol Romeu which gifted Chelsea possession in the build-up to Mount's goal.\nIngs' clinical finish from Valery's cut-back appeared to spark the hosts briefly into life. Redmond fired into the side-netting from a tight angle and Ings also had a goal-bound effort blocked, but their self-belief drained away with Kante's deflected effort shortly before the break.\nWith games against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Leicester City and Manchester City coming up, it is hard to see where Southampton's next victory is going to come from.\nMan of the match - Jorginho (Chelsea)\nNo home comforts for Southampton - the stats\nSouthampton have lost three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since October 2018, under Mark Hughes.\nChelsea have won each of their last four games in all competitions, equalling the longest win streak of Frank Lampard's managerial career to date (four games in August-September 2018 with Derby).\nThis was Southampton's heaviest defeat in a home Premier League game under Ralph Hasenhuttl. Indeed, the last time they lost by three or more goals in a home game in the competition was also against Chelsea (0-3 in October 2018).\nChelsea have scored three or more goals in three consecutive Premier League away games for the first time since August 2009.\nSouthampton have won just one point in Premier League home games this season (P4 W0 D1 L3) - the fewest in their opening four home games of a top-flight campaign since 2001-02 (also one point).\nTammy Abraham has scored nine goals for Chelsea across all competitions in 2019-20, the joint-most of any current Premier League player (along with Raheem Sterling).\nNo player in the top four tiers of English football has scored more league goals than Chelsea's Tammy Abraham in 2019 (20 - joint-most with Sergio Aguero, Teemu Pukki and James Collins).\nChelsea's Mason Mount has scored three goals in four away appearances in the Premier League this season, as many as he managed in 20 away league games under Frank Lampard at Derby last season (including play-offs).\n'We can be a lot better' - what the managers said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We started well but to be honest we are far away from our best, and against the best opponents you only have the chance to take something if you play your best.\n\"We were too slow in our minds, too slow on the ball. They showed us every weakness we had and we have a lot of them at the moment.\n\"When they build up from behind and score we must say 'OK', but to give the chances we did against such an opponent, you cannot handle it. That was the reason we were 3-1 down in the first half. Second half was a little better but not really, we never had the chance to come back.\n\"We know it is a tough situation, but we must work really hard and that's what we will do.\"\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Tammy's performance was great, his all-round performance and his work off the ball. But I must say, I thought Willian was immense - he was an example in what he was doing on and off the ball. He's a leader - not one that shouts - but in how he performs.\"\nOn Callum Hudson-Odoi: \"I liked a lot of the stuff he did, there's competition in those wide areas now. I thought it was a really good performance, really bright stuff. I'm disappointed he didn't get his goal.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to Wolves in their first game after the international break on Saturday, 19 October (kick-off 15:00 BST), while Chelsea welcome Newcastle United to Stamford Bridge at the same time."

We controlled the match and played with a high level, taking chances and scored from a corner. We also didn't concede chances to them and pressed well up the pitch.\n\"The second half we wanted to keep more of the ball, but they started pushing and maybe we lost our confidence and didn't do the work like we were in the first half.\"\nOn the team's young players: \"I am being very calm with them. It's very important to keep the balance. When they are playing well keep calm and the same if they are not playing like we want them to. We are there to help them, given them chances and some minutes.\n\"The Premier League is very demanding and we are going to play a lot of matches like today.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm disappointed with the first half, we were a little bit too passive and didn't dominate our style on them.\n\"We were second best for long periods. But you saw the other side in the second half, as bad as we were in the first half, we were good in the second.\n\"We dominated possession and deserved a point, we did well enough and had good enough chances.\n\"It didn't quite happen but I'm pleased with the reaction to the first half.\"\nBournemouth lose at one of the 'big six' again - the stats\nArsenal have won all six of their home matches in all competitions against Bournemouth - only against Gainsborough Trinity (eight wins out of eight) do they have a better 100% home win ratio in their entire history.\nBournemouth have lost 13 of their last 14 away Premier League games against the 'big six' teams (W1 D0 L13).\nArsenal have won 17 home Premier League games under Unai Emery. Since the start of last season, only Liverpool (21) and Man City (20) have won more.\nOnly against Man City (9) have Bournemouth lost more Premier League games than against Arsenal (7).\nArsenal have won 14 of their last 17 home matches in all competitions (W14 D2 L1), with this their first 1-0 win in this sequence.\nBournemouth have won none of their last 25 Premier League matches when conceding first (W0 D5 L20).\nTen of David Luiz's 12 Premier League goals have been scored in home matches, with this his first goal for Arsenal.\nNicolas Pepe has been involved in 28 goals in his last 30 home league matches for Lille and Arsenal (16 goals, 12 assists).\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth host Norwich after the international break on Saturday, 19 October (15:00 BST).

        "article_text": "Man City 0-2 Wolves: Champions beaten at home\nChampions Manchester City fell eight points behind Liverpool in the title race after suffering a shock home defeat against Wolves.\nAdama Traore scored twice in the final 10 minutes as Wolves won in the top flight at Manchester City for the first time since 1979.\nTraore scored the first 10 minutes from time as the visitors capitalised on a mistake from Joao Cancelo. He added a second on the break deep into injury time.\nCity have now dropped five points in their opening four home games of the season, having dropped just three in the whole of last season and seven the year before that.\nDavid Silva came closest for the hosts when he hit the bar with a second-half free-kick. Raheem Sterling also had a shot blocked in the scramble that followed.\nIt was only the second time in 45 league games that City have failed to score. The last time that happened at home in the league was against Huddersfield in May 2018, by which time they had already won their first title of the Guardiola era.\nTraore had not scored since September 2018 but the \u00a318m man made no mistake as Wolves twice broke clear of the home defence. Raul Jimenez provided the assist on both occasions.\n'No hint of a hangover' - Shearer on why Reds' lead looks ominous for Man City\nGuardiola says Man City can catch Liverpool\nRelive Wolves' stunning victory over Manchester City\nCity defensive errors ruthlessly punished\nIt is 20 years since Wolves last beat City away from Molineux and 40 since they did so in the top flight. The impact of this victory could have a significant bearing on the title race, so fine are the margins in the battle between the champions and leaders Liverpool.\nCity and Wolves had both been engaged in European combat this week - and the fact City were at home, rather than travelling 4,000 miles to Turkey and back - and had an additional two days' rest, should have given them a clear advantage.\nThat they failed to make the most of it was almost entirely due to their own failings.\nThrough either misplaced passes by Riyad Mahrez or Nicolas Otamendi, or the latter man needlessly charging out of position, Wolves forwards were allowed to run free three times in the opening half, straight down the middle of the pitch.\nPatrick Cutrone screwed one opportunity badly wide and Jimenez appeared to be clipped in the penalty area by Fernandinho, costing him a shooting chance. In between, Fernandinho, currently operating as a makeshift central defender, denied both men with a magnificent double block.\nCity thought they had survived the worst. But as they pushed for a winner in the final 10 minutes, their mistakes finally cost them.\nThis time, Cancelo lost possession, allowing Jimenez to race on. As Otamendi slipped, the Mexican rolled the ball to Traore, who finished cleanly.\nAs City's desperation increased, Traore's pace was too much for them. And in the final minute of stoppage time, Jimenez again fed the \u00a318m signing from Middlesbrough, who completed his first double since February 2018, when he was still on Teesside.\nAre City's problems already insurmountable?\nThis was the day when City's injury problems finally caught up with them.\nIt is tempting to dismiss Guardiola's travails as first-world issues.\nAfter all, City were able to give a full Premier League debut to Cancelo, who cost \u00a360m to sign from Juventus in the summer, and could afford to leave Bernardo Silva and Gabriel Jesus on the bench.\nNevertheless, without Kevin de Bruyne and Leroy Sane, they are being robbed of creativity and the absence of central defenders Aymeric Laporte and John Stones denies them continuity. It already feels as though the problems they face in this title battle are insurmountable.\nCancelo's selection at left-back meant Guardiola had picked four different players in that single position in the last four games. One of them, Benjamin Mendy, has not started back-to-back Premier League games for 11 months and is facing another spell on the sidelines after suffering a hamstring injury in training.\nCancelo did OK during the opening period. Evidently, that was not good enough for Guardiola, who switched the Italian to right-back at the break - sacrificing Kyle Walker in the process three days after he was left out of the latest England squad - and brought Oleksandr Zinchenko on instead.\nThere was marginal improvement. But it was limited. And that Cancelo made the mistake that gave Wolves the advantage they were never to lose, just highlighted the consequences of the City weakness that has been exposed.\nA week to kickstart Wolves' faltering season\nThe victory completed a fantastic week for Wolves.\nThey started it in the bottom three of the Premier League but a 2-0 win against Watford - their first of the season - lifted them out of the relegation zone.\nThen, an injury-time goal by central defender Willy Boly earned them a Europa League victory in Turkey against Besiktas and raised their hopes of reaching the knockout stage.\nThis win, in their 17th match of a campaign which began on 25 July, leaves them four points off a top-four spot.\nIn the past 12 months, they have now beaten all of the 'big six' in the Premier League apart from Liverpool, who they knocked out of last season's FA Cup.\nMan of the match - Willy Boly (Wolves)\n'It is a bad day' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola tells BBC Sport: \"We were not at our best. We had chances to score but it was a bad day and we lost the game.\n\"We did not make good process, we had problems in that sense. We are a team that plays a specific way but it is a bad day, that happens sometimes.\n\"When you win games, you think about the other one. Now we have the international break, then we can come back and go to the other games.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo tells BBC Sport: \"We played good, the performance was good but defensively was very good and very organised. The boys worked hard until the end. The fans enjoyed it.\n\"We had a couple of good chances early on but it is too difficult to play against Manchester City. They play so fast but the chances came eventually. More importantly is how the players did their tasks, very good.\n\"Adama Traore is improving. He is special because he is very fast, he is unique in that and we searched for a moment of talent.\n\"It has been a long season already, too many games, but we always compete. I cannot say any game they have not done that. This is the way we want to work, maintain and sustain this.\"\nWolves' landmark win - the best stats\nWolves have beaten Manchester City away from home in a top-flight match for the first time since December 1979, having drawn once and lost six there since then before today.\nManchester City have lost at home in the Premier League for just the fourth time in 61 matches under Guardiola.\nManchester City have lost a Premier League match at Etihad Stadium without scoring for the first since March 2016 against Manchester United (0-1), with Manuel Pellegrini in charge.\nWolves have beaten the reigning champions of the top flight away from home for the first time since January 1984, when they defeated Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield.\nGuardiola has a 25% win rate in all competitions against Nuno Espirito Santo (1/4) - of managers Guardiola has faced at least three times while in charge of Manchester City, only against Ronald Koeman (0%) and Jurgen Klopp (22%) does he have a worse win rate.\nTraor\u00e9 had not scored in his past 32 Premier League games before netting twice against City, last scoring against West Ham in September 2018.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City will look to get their faltering title bid back on track when they travel to Crystal Palace - one of the few teams to beat them last season - on 19 October. Wolves host Southampton on the same day."

We knew this run was going to be difficult. I hope this is the turning point.\n\"I have waited something like 20 years for a result against United.\n\"To beat a club of Manchester United's size is always a special thing. Considering the start we've had and the teams we've played, eight points - we'll accept it.\"\nBruce was unhappy that his team had been leaked in the newspapers before the game, adding: \"I know I am not going to be everyone's cup of tea but the nonsense that flies around is insulting. Hopefully this helps the cause.\"\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side looked bereft of ideas in front of goal: Andreas Pereira's curling strike was comfortable for Martin Dubravka, while Harry Maguire nodded a free header wide from four yards.\nThe visitors' tally of nine points after eight games is their lowest since the 1989-90 season, when they were a point worse off.\nA day to remember for Matty Longstaff\nRelive Newcastle's win over Manchester United\nToothless Reds hit new lows\nThese two Uniteds had some tremendous title tussles during the 1990s, but the situation is much different these days with both sets of fans deeply unhappy with their respective owners.\nThough big money was spent in the summer - Newcastle signing striker Joelinton for a club record \u00a340m and their opponents bringing in defender Maguire for \u00a380m - both face the prospect of a difficult season.\nThe Magpies are fighting to remain in the top flight and while the Red Devils are attempting to claim a European place, they find themselves in 12th place in the table.\nThey last won away from home in the league in February and extended that run to eight games with another lifeless and uninspiring showing.\nTheir defence has improved from last term, conceding eight times so far which is the third-best record in the division, but it is in attack where the major problems lie.\nSolskjaer's men failed to get a single shot on target against AZ Alkmaar in the Europa League on Thursday and again struggled to carve out clear-cut chances in the final third, the best opportunity falling to Maguire, who should have converted his close-range header in the first half.\nPlaymaker Juan Mata contributed little, while in attack Marcus Rashford received no service in a side that has not scored more than one goal in a game since hitting four against Chelsea on the opening weekend.\nMagpies much improved\nNewcastle boss Bruce had tried and failed to beat his old employers as a Premier League manager on 21 previous occasions\u2026 but that all changed with this result.\nHis job was under scrutiny after a 5-0 capitulation at Leicester in their previous game, but Newcastle's first home win of the campaign moves them up to 16th place.\nBruce gave a first top-flight start to Longstaff and his impressive showing was rewarded with a delightful goal.\nLongstaff did not look out of place alongside his older brother, making more passes (39) than any team-mate and contributing in defence by winning the ball back four times.\nHe told BBC Sport: \"I think getting to play with Sean was unbelievable. We used to kick each other in the garden growing up so to be on the same team, for our hometown club, and to win against Manchester United, who are a good side, is a bit surreal.\n\"I found out I was in the team after training yesterday. Your belly starts to turn a bit, you get a bit nervous and then you don't sleep much. I dreamed about it last night, this is kind how it of went.\"\nBruce said: \"They [the Longstaffs] are a very proud family. For one of your sons to be playing, let alone the two - and 19 and 21 years old - it's something else.\n\"When it fell to him [Matty], I thought I've seen him drill them in in training but to do it on the big stage...\n\"He's been a breath of fresh air. He just wants to play football. I thought who's this ginger kid when we were in China. He's been good in training.\n\"It didn't faze him. He enjoyed it. He probably didn't sleep well last night. He won't get much sleep again tonight. It's quite a story. I've been going 20 odd years and not been able to beat Manchester United and he's done it straight away.\"\nThe lively Allan Saint-Maximin dragged a shot wide, Miguel Almiron continues to seek his first goal for the club as a low shot was brilliantly blocked by Maguire, and substitute Andy Carroll steered a diving header over the bar.\nMan of the match - Matty Longstaff (Newcastle)\nBruce's milestone - the stats\nMan Utd have won just nine points from their eight Premier League games this season - their lowest total after the first eight games of a league season since 1989-90 (8 pts).\nMan Utd are winless in their last eight away league games (D3, L5) - their longest such run in the top-flight since September 1989 (11 games).\nSteve Bruce took charge of his 400th Premier League game, the seventh manager to reach this milestone. He's only the fourth manager to win on his 400th game in the competition (also David Moyes, Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger).\nManchester United have won just two of their last 13 Premier League games (D5, L6).\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer won his first nine away games in all competitions as Man Utd manager, since then he's won none of his last 11 (D4 L7).\nMatty Longstaff became the youngest player to score on his Premier League debut for Newcastle United (19y 199d).\nMatty Longstaff became the second youngest player to score a winning goal against Man U in the Premier League, after Jermain Defoe (19y 62d in December 2001 for West Ham).\nNo Man Utd player had more touches in the opposition box (4) or attempted more shots (3) versus Newcastle than defender Harry Maguire.\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Newcastle travel to Chelsea on 19 October (kick-off 15:00 BST), while it does not get any easier for Manchester United, who host unbeaten Premier League leaders Liverpool the following day (16:30)."

Express yourselves on the pitch is what I say - and we did.\n\"When you are not in a very good moment, the pressure is there to win more games. We were not good enough in last results.\"\nEverton's supporters gave their team vociferous backing throughout and Silva said: \"The crowd was really good. I asked them to support our players from the first moment and they did.\"\nHe added: \"I know what I'm doing. I have full confidence in the staff and full confidence in my players as well. Of course it's better when you win games, but I was always calm.\n\"I wasn't nervous. This afternoon we created so many chances. The game was always under control.\"\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini was bitterly disappointed and, after replacing Felipe Anderson with Andriy Yarmolenko at half-time, admitted: \"In that moment, if I could make 11 changes, maybe I do.\n\"In the first half we didn't shoot once at goal. Everton dominated the game. They had six or seven chances.\"\nBrave Silva gets his reward\nSilva took positive action with his back against the wall - so deserves full credit as Everton produced their best performance of the season to overpower woeful West Ham.\nHe dropped Sigurdsson, who can have no complaints after his poor form this season, pushed Richarlison into the centre and brought back Theo Walcott.\nSilva reintroduced Tom Davies into central midfield alongside Andre Gomes and gave Alex Iwobi the number 10 role in behind the striker.\nThe result was an Everton performance full of energy, hard work and creativity that should have reaped a much greater victory margin than it actually did.\nIt was only the excellence of West Ham goalkeeper Roberto, producing a succession of fine saves and also calling on the help of the woodwork, that kept the score within reason for the Hammers.\nEverton were always on the front foot, backed by a raucous Goodison Park crowd that never wavered in its support for Silva's team.\nIt will take more than one win to blow away the clouds over Silva as he has reached that critical stage where one setback ratchets up the pressure again.\nAll the noises suggest he still needs to follow this up with a win at Brighton next Saturday and then at home to Watford in the Carabao Cup.\nThis, however, was exactly what he needed - namely a comprehensive, crowd-pleasing win in which Everton responded to the manager's changes and promptings.\nWretched West Ham disappoint again\nWest Ham should have their sights set on the top six in this season of Premier League flux, with Spurs struggling and Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal in stages of relative transition.\nInstead, they have an infuriating inconsistency that threatens to derail those aspirations once more.\nYes, they can throw in the occasional excellent victory as they did against Manchester United - although that currency is devalued these days - but then they are humiliated in the Carabao Cup at League One Oxford United, lose at home to Crystal Palace then deliver this shocking show at Goodison Park.\nIf they had come near snatching a point here, it would have been an act of grand larceny.\nPellegrini stood motionless in his technical area, actions mirrored by most of his team as they lacked energy, ideas and threat.\nOnly keeper Roberto emerged with any sort of credit in what was a display lacking heart and competitive edge.\nIf those top-six hopes are to be realised, they cannot perform like this on many more occasions.\nMan of the match - Theo Walcott (Everton)\nHome comforts for Toffees - the stats\nEverton's last six Premier League wins have all come at Goodison Park; the Toffees have won seven of their last nine home league matches (W7 D0 L2).\nWest Ham suffered their first away Premier League defeat of the season (W1 D3 L1), leaving only Liverpool and Sheffield United unbeaten away from home this season.\nEverton have won more Premier League games against West Ham than against any other side (26).\nTwo of Bernard's three Premier League goals for Everton have been scored against West Ham United, also netting against the Hammers in March 2019 at London Stadium.\nEverton's Theo Walcott has been involved in 10 Premier League goals against West Ham (six goals, four assists) - against no side has he been involved in more (also 10 against Newcastle and Tottenham).\nGylfi Sigurdsson has scored 21 Premier League goals from outside the box since his debut in January 2012; only Christian Eriksen (22) has scored more from outside the box in the competition.\nTheo Walcott had seven shots without scoring for Everton in this game, the most he's ever had without scoring in a Premier League match in what was his 327th appearance.\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to Brighton in their next Premier League game on Saturday, 26 October (kick-off 15:00 BST), while West Ham host Sheffield united at the London Stadium at the same time."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 0-0 Norwich: Canaries earn first away point\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke said claiming a first clean sheet and away point of the season in their draw at Bournemouth was \"important\" for his team's belief.\nThe Canaries were thumped 5-1 by Aston Villa before the international break and soundly beaten by Burnley and Crystal Palace prior to that.\nAnd such was the quality of the performance against Villa, former Norwich striker Chris Sutton was prompted to say: \"Norwich are not going to survive in the Premier League unless they improve significantly at the back.\"\nAgainst Bournemouth they did just that - they put in an organised defensive display to keep the Cherries at bay while maintaining an attacking threat at the other end.\nAnd their away clean sheet is an even more impressive feat considering the fact they played nearly half the game with two central midfielders at centre-back - in Alexander Tettey and Ibrahim Amadou - following Ben Godfrey's early exit due to injury.\n\"We changed our approach slightly to play with three central midfielders; in order to be solid it was important to control the centre and have a bit more control and a bit more steel in there,\" Farke said.\n\"It's our first clean sheet at this level, after a difficult game for us against Aston Villa - I've worked pretty long in this business but I've never had to play without four centre-backs, without three holding midfielders and without two goalkeepers. It's a strange situation.\n\"[The result is] good for the mood, good for the self-confidence. Bournemouth is a tough place to come, their speed and mobility and physicality is often difficult to handle but we controlled the game in their half.\"\nTeemu Pukki had the Canaries' best chance, when he was denied by a fine Aaron Ramsdale save in the second half.\nBournemouth's best chance fell to Dominic Solanke, but Tim Krul was equal to his first-half effort.\nNorwich remain 19th following this result, however, the improved defensive display will give Farke cautious cause for optimism for the rest of the season.\nMeanwhile, the point means Bournemouth climb to ninth - going above West Ham on goal difference.\nAs it happened: Bournemouth 0-0 Norwich\nReaction to the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nCanaries earn well-deserved point\nDaniel Farke and the Canaries gave their fans a night to remember when they memorably beat champions Manchester City in mid-September but since then there has been little to celebrate for the Carrow Road faithful.\nThey were beaten by Burnley and Crystal Palace and they suffered a chastening home defeat by fellow Premier League newcomers Aston Villa in the final game before October's international break.\nHowever, there was something to celebrate for the travelling fans at Vitality Stadium: a hard-earned away point and a first shutout of the campaign.\nWhile the Canaries' defensive rigidity will have pleased Farke, their forward play will have not.\nDespite showing glimpses of quality, Pukki was largely shackled by the Cherries' centre-halves, meaning he was unable to replicate the form he showed to score twice for Finland on Tuesday night.\nKenny McLean and Todd Cantwell also looked dangerous at times but neither player was able to create any real chances.\nAnd Norwich's injury woes continued as Godfrey was forced off shortly after the break.\nThere were positives on the injury front for Farke, however, as Krul and captain Tettey, who filled in at centre-back for most of the second half after Godfrey went off, both played the full match and Tom Trybull and Onel Hernandez both made their comebacks off the bench.\n\"We have to wait and see what the outcome is [with Ben Godfrey],\" Farke said. \"He had hernia surgery 10 days ago and he only had one [training] session with the team.\n\"He was top class in the first 50 minutes and it was important to have him on the pitch - he was a great leader. After 50 minutes he felt pain, I think his body was getting tired after only one session, I hope it's not a big setback, but I hope to have him available for Man United but we have to wait.\"\nCherries fail to fire\nThe Cherries will see this as an opportunity missed.\nThey did manage to take 11 shots but only two of them were on target and just one of them seriously tested Krul in the Norwich goal.\nSolanke should have done better in the first half when he was thwarted by Krul after latching on to Callum Wilson's flick while Arnaut Danjuma's effort in the second half was nothing more than speculative.\nHarry Wilson also arguably should have done better when his free-kick found the Norwich wall where in the past the Liverpool loanee has found the top corner.\nThey struggled to break down the Canaries defence, which conceded five goals to Aston Villa last time out, despite the efforts of Ryan Fraser, who was lively throughout on his 100th Premier League outing for the club.\nBut despite their lacklustre performance, the Cherries did rise to ninth with this point.\nMan of the match - Adam Smith (Bournemouth)\n'A tough nut to crack' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"The positives are it's a clean sheet and another point in the right direction, but not the three we wanted. We'll have to look at the performance and try to learn from it.\n\"But at the same time, it's not a defeat. People see the fact we're playing Norwich at home and the expectation is for it to be a home win, and that's our expectation as well, but these games are never that easy.\n\"I fully respect Norwich, their manager and players and the way that they play - they're a tough nut to crack and the showed that today.\"\nNorwich boss Daniel Farke: \"As a newly promoted side who wasn't able to spend lots of money, sometimes the outcome is not what you wish for. Today was difficult as we had several players coming back after long-term injury, so it was a great performance and a great team effort. Three points would have meant a big step, but without a doubt it's a great point.\n\"All my centre-backs are injured, with all respect I would love to see Man City play without all their centre-backs, even they might struggle to be solid in defending. So it's a great point.\"\nCanaries end losing run - the stats\nBoth Bournemouth and Norwich kept their first league clean sheets of the season, becoming the last two sides in the Premier League to do so.\nNorwich's tally of seven points is their lowest after nine league games of a season since 2012-13.\nThis stalemate ended a seven-game losing run away from home in the Premier League for Norwich, and was their first draw on the road in the competition in 20 such games since a 2-2 draw at West Ham in September 2015.\nThis was Bournemouth's first goalless draw in the Premier League in almost exactly a year - since the game against Southampton on 20 October 2018.\nBoth Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson made their 100th Premier League appearances for Bournemouth in this game, making the Cherries the first side to have two players reach the milestone in the same game since Manchester City in August 2016 against Sunderland (Jesus Navas and Fernandinho).\nFraser and Wilson became the eighth and ninth players to reach 100 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth. Since the Cherries debuted in the competition in 2015-16, they have had more players make 100 or more Premier League appearances for them (nine) than any other side.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Vicarage Road to face Watford next Saturday (15:00 BST), and the following day the Canaries play host to Manchester United (16:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-1 Southampton: Raul Jimenez scores after VAR disallows two goals\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said his side knew it was \"time to show up\" after they carved out a point against Wolves.\nDanny Ings' opening goal was cancelled out by Raul Jimenez's equaliser from the penalty spot but it marked their first league point since victory over Sheffield United five weeks ago.\nJimenez had two goals disallowed by the video assistant referee in the first half at Molineux, which was hosting its 100th Premier League fixture.\nBut it was a confidence-boosting performance for Saints - one in which they dominated spells of possession - following defeats by Chelsea and Tottenham before the international break.\n\"You could feel it in the dressing room. Everyone knew it was time to show up,\" said Hasenhuttl.\n\"I know it was two difficult games we lost before but we were very critical with ourselves and that is the right way to make something better. If you are not honest, it is difficult to improve.\n\"It was a step forward. We were more stabilised in this game, better organised with our shape.\n\"It absolutely helps morale. After the last three games, the situation is never easy.\"\nJimenez thought he had put the hosts ahead midway through the first period when he rounded Angus Gunn before scoring into an empty net, but the video assistant referee ruled it out for handball.\nHe then finished from close range as half-time approached, but Patrick Cutrone was judged to have been offside in the build-up to the goal.\nIngs put Southampton ahead soon after the break - scoring in his fourth consecutive appearance in all competitions for the first time in his career - but the visitors' lead lasted only eight minutes as Jimenez equalised from the penalty spot.\n\"We have to get used to VAR. It's fine margins. They are small details but they are there to decide,\" said Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\"We celebrate then lose that, that is what's tough. The mood, it has a terrible impact and the other team celebrates. This is VAR and we have to get used to it.\n\"Every time the referee makes a signal for VAR, everybody is worried.\"\nWolves v Southampton - as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nJimenez and Wolves made to wait\nNuno made two changes to the Wolves side which beat champions Manchester City two weeks ago, bringing in Jonny and Ryan Bennett for the injured Romain Saiss and Ruben Vinagre, who dropped to the bench.\nThe hosts showed no sign of sluggishness after the international break, which came just as they were finding form with three consecutive league wins, but they were dealt an early blow when Bennett went off with a muscle twinge.\nSouthampton applied some early pressure while Wolves' Willy Boly played several exquisite balls forward, twice handing his team-mates good opportunities in and around Gunn's box.\nIt was Boly who put Jimenez in to find the back of the net for the first time, but VAR ruled the Mexican had handled the ball when bringing it down.\nThe second disallowed goal soon followed, Wolves making the most of some sloppy Saints play in the middle as Cutrone poked an effort towards goal. Gunn could do little but push it into Jimenez's path to finish, but VAR replays showed Cutrone had been marginally offside.\nTempers started to fray towards the end of the first half, and after Ings' goal at the start of the second, Wolves looked to have lost their way.\nBut when substitute Matt Doherty was clipped in the box by Saints skipper Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jimenez made no mistake in making it third time lucky, coolly slotting the ball past Gunn for the equaliser.\nSaints show promise\nSouthampton looked a different side to that beaten 4-1 at home by Chelsea two weeks ago, despite boss Hasenhuttl making just one change to his starting XI with Jannik Vestergaard replacing Shane Long.\nThey matched Wolves through the majority of the match, Ings and Nathan Redmond proving thorns in the hosts' side as they carved out several chances with the former going close from a tight angle early on.\nIt was Hojbjerg who had the best opportunity to put his side ahead but he failed to keep his effort low after being fed in by Ings, and punched the air in frustration as he quickly rued the missed chance.\nThey no doubt sighed with great relief when Jimenez's first and then second goals were ruled out, sandwiching another missed chance by Ings after he was played in by Ryan Bertrand, before Redmond saw out the first half with a half-volley into the side netting.\nIngs finally put Southampton ahead just after the hour mark after a slip up at the back by Wolves, the striker finding the ball at his feet with only the goalkeeper to beat.\nTheir celebrations were soon muted by Jimenez's equaliser but they showed great promise in the latter stages of the match, James Ward-Prowse going close with a free-kick and there was slick play from substitute Sofiane Boufal.\n'There was a lot of fight' - what they said\nMan of the match - Danny Ings (Southampton)\nJimenez makes Wolves history - the stats\nWolves have lost just one of their past 13 Premier League matches at Molineux (W7 D5 L1).\nSouthampton have won just twice in their past 14 Premier League games, drawing five and losing seven times.\nSeven of Southampton's eight points this season have come on the road - a league-high share in 2019-20 (88%).\nRaul Jimenez has scored more penalties than any other Wolves player in Premier League history (four).

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-1 Burnley: Youri Tielemans winner on emotional afternoon\nLeicester got the win they craved over Burnley to mark the anniversary of former owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's death on an emotional day at the King Power Stadium.\nBurnley thought they had equalised through Chris Wood eight minutes from time but his effort was controversially ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR), which ruled the striker had accidentally tripped Jonny Evans before the ball entered the net.\nIt meant Leicester were able to celebrate victory after goals from Jamie Vardy and Youri Tielemans had overturned Wood's 26th-minute header.\nIt was a fitting result on a day when Leicester honoured Vichai, who was killed on 27 October last year when his helicopter crashed shortly after take-off close to a car park by the stadium.\nWall of white honours former chairman Vichai\nFans walk to honour Leicester crash victims\nLate Leicester chairman's first horse seals emotional Ascot win\nEarlier, thousands of fans took part in a 'Walk for Vichai' and the stadium itself turned white as they wore scarves bearing the logo 'Making the Impossible Possible' which were given to them after entering the stadium.\nVichai's son 'Top', who is now responsible for running the club, was dignified throughout the game, shaking hands with numerous well-wishers before kick-off. He did allow himself to punch the air when Tielemans' 74th-minute shot powered into the roof of the net.\nAs the players left the field, Top put his hands together in prayer and pointed to the sky.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nLeicester v Burnley as it happened\nSubdued day for Maddison\nIt has been a strange couple of weeks for James Maddison after being selected for the England squad by Gareth Southgate. After joining up with the national team, he spoke about being a team player and not having a divine right to play international football. Two days later he had left the squad because of a virus. Twenty-four hours after that he was pictured in a casino.\nIn defending his player, Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers accepted Maddison \"will make better decisions in his life\".\nThe 22-year-old evidently still has some maturing to do but on the field, he is a major threat. The former Norwich man came close to putting Leicester in front when he arrowed a shot through a crowded penalty area, only for Ben Mee to turn it away.\nImmediately after the break, Maddison was not far away after stepping inside onto a pass from Tielemens on the edge of the box.\nIt was not his most productive day, though, and he appeared to have taken a knock before he was replaced by Dennis Praet in the 73rd minute, just before Leicester's winner.\nBurnley's long wait for top-flight win at Leicester goes on\nIt seemed fitting Burnley should be the visitors on the day Leicester celebrated Vichai's life, for they were also the first team to play here after his death.\nThat goalless draw extended the Clarets' wait for a top-flight win at Leicester to 51 years.\nFor almost 20 minutes, they looked to have a decent shot at ending that barren streak.\nWood is in a rich vein of form. There is nothing subtle about the New Zealander, who will doubtless be telling a few of his English team-mates they have no chance of reaching the Rugby World Cup final next week.\nBut when the excellent Dwight McNeil curled over a cross from the right, Wood climbed between Evans and Caglar Soyuncu at the far post and sent his header so high into the Leicester goal that, even at full stretch, Kasper Schmeichel was unable to claw it out.\nIt was Wood's fourth goal in five games and put Burnley fourth in the 'as it stands' table. VAR denied him a fifth eight minutes from time, with Sean Dyche incredulous that the striker's 'equaliser' should be ruled out for an accidental foul by Wood on Evans, who felt he would have cleared the ball before it had gone in.\nVardy silences Burnley fans\nIt might be regarded as trivial in the scheme of things but the social media spat between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy had plenty of people engrossed, judging by the millions who commented on it.\nWith their team winning and life looking good, the Burnley fans decided it was time to enter the debate. After an initial \"Rooney\" chant failed to catch on, they came up with \"Jamie Vardy, your wife is a grass\".\nIt was amusing but they must have known it had the potential to come back and haunt them.\nSo it proved as Vardy rose to head home Harvey Barnes' cross a minute before half-time. Vardy was virtually the length of the pitch away but he looked directly at the corner housing the Burnley fans and cupped his ears in celebration.\nMan of the match - Youri Tielemans (Leicester)\n'Key moment went against us' - what the managers said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"We were keen to make it a celebration. The supporters were incredible. We needed to tap into that emotion, we didn't in the first half but we were much more aggressive after half-time. Today they made him [Vichai] proud in fighting for the result.\n\"At Liverpool VAR went against us and cost us. From Sean's [Dyche] point of view, it will be harsh. There's an angle where you can see he clips Jonny Evans - the officials have time to asses from every angle and they decided it was a goal.\n\"Unfortunately it's something you accept as part of the game. I'm proud of how we won the game today - a tough game, an emotional game.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"I'm very disappointed. I'm a big fan of VAR but it has to be used more wisely than that. Chris Wood only has eyes for the ball and the defender isn't getting it in a million years. The referee doesn't even use the screen, he has got to come and look at that and I'd be surprised if he gave it.\n\"There is contact but we're talking about people who have been around the game long enough to know what body language means. If you're going to trip someone there's that little look and then you clip someone. Hopefully this is an incident that we can learn from.\n\"We do know there are going to be decisions that are so difficult to decide. We know that, but I don't think that was difficult today. Jonny Evans was never going to get that. The key moment has gone against us.\"\nRodgers continues perfect Burnley record - the stats\nBrendan Rodgers has won all four of his home league matches against Burnley as a manager, winning with four different clubs - Watford in 2009, Swansea in 2010, Liverpool in 2015 and Leicester.\nLeicester have won four consecutive home Premier League matches for the first time since winning five in a row in May 2017.\nRodgers has won 21 of his past 24 home league matches as manager while at Celtic and Leicester, losing once.\nSince Rodgers' first Premier League game in charge of Leicester on 3 March, Jamie Vardy has scored 15 Premier League goals - two more than any other player.\nAt 21 years and 314 days, Leicester's Harvey Barnes became the second-youngest player to provide two assists in a Premier League game for the Foxes, behind only Emile Heskey in May 1998 against West Ham.\nThis was Burnley's 100th away Premier League match, but they have won just 16 of those 100 games. Only West Brom (12) have won fewer in their first 100 away games in the competition.\nSix of Dwight McNeill's eight Premier League assists have been provided for Chris Wood, with all of those goals coming in 2019.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester are next in action on Friday, when they travel to Southampton (20:00 BST). Burnley entertain Chelsea the following day, 26 October (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham 1-1 Watford: Dele Alli saves Spurs amid VAR confusion\nDele Alli rescued a late point for Tottenham to deny visitors Watford a first Premier League win of the season amid video assistant referee (VAR) confusion.\nWith the out-of-form hosts desperately seeking a way back into the game, Hornets keeper Ben Foster flapped at an 86th-minute cross, with Alli controlling with his shoulder before turning the ball into the net.\nThe video assistant referee reviewed the goal and decided it was correctly awarded. The big screen, however, indicated the decision was 'no goal'. After a spell of confusion, the goal stood.\nFor large periods before Alli's intervention, it had looked as though Mauricio Pochettino's side were going to suffer a fifth defeat in six games.\nWatford, who lost Danny Welbeck to an early hamstring injury, took the lead when Abdoulaye Doucoure swept home Daryl Janmaat's cross.\nAnd they had a strong penalty appeal turned down by referee Chris Kavanagh - and the VAR - when Jan Vertonghen brought down Gerard Deulofeu.\nBut, leading for 80 minutes, their wait for a first Premier League win continues and they remain bottom.\nFollow reaction to all of Saturday's Premier League games\nVAR is not being used correctly - Shearer\nVAR dominates headlines again\nWatford will feel hard done by after more VAR controversy.\nIt looked like they should have had a penalty when 1-0 up in the first half as Vertonghen's trailing leg brought down Deulofeu in the box.\nThe VAR decided Kavanagh had not made a clear and obvious error in not awarding a penalty so Spurs escaped. Only one 'subjective decision' has been changed by the VAR in the Premier League all season - with most reversals down to factual incidents such as offside.\n\"You could see exactly what happened there. I completely believed it was a penalty,\" Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores told BBC Sport after the game.\nIt then looked as if the Hornets had been given a late reprieve when the big screen said 'no goal' from Alli's equaliser - although Kavanagh eventually made clear the goal stood.\nThe company that provides the technology apologised to both clubs for the incorrect graphic after the game.\nPlayers are not allowed to touch the ball with their arms before scoring - even accidentally - under new laws. It was decided, however, that Alli's goal should stand with the marginal call deeming the ball had come off his shoulder.\nFlores also felt the goal should have been disallowed for a Harry Kane shove on Christian Kabasele in the build-up.\n\"I believe it is a foul. He pushed with both hands but that is my opinion,\" said Flores. \"It is a little bit different. I don't think they need VAR.\"\nLucky escape will not relieve pressure on Pochettino\nPochettino made seven changes from the 3-0 defeat by Brighton before the international break, but his substitutions during the game effectively reversed three of them.\nSon Heung-min came on at half-time as Spurs abandoned a wing-back formation and he was their star man.\nThe South Korea international almost levelled four minutes after coming on, as he ran onto Alli's pass before blasting a shot off the crossbar. It looked as if Watford keeper Foster got a touch, although the referee awarded a throw-in to the Hornets.\nSpurs - who were regularly opened up at the back - only managed two shots on target, both from Alli - who was making his first Premier League start of the season following injury.\nThings are not going to get any easier for ninth-placed Spurs, who do not appear to have recovered from losing last season's Champions League final.\nThey host Red Star Belgrade on Tuesday before visiting unbeaten leaders Liverpool in the Premier League next Sunday.\n\"I feel well - good not great - because I saw the team fight and have character,\" Pochettino said. \"It wasn't a great game but I think we did enough to score and maybe win the game.\n\"I am happy with the way the team showed character so it means that the only way we improve is to work hard.\"\nWatford deserve more\nBottom side Watford's problem this season has been their failure to score goals.\nThey have created 90 Premier League chances - the joint sixth highest in the division - but Doucoure's goal was only the fifth they have scored in the league all season.\nThey squandered plenty of chances on the counter-attack with Janmaat guilty of wasting two of them - including a poor shot from a four-on-two scenario.\nThey were unlucky not to get a penalty - and unfortunate to concede at the end - but their failure to finish off chances is what could cost them a place in the Premier League come May.\nNext up for the Hornets is a home game with Bournemouth next Saturday.\nMan of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure (Watford)\nMore changes than ever before for Spurs - match stats\nSpurs have won just three of their past 12 Premier League games (W3, D4, L5), keeping just one clean sheet.\nWatford remain winless in the Premier League this season (D4, L5), failing to win their opening nine games of a league season for the first time since 2006-07, when they went on to finish bottom of the Premier League.\nDele Alli has scored five Premier League goals against Watford for Spurs - against no side does he have more (also five against Chelsea and Southampton).\nOf players to score in at least 10 Premier League games, Watford's Abdoulaye Doucoure has the lowest winning percentage, having scored in 14 and winning just two (14% - W2, D6, L6).\nTottenham conceded in the opening 10 minutes of consecutive Premier League games for the first time since November 2014, when they did so against Stoke City and Hull City.\nWatford's Danny Welbeck was substituted off in the fourth minute of this match, the earliest substitution in a Premier League match since Daniel Sturridge for West Brom against Chelsea in February 2018 (also fourth minute).\nSpurs made seven changes to their starting XI for this match - their most between two Premier League games in a season in Premier League history."

The home side should have settled their fans' nerves moments later but Abraham was denied by an excellent stop from Yedlin.\nSaint-Maximin shines again\nNewcastle are in the bottom three, but this display suggests it is not time to panic just yet.\nOnce again the Magpies shone defensively, with Dubravka, Yedlin, Fabian Schar and Ciaran Clark leaving everything on the pitch. And perhaps against weaker opposition the effervescent Allan Saint-Maximin will have seen some of his lung-bursting runs have an end result.\nThe Frenchman is a new fans' favourite on Tyneside and looked most likely to either score for his team or provide an assist. Unfortunately for him and the travelling support, record signing Joelinton was not on the same wavelength in attack.\nBruce threw on forwards Andy Carroll and Dwight Gayle in the last 20 minutes but they failed to make an impact.\nMan of the match - Tammy Abraham\n'We want more' - reaction\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard, speaking to Match of the Day: \"The second half was the most pleasing thing. It was a good test for us today. We changed things a little in the second half and we showed a little more flexibility and creativity.\n\"We were upbeat, we had urgency, the tempo was good, and that got us the win.\n\"We want to score goals. You can see the fans - I think they're happy with what they're seeing at the moment. We want more.\n\"If we want to keep moving up, we can do better. So far this season, though, things are going well.\"\nOn Ross Barkley's injury:\"It's an ankle injury. We need to assess it and see how bad it is.\"\nNewcastle head coach Steve Bruce, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We had a few chances in the first half in particular, but we didn't pick the right pass or the right cross.\n\"Chelsea have a nice blend of youth and experience at the moment. We didn't weather the storm in the second half.\n\"We've had a really tough start. We've now got a run of games against teams who are going to be in and around us. Hopefully we can get a few points.\"\nOn Chelsea's goal: \"I have to say, I thought it was a foul on Joelinton. When you come to Chelsea you need these things to fall for you.

Targett's shot found the bottom right corner to secure Villa's first back-to-back Premier League wins since May 2015 and leave Brighton 16th in the table.\nHow Aston Villa v Brighton unfolded\nGrealish integral as Villa rewarded for perseverance\nWhile Dean Smith's Aston Villa side were initially outplayed and outmanoeuvred by the visitors in their first top-flight meeting for 26 years, they persevered and were also aided by the first-half dismissal of Mooy.\nMooy's departure not only deprived Brighton of one of their better performers, it also released Grealish, who had until then been largely restricted to defensive work.\nThough Grealish worked diligently to track back down the left to try and stem the flow of Brighton attacks, his contributions at the other end of the pitch swung the outcome in the hosts' favour.\nDriving Villa forward at every opportunity, his equalising goal, coming as he slid in Guilbert's cross at the Holte End of the ground, represented his second consecutive Premier League goal and his fourth of the season.\n\"It was a captain's performance,\" said Villa manager Dean Smith.\n\"For the other side of the game people don't see, Jack ran 60 yards to back dispossess players [at times]. He was integral to everything, he got the goal and provided an assist. All in all he was really good.\"\nThough Ryan repelled two zinging efforts from the 24-year-old after the break, Grealish's influence never waned.\nWith Villa slowly taking control, Anwar El Ghazi wastefully blasted a right-foot shot over the bar from eight yards after following up Conor Hourihane's shot.\nThat appeared to have been Villa's best chance to claim all three points, until Grealish's late intervention, showing quick feet and intelligence to flick the ball between Brighton defenders for Targett's late goal.\nBrighton punished for late lapse\nThe afternoon had started serenely for Brighton who picked up where they left off in their 3-0 win over Tottenham prior to the international break.\nInitially controlling proceedings, midfield trio Dale Stephens, Aaron Mooy and Davy Propper set the tone as the Seagulls swept forward and fed Neal Maupay and Aaron Connolly at every opportunity.\nAnd their goal, which arrived when Webster headed back across goal from Gros' right-footed delivery, was just reward for their efforts.\nOnly a superb Tom Heaton save from Connolly, after the forward had been sent clear on goal by Maupay, prevented a richly-deserved second goal.\nMooy's dismissal though four minutes later shifted the momentum back in favour of the hosts and allowed Grealish and John McGinn more time and space to direct Villa's attacks.\nAt times Brighton made light of that, with Webster, Dunk and Duffy all impressive in defence as they restricted the hosts, largely to half chances and just seven shot on target until Targett's late strike.\n\"In the context of the game the sending off has an impact,\" said Brighton boss Graham Potter, \"We were the better team and in control until then.\"\nBut despite still causing the hosts problems on the counter-attack and with a point in sight, Brighton were punished for a defensive lapse with two defenders being drawn to Grealish and Targett allowed to run beyond them in the penalty area.\n\"It's a painful one that is for sure,\" Potter added. \"When it happens with the last kick, it's a heart-wrenching one.\"\nMan of the match - Jack Grealish (Aston Villa)\nVilla concede a lot of shots - the stats\nAston Villa's Premier League games this season have seen a combined 293 shots (131 attempted, 162 faced), more than any other side, with today's game seeing 44 (24 attempted, 20 faced), the most in a single Premier League fixture since Manchester United v Burnley in October 2016 (45).\nAston Villa came from behind to win a Premier League game for the first time since December 2014 against Leicester (2-1), ending a run of 50 winless games in the competition when falling behind at any stage.\nAston Villa have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since May 2015 under Tim Sherwood.\nBrighton have now lost 15 Premier League games in 2019, more than any other team this calendar year in the competition.\nBrighton have never won away at Aston Villa in any competition, with today their 12th such visit (D3 L9).\nPascal Gros has assisted 12 goals for Brighton in the Premier League - at least five more than any other Seagulls player - and has 22 goal involvements in the competition (10 goals, 12 assists); only Glenn Murray (26) has more.\nBrighton's Aaron Mooy became the first Australian player to be sent off in a Premier League game since Brad Smith for Liverpool against Swansea in May 2016.\nSince they joined the Premier League in 2017-18, only Leicester (10) and Everton (9) have received more red cards in the competition than Brighton (8).\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa travel to the Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City next Saturday, 26 October (12:30 BST) while Brighton will hope to bounce back against Everton later the same day (15:00 BST)."

It was, ultimately, one they overcame with relative ease.\nSetting up without any recognised centre-backs - midfielders Fernandinho and Rodri lining up centrally between wing-backs Joao Cancelo and Benjamin Mendy - the visitors launched wave after wave of attack but were initially frustrated by Hennessey.\nJesus was unable to direct Kevin de Bruyne's excellent cross on target within the opening five minutes, while Bernardo Silva's curled effort - bound for the top-corner - was met by Hennessey's fingertips as the visitors peppered his goal with 11 first-half attempts.\nStriker Jesus was given the nod ahead of Sergio Aguero, who was involved in a car crash on his way to training on Wednesday, and the Brazilian repaid his manager's faith with a moment of quality to score the crucial opener.\nOffering Guardiola much food for thought, Jesus has now scored in each of his last seven starts for City - and 21 times in his last 20 games when starting in all.\nWhile Silva's exquisite finish from Sterling's equally delicate pass before half-time suggested the flood gates had opened, City were uncharacteristically unable to add more goals as Jesus and Sterling both passed up glorious second-half opportunities.\nThat did not matter. Despite their recent inconsistency, two quick-fire first-half goals were enough to extend their impressive away record to 11 victories from their past 12 in the top flight - and a favour from cross-city rivals United on Sunday would a big help as the champions look to get back on track.\nNo joy for Palace despite Hennessey's best efforts\nIndicative of the impressive, yet somewhat under-the-radar, start Palace have made to this campaign, Roy Hodgson's side began this match with the potential to leapfrog their opponents in the table and climb into the top four after nine games.\nThe hosts were therefore expected to make life rather uncomfortable for Guardiola's stuttering side, but despite Hennessey's superb efforts they were unable to take advantage of the champions' makeshift defence.\nThere were unconvincing moments at the back for City, with Wilfried Zaha offering a capable threat on the counter, but their best opportunities did not arrive until the closing stages.\nHennessey touched the ball more than any of his team-mates in the opening half an hour, his initial invincibility suggesting his side could add to their tally of three clean sheets in four home matches this term.\nIt was, forgivably, two moments of quality that unravelled Hodgson's best laid plans.\nThe Eagles, who had won back to back league games, enjoyed a promising final period, however Ederson was equal to what they could offer - most notably keeping out Zaha's powerful strike from close range and tipping Benteke's effort onto the bar - but Palace remain sixth despite the defeat.\nMen of the match - Wayne Hennessey (Crystal Palace) & Ederson (Man City)\n'We still have our hat pegged nicely' - what they managers said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"After the international break, to play here at Selhurst Park and create a lot of chances was good. We played well but didn't score too many - but we didn't concede. We conceded chances at the end but Ederson made two incredible saves. It's three points and we move forward.\n\"We enjoyed the second goal - it was nice. But in the Premier League we have to score the third and fourth because it was difficult in the end with the pressure.\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: \"They were two very good goals, they had had a lot of possession and they had been pushing us back. I am pleased and proud of the way the players did not drop their heads. I take a lot of comfort from that.\n\"We are not in a bad place and we are not in a much worse place after today's game. We could have been if we had collapsed. We have still got our hat pegged nicely in place and we have to accept sometimes we will come across a team as good as they were today.\nOn goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey's performance: \"He was excellent, absolutely excellent. I was pleased because he's had to wait for his chance because Vicente Guaita has been so good. He has been working hard in the background to show us he's still a good goalkeeper and he showed us that today.\"\nJesus hits 50 - the stats\nManchester City have won 12 of their 14 away Premier League games in 2019 - at least three more than any other club.\nIn all competitions, City have won 16 of their last 19 meetings with Crystal Palace, scoring 47 goals.\nGabriel Jesus scored his 50th goal for Manchester City in all competitions.\nJesus has been directly involved in 58 goals in his 64 starts across all competitions for Manchester City.\nDavid Silva has been directly involved in eight goals in his last seven league starts against Crystal Palace.\nRaheem Sterling has 13 goals and seven assists in 16 appearances for Manchester City and England combined in 2019-20.\nCrystal Palace have lost 10 home league games since the start of last season. Of ever-present Premier League sides in that time, only Burnley and Newcastle have suffered more such defeats on home soil.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City host Atalanta in the Champions League group stages on Tuesday (20:00 BST), before welcoming Aston Villa to Etihad Stadium on Saturday (12:30 BST).\nMeanwhile, Crystal Palace travel to face Arsenal on Sunday (16:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Man Utd 1-1 Liverpool: Adam Lallana saves Reds' unbeaten start\nAdam Lallana's late equaliser rescued a point for Liverpool at Old Trafford as Manchester United ended the leaders' flawless start to the Premier League season.\nLiverpool were in search of their 18th successive league win to equal Manchester City's top-flight record set between August and December 2017 but had to settle for a point after a scrappy encounter.\nMarcus Rashford's hotly-contested first-half goal, allowed after a video assistant referee check for a foul by Victor Lindelof on Divock Origi, looked to be condemning Liverpool to their first league loss since they went down at Manchester City in January.\nRashford finished neatly from Daniel James' cross in the 36th minute but Liverpool, who saw a first-half strike from Sadio Mane ruled out by VAR for handball, struck back when substitute Lallana arrived unmarked at the far post to score from Andy Robertson's cross five minutes from time.\nThe draw means Liverpool's advantage at the top of the table has been cut to six points.\nAnalysis - how Solskjaer found a way to stop Liverpool\nKlopp: Man Utd always set up to defend against us\nWas Liverpool's run always destined to end at Man Utd?\nDiscover how you rated the players\nLiverpool grateful for a point\nLiverpool's relentless start to the season ended here at Old Trafford, an arena where they always struggle to produce their best.\nThey have failed to win on their past six visits to Manchester United, comprising three losses and three draws, meaning manager Jurgen Klopp is still searching for his first win here with Liverpool.\nRobbed of the injured Mohamed Salah, Liverpool started with Origi on the left and rarely displayed the intensity and attacking verve that has become their trademark in a strangely subdued performance. They had 68% of the ball but barely created any clear-cut opportunities in a match that swiftly became a war of attrition.\nLiverpool, however, are sustained by a fierce determination even when not in top gear and Lallana was on the mark after a lengthy spell of possession to score his first league goal for over two years.\nKlopp's side even threatened to snatch victory, but substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's shot flashed inches wide.\nKlopp was furious about the decision to award Rashford's goal but he must also accept that this was a below-par Liverpool performance and in the end they and their fans, who taunted their United counterparts with inflatable Champions League trophies and the number \"6\", were grateful for a draw that means they still have a healthy advantage at the Premier League summit.\nUnited show character and fight\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be bitterly disappointed they could not hang on for five more minutes for what would have been a hugely satisfying landmark win.\nHe will, however, be delighted with the fight, spirit and organisation shown by his side, especially as the five-man defensive system United had been working on this week was disrupted minutes before kick-off when Axel Tuanzebe was injured in the warm-up and replaced by Marcos Rojo.\nThey subdued Liverpool until they switched off carelessly late on when Rojo went missing and Ashley Young failed to spot the danger from Lallana in behind him.\nOverall, however, this was a huge improvement simply in terms of resilience and character.\nGoalscorer Rashford worked tirelessly while Scott McTominay continues to mature in midfield, and the Stretford End showed their appreciation at the final whistle.\nThis is a mediocre Manchester United side but there was no shortage of effort and they deserved a point that Solskjaer will hope provides a platform for a rise up the table.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford\n'A step in the right direction' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"It's important to get results. That's the only way to grow confidence. A win would have been great but a draw is a step in the right direction.\n\"As a manager you want results now - you can't lose four, five or six games on the bounce. We're looking to win games as soon as possible.\"\nOn the lack of a free-kick to Liverpool in the build-up to Rashford's goal: \"It's maybe a slight touch but it's not a clear and obvious error. It's still a man's game with tackles allowed, and the second one [Sadio Mane's disallowed goal] was a handball. Today we were on the right end of the VAR decisions.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"The result is OK. It's not what we wanted but we have to be happy given how the game developed. The first half I didn't like because we gave United the chance to do what they want to do - to put us under pressure and be aggressive. They were not better than we were but they did what they wanted to do.\n\"They scored a goal which shows all the problems with VAR. Mr Atkinson let the game run I'm sure because there is VAR. For me it was a clear foul. It's a general problem. VAR looks and says 'you decided like this'. But it was a foul. Then we scored a goal that was disallowed. Pretty much everything went against us but we still didn't lose so that is OK.\n\"We were in charge 100% towards the end. We wanted a different result but to do that you have to play better.\"\nMatch stats - Klopp's struggles against Solskjaer\nLiverpool failed to win for the first time in 18 Premier League games, since a goalless draw with Everton in March.\nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than Manchester United (8, level with Aston Villa).\nUnited registered their second lowest possession figure (32.1%) in a Premier League home match since 2003-04, second only to 32.06% against Liverpool in March 2018.\nFive of the past seven Premier League meetings between United and Liverpool have ended level (one win each) - just four of the previous 36 between the sides had been drawn.\nEnglish players scored for both Manchester United and Liverpool in a Premier League meeting for the first time since November 2001 (David Beckham and Michael Owen).\nSince the start of last season, Liverpool have scored 28 Premier League goals in the final 15 minutes of games, more than any other side.\nMan Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the only manager Jurgen Klopp has faced more than once in the Premier League and failed to beat (P2 D2).\n35% of Marcus Rashford's 31 Premier League goals for Manchester United have come against 'big six' opponents (11/31).\nLiverpool's Adam Lallana netted his first goal in 29 Premier League appearances, since scoring against Middlesbrough in May 2017.\nSince the start of 2017-18, Liverpool's Andrew Robertson has registered 19 assists in the Premier League, more than any other defender.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool visit Genk in the Champions League on Wednesday, with United at Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday.\nNext Sunday in the Premier League, Liverpool host Tottenham with United at Norwich City."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 1-0 Arsenal: Lys Mousset's first-half goal stuns Gunners\nSheffield United claimed a stunning win over Arsenal to move into the top half of the Premier League.\nLys Mousset marked his first start for the Blades with the decisive goal in the first half, turning in Jack O'Connell's knockdown from close range.\nArsenal's \u00a372m signing Nicolas Pepe had earlier skewed a golden chance wide from six yards.\nGranit Xhaka forced Dean Henderson into an excellent save but the Blades closed the game out superbly for a famous win.\nThe victory was Sheffield United's biggest result since their return to the Premier League as they moved up to ninth, four points clear of the relegation zone.\nDefeat for Arsenal, meanwhile, means they missed the chance to move back into the top four. They are fifth, two points behind Chelsea in fourth.\nSheffield show their steel once again\nSheffield United have certainly shown plenty of grit on their return to the Premier League and have been particularly impressive in not rolling over to sides in the top six.\nThey battled from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Chelsea in August before pushing Liverpool close at the end of last month, only to be undone by a single goal from a mistake by Henderson.\nAgainst Arsenal they again took the game to their opponents from the outset. David McGoldrick's technical ability combined with Mousset's pace posed a troubling front line for the Arsenal defence.\nChris Wilder had challenged his new-look forward line to give the Blades the cutting edge they have lacked this season and Mousset did just that, making the most of being unmarked inside the box to sweep home.\nFrom then on, it was all about the Sheffield United defence. The hosts, incredibly, have not lost a league game when leading at half-time since 2014 and they managed the remainder of the game superbly, with their back three of O'Connell, Chris Basham and John Egan forming a formidable barrier.\n\"I have so much respect for Sheffield United's back three,\" BBC Radio 5 live summariser Chris Sutton said. \"They have come up through the leagues together, they are well oiled and well drilled.\n\"It is the best defence in the Premier League this season, along with Liverpool.\"\nTravel sickness strikes again for Arsenal\nThe Gunners went into the international break in a good place in the Premier League.\nThey sat third after beating Bournemouth 1-0 at the Emirates, extending their home record so far this season to four wins and one draw.\nBut away from home Arsenal remain unconvincing.\nTheir only win on the road in the Premier League came in their season-opener when they beat Newcastle 1-0 but since then they have scraped draws against Watford and Manchester United and lost to Liverpool and now Sheffield United.\nArsenal have won just four of their last 17 games away from home - a statistic Gunners boss Unai Emery will need to improve quickly if they are to challenge for the top four.\nPepe fails to produce the goods\nIvory Coast winger Pepe arrived at Arsenal in the summer with a big reputation and a big price tag.\nThe \u00a372m club-record signing had scored 35 goals in 74 appearances for Lille, but he has been underwhelming so far for the Gunners.\nThe 24-year-old had scored one goal - a penalty - in nine appearances prior to Monday's game and should have really got his second for Arsenal but managed to miss a chance that looked considerably easier to score.\nBut despite that error he was arguably the best player in an admittedly under-performing Arsenal team in the first half, and it is easy to forget that it was he who started the move in his own box that led to the chance he missed.\nHowever, Arsenal fans will understandably be expecting him to perform on a more consistent basis to justify his huge price tag.\nMan of the match - John Fleck (Sheffield United)\n'There was a very clear penalty' - what they said\nArsenal boss Unai Emery: \"We deserved more. I think the first half the very clear chances were for us. Then we conceded more corners than we wanted and they scored one from a corner. There was a very clear penalty and I think VAR is for that.\n\"The second half the defence was more deep and had good control of the match. There was less space in the second half but we still had three or four chances. We deserved more but they are a very strong defensive team.\n\"We created 12 corners for us and we conceded seven or eight. They score one goal from one corner.\n\"We prepare for the matches the same home and away and think to win.\"\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder: \"We have deserved to win a tight game. We knew they would have some chances and have a lot of the ball.\n\"I thought we got the balance tonight. We had to put in a big performance and get a big result. The players know what is expected of them. We have to play, we have played to get into this division and we have to play to keep in the division.\n\"It is Arsenal, no disrespect it is not a League One team but we have managed to win a tight game at home.\"\nOn goalscorer Lys Mousset: \"Brilliant for him. He is a really popular boy. He took a bit of time to get up to speed but he had something for us that was a little bit different.\"\nBramall Lane blues for Arsenal - the stats\nArsenal have played more Premier League games at Bramall Lane without victory than they have any other ground in the competition (4 - D2 L2).\nArsenal have lost four of their last seven Premier League away games against newly-promoted sides (W3), as many defeats as in their previous 49 matches (W33 D12 L4).\nThree of the 10 bookings for diving in the Premier League this season have been awarded by Mike Dean (30%), with no other referee issuing more than one this campaign. He gave out two cards for diving on Monday night.\nSince the start of last season, Arsenal have been shown more cards for diving than any other Premier League team (7).\n13 of Jack O'Connell's last 14 goal involvements in the league for Sheffield United have come at Bramall Lane, including each of his last eight (3 goals, 5 assists).\nSheffield United's Dean Henderson has kept 25 clean sheets in the league since the start of last season; more than any other goalkeeper in England's top four tiers.\nSheffield United's Lys Mousset has scored two goals in six Premier League appearances this season (1 start, 5 sub apps), one more than he registered in 24 games for Bournemouth in 2018-19 (1 start, 23 sub apps).\nWhat next?\nSheffield United travel to West Ham on Saturday, 26 October (15:00 BST) while Arsenal host Portuguese side Vitoria SC in the Europa League on Thursday, 24 October (20:0 BST)."

His trademark blistering pace then took him clear of the Southampton defence to win and convert a late penalty.\nHis exploits were also complemented by Perez, who opened his account for the season after finding the bottom-right corner following a neat one-two with Tielemans.\nThe Spaniard then superbly swept home Chilwell's pinpoint cross for his second before finding the bottom corner with a left-footed shot to complete his treble.\nFootball Daily podcast: It's raining goals... for Leicester\nReaction to Leicester's record-equalling victory at Southampton\nWhat does this mean for sorry Southampton?\nAt the start of the evening Southampton's focus was purely on ending a barren run of seven games without a home win dating back to April.\nBut by half-time manager Ralph Hasenhuttl had changed tack considerably, by simply trying to avoid any further embarrassment.\nThe Austrian, who at times appeared exasperated and spent much of the interval sitting in his technical area, introduced Kevin Danso and Jack Stephens to replace Jannik Vestergaard and Danny Ings, but it was too little to late.\nWith the crowd visibly thinning in the second period, Hasenhuttl must now hope the scale of this defeat has not eroded the confidence of his players too much.\nWhile the Saints are a couple of points better off than at the same time last term, they appear in danger of being dragged into another relegation fight.\nAnd their road to redemption is unlikely to be an easy one with their next two fixtures away at Manchester City in both the Carabao Cup and Premier League.\nMan of the Match - Ayoze Perez\n'We were ruthless' - what they said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Match of the Day:\n\"I'm very pleased to see our work rate, we scored some great goals and we were very hungry tonight. It was horrible weather but our focus was outstanding. I'm very pleased how we defended, and we were ruthless. I'm very proud to stand and be the manager of that team.\n\"We wanted to get the ball back quickly and attack again. A mark of the good sides is you don't let up. We wanted to show we're a good side and we certainly did that in the second half.\n\"We were ruthlessly simple in our game. When you're so many goals up you can easily slow but we kept focused. We want to be a top team and to be a top team you must be clinical.\n\"It was a very good team performance and we're pleased to keep a clean sheet. It's good for our goals for but the clean sheet is equally important.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Match of the Day:\n\"That was one of the tough ones tonight. The performance was a disaster today and I have to apologies and take 100% responsibility - I've never seen a team act like this, there was no fight for anything.\n\"It was horrible to watch and everyone who stayed to watch is really a fan of this football club. Leicester were in every part of the game better than us I'm a proud man but the way we play today is not the way I want to see my team play. We must get our heads up and that is my job in the next few days.\n\"I said we must play to the last minute but I can understand why the fans that left. We all must to do everything to pull this back. I haven't looked at the [Ryan Bertrand] red card but it doesn't make any difference in this moment.\"\nOn what was said after the game: \"There is nothing I want to speak of here in front of the camera - we keep that for in the dressing room.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before returning to the Etihad in the Premier League on Saturday, 2 November (15:00 GMT).\nLeicester travel to Burton in the EFL Cup also on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before going to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday, 3 November (14:00 GMT)."

He showed us the way we wanted to play, and it was much better.\"\nLiverpool can restore their six-point advantage if they beat Tottenham on Sunday - although after dropping points last weekend, the Reds go into that game knowing they now have the defending champions breathing down their neck.\nAs Guardiola acknowledged, it did not always look like turning out that way for City, who had to work hard to break down a well-organised Villa side.\nThe visitors had largely frustrated City in the first half but their resistance lasted for only 20 seconds after the restart.\nAfter Villa squandered possession from their own kick-off, Ederson's long punt forward was flicked on by Gabriel Jesus and into the path of Sterling, who made no mistake.\nJesus should have made it 2-0 soon afterwards when a mistake by Bjorn Engels left him clean through, but a combination of a Tom Heaton save and a brilliant goal-line clearance by Tyrone Mings denied him.\nCity had to wait until the 65th minute for their second goal, which confusingly was eventually awarded to David Silva, after a long delay for a VAR decision that had concluded it was Kevin de Bruyne's goal.\nIt was unclear at first glance whether Silva or Sterling, who would have been offside from a Silva touch, had got a deflection on De Bruyne's wicked curling cross but after a four-minute delay that was met with derision by both sets of fans, it was ruled it had gone straight in and was allowed to stand.\nHowever, some time after the final whistle, the goal accreditation panel - an independent entity which has no affiliation with VAR - awarded the goal to Silva, who had wheeled away in celebration.\nNonetheless, Ilkay Gundogan made absolutely sure of the points a few moments later, when Fernandinho's shot was cleared into his path, and he expertly adjusted his body to put away a fine first-time finish.\nThe hosts finished the game with 10 men after Fernandinho was shown a second yellow card.\nFollow the rest of Saturday's Premier League action here\nVilla work hard but Grealish fails to shine\nVilla came to a sodden Etihad Stadium after taking seven points from their previous three games, and with the message from their manager Dean Smith that City were \"not superhuman\" and they had nothing to fear.\nThey did more than just keep City quiet in a tight opening period, with John McGinn bringing a fine fingertip stop from Ederson - the Scot also went close to a consolation before the end when he hit the post after the City keeper had denied Douglas Luiz.\nThe only slight disappointment from Villa's point of view was that they did not see more of Jack Grealish with the ball at his feet in the City half, the midfielder's role here involving rather more defensive duties.\nThere were still some neat passes and a couple of trademark flashes of his quick feet that saw the away fans break into chants of 'Super Jack', but he did not create a single chance or do much to back up his claims this week that he wants a senior England call-up.\nGuardiola has more defensive issues\nFernandinho's late dismissal gives Guardiola another problem in the centre of his defence, with the Brazilian set to miss next week's game against Southampton while he serves his suspension.\nThe 34-year-old has been the only real fixture in City's defence in recent weeks and, although he will be back for the crucial trip to play Liverpool at Anfield on 10 November, his absence means Guardiola will be forced into another reshuffle in the meantime.\nWith Aymeric Laporte out until the new year and the versatile Rodri recently sidelined for up to a month, it was a boost for City that John Stones was fit enough to face Villa for his first start since 14 September, although his mistake to gift McGinn possession for his early chance was hardly a reassuring sight.\nGuardiola also has Nicolas Otamendi available, with the Argentine left on the bench on Saturday, but he and Stones have not played together since City's capitulation against Norwich at Carrow Road.\nWhatever combination the City manager goes for next, it seems his search for a consistent line-up at the back will go on for a few more weeks.\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling (Manchester City)\n'It was a special second half' - what they said\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I am disappointed with the manner of the goals we conceded. We came with a gameplan and I thought we showed some good enterprise going forward.\n\"We started quite well in the second half, and City's first goal is just a lump from the goalkeeper. Tyrone Mings should do better and he knows that then but a top player like Raheem Sterling puts it on the back of the net.\n\"But I would question City's second goal: I think Raheem Sterling is offside and he impedes the goalkeeper from making the save.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"Aston Villa played very well in the first half and we played not so good. They are newly promoted and played with real spirit, attacking the channels well.\n\"But the second half, I don't know if we played good because we scored early or it was because we played differently, but we won. It was a special second half, we were another level.\"\nCity continue their run against the Villans - the stats\nManchester City have won their past 10 Premier League home games against Aston Villa by an aggregate score of 33-4. It's their joint-longest winning run at home versus a single opponent in Premier League history (also currently 10 v Newcastle).\nPep Guardiola has lost just one of his 20 Premier League matches against newly promoted teams as City manager (W15 D4 L1).\nVilla have lost 14 of their past 15 away games against City in the Premier League (W1), with nine different managers suffering a loss while in charge in this run.\nVilla are winless in their past 14 Premier League games against reigning champions, drawing three and losing the past 11 in the run.\nRaheem Sterling has scored in 43 Premier League games for City without ever finishing on the losing side (W41 D2 L0) - he's scored in more games for a single club without ever losing than any other player in the competition's history.\nFernandinho made his 200th Premier League appearance - the third Brazilian to reach this milestone after Chelsea's Willian (206) and former Liverpool player Lucas Leiva (247).\nFernandinho has been sent off at Etihad Stadium more times (three) than any other player in the Premier League since it opened in 2003.\nWhat next?\nCity continue their defence of the Carabao Cup with a fourth-round tie at home to Southampton on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) and host the same opposition four days later in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nVilla are at home to Wolves in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) and then take on Liverpool at Villa Park in the league on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Watford 0-0 Bournemouth: Hornets' winless start goes on\nWatford are \"getting closer\" to their first victory in the Premier League this season, says manager Quique Sanchez Flores, despite their winless start stretching to 10 games with a goalless draw against Bournemouth.\nThe Hornets, who stay bottom of the table, should have taken the lead after 60 seconds but Abdoulaye Doucoure blazed over from 12 yards.\nGerard Deulofeu hit the post and had a shot well saved at the start of the second half by Aaron Ramsdale but Bournemouth also struck the woodwork twice.\nSteve Cook directed a header onto the crossbar in the first half and Harry Wilson grazed the post with a free-kick late on, while Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster brilliantly blocked Arnaut Danjuma's close-range shot in the 45th minute.\nThe draw is Watford's third in a row but they remain without a league win since April.\n\"We had our chances, we did not concede goals and we had a good team spirit and this is really good for the future,\" Flores said.\n\"I think the first win is getting closer, the difference with the other teams (at the bottom) is not so big and I'm really confident for the future.\"\nThe goalless draw is Bournemouth's second in a row and means they have failed to score in their last three games.\nWatford v Bournemouth as it happened\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nToothless Watford still waiting for win\nThe point is another to Watford's total as they try to climb the early season table but the performance once again showed they have big problems in front of goal, especially with captain Troy Deeney out injured.\nDeeney watched on as his side drew a blank for the sixth time in the league this season with the Hornets failing to add to the five goals they have scored this campaign - the joint lowest total alongside Newcastle.\nDoucoure and Deulofeu missed Watford's two big chances at the beginning of each half and frustration grew inside Vicarage Road as the home side failed to make the most of promising counter-attacking positions.\nThe only positive for Watford was the clean sheet which came thanks to Foster's good saves and a slice of luck with the two Bournemouth efforts which hit the woodwork.\nThe Cherries did not create many clear opportunities and since conceding eight goals at Manchester City last month, Watford have only let in three goals in four league games.\nAfterwards Flores praised his side's defending but admitted his players are \"nervous\" in front of goal.\n\"Defending well is a good base, but I feel when we are in the opposition's box that the players are still a little bit nervous and they can sometimes take bad decisions,\" he said.\nCherries struggling for goals too\nBournemouth dominated possession - having 60% of the ball in the match - and probably created the better chances but they have now failed to score in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2017.\nDanjuma, making his first Premier League start, should have scored in the first half when he met Joshua King's cross unmarked but could not put his effort out of Foster's reach.\nStriker Callum Wilson was not given any service - touching the ball fewer times than any other Bournemouth starter (17) and failing to have a shot - and his team-mates were equally ineffectual.\nRyan Fraser had a chance late in stoppage time but he was denied from a tight angle by Foster while, in the first half, full-back Diego Rico smashed a half-volley from the edge of the area on target but watched it be expertly parried away.\nThe point takes the Cherries to eighth but they are without a win in five games in all competitions.\n\"I am frustrated on one hand, but on the other hand we could have also lost the game,\" manager Eddie Howe said.\n\"Keeping a clean sheet away from home is positive, but having our third game without scoring is certainly a negative.\n\"We don't normally struggle to score but today at least we did not struggle to create chances.\"\nMan of the match - Ben Foster (Watford)\nWatford's unwanted record - the best stats\nWatford have become the first team to fail to win any of their opening 10 games in a Premier League season on two occasions, with the Hornets also doing so in 2006-07.\nBournemouth have failed to score in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2017, while this is the first time they've had back-to-back goalless draws in the competition.\nWatford are winless in nine home league games - only in December 2004 (10) have they ever had a longer run without a win at Vicarage Road in league competition.\nWatford have failed to score in a league-high six Premier League games this season.\nThere were eight yellow cards between Watford and Bournemouth today, no other Premier League match has seen more so far this season.\nWatford's Gerard Deulofeu (2 attempts, 1 on target today) has had more shots (24) and more shots on target (10) without scoring than any other player in the Premier League this season.\nWhat's next?\nWatford play Everton in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night (kick-off at 19:45 GMT) while their next league game is against Chelsea at Vicarage Road on Saturday (kick-off at 15:00 GMT).\nBournemouth host Manchester United on Saturday in their next game (12:30 GMT kick-off)."

        "article_text": "West Ham v Sheffield United: The Premier League grudge match with 13 years of baggage\n\"Carlos Tevez! It was bound to be him!\"\nWhen the Argentine striker scored the winner for West Ham against Manchester United at Old Trafford on the last day of the 2006-07 Premier League season, it saved the Hammers as Sheffield United went down.\nBut Tevez's controversial role in that season's narrative went way beyond his seven goals in 10 games - and means Saturday's West Ham v Sheffield United fixture has been billed as an unlikely grudge match with 13 years of baggage.\nOn transfer deadline day in August 2006, the mid-table London club sprung a huge surprise by signing two of the world's most sought-after young players - Argentine duo Tevez and Javier Mascherano.\nThe move would enrage rival clubs, who claimed foul play\n, external\nover third-party ownership as the Hammers staged a 'great escape' and the Blades went down.\n'A huge sliding doors moment'\n\"The sense of grievance at the time was so deep,\" says Alan Biggs, a reporter who has covered Sheffield United for more than 40 years.\nThe Blades insisted they were victims of a relegation rival gaining an unfair advantage by breaching the rules that barred third parties - agents, typically, or a company or investors - from holding a stake in the financial rights to a player.\nYet 180 miles to the south, there was corresponding bitterness over the reaction of the relegated club, who imploded on the field and then pursued compensation off it.\n\"A lot of West Ham fans are still annoyed with what is perceived as a hypocritical stance taken by Sheffield United,\" explains Graeme Howlett, editor of the Hammers fanzine Knees Up Mother Brown, referencing the investigation\n, external\ninto Steve Kabba's move to Watford from the Blades.\n\"It was still in their hands - they could have got enough points. It was a bit like Brexit in a way - they wanted to keep going until they got the result they wanted.\"\nMascherano barely featured for the Hammers all season, while Tevez only turned match-winner towards the very end.\nBut West Ham, bottom of the table and 11 points adrift of Sheffield United with nine matches to go, won seven of them, including an unlikely 1-0 victory at champions Manchester United on the final day.\nSheffield United, needing only a draw at home to relegation rivals Wigan, lost and were relegated. They subsequently slid into League One before their recent resurgence, while the Hammers, in contrast, have only spent one season since outside the top flight.\n\"There was a real enmity and hostility that extended from the boardroom. It was a huge sliding doors moment. It took Sheffield United 12 years to get back,\" says Biggs.\nWest Ham eventually paid \u00a320m in compensation, having initially being fined \u00a35.5m rather than being docked points.\nAn arbitration panel said the club had not only deliberately breached the rules but committed a grave breach of trust and been responsible for \"dishonesty and deceit\".\nWho were the main players?\nCarlos Tevez: The striker did not score for six months after signing then got seven in 10 games. Voted Hammer of the Year by fans. Left for Manchester United and later switched to Manchester City.\nJavier Mascherano: A defensive midfielder, he was largely kept out of side by Hayden Mullins. Loaned to Liverpool in the January window and played in their Champions League final defeat.\nKia Joorabchian: Iran-born businessman and agent, educated in London. Boyhood Arsenal fan, once reported to be interested in a potential West Ham takeover. Engineered the duo's move from Brazilian club Corinthians and was linked with companies that owned their contracts.\nAlan Pardew: Led the Hammers to the brink of an FA Cup final win against Liverpool before a penalty shootout defeat in May 2006. Dismissed in December 2006.\nAlan Curbishley: Replaced Pardew for the remainder of the 2006-07 campaign, but left West Ham three games into the 2008-09 season.\nNeil Warnock: Disgruntled Sheffield-born Blades boss, who blamed the Tevez affair for relegation and losing his job. Current Cardiff City boss.\nKevin McCabe: Sheffield United chairman fought for compensation before reaching an out-of-court settlement, which he believes actually saved the West Ham from going bust. Recently lost control of the club in a power struggle with Saudi's Prince Abdullah.\nEggert Magnusson: Icelandic biscuit baron who took over West Ham from chairman Terry Brown. \"I think Pardew is a great manager,\" he said on arrival in November 2006. Sacked him three weeks later and stayed a year before selling up amid financial crisis.\nThe deal that shocked football\nTevez and Mascherano, both 22 and reportedly targets of Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United after starring in the 2006 World Cup, only knew about the deal two days before it took place.\nThe pair, and manager Alan Pardew, looked slightly nonplussed at a hastily arranged news conference heralding their arrival.\n\"They were like rabbits in the headlights. Neither of them spoke much English, and it was quite clear Pardew hadn't known a great deal about it all,\" recalls Howlett.\n\"I guess there was always a feeling of disbelief at how they had managed to pull off the signings and whether it was entirely above board.\"\nWest Ham were found guilty in April 2007 of acting improperly and withholding vital documentation, but Tevez was allowed to continue playing and his part in the Hammers' survival rankled with the Blades.\n\"I remember writing a piece that [Sheffield United] were hopeful of being reinstated, and also that Neil Warnock was considering suing West Ham. It was such a drawn-out affair,\" remembers Biggs.\nHowlett says initial excitement at the double-transfer was tempered as Hammers fans realised Tevez did not look totally fit.\n\"Who knows? If we had played Marlon Harewood instead, we might not have been in that relegation position in the first place,\" he says. \"But it was just ridiculous what happened at the end of that season. It will never be repeated.\"\nSo what can we expect at the weekend?\nThe teams have only met once since, in a League Cup tie five years ago, which away side Sheffield United won on penalties.\n\"There's likely to be some lingering animosity between the two sets of supporters,\" says Howlett. \"We were seen by other fans as a club that had cheated.\n\"I'm sure there will be chants of 'one Carlos Tevez' and fans wearing Tevez face masks, but probably no more than that.\"\nAsked whether Saturday's game might have extra spice, Blades manager and Sheffield United fan Chris Wilder said: \"I think it does but there's a lot of water gone under the bridge since and it's a long time ago.\"\n\"The relationship between the two clubs had been friendly, and I'm sure it will be again,\" adds Biggs."

Can we ever agree? Pundits split on latest VAR controversy\nBrighton v Everton as it happened\nWhat happened in the English top flight on Saturday?\nRe-live all the Premier League action\nDespairing Toffees stunned by late comeback\nDefeat will pile more pressure on the shoulders of Everton boss Marco Silva, who becomes the first manager to lose three Premier League games against Brighton.\nThe Toffees had ended a run of four straight defeats with victory over West Ham last weekend but if the future had looked brighter for Silva's men, that was soon dampened down in dismal conditions on the south coast.\nSilva made one change for the trip to Brighton, with Mason Holgate coming in for the injured Yerry Mina for his first Premier League start in 13 months.\nLittle could separate the two sides in the early stages, but when Gross gave the hosts the lead, Everton responded in perfect fashion, Richarlison's header towards goal deflecting in off Webster.\nThat goal injected life into the Toffees - despite being forced into an early substitution when Bernard was injured off the ball - with Theo Walcott a constant thorn in Brighton's side.\nAlex Iwobi went close to giving them the lead either side of the break, and after surviving a disallowed goal, Everton eventually took the lead in the 74th minute when Calvert-Lewin tucked the ball home with a composed finish.\nBut they were left stunned when Brighton were awarded a penalty after Keane appeared to step on Connolly's ankle, a challenge that went unnoticed by referee Andy Madley, who quickly found himself surrounded by Everton players when VAR gave the spot-kick.\nTen minutes of end-to-end action followed as both sides desperately searched for a winner, before six minutes of stoppage time was added, ending in despair for Silva's team as Digne slid the ball past his own goalkeeper.\nEverton remain without a win at Brighton for 36 years.\nBrighton's fortunes change\nThree weeks have passed since Brighton stunned Tottenham but they were brought back down to earth with a bump last weekend with an injury-time defeat by Aston Villa. Seven days later, the tables turned.\nGraham Potter's men struggled to settle in the opening exchanges of the match and it took 12 minutes for Amex Stadium to see its first shot of the day from either side.\nBut the hosts had the ball in the back of the net soon after, Gross firing a set-piece into the top corner for Brighton's first goal from a direct free-kick in the Premier League.\nThey managed to contain their visitors for the remainder of the first half after Everton's equaliser, and Steven Alzate - in for the suspended Aaron Mooy - went close to scoring early in the second, fizzing a shot over Jordan Pickford's bar after good play on the wing.\nJust after the hour mark, Gross thought he had doubled his tally for the afternoon when he touched in a Davy Propper cross, but his strike was ruled out for offside, and it looked as though his side were going to be made to pay when Calvert-Lewin nudged Everton ahead.\nBut Maupay's easy finish from the spot brought new life into the game as tempers started to fray, with Trossard unlucky not to flick in from close range when a Lewis Dunk free-kick was unexpectedly punched into his path by Pickford.\nYet the Amex erupted when Brighton stole the win at the death, their first 90th-minute winning goal in their short Premier League history.\nMan of the match - Steven Alzate (Brighton)\n'My heart needs a rest' - what they said\nEverton boss Marco Silva, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"If VAR saw something in our box, why didn't it see 15 minutes earlier the penalty for Richarlison.\n\"Because of that my players are in the dressing room and don't understand.\n\"If they see one for one side then they have to see for the other side too. It was a clear penalty [to us]. VAR has to be the same for both sides.\"\nOn his side's late defeat: \"We have to be more mature to control the last 10 minutes. It's a tough moment for us. We have to stick together.\n\"We conceded the first goal but after that we reacted strongly and as a team. We created some dangerous moments.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter, also to Match of the Day: \"My heart needs a bit of a rest after that!\n\"To turn it around like we did is an amazing feeling. It was an important moment to get the equaliser and there was a feeling in stadium for us to push on and get the win.\n\"I haven't seen replays of the penalty. We have had a few that have not gone our way recently. We have earned a bit of luck. We didn't play our best and it was a tough match. We had to dig deep.\"\nThe stats\nEverton have failed to win any of the 24 Premier League games in which they've fallen behind under Marco Silva (W0 D4 L20).\nThe home side has never lost a Premier League meeting between Brighton and Everton (W4 D1), with Brighton winning twice and drawing once at the Amex.\nLucas Digne's own goal was Brighton's first-ever 90th-minute winning goal in the Premier League.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has scored five goals in his last five appearances in all competitions for Everton, as many as he had netted in his previous 39.\nEverton netted their first set-piece goal of the 2019-20 Premier League campaign (via Webster's own goal) and their first since May 2019 vs Spurs (Tosun via a corner).\nNeal Maupay netted his fourth goal in 10 Premier League games for Brighton, twice as many as any other Seagulls player this season.\nPascal Gross scored Brighton's first-ever direct free-kick in the Premier League and their first in league competition since Sebastien Pocognoli netted vs QPR in the Championship in April 2017.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton welcome Norwich to the south coast on Saturday, 2 November, (15:00 GMT).\nEverton host Watford in the EFL Cup fourth round on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before Tottenham travel to Goodison Park on Sunday (16:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 2-4 Chelsea: Christian Pulisic scores first Blues hat-trick in win at Turf Moor\nChristian Pulisic scored a hat-trick to announce his arrival in English football in sensational style as Chelsea beat Burnley for a seventh consecutive win in all competitions.\nThe 21-year-old American winger scored a 'perfect' hat-trick with a left foot, right foot and headed effort.\nHe was the difference in an even first half, first of all winning the ball on the halfway line before running all the way and slotting home.\nHis second was also a break from midfield after Willian won possession.\nBurnley were in the game until that stage but Chelsea ran away with it in the second half.\nPulisic headed in from Mason Mount's cross for his first career treble, before Willian blasted home a fourth moments later.\nJay Rodriguez's long-range strike and Dwight McNeil's deflected effort brought huge roars from the Turf Moor faithful but they had left their comeback far too late.\nChelsea beat Burnley - as it happened\nQuiz: Name the nationalities of Chelsea's Premier League scorers\nPulisic's breakthrough game\nPulisic, who has already been dubbed Captain America in some parts, has had a slow start to life in England as he adjusted from the switch from Borussia Dortmund.\nThis was his first Premier League start since August, but there can be little doubt he is ready now.\nIt was not just his goals which were impressive. He caused so many problems for Burnley with surging runs down both flanks and through the centre, as well as some testing crosses.\nBut what will clearly be remembered are his three goals.\nHis first was all his own work as he won it from Matthew Lowton before skipping past James Tarkowski and slotting home.\nThen Willian stole the ball off a Burnley defender before finding Pulisic, who did the rest - albeit with the help of a deflection.\nAfter the break, he popped up with an unlikely header to become only the second American to score a hat-trick in the Premier League.\nWillian's fierce drive into the bottom corner was merely a footnote on this game.\nChelsea's fans chanted \"we want 10\" but the only other Chelsea action of note was a penalty awarded to Callum Hudson-Odoi which was overturned by the VAR, and which subsequently earned the substitute a yellow card for diving.\nBurnley's 'big six' struggles continue\nThe omens were never good for Sean Dyche's hosts. They have now only won one of their last 26 Premier League games against 'big six' opposition, while their last home win against Chelsea was in 1983.\nA win would have taken them above Arsenal into fifth spot and for 45 minutes that looked plausible.\nAshley Barnes, back from an injury, missed three good first-half chances for the Clarets, with Kepa making a good stop from Erik Pieters' deflected strike.\nThe game was basically over after Pulisic's moments of magic but fans will wonder what could have been had Rodriguez and McNeil's goals - both assisted by 84th-minute substitute Robbie Brady - arrived 10 minutes sooner.\n'It was beautiful to watch' - what they said\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard, speaking to Sky Sports: \"This is a really tough place to go and the way we controlled the game, our midfield combinations and movement, was beautiful to watch. I really enjoyed watching them today.\"\nOn his handling of Christian Pulisic: \"He had a week's break this summer. He arrived for a big price and wanted to come straight back in but at the same time why am I going to throw him in? So I have to do it in the right way and get the best out of him. I'm delighted for him.\"\nOn making just one change from midweek: \"It's a balance, I always think one, two or three games ahead. But there's an argument that we are doing okay, they are hungry, and I felt one change was enough today. It's important we keep our feet on the ground. We played well but we can play better.\"\nOn conceding two late goals: \"I will be the first to criticise sloppy goals, and they were. But not tonight because of the way they played, their movement on the ball, there were so many great things to admire. I'm not letting that in the dressing room tonight, we came to a really tough place and won comfortably.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Chelsea are a good side and they are in top form, credit to them but the second goal was our own doing.\n\"It was similar to the game we played against Liverpool and the second goal was a killer.\n\"Our mentality continues to grow and we are creating a better standard of chances against these top sides and there's a growing belief in what we can do, but we can't commit those mistakes.\"\nOn Callum Hudson-Odoi being booked for diving: \"I can't stand diving, it is ridiculous, that has to get out of the game.\n\"Everyone is talking to me about respecting the referees, but players need to respect the game as well.\"\nMan of the match - Christian Pulisic (Chelsea)\nThe stats\nChelsea have won their last six away games in all competitions - only once in their history have they won more consecutively on the road (seven between February-April 1989).\nThis was the fifth time Burnley have conceded 4+ goals in a Premier League home game, with Chelsea doing so on two of the last three occasions.\nChelsea have won four consecutive top-flight away games while scoring at least three goals each time for the first time in their history.\nChelsea have scored 16 goals in their five away league games this season - only Norwich (17 in 1993-94) and Manchester City (20 in 2011-12) have scored more in their first five on the road in a Premier League season.\nOnly Watford (34) have conceded more Premier League away goals in 2019 than Chelsea (30).\nChristian Pulisic became the first player from the USA to score for Chelsea in the Premier League, meaning the Blues have now had players from 36 different nations score for them in the competition (excluding own goals).\nChelsea's Christian Pulisic became just the second American player to score a Premier League hat-trick, after Clint Dempsey in January 2012.\nChristian Pulisic became Chelsea's youngest hat-trick scorer in Premier League history (21y 38d), while he also became the first player to net a 'perfect' league hat-trick for the Blues since Didier Drogba against Wigan in May 2010.\nWillian has scored three goals in his last six appearances for Chelsea in all competitions, as many as he had in his previous 30 for the Blues.\nBurnley's Dwight McNeil became the first teenager to score a Premier League goal against Chelsea since Marcus Rashford in April 2017.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Sheffield United on Saturday (15:00 GMT) while Chelsea, after hosting Manchester United in the EFL Cup fourth round on Wednesday (20:05 GMT), visit Watford on Saturday (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Newcastle 1-1 Wolves: Jonny earns a point for Wolves after Lascelles opener\nA close-range finish from Jonny ensured Wolves fought back to earn a battling point against Newcastle at St James' Park.\nSpaniard Jonny volleyed home from six yards after goalkeeper Martin Dubravka had fumbled Matt Doherty's cross into his path to cap a much-improved second-half display from Nuno Espirito Santo's side.\nMagpies captain Jamaal Lascelles scored the opener with a powerful near-post header from Federico Fernandez's cross to light up what had been a largely dour first half.\nNewcastle ended the game with 10 men when midfielder Sean Longstaff was sent off late on for a high challenge on Ruben Neves.\nDoherty very nearly secured all three points for Wolves in stoppage time, but his header across goal from Raul Jimenez's cross flashed just wide.\nFollow the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nResilient Wolves maintain upward momentum\nThree successive defeats in September raised doubts about Wolves' ability to balance the demands of domestic and European football, as well as build on their impressive campaign last year.\nBut this result makes it eight games unbeaten in all competitions, suggesting they are more than adept at coping with the extra matches in their fixture list.\nIf anything, they have shown an extra resilience, with 13 of their last 14 Premier League goals scored in the second half of matches, including Jonny's leveller at St James' Park.\nWolves boss Nuno once again freshened up his side, making five changes to the team that came from behind to win against Slovan Bratislava in the Europa League Thursday.\nOne of those changes was enforced, with defender Willy Boly suffering a fractured ankle in training on Saturday.\nA formation change at half-time proved the spark for that victory in Slovakia and Nuno very nearly repeated the trick here.\nThe Portuguese switched from 3-5-2 to 3-4-3 at the break, with Adama Traore pushed forward into the front line behind Doherty, who was replaced in the back three by Leander Dendoncker.\nIt proved to be the catalyst for a vastly improved second-half performance, with the duo creating a chance for Diogo Jota within minutes of the restart.\nJota then created an opportunity himself when his mazy run and shot was only fumbled by Dubravka before the ball was scrambled clear.\nMoments later, Wolves were level when Doherty's cross was fumbled by Dubravka straight into the path of Jonny, who volleyed home from close range for just his second goal in a Wolves shirt.\nThat goal galvanised the visitors and they pinned Newcastle back in the closing stages of the game.\nThe Midlands club may be frustrated they did not come away with more than just a deserved point.\nAfter stoppage-time goals in games against Burnley and Crystal Palace earlier this season, Wolves very nearly grabbed a third when Doherty went close.\nNewcastle let down by lack of firepower\nNo Premier League ground had seen fewer goals than the four St James' Park had witnessed going into this weekend, with just two of those for the Magpies, highlighting the challenge Steve Bruce faces.\nHe possesses a robust backline, with Lascelles, Fernandez DeAndre Yedlin and Ciaran Clark impressing here. But the former Aston Villa boss now needs to work out how to sharpen his attack without losing any of that defensive solidity.\nClub-record signing Joelinton, who has scored just once this season, rarely threatened. Though he often found himself isolated as the Magpies defence dropped ever deeper as the game wore on.\nThey did manage nine shots on goal during the first period, their most in the opening half of a Premier League game since April.\nBut goalkeeper Rui Patricio was rarely troubled by any of them apart from a Miguel Almiron shot into the side netting from Matty Longstaff's early ball over the top.\nWith their forward line miss-firing Newcastle need to rely on goals from elsewhere, and so it proved for the opening goal.\nArgentine defender Fernandez, making his first Premier League start of the season, stayed forward after a set-piece and put in a dangerous cross from the right that was powered home at the near post by Lascelles for his first goal since January 2018.\nBruce will be pleased with the way his side clung on for a point, particularly after Sean Longstaff was deservedly dismissed after catching Neves' knee with a studs-up challenge with 10 minutes left, but they could have easily lost this game during a frantic finale.\nBruce has to somehow get his strikers scoring on a regular basis if Newcastle are to lift themselves away from near the bottom of the table.\nMan of the match - Adama Traore (Wolves)\n'They were feeding off scraps' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I was delighted the way we played in the first half and needed more of it in the second but for some reason we didn't play in the second half. We needed to gain composure and a foothold in the game but we gave the ball away so many times and sat back too much.\n\"We forgot to take part in the second half. \"We said we wanted to win the second half as well. Second half it was that horrible cliche of a game of two halves - if ever there was one.\"\nOn Sean Longstaff's red card: \"I thought he was unlucky. I think he has played the ball and he isn't in control of his foot but where is his foot supposed to go? When players roll around like that afterwards I'm always a bit dubious.\"\nOn his side's scoring problems: \"We've invested in strikers, in the second half they were feeding off scraps. We need to do better to give the players at the top end of the pitch chances.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo, also to BBC Match of the Day: \"We performed better in the second half. Newcastle were organised and we had problems but in the second half we were better and created so much. We combined well and I'm happy - the challenge is to do it in both halves.\"\nOn his side's busy schedule: \"We are embracing the challenge. We have played 20 games, that is a lot of effort. There are no days off and so a lot of credit goes to the boys.\"\nOn losing Willy Boly this week through injury: \"He's a big player and a big man and we will miss him, but it is something that can happen. He was doing a box in training and fell - it is sad that has happened.\"\nWolves continue scoring run - the stats\nNewcastle haven't scored more than once in any of their last 10 Premier League games (six goals), their longest such run since April 2015 under John Carver (10 games).\nWolves have scored in each of their last nine Premier League games, their joint-longest scoring run in the competition.\nSean Longstaff is the 53rd different Newcastle player to pick up a red card in the Premier League, with only Everton (57) seeing more individual players sent off in the competition.\nSteve Bruce has seen one of his players shown a red card on 53 occasions in the Premier League, with only Arsene Wenger having had more sent off in the competition (78).\nWolves have conceded four headed goals in the Premier League this season, the joint-most along with Norwich.\nEach of Newcastle captain Jamaal Lascelles' six Premier League goals have been headers; only Dean Richards, Craig Short and Curtis Davies (all 7/7) have scored more goals in the competition with 100% of them coming via their head.\nLascelles' opener for Newcastle was his first Premier League goal in 634 days (Jan 2018 v Burnley), with Federico Fernandez assisting his first goal in the competition in 407 days (Sep 2018 v Arsenal).\nWolves wing-back Jonny scored his first away goal in top-flight football (Premier League and La Liga) in his 112th such game on the road.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to London Stadium to play West Ham on Saturday, 2 November (15:00 GMT).\nWolves are away at Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday (19:45), before taking on Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool's 'improved mentality' helped beat Spurs, says Jordan Henderson\nLiverpool captain Jordan Henderson said an \"improved mentality\" under Jurgen Klopp helped them come from behind to beat Tottenham and restore their six-point Premier League lead.\nHarry Kane scored within 48 seconds of kick-off and keeper Paulo Gazzaniga pulled off a number of impressive saves to give Spurs a 1-0 lead at half-time.\nHenderson equalised six minutes after the break before Mo Salah thumped the winner from the penalty spot.\n\"Our mentality has improved. That's grown over the last few years and the gaffer has changed that so much,\" Henderson told Sky Sports.\nLiverpool have dropped just two points in the Premier League this season and are unbeaten at home in 45 league games.\n\"We have faced adversity at times. It's not always going to go your own way,\" Henderson added. \"After 48 seconds I was thinking it was my fault because I gave the ball away for their goal. Thankfully I managed to get a goal to make up for it.\"\nReaction to Liverpool's victory\nHere's how you rated the players\nLiverpool were made to work for the victory, needing several big chances to score before Henderson eventually slotted his half-volley into the far corner early in the second half.\nThat came moments after Son Heung-min had smacked the crossbar for the second time in the match - his first effort was nodded in by Kane from seven yards out for the opener.\nBut Liverpool's pressure eventually took its toll when Serge Aurier caught the back of Sadio Mane's leg and gave away a penalty, which Salah smashed past a stationary Gazzaniga with 15 minutes left.\nSalah was substituted in the 85th minute with a recurrence of the ankle injury which kept him out last week's draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford, but manager Klopp said \"it's not a massive issue\".\nGazzaniga heroics not enough\nLiverpool finished the first half a goal down despite having had 10 shots on target and 76% of possession.\nThat was largely down to Gazzaniga's excellent display for Spurs - the keeper making 12 saves.\nHis first big save came after 20 minutes when Salah's half-volley was hit straight at him before the Egyptian struck another shot which he palmed away.\nGazzaniga got back to his feet to block the rebound from Roberto Firmino and then tipped Virgil van Dijk's header over the crossbar - all in the first 30 minutes.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold joined in on the action, again being denied by Gazzaniga, before Mane missed the biggest chance of the half - skewing a header wide from just a few yards.\nBut the Spurs keeper, filling in for the injured Hugo Lloris, could do nothing about Henderson's equaliser or Salah's penalty which flew past his outstretched left leg.\nWhat it means for the title race\nIt's a huge victory for Liverpool, having dropped their first points of the season at Old Trafford against rivals Manchester United last weekend.\nThey went into this game having not lost at home in the Premier League since April 2017 and with only one defeat in their last 48 Premier League matches.\nSecond-placed Manchester City had cut their lead at the top of the table to three points following their 3-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday.\nThe two teams go head-to-head next month at Anfield, when Liverpool will hope to make it 46 matches undefeated at home.\nAs for Spurs, they drop out of the top 10 with just three wins in their opening 10 games and sit 16 points behind the league leaders.\nNo Spurs revenge for European heartache\nWhile Salah needed two minutes to score Liverpool's opener in last season's Champions League final, Kane did it in half the time at Anfield.\nThe Tottenham striker was first to react when Son's strike deflected off Dejan Lovren's head on to the crossbar.\nKane became only the third opposition player to score inside 60 seconds in a Premier League game at Anfield and his goal silenced the crowd, who sang 'we are the champions of Europe' at kick-off and held banners reminding their opponents of June's result in Madrid.\nBut Spurs were second best for the majority of the game, though Son presented a threat on the counter-attack and could have made it 2-0 when he rounded Lovren and Alisson, only to smash his effort against the crossbar again.\nTottenham are winless in their last nine away games against Liverpool in the league and have not won at Anfield since May 2011.\nMan of the match - Paulo Gazzaniga (Tottenham)\n'It was impossible!'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC Match of the Day: \"I really liked the way we played against really tough opponents. It was a wonderful game of football, it's how you wish games should be. The boys delivered. We had chance after chance and the keeper had sensational save after sensational save.\n\"At half-time I said this game had only one problem - the scoreline. When Tottenham had the ball their counter-attacks were incredible. We won the game and deserved it.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino to BBC Match of the Day: \"We tried in the last 10 or 15 minutes and had chances but it was impossible! I've got no complaints about the penalty. You can have your own opinion. It was a fair reaction.\"\nOn Gazzaniga's performance: \"He made some good saves but for sure he is so frustrated and disappointed because we lost.\"\nBeating the top six - the best of the stats\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League games when conceding the first goal at Anfield (W7, D3), winning each of the last six.\nTottenham are without a win in their last 11 Premier League away games (D2 L9), and last endured a longer run between May 2000-January 2001 under George Graham (14 games).\nThere have been 23 penalties in Premier League fixtures between Liverpool and Tottenham, two more than any other fixture in the competition.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their last 20 Premier League games against 'big six' opponents at Anfield since a 1-0 defeat by Man Utd in January 2016 (W12, D8), winning their last six in a row.\nGazzaniga made 12 saves in the Anfield defeat, the most by a goalkeeper in the Premier League since David de Gea versus Arsenal in December 2017 (14).\nHenderson scored his first Premier League goal at Anfield since he netted against West Brom back in December 2015, 1414 days ago.\nSerge Aurier has conceded four penalties in 48 games in all competitions since his Tottenham debut in September 2017; no Premier League player has given away more.\nKane's first-minute opener for Spurs was his 150th goal involvement in the Premier League in his 191st appearance in the competition (131 goals, 19 assists).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool welcome Arsenal to Anfield on Wednesday in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup (19:30 GMT) and are back in Premier League action on Saturday, 2 November at Aston Villa (15:00).\nTottenham are away at Everton in the Premier League on Sunday, 3 November (16:30)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-2 Crystal Palace: Gunners surrender two-goal advantage as Granit Xhaka booed off\nArsenal captain Granit Xhaka was involved in an angry confrontation with his own supporters as Crystal Palace came from two goals down to earn a point in an ill-tempered atmosphere at Emirates Stadium.\nThe Gunners were two up inside nine minutes as Sokratis Papastathopoulos and David Luiz took advantage of poor defending at corners - but it was all downhill from there for Arsenal and manager Unai Emery.\nPalace pulled one back before half-time when Luka Milivojevic scored from the spot following a VAR intervention after referee Martin Atkinson had initially shown Wilfried Zaha a yellow card for diving in a tangle with Calum Chambers.\nAnd Palace were level seven minutes after the break when Jordan Ayew headed in James McArthur's cross at the far post.\nThe game turned toxic just after the hour when Xhaka was substituted to roars of delight from Arsenal's fans, the newly-appointed captain reacting angrily to jeers at his slow departure by waving and cupping his ear sarcastically to the home support, exchanging words before taking off his shirt and disappearing down the tunnel.\nArsenal's frustration and misery was complete when another VAR intervention infuriated Emirates Stadium and denied the Gunners victory after Sokratis scored from close-range late on.\nAs the players returned to the centre circle, referee Atkinson was involved in more debate with Stockley Park, where an apparent foul by Chambers on Milivojevic was detected, causing widespread anger inside an arena that was already boiling over.\n'No evidence Emery a Wenger upgrade amid poisonous atmosphere'\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League fixtures\nXhaka lays bare Emirates frustration\nXhaka was a contentious choice as new Arsenal captain - and his behaviour here did nothing to suggest it is a role that suits him.\nHis own performances raise questions about his suitability but his petulant, goading reaction to his 61st-minute substitution by youngster Bukayo Saka only played into the hands of those who believe he does not have the character for the role.\nOf course, it will have hurt a proud professional to hear the mixture of delight and sarcasm that greeted his number coming up, but his response was provocative and met with loud condemnation from Arsenal's fans.\nArsenal had conceded a two-goal lead so there was a sense of urgency that was not reflected in his slow stroll towards the technical area, anger growing with every laboured stride.\nHe then waved his arms towards Arsenal's fans before foolishly cupping his ear and going through the most cursory of gestures with Emery, also appearing to exchange words with supporters. Xhaka then took off his shirt and went straight down the tunnel.\nIt summed up the discontent lurking close to the surface at Arsenal, with further evidence provided by the loud chants for exiled German star Mesut Ozil as they fought in vain for the winner.\nArsenal are in fifth but a gap is now opening up - four points to Chelsea in fourth - and this was another display that exposed their fragility and soft centre as that early advantage was cast aside.\nThis was another unsatisfactory 90 minutes for Emery and Arsenal.\nPalace show grit once more\nThis draw continues Palace's fine start to the season as they enjoy a top-six place after this battling point.\nManager Roy Hodgson will be mortified at conceding those two early goals from corners but will also be delighted at the way Palace dug deep and showed great reserves of resilience to fight back.\nIt was inevitable Zaha would be a central figure after Arsenal's summer pursuit of the player fell flat and he reluctantly stayed at Selhurst Park when a move to Everton failed to materialise.\nAnd so it proved in the incident that changed the game just after the half hour as he was initially cautioned for diving before VAR correctly ruled he had been dragged down by Chambers.\nThis was all the encouragement Palace needed, playing on Arsenal's nerves and plundering the equaliser through Ayew.\nHodgson himself accepts Palace are unlikely to stay in this lofty position but there is certainly enough experience and threat in this side to ensure they will not have any serious concerns at the wrong end of the Premier League table.\nMan of the match - Luka Milivojevic (Crystal Palace)\nZaha and Milivojevic combine for penalties - the stats\nArsenal had won 49 consecutive Premier League games after going two goals ahead but they have now dropped points in the last two games where they have led by two.\nSince returning to the top flight in 2013-14, Crystal Palace have won (48) and scored (39) more penalties than any other side in the Premier League.\nJust 106 seconds separated Arsenal's first two goals.\nAlexandre Lacazette has been directly involved in 29 Premier League goals for Arsenal at the Emirates - a tally bettered only by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (30) since the Frenchman's debut in August 2017.\nSince his Premier League debut in February 2017, Crystal Palace midfielder Luka Milivojevic has scored 21 penalties - more than twice as many as anyone else in that time.\nSince returning to Palace in 2014-15, Wilfried Zaha has won a joint-high 16 penalties in the Premier League.\nEagles striker Jordan Ayew has scored four goals in his last eight Premier League games, which is as many as he managed in his previous 34.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to Anfield to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday (19:30 GMT), before hosting Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nCrystal Palace host Leicester City in the league on Sunday (14:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Man Utd beat Norwich 3-1 to end bad away run in Premier League\nManchester United won a Premier League away game for the first time since February and would have beaten Norwich by more if not for two Tim Krul penalty saves.\nUnited's two first-half goals came moments after outstanding Krul stops.\nScott McTominay slammed home the opener seconds after a stunning reaction save from the Canaries keeper to deny Anthony Martial from close range.\nThe video assistant referee (VAR) then controversially awarded United a penalty for a Ben Godfrey foul on Daniel James - with Krul stopping Marcus Rashford's kick.\nBut Rashford scored with United's next attack as he was left in acres of space by the Norwich defence.\nUnited - who move up to seventh in the Premier League - were awarded a second penalty by VAR for a Todd Cantwell handball. This time Martial took it and went the other way, and again Krul guessed correctly.\nThe Canaries, who remain in the relegation zone, had a couple of chances but United wrapped the game up when Martial clipped the ball over Krul after a good passing move with Rashford.\nNorwich scored a late consolation through substitute Onel Hernandez, who took the ball off McTominay before running at United's defence and shooting past David de Gea to becoming the first Cuban-born player to score a Premier League goal.\nSolskjaer 'hurt' by Man Utd results\nPogba not expected back until December\nSunday's Premier League games as they happened\nMore disagreement on VAR use in the Premier League on Saturday\nKrul and VAR catch the eye\nIn the first nine rounds of Premier League games this season no penalties were awarded by VAR with a seemingly high bar set for the \"clear and obvious error\" needed to overturn a referee's decision.\nThere have been four this weekend, including two at Carrow Road.\nThe first was highly controversial with Godfrey and James appearing to run into each other and referee Stuart Attwell changing his decision after consulting with the video team.\nKrul appeared well off his line when he saved Martial's kick - but VAR in the Premier League does not check for goalkeepers' positions from penalties.\nThe second penalty was not contentious with the new handball laws with Cantwell's arms clearly high in the air as he blocked Fred's shot.\nMartial became the third United player to fail from the spot in the league this season when Krul denied him.\nHe is the first goalkeeper to save two penalties in a Premier League game since fellow Dutchman Maarten Stekelenburg for Everton against Manchester City in October 2016.\nEven United manager Solskjaer thought the first penalty should not have been given.\n\"I disagree with the first one, the second one is but both should be retaken, the goalkeeper is a yard off his line,\" he said.\n\"VAR is there to help but when it takes ages like the first penalty, it is not a clear and obvious error. When it took that long, it is a signal that it should not have been.\"\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke agreed, and thought United's James fouled Godfrey for the first penalty.\n\"It's quite obvious it was a big mistake,\" he told BBC Sport. \"The referee was right and it was Daniel James falling on the defender. I don't blame VAR for this defeat, we were not major enough in the first half.\"\nKrul was brilliant throughout the game, making eight saves - including a remarkable stop to keep out Martial's header from point-blank range.\nHe suffered a late knee injury, although played on with Norwich having used all their subs.\n\"We'll have to assess it tomorrow,\" he said after the game. \"I was worried when it happened but I feel a bit better now.\"\nUnited continue improvement\nThis is a third decent result in a row for Manchester United as they climb away from the lower reaches of the league.\nA draw against leaders Liverpool last Sunday was followed by a first away win since Paris St-Germain in March, when they beat Partizan Belgrade 1-0 on Thursday.\nA Norwich team short on confidence was an ideal opponent to end their worst away run in the league since 1989.\nMcTominay, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Martial and Rashford were all excellent - despite the latter two's penalty misses.\nWith their first chance, Andreas Pereira curled a shot just wide and then Martial thought his header was in from Rashford's flick-on - before Krul's brilliant save.\nThey led when Scotland midfielder McTominay curled home after Cantwell failed to clear Pereira's cross - United's 2,000th goal in the Premier League era.\nOnly Rashford has scored more league goals for United than McTominay's four since Solskjaer was named permanent manager in March.\nRashford and Martial's penalty misses mean United have failed to score with four of their last six Premier League spot-kicks.\nBut that did not dishearten them with Rashford running onto James' defence-splitting pass to stroke home a shot past Krul.\nTheir third was excellent. Rashford played a one-two with Martial - on his first league start since August - and then backheeled the ball back into the Frenchman's path for his deft finish over Krul.\nIt is far too early to read too much into one good week for United, but things are looking a lot more encouraging than they were in the preceding five-game winless run.\n\"This had been a good week for us,\" said Solskjaer. \"It started with a decent performance against Liverpool and now two wins away from home. It gives the players confidence and momentum.\n\"The third was a very good goal and a class finish. It is great for Anthony Martial to score a goal like that. We could and should have had a few more goals.\"\nLong season ahead for Norwich\nNorwich have now gone five games without a win in the league - and are two points below 17th-placed Newcastle.\nThey must be credited for trying to attack teams - right-back Max Aarons in particular was excellent going forward.\nThey will not struggle to create chances this season - Aarons set up good opportunities for Cantwell and Teemu Pukki, who both missed the target. Pukki has now gone five Premier League games without a goal, after six in his first five.\nHernandez's late strike after a McTominay error was their 11th Premier League goal of the season - more than sixth-placed Crystal Palace or Sheffield United in eighth.\nBut their defence was shambolic at times, especially when Rashford was completely free from James' pass over the top.\nThey have conceded 24 goals in 10 league games. Only Southampton - with 25 - have let in more, including the nine they conceded against Leicester. And it would have been worse if not for Krul.\nCanaries boss Farke hopes things will be better when some of their injured centre-backs - Christoph Zimmermann, Timm Klose and Grant Hanley - return.\n\"In general it is difficult when three centre-halves are not available,\" he said.\n\"It's important to improve. We look forward to having our centre-backs back but we have to take this as a lesson.\n\"You need physicality and robustness, and we missed that in the first half.\"\nMan of the match - Scott McTominay\nRashford and Martial make history - match stats\nNorwich have lost more Premier League home games against Manchester United than they have against any other team, losing seven of nine (P9 W2 D0 L7).\nManchester United scored as many goals in this game as in their previous six Premier League away games combined.\nManchester United are the first team to score 2,000 Premier League goals.\nMarcus Rashford's goal was his 50th for United, with 32 coming in the Premier League\nRashford and Anthony Martial are the first team-mates to score a goal and miss a penalty each in a Premier League game.\nNorwich's Tim Krul became the eighth different goalkeeper in Premier League history to save two penalties in a game.\nManchester United have had three different players miss a penalty within a single Premier League season (Rashford, Martial and Paul Pogba) for only the second time, and for the first time since 2012-13 (Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Javier Hernandez).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United visit Chelsea in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday, 30 October (20:05 GMT), followed by a Premier League trip to Bournemouth on Saturday (12:30).\nNorwich, already out of the cup, go to Brighton on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-0 Manchester United: Joshua King's goal gives Cherries first win since September\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said it was a \"step back for us\" as his side's three-match winning run ended at Bournemouth.\nUnited made a positive start after going four unbeaten but their new-found belief seemed to evaporate in driving rain and swirling wind on the south coast.\nFormer United trainee Joshua King struck on the stroke of half-time to claim Bournemouth's first goal in nearly six hours and give the Cherries their first win since September.\nUnited came into the game in seventh place but now have a haul of 13 points from 11 games - their lowest at this stage of a league campaign since 1986-87 (11).\n\"If you want to get into the top four you need to win games like this,\" said Solskjaer. \"It is a step back for us today, but we need to shake it off and go again.\"\nKing, who scored the winner in Bournemouth's only previous Premier League win against the Red Devils in 2015, was allowed to chest down Adam Smith's cross into the box before turning Aaron Wan-Bissaka and volleying between David de Gea's legs from close range.\nThe Cherries carried that momentum into the second half and Harry Wilson twice went close to doubling their lead, before late substitute Mason Greenwood hit the post moments after coming on for United.\nBut the visitors could not prevent Bournemouth securing their first win in six, which sent them back above the Red Devils to sixth before the rest of Saturday's games.\nMartial not the answer to all United's problems\nHaving gone unbeaten since the international break, holding league leaders Liverpool before claiming three straight wins for the first time this season, United fans hoped the club had turned a corner.\nManager Solskjaer felt confidence was building and Anthony Martial's return to the side for last week's win at Norwich looked to have revived the United attack. After all, the Red Devils had won 65% of their games with Martial starting under Solskjaer, compared to 41% without.\nAfter winning at Chelsea in the Carabao Cup, Solskjaer reverted to last Sunday's starting line-up, but his side failed to show the same fluency, particularly Martial and strike partner Marcus Rashford.\nInstead their biggest threat was Daniel James, who created two early chances from the right. Andreas Pereira blazed over while fellow Brazil midfielder Fred scuffed a shot wide.\nJames then won a free-kick which led to the Wales winger firing narrowly wide from 20 yards, and as United struggled to maintain that early dominance, King pounced.\nThe 27-year-old striker was left unmarked before Wan-Bissaka committed himself, allowing the Norway international to control the ball on his chest, flick it over his head and hammer past De Gea.\nThe Spanish keeper kept United in it with a string of saves after the break, before Solskjaer made a double substitution, bringing on Greenwood and Brandon Williams with 10 minutes left.\nGreenwood volleyed Fred's cross against the woodwork at the back post before Scott McTominay and Fred tested home keeper Aaron Ramsdale from outside the box, but those chances came more through desperation than design.\nCherries end goal drought\nWhile Bournemouth conceded just one goal in three games in October they also failed to score, but manager Eddie Howe backed his attacking players in Friday's news conference and made only one change to the side which drew 0-0 at Watford.\nHarry Wilson came in and the Liverpool loanee had the Cherries' first shot, which was deflected wide, before a Bournemouth break saw Ryan Fraser shoot straight at De Gea.\nYet the Cherries seldom managed to get behind the visitors' defence until Harry Wilson and Fraser combined to find Smith in the right side of United's box. The full-back lifted the ball towards King, who showed great composure to convert his fourth goal of the season.\nAfter the break Bournemouth looked more like the side which went third in the table after a 3-1 win at Southampton on 20 September.\nFraser steered a volley straight at De Gea, who had to rush out to deny King and Harry Wilson in quick succession.\nDe Gea then had to produce a fine low save to keep out Harry Wilson's left-footed strike before ever-present keeper Ramsdale made two late saves to ensure the Cherries kept a third straight clean sheet.\n'We fully deserved to win' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"Today we were much more like ourselves with the ball and also very determined without the ball.\n\"We managed to keep three clean sheets in a row so I am really pleased with that and the attacking play was back today so I think we fully deserved to win.\n\"These results could be season defining. In our previous Premier League campaigns we have beaten top teams and we know what these results can do for our confidence in the longer term.\"\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"You are always very down when you lose and considering the form we were in we were hoping to take the three points.\n\"We could not capitalise on the good start and a moment of magic won the game for them, sometimes you just hold up your hands and say 'well done'.\n\"I thought Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial defended very well against them, but in games like this one it is so important to get the first goal and they [Bournemouth] did it.\n\"We are disappointed but when you come to places like this you have to take control of the game. We did not and we could not get the goal. We were missing some quality at times. Maybe I should have started some others.\"\nKing second only to Solskjaer - the stats\nManchester United have lost all six Premier League away games in which they've fallen behind under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nUnited have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their last 11 Premier League away games.\nBournemouth ended a seven-match winless run against United in the Premier League (D1 L6), picking up their first win against the Red Devils since December 2015.\nSix of Bournemouth's eight Premier League victories against 'big six' opposition have come at Vitality Stadium.\nJoshua King netted the 45th Premier League goal of his career - the second-highest total by a Norwegian player in the competition's history after United manager Solskjaer (91).\nSince the start of last season no player has been shown more yellow cards than Bournemouth's Jefferson Lerma (17).\nBournemouth's four wins this season have come from the five games in which they've had the least amount of possession (42.5% v United).\nMan of the match - Steve Cook (Bournemouth)\nWhat's next?\nManchester United have a Europa League group game at home to Partizan Belgrade on Thursday (20:00 GMT) before hosting Brighton in the Premier League next Sunday (14:00), while Bournemouth visit Newcastle next Saturday (15:00)."

The result is not good.\n\"I feel every time my responsibility to work and come back with better results.\"\nThe afternoon had started brightly for the Gunners, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - standing in for the dropped Granit Xhaka as captain - opening the scoring to register his 50th goal for the club.\nHowever, that was a rare blip for Wolves who repeatedly carved the hosts open and on another day may have claimed all three points.\nAnd Nuno Espirito Santo's side got their reward when Raul Jimenez headed Joao Moutinho's hooked cross past Bernd Leno into the bottom right corner.\nIt ensured Wolves, who are up to 11th, stretched their unbeaten run to six games, while Arsenal remain in fifth.\nFollow all the Premier League action\nFamiliar failings haunt Arsenal\nArsenal have already surrendered leads against Watford and Crystal Palace this season, and this result did little to allay concerns over the team's perceived fragility in defence.\nFormer boss Arsene Wenger came in for criticism over this towards the end of his 22-year tenure at the club and there is a feeling that Emery has been unable to address those failings as he nears 18 months in charge.\nWhile they were in total control against Watford and Palace before capitulating, that was not the case against Wolves who took the game to the hosts from the off.\nThe visitors had already fashioned at least half a dozen good opportunities before Arsenal opened the scoring against the run of play.\nAubameyang - who Emery later suggested could replace Xhaka has the club's captain - expertly finished from Alexandre Lacazette's pass to score his ninth goal in 13 games.\nBut the Gabon forward largely forced to feed off scraps with Arsenal managing just 10 shots compared to the visitors' 25, their was a sense of inevitability about Jimenez's equaliser.\nHowever, only Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola currently enjoys a higher win ratio in the Premier League than Emery.\nAnd the Spaniard's 59% currently places him ahead of Jurgen Klopp (58%), Mauricio Pochettino (55%) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (50%).\nWolves the comeback Kings\nAfter a slow start to the season Wolves have now collected 10 points from the last 18 available on an unbeaten run that has seen them climb from 19th.\nThis performance which mirrored their showing in the 1-1 draw the Emirates last season was brimming with pace, energy and swift counter-attacking football which at times overwhelmed the hosts.\nRoared on by 3,000 supporters draped in gold and black, Jimenez, Dioga Jota, Matt Doherty and Ruben Neves all featured prominently, particularly during the first period.\nWith the visitors sweeping forward at every opportunity, they conceded the softest of goals as the absence of their regular defenders - Willy Boly and Ryan Bennett - was felt when deputising midfielder Leander Dendoncker failed to spot Aubameyang's run.\nBut that did little to jolt or unnerve them as they continued in the same vein and pushed Arsenal back.\n\"We finished on the front foot and every time we broke the feeling was we could harm more,\" said Nuno.\n\"I am happy because we worked hard and showed character. This is the process we want. We want to go to every stadium and play with our identity.\"\nDoherty saw his right-foot shot superbly saved by Leno, with the Arsenal keeper also forced into action by Neves and Mexico forward Jimenez.\nWolves, who have scored 86% of their goals in the second half this season, underlined their status as comeback specialists when Jimenez got his reward with one of his eight efforts on goal.\nNuno's team have now recovered to draw 1-1 on six occasions this season.\nMan of the Match - Raul Jimenez (Wolves)\nShot-shy Arsenal - the stats\nArsenal have dropped points having scored the first goal in consecutive home league games for the first time since November 2004 (Southampton and West Brom).\nWolves have gone unbeaten in three league games against Arsenal (W1 D2) for the first time since a run of three wins between October 1978 and September 1979\nWolves have scored in 10 consecutive Premier League games for the first time.\nArsenal failed to have a single shot on target in the second half of this match, with their last effort coming in the 32nd minute.\nSince Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's debut in February 2018, he and Alexandre Lacazette have combined for nine Premier League goals for Arsenal - the most of any pair at the club in this period.\nWolves' Raul Jimenez has scored 11 goals in all competitions this season - only Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero (13 each) have scored more amongst Premier League players.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to Vitoria Guimaraes in the Europa League on Wednesday, 6 November (15:50 GMT) before their next Premier league outing at Leicester on Saturday, 9 November (17:30).\nWolves host Slovan Bratislava in the Europa League on Thursday, 7 November (20:00) and resume their Premier League duties when they welcome Aston Villa to Molineux on Sunday, 10 November (14:00)."

That would be nice.\"\nRelive how Newcastle ended their scoring woes at West Ham\nCatch up on all of Saturday's Premier League action\nNewcastle front three offer signs of hope for Bruce\nNewcastle's problems have been laid bare over the first three months of the season, with supporters given little to cheer about by a toothless attack that had not scored more than once in any of their opening 10 Premier League games.\nThat all changed in an almost-perfect away day for the Toon Army.\nBruce's side were organised defensively and rarely threatened until the Hammers' late fightback, while clinically punishing their opponents at the other end.\nEven though the opening two goals came from set-pieces, Newcastle constantly caused panic in the home defence through their pacy counter-attacking and should have enjoyed a greater margin of victory at London Stadium.\nFrench youngster Allan Saint-Maximin was a particular nuisance throughout, causing veteran Hammers full-back Pablo Zabaleta all sorts of problems with his speed and trickery.\nSaint-Maximin, 22, started to stretch the home defence and twice could have extended the lead when he sprinted through on goal only to be denied by Hammers keeper Roberto on both occasions.\nBrazilian striker Joelinton has been criticised for a lack of goals since his \u00a340m move from German club Hoffenheim but teed up Clark's opener with an unselfish header back across goal from Shelvey's free-kick and worked hard throughout.\nParaguayan winger Miguel Almiron was also lively for the visitors, only to be again let down by his end product and spurning a chance late on to score a fourth and ease the pressure.\n\"They are all young lads at the top of the pitch and they need time to settle in and bed in,\" Bruce said.\n\"We've paid a lot of money for them and those price tags bear on them. It's a glimpse of what we can do and I was delighted with some of our forward play.\"\nWest Ham need a 'reality check' after poor display\nWhile the celebrating away end remained packed immediately after the final whistle, hordes of West Ham fans had already long left London Stadium in disappointment.\nAfter a promising start to the season the Hammers have slid down the table after five league matches without a win and are now only a point clear of Newcastle in 13th place.\nManuel Pellegrini's side appear to have still not recovered from the scars of that humiliating League Cup defeat by League One side Oxford United which has proved to be the catalyst for this dismal run.\nThe Hammers lacked ideas in the final third of the pitch, unable to create any clear-cut chances from open play in a first half dominated by Newcastle.\nThe home fans began to show their frustration, notably after keeper Roberto should have stopped Shelvey's free-kick from creeping in, and had already left in their droves before Balbuena and Snodgrass sparked a fightback which had looked unlikely over the previous 70 minutes.\nUltimately it came far too late and produced a final scoreline which did not truly reflect Newcastle's superiority.\n\"It's a bad result and it is a performance that isn't West Ham like,\" Hammers scorer Snodgrass told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We need a reality check and need to know we need to start getting points on the board.\n\"We need to be solid and resolute, we could have been four or five down. We can't give teams a three goals start.\"\nMan of the match - Allan Saint-Maximin (Newcastle)\nFrance Under-21 international Saint-Maximin was a nuisance throughout for West Ham but was unable to cap his display with a goal, despite having a game-high three shots on target.\n\"He should have scored but you can see he is a handful and will get people off his backsides,\" Magpies boss Steve Bruce said.\n\"He's that little bit of different. He is exciting and quick and if he can learn to be more clinical we will have a player on our hands.\"\n'I don't understand why we played so bad' - post-match reaction\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It is really difficult to explain why we played the way we did in the first 45 minutes.\n\"The last two games we played at home we started by pressing from the beginning, playing in the opposite half.\n\"I do not understand why we played so, so bad.\"\nWhy Newcastle enjoy their trips to London - the stats\nWest Ham are now without a win in five Premier League games, their longest winless streak in the competition since a run of eight ending in December 2017\nNewcastle have scored more than once in a Premier League game for the first time this season, becoming the last side in the top flight to hit two or more goals in a match in the competition this season\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini suffered his first defeat in his ninth Premier League meeting with Newcastle\nNewcastle have tasted victory on three of their last four Premier League visits to London, as many wins as they managed in their previous 24 trips to the capital in the division\nNewcastle have scored two headed goals in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time since December 2006 against Tottenham\nFive of Newcastle's Premier League goals this season have come via defenders this season, more than any other side\nJonjo Shelvey netted his first direct free-kick goal in the Premier League with his 31st attempt\nRobert Snodgrass has scored in consecutive Premier League games after going 21 such appearances without a goal going back to December 2018\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham look to halt their slide when they go to Burnley on Saturday, 9 November at 15:00 GMT, while Newcastle hope to take this form to St James' Park when they host Bournemouth at the same time."

It was not easy, but that is why we did it and could make the comeback in the end.\"\nWith Liverpool simultaneously staging a similar last-gasp rescue act to overcome Aston Villa, it was a dramatic day at the top of the table that leaves the top two as they were, a week before they meet at Anfield.\nThe overriding emotion on the final whistle at the Etihad Stadium was still relief at City's triumph, with the focus from the champions on securing three points rather than any potential Liverpool slip-up.\nSaints came within minutes of leaving Manchester with a remarkable point, just eight days after shipping nine goals at home to Leicester, before Walker's volley gave the hosts a vital victory.\nSouthampton had taken an unlikely early lead when Ward-Prowse pounced on an Ederson error and they held out until Aguero hammered home Walker's cross with 20 minutes to go.\nCity's struggle to turn their possession into clear chances was testament to Southampton's incredible defensive display.\nThe visitors' resistance was only ended when Angelino's cross was not cleared and Walker buried the loose ball for his first City goal since January.\nAs it happened: Manchester City 2-1 Southampton\nLive reaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nSaints give defensive masterclass\nMost of Southampton's players were down on their haunches to show their dejection at the final whistle, as they were at the end of their previous league game -humiliation at the hands of the Foxes.\nBut this performance from Ralph Hasenhuttl's side was nothing like their meek surrender at St Mary's, with Saints putting on an impressive defensive show of determination and organisation that almost brought them some reward.\nJust as they did in their defeat here in the Carabao Cup four days ago, Saints stayed deep and defended in numbers - but this time they also had a meaningful threat on the break through Nathan Redmond and Danny Ings.\nThey scored with their first real attack, when Emerson failed to collect Stuart Armstrong's skidding shot and Ward-Prowse was first to react to the loose ball.\nFrom then on it was a defensive masterclass, with Saints staying narrow and packing their penalty area, sending City wide to deliver countless crosses - Aguero's equaliser came from their 46th delivery in open play.\nIt was only City's relentless pressure that wore them down, but it was exactly the kind of performance Hasenhuttl had asked for in the past few days.\nCity find a way through in the end\nWalker's winner sent City boss Pep Guardiola jumping for joy, after he had spent most of the second half dashing up and down his touchline to quickly retrieve Southampton's clearances from the crowd, and urge his side forward.\nDespite dominating possession, City found it difficult to create chances for most of the game - and not just because of the commitment of Southampton's players and their willingness to throw themselves into the path of every shot or cross from the home side.\nWhen City did manage to clear a shot at goal, they were wasteful - with John Stones heading over from Ilkay Gundogan cross in the first half and Aguero doing the same from a Bernardo Silva ball soon after the break.\nBy then, Gabriel Jesus had joined him in the City attack, but the Brazilian's arrival initially did not make much difference in what had become a frustrating afternoon for the home side.\nBut on a day where Southampton's players had shown their character and resolve in defence, City did the same in front of goal to finally force their way through.\nLiverpool's eventual win over Villa means City will have to wait at least another week to close the gap at the top, but this was still a vital victory for Guardiola's side, no matter how they got it.\nMan of the match - Kyle Walker (Manchester City)\n'We created an incredible amount of chances' - what they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to Sky Sports: \"We played incredible from the first minute until the end. We created an incredible amount of chances. We were pressured but we did it. We kept our cool and we were patient. We know we will always get chances, it was important that we stayed calm ahead.\n\"I told them at half-time to keep going for it, to keep attacking. It is the only way. There was no space, it was almost impossible but we did it and that is why I am delighted.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"To come here twice after losing 9-0 is not the easiest moment for a team but I think it was a chance to show up today, and we did, and it was really a pity that we didn't get something for the amazing work we did today.\n\"We had to show a reaction, we know that Tuesday was the first step and we knew we had to do it better than on Tuesday because the City team today was their first team, their A team, with all their best-performing players.\n\"And our squad today was unbelievably committed, and unbelievable defending, following the game-plan and investing so much in defending our net.\n\"It was very difficult today for City to create chances - I don't think they had a lot, only at the end was it open because we wanted the equaliser but until then I think they haven't seen a lot of chances.\n\"They had a lot of possession, yes sure, that is normal against this team but I think this was the only way how we could play against such an opponent. We did it in a fantastic way.\"\nSaints' struggles v the big six continue - the stats\nManchester City have won each of their last six Premier League meetings with Southampton, extending their longest-ever winning run against Saints in league competition.\nCity had to wait until the 70th minute for their first shot on target in this match, which resulted in Sergio Aguero scoring - it's the longest they've had to wait for their first shot on target in a league match since December 2016 against Leicester (82nd minute).\nSouthampton are winless in their last 20 away Premier League games against 'big six' teams (D4 L16), since a 2-1 win against Spurs in May 2016.\nSouthampton have never kept a league clean sheet at the Etihad (10 games), with their last away shutout against Man City coming in the last ever match at Maine Road in May 2003 (1-0).\nSergio Aguero has been involved in 10 goals in his last 10 Premier League games against Southampton (six goals, four assists).\nMan City's Sergio Aguero has scored nine goals from his 10 shots on target in the Premier League this season, with his strike today the Citizens' first effort on target in the match.\nSince the start of last season, only Danny Ings (11) has scored more Premier League goals for Southampton than James Ward-Prowse (nine).\nWhat next? Liverpool test is fast approaching for City\nAfter four successive home games, and four straight wins, City head to Italy for Wednesday's Champions League game with Atalanta, knowing a win will make certain of their progress out of Group C (20:00 GMT kick-off)\nThen comes a much shorter trip for their potentially pivotal Premier League clash with leaders Liverpool, at Anfield on Sunday (16:30)\nSouthampton also have a match against a Merseyside team on the horizon - their next league game is at home to Everton on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 2-0 Norwich City\nBrighton's revival under manager Graham Potter continued as they deservedly overcame struggling Norwich City at Amex Stadium.\nThe Seagulls were by far the more impressive side and secured their third successive home win in the Premier League with second-half goals from substitutes Leandro Trossard and Shane Duffy.\nNorwich, in contrast, have lost five of their last six league games since beating Manchester City at Carrow Road in September and could have no complaints here.\nThey came close in the first half when Marco Stiepermann hit the bar but from then on the momentum was with Brighton and they were rewarded when Trossard steered in a neat near-post finish after 68 minutes and Duffy slid in from a free-kick six minutes from time.\nVictory puts Brighton in the top 10 but leaves Norwich still struggling to adapt to life in the Premier League under manager Daniel Farke.\nThe German said: \"You have to have a mentality like selling Hoovers - you have to knock on many doors.\n\"The task is like I said at the beginning - it's about climbing Mount Everest. Clubs spent money, even Sheffield United spent money - we weren't able to do it.\n\"It's a tough period right now.\"\nSaturday's Premier League reaction\nRelive the action as it happened from Amex Stadium\nBrighton getting Potter's message\nBrighton received criticism in some quarters when they sacked manager Chris Hughton after he kept them in the Premier League last season - but the decision to bring in Graham Potter from Swansea City has proved wise so far.\nHughton had done an outstanding job but there perhaps comes a time when a manager's tenure comes to a natural end and a fresh voice and approach is required.\nBrighton decided that was the way forward and went for Potter, who had distinguished himself at Ostersunds in Sweden before doing well in difficult circumstances in south Wales.\nHe has brought a patient, passing style to Brighton and his new charges have been impressive in the manner they have got up to speed.\nThere are odd occasions when Brighton's fans might like to see things done a little quicker but three successive home league wins against Tottenham, Everton and now Norwich have provided strong evidence that Potter's message is working and winning favour with supporters and players.\nBrighton looked strong at the back and the invention of Trossard, a summer signing from Genk, gives them an extra dimension, as he did when he emerged as a second-half substitute here and turned in the crucial opening goal from Martin Montoya's cross.\nThey are now in eighth place and as Potter took the acclaim of Brighton's fans at the final whistle, it is clear his work is winning their seal of approval.\nNorwich struggling for answers\nNorwich's magnificent win over reigning champions Manchester City on a night that electrified Carrow Road in September seemed an age away as they struggled so badly here.\nWhen they beat Manchester City 3-2 they had pace, strength and the goalscoring touch of Teemu Pukki - none of that was on show here.\nThis is not Pukki's fault. The talismanic Finnish striker is not even feeding on scraps currently and he is not helped when the undoubtedly talented Emiliano Buendia has the skill to work dangerous positions but is so prone to over-elaboration that the chance is often lost.\nManager Farke was determined his team would meet the Premier League challenge head-on with his all-out attacking style, but it has only brought them two wins this season and they are now characterised by the ominous combination of lack of punch up front and a propensity to concede at the back.\nNo wonder Farke's brow was even more furrowed than usual as he prowled the touchline at a rain-lashed Amex Stadium.\nNorwich can still work their way out of this but Farke must work fast to shore up those defensive deficiencies and find a way to get Pukki, his most potent attacking weapon, into the game.\nFail and it will be a long season.\nMan of the match - Leandro Trossard (Brighton)\n'We had to be disciplined' - reaction\nBrighton manager Graham Potter: \"It's pleasing to get three points against a team that carry a threat.\n\"We had to be disciplined and we were.\n\"We needed patience and understanding playing against side that carries a threat.\"\nNorwich's travel bug - the stats\nBrighton have won back-to-back home league games against Norwich without conceding, having lost four on the bounce against the Canaries on home soil prior to this run.\nBrighton have won three consecutive home games for only the second time in the Premier League (also in March 2018 under Chris Hughton).\nNorwich's seven points from 11 games this season in their joint-lowest points tally at this stage of a top-flight season (also seven points after 11 games in 2004-05).\nNorwich have lost 14 of their last 16 away games in the Premier League (W1 D1), failing to score in 13 of those matches, including each of the last five.\nLeandro Trossard was the first Brighton player to both score and assist in a Premier League game since Pascal Gross against West Ham in February 2018.\nWhat's next?\nNorwich host Watford on Friday (20:00 GMT) and Brighton are away at Manchester United next Sunday (14:00)."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 3-0 Burnley: Impressive Blades into sixth\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder insists he \"is not looking at the table\" after his side moved into sixth place in the Premier League with an impressive victory over Burnley at Bramall Lane.\nAll of the Blades' goals came before half-time, with John Lundstram scoring twice.\nWilder's side, who finished second in the Championship last season, are now unbeaten in four outings.\n\"I've not looked at the league table and I won't do,\" said Wilder. \"I'll only assess the season at the death.\"\nLys Mousset assisted all three goals, with Lundstram's second followed by John Fleck's first of the season just 90 seconds later.\nBurnley's claims for a VAR penalty for handball by Jack O'Connell when 1-0 down were refused as United kept their fifth clean sheet of the season.\nRelive the action from Bramall Lane\nFollow all today's Premier League action\nBurnley coach Stone under investigation\nLundstram had several chances to complete his hat-trick in the second half, going closest when forcing Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope into a good save.\nPope also denied substitute Billy Sharp with his feet, while Burnley failed to have a shot on target and slip down the table into 14th place following their third defeat in a row.\n\"It's an accumulation of points for us. It always has been and it always will be,\" added Wilder, who took over at Bramall Lane in May 2016 when the club were in League One.\n\"We will have difficult days to come and poor results in this division, I understand that because of the level that we are at.\"\n'Blades and Lundstram have raised their game'\nUnited's impressive return to the top flight just keeps on going, with their fourth game unbeaten and their biggest win of the season to date.\nTheir only loss in their last six outings in the league was a somewhat unlucky 1-0 defeat by leaders Liverpool, while against Burnley they were rarely troubled and out of sight by half-time.\nWilder's approach has won praise, and both of Lundstram's goals came at the end of slick moves that swept down the left flank.\nLow crosses from David McGoldrick and Enda Stevens received subtle touches in the middle from Mousset, setting up Lundstram for shots that the 25-year-old midfielder tucked away with confidence.\nMousset worked hard to to give Fleck his chance, quickly latching on to a mistake by James Tarkowski near halfway.\n\"John raised his game in the summer - as we all had to,\" Wilder added. \"We're going into a completely different league, and when you're playing at this level everybody has to raise their level. John is someone who has looked comfortable and at home in the Premier League.\"\nThe forthcoming meetings with Tottenham and Manchester United may have looked formidable when the fixture list was announced, but thanks to some outstanding displays the South Yorkshire club are looking down on both of their next two opponents.\nProblems at both ends for Burnley\nThe Clarets' first top-flight visit to Bramall Lane since 1975 ended badly, but the opening exchanges were end-to-end and there were claims for an early penalty when Jay Rodriguez tangled with O'Connell.\nHindsight makes the VAR penalty decision look like a turning point, but loose defending by Sean Dyche's side twice inside two minutes just before the break gave them too much to do in the second half.\nDyche's Burnley have had a hard-to-beat reputation in recent seasons but now they are conceding goals at a worrying rate.\nThree consecutive defeats have seen nine goals go in, doubling the 'goals against' column from their previous eight outings this season.\nThe lack of efforts on target will also be a concern to Dyche, who will be hoping that striker Chris Wood gets over his hamstring injury soon.\nThe New Zealander scored four goals in his last four appearances, and while this was only the second time Burnley have drawn a blank this season, they cannot afford toothless displays to become a habit.\nMan of the match - John Lundstram (Sheffield United)\n'Unacceptable' - manager reaction\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"The first half was unacceptable, it's as simple as that. Too many players were way off the mark.\n\"There were a couple of decisions that I felt went against that might have got us out of jail. J-Rod got clipped. We've seen those given, although we don't get many of them. We've been hearing a lot about 'soft contacts' lately and he gets one today from behind and nothing is given. He doesn't dive, he falls naturally, but doesn't get it.\n\"Then there was the handball, which I think everyone would expect to get a penalty for. But I need to be clear, they would have got us out of jail because they were miles better than us in the first half.\"\nWoe on the road for Clarets - the stats\nBy scoring three goals, all in the first half, Sheffield United equalled their total haul from their previous five home Premier League games (three in five home games)\nBurnley are winless in their last eight away Premier League games, their longest such run since their first 17 on the road in 2016-17\nSheffield United are the 54th different side Burnley manager Sean Dyche has faced in his English league career - but just the fourth he hasn't beaten, also failing against Arsenal (nine games), Man Utd (eight games) and Coventry (two games).\nBurnley have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their last 13 away league games, since a goalless draw at Watford in January\nBurnley conceded three goals in a Premier League first half for the first time since December 2018 against Everton\nThis is just the ninth occasion a Sheffield United player has scored two or more goals in a Premier League game, with John Lundstram the first to do so since Nathan Blake against Newcastle in April 1994\nSheffield United attacker Lys Moussett is the ninth player to register three assists in the first half of a Premier League game and the first since Kyle Walker-Peters for Tottenham against Bournemouth in December 2018\nMousset is also just the fifth player to assist three or more goals in a single Premier League game for a newly promoted side, and the first since Darren Huckerby for Norwich in January 2005\nWhat's next?\nUnited take on Spurs at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, 9 November at 15:00 GMT, while Burnley host West Ham at Turf Moor at the same time."

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool: Reds fight back to down Villa\nLiverpool scored two late goals - including a dramatic injury-time winner from Sadio Mane - as they came from behind to beat Aston Villa and preserve their six-point lead at the top of the Premier League.\nWith their 10-month long unbeaten league record seemingly about to end, the Reds dug deep to conjure a stellar finish, begun when Andy Robertson arrived at the back post to head them level.\nMane then provided the final, remarkable twist, glancing a header from Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner past Tom Heaton and into the far corner of the net.\nIt was a cruel blow to Villa, who had led from the 21st minute through summer-signing Trezeguet's first goal for the club - a volleyed finish from John McGinn's free-kick.\nThe home side had shown huge endeavour, in a display that saw them match the European champions in the first half and then hold them largely at arm's length until the dying moments of the second.\nLiverpool's win means they retain their advantage over second-placed Manchester City, who staged their own comeback to beat Southampton and visit Anfield for a mouth-watering top-of-the-table clash next Sunday.\nHaving won two on the bounce last month, Villa have now lost back-to-back games - admittedly to the league's top two sides - leaving them in 16th place, three points above the relegation zone.\nReds 'deserved' dramatic victory - Klopp\nAs it happened: Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League action\nLiverpool find a way\nThe old adage goes that good sides find a way to win, even when they play badly. And Liverpool keep finding a way.\nThey have done a number of times this season, repeatedly in Europe in recent seasons, and managed it again here.\nThis was not a good Liverpool display, but it was a winning one.\nThey lacked control for large parts, were rattled by a hard-working opponent and lacked their usual composure in front of goal until Robertson and then Mane seized the initiative.\nPart of this could be down to the absence of Fabinho, benched by Jurgen Klopp with the looming shadow of Man City next weekend and the fact one more yellow would have seen the Brazilian sit out that game.\nFabinho - nicknamed 'Dyson' by his manager after last weekend's win over Tottenham for his ability to \"hoover up\" danger - has been magnificent in midfield this season.\nHis replacement, Adam Lallana, spent the summer retraining for the deeper role but he lacks the authority and composure of the man he replaced.\nToo often he dwelt on the ball and found himself swarmed by Villa players, failing to provide the platform on which his side could build.\nHe was also guilty of a glaring miss in the second half, slicing well wide from a cut-back from Roberto Firmino, who had earlier been denied himself when an offside flag ruled out his neat finish.\nHe was not alone in his profligacy, though, with Mane and Mohamed Salah also spurning good opportunities to give their side a less stressful afternoon.\nHowever, with 31 points from 11 games this season, Liverpool will have to set an unwanted precedent if they are to end this campaign without the top-flight trophy.\nThe two clubs with the same tally at this stage of a Premier League season - Chelsea in 2005-06 and Man City in 2017-18 - both went on to win the title.\nIf they indeed win the title, it will have been because of the grit they demonstrated in the final moments here, as well as the guile they have showed for much of the last 10 months.\nVilla deserve more\nVilla were the nearest challengers the last time Liverpool won the title in 1990, pushing them all the way until the final month under Graham Taylor.\nHaving returned to the top flight following a two-year absence, their ambitions this season are more humble. In truth, a 17th-placed finish will probably do.\nThey look far more equipped to secure their Premier League status than they did the last time they faced Liverpool at Villa Park, when Remi Garde's side surrendered to a humiliating 6-0 defeat en route to relegation.\nThey are a much better side now, emboldened by a promotion and the acquiring of superior talent during the summer and this felt like a statement performance to a division in which they feel they belong.\nThey could have led through a saved Anwar El Ghazi effort, should have gone ahead through a Wesley header that he somehow glanced wide and finally did go in front when Trezeguet broke the offside trap to fire home from McGinn's free-kick and provide a deserved lead.\nThe opportunities dried up in the second half as they conceded greater and greater territory to an opponent growing increasingly desperate.\nBut with backs to the wall, they rarely turned away from a challenge.\nVilla deserved to emerge with a draw and a defeat was an extremely harsh reward for all their effort.\nHaving beaten Norwich and Brighton in their first two games in October, Villa have been somewhat unfortunate to face Man City and then Liverpool in successive fixtures.\nThe rest of November sees them make a short trip to Wolves before hosting Newcastle - two games from which they will feel far more confident of securing points.\nMan of the match - Marvelous Nakamba (Aston Villa)\n'We were in the wrong path'- what the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We had our good moments during the game but were not clinical enough, especially in the first half.\n\"I don't always believe we can win every game but I never give up. So when we scored the equaliser I thought, 'that's what we deserve'.\n\"We know we can do better, but on days like this you just need to be ready to fight. When you play in a stadium like Villa Park it's fair you might get a little knock.\n\"After the first half we realised we were in the wrong path and we made changes.\"\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We're disappointed we have come out with nothing.\n\"It's a tough one to take. We created some big chances in the game but two basic mistakes cost us.\n\"We were always a threat on the counter-attack. We knew they were always going to have the ball.\n\"Their full-backs are very attacking. I think we got away with one with the VAR incident [Firmino's disallowed goal] and Lallana missed a big chance as well.\"\nReds leave it late again - the stats\nSadio Mane scored the 35th 90th-minute winning goal by Liverpool in the Premier League, at least 10 more than any other side in the competition's history; five of those have come since the start of last season, more than any other team.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in seven Premier League games in which they have conceded the first goal, winning six of those (D1); they have won more points from losing positions (10) than any other side in the top-flight this season.\nLiverpool have earned 31 points from their 11 Premier League games this season; in English top-flight history, only Tottenham in 1960-61 (33, adjusted to three points for a win) have had more at this stage of a campaign.\nAston Villa have lost 11 points in games in which they have gone ahead this season, more than any other Premier League side.\nLiverpool have won 14 consecutive Premier League games against newly-promoted opposition.\nLiverpool's Sadio Mane has more assists in 11 league games this season (two) than he provided in 36 such appearances last term (one).\nTrezeguet is the first Egyptian player to score a Premier League goal for Aston Villa, meaning players from 32 different nations have now scored in the competition for the Villains (excluding own goals).\nAndy Robertson has scored two goals in his last six games for Liverpool in all competitions, one more than his first 88 appearances for the club before this.\nAged just 21 years and 26 days, Trent Alexander-Arnold made his 100th appearance in all competitions for Liverpool. Since his debut in October 2016, only Roberto Firmino (36) and Mohamed Salah (28) have more assists for the Reds than Alexander-Arnold (22).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool welcome Genk to Anfield in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) before hosting second-placed Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday, 10 November (16:30).\nVilla travel to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League next Sunday (14:00)."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-2 Chelsea: Tammy Abraham & Christian Pulisic goals send Blues third\nGoalkeeper Ben Foster was denied a stunning headed equaliser in stoppage time as Chelsea hung on for victory at Watford to move third in the Premier League.\nIn blustery conditions, the visitors opened the scoring after five minutes when Jorginho's delicious pass allowed Tammy Abraham to lift in his 10th goal of the season.\nFoster made two superb stops to prevent Frank Lampard's side going further ahead before the break as he denied both Christian Pulisic and Mason Mount.\nBut he could not prevent Pulisic following up his hat-trick against Burnley last Saturday with another goal as the American tucked in Abraham's low cross.\nWatford, who remain bottom of the Premier League and are still searching for their first league win of the season, were handed a lifeline when Gerard Deulofeu tucked in a video assistant referee-awarded penalty, his first goal of the season.\nAnd the hosts almost equalised when Foster's header deep in injury time was superbly saved by Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, who sparked celebrations among his team-mates with the last action of the match.\nBut overall, Watford could not match a superior Chelsea side who recorded a fifth successive away win in the league, and a club-record equalling seventh away victory in all competitions.\nLampard's side can slip back into fourth behind Leicester, who face Crystal Palace on Sunday and have a superior goal difference, yet it was another impressive step forward for his young side who are now two points behind second-place Manchester City.\nVAR in 'really dangerous place' - Lampard\nRelive the action from Vicarage Road\nChelsea show style and substance in gritty win\nChelsea's defeat by Manchester United in the Carabao Cup ended their seven-game winning run, but on the evidence of this game it has done little to dent their confidence.\nWith Abraham, Mount and Willian restored to the team, and Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic pulling the strings in midfield, Watford struggled to get hold of the ball in the early stages.\nWhen the hosts finally had a sustained period of possession after half an hour, they could have been three goals down.\nAbraham's opener was a work of wonder from Jorginho, who is now a fans' favourite after becoming a lightning rod for the frustration last season under Maurizio Sarri.\nBut Chelsea's top scorer could have had a second as Foster also stopped Pulisic's header and somehow tipped Mount's shot onto the bar, also denying the midfielder again in the second half after a fast break.\nAlthough Chelsea finished third last season, their away form often faltered under Sarri. This season, however, they are showing steel, suggesting that a similar finish may be possible despite losing Eden Hazard in the summer and being in the midst of a two-window transfer ban.\nWin eludes Watford again despite soft penalty\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores said in his programme notes that he can \"feel\" his team getting closer to their first Premier League win of the season following three successive draws.\nSetting up in 5-3-2 system, they had to contain Chelsea for the first half hour, as the visitors threatened to put the game out of sight.\nBut following Foster's heroics, they grew into the game as half-time approached, giving their shivering fans something to warm to.\nDeulofeu's fizzing effort was the closest they came before the break and Kurt Zouma had to be sharp to block Andre Gray's early second-half shot.\nOnce Pulisic scored his fourth of the season, the game looked to have petered out and yet there was still time for VAR to intervene with 10 minutes remaining.\nHaving been on the wrong end of two VAR decisions against Tottenham last month, Watford will not have minded that the penalty award looked soft.\nJorginho appeared to trip Deulofeu but the contact looked minimal, with referee Anthony Taylor deciding against the spot-kick.\nThe VAR thought differently, and although Watford pressed for an equaliser with Arrizabalaga saving from Foster's header in injury time, Chelsea fans were able serenade \"Super Frankie Lampard\" once again on the road.\nMan of the match - Jorginho (Chelsea)\n'If I score at the end that's me retiring' - reaction\nWatford goalkeeper Ben Foster, speaking to Match of the Day: \"If I score at the end that's me retiring. Fair play to Kepa - that was some save.\n\"Chelsea are a very good team with a lot of good energetic players, it is good for them and for England. But we can hold our head up high for hanging on until the end. We could have nicked something.\"\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: \"In the last minute Kepa had to do an amazing save, we're fighting against very good teams but our idea of football remains the same.\n\"The match was very tough but we had an opportunity to draw it. When we are positive on the pitch we are a good team and we can compete very well.\n\"I trust the players we have, some are coming back from injuries and others are tired, but right now it is about experience and managing our next challenges.\n\"We have positives, we are able to do good things but this does not happen for a full match.\n\"It's tough for the players but we need to go for the positive moments and make them more.\"\nHornets get the Blues again - stats\nChelsea have won seven consecutive away games in all competitions - their joint-longest winning run on the road in the club's history (also seven between February-April 1989 under former boss Bobby Campbell).\nWatford have failed to win any of their opening 11 games to a league season for the first time in their history (D5 L6). They are the first team to do so in the Premier League since QPR in 2012-13.\nChelsea have won consecutive away games against Watford for the very first time in the top-flight of English football, having also won this exact fixture last season (1-2).\nAbraham has scored seven goals in his six away appearances in the league this season - only Kevin Phillips in 1999-00 (Sunderland) and Manchester City duo Edin Dzeko in 2011-12 and Sergio Aguero in 2016-17 (all eight) have scored more in their opening six away games of a Premier League season.\nPulisic has been directly involved in nine goals for Chelsea in all competitions this season (four goals, five assists); only Abraham has been involved in more (12) - while eight of those nine goal involvements have come away from Stamford Bridge, including all four goals.\nJorginho has been directly involved in three goals in his 11 Premier League games this season (one goal, two assists), already more than he managed in his 37 such appearances last season (two goals, no assists).\nDeulofeu has scored his first goal from his 26th shot in the Premier League this season - his shot conversion rate of 3.8% is the joint-lowest of players to score in the competition in 2019-20 (along with Arsenal's Nicolas Pepe, also 1/26).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Ajax in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) and are back at Stamford Bridge on Saturday (12:30) for their match against Crystal Palace. The Hornets are at Norwich next Friday (20:00)."

We have so many options and it can only benefit us.\"\nThe Foxes are now level with Chelsea on 23 points, but with a better goal difference, and just two points behind second-placed Manchester City.\nThey have one more point than they did at this stage during their title-winning campaign in 2015-16.\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers said he did not want to put any pressure on his players.\n\"My senior players are first-class,\" said the former Liverpool and Celtic boss. \"The spirit is very good and they understand we are trying to create something here we can sustain.\n\"People asked about European football at the beginning of the season and I said, 'listen, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves' because there are some incredible teams in this league.\"\nTurkey centre-back Soyuncu, who joined from Freiburg in 2018, has been one of the shining stars for the Foxes this season and further endeared himself to their fans with a stooping header that broke the deadlock in the 57th minute.\n'A defender made for the modern game' - Martin Keown analysis on Caglar Soyuncu\nCoverage of Everton v Spurs and reaction to the match at Selhurst Park\nVardy, who scored a hat-trick in the 9-0 win at Southampton, then sealed the away win in the 88th minute with a first-time strike after a swift one-two with substitute Gray.\nFull-back Ben Chilwell came close to adding a third in stoppage time but saw his angled strike come off the inside of the post.\nMid-table Palace, who came into the match with seven points from 12, failed to trouble Kasper Schmeichel aside from a Jeffrey Schlupp deflected strike that had to be tipped over the bar by the Dane.\nThe Eagles remain ninth with 15 points.\nMaddison and Tielemans sparkle again\nYou cannot blame lifelong supporter Leigh Herbert for again backing Leicester to produce their second \"miracle\" in four years.\nHe believes they are a stronger unit than the one that stormed to the 2015-16 title and earned him \u00a320,000 for his 5,000-1 bet.\nThe bookies agree with Leigh and gave him odds of 300-1 this time, although perhaps a better bet is to back them to finish in the top four.\nThis season those heavily used tactics that brought so much success five seasons ago are proving fruitful again.\nIn Maddison and Tielemans they have a duo in tune with Vardy's intentions in the same way Danny Drinkwater and Riyad Mahrez were in the title-winning season.\nMaddison found the former England striker for the first chance which Vicente Guaita did well to save before Tielemans threaded a brilliant ball into Vardy's path, only for the Spanish keeper to anticipate the danger.\nMidfielder Maddison had another outstanding game. He had a direct hand in seven of Leicester's first eight shots in the match before delivering the corner for Soyuncu's opener.\nWhen called upon to defend, centre-backs Soyuncu and Jonny Evans, who made one notable block to deny Wilfried Zaha, coped comfortably.\nGray's introduction in the 74th minute added more pace to the attack and he linked up with Vardy in the area for the second, which effectively ended the contest.\nIt is Arsenal at home next Saturday for Leicester, but thoughts might already be fixed on back-to-back fixtures with Manchester City and Liverpool in December.\nPalace struggle in attack once more\nAs for Palace, they performed their own miracle under Roy Hodgson when he took over just over two years ago with the team in a desperate state.\nNow the 72-year-old football sage is hoping for an extension to his contract, which few would argue he has not earned.\nThis season his side had only lost once at home prior to Sunday's fixture and came into the match having come from 2-0 down to draw to 2-2 at Arsenal.\nBut there was to be no fightback against the Foxes as once again Palace's seemingly perennial problem in the final third reared its ugly head again.\nSchmeichel only had to stretch once to ensure Schlupp's shot did not embarrass him as the home attack struggled to make breakthroughs.\nPalace have only scored 10 goals this season - the joint second worst total in the Premier League and the same number as Vardy.\nHodgson might be advised to ask for funds for a new striker during his contract negotiations.\nMan of the match - James Maddison (Leicester)\nMaddison equals Rooney feat - stats\nThis was Leicester's 12th Premier League win under Brendan Rodgers - since his first game in charge, only Liverpool (19) and Man City (17) have won more than the Foxes.\nPalace have lost back-to-back home Premier League games for the first time since March, when they lost to Brighton and Man Utd.\nVardy is the first player to score 10 Premier League goals this season - the last time he was the first player to reach 10 in a season was in 2015-16, when they went on to win the league.\nSoyuncu became the second Turkish player to score in the Premier League for Leicester City, after Muzzy Izzet (33 goals between 1996 and 2004).\nThree of the last four Premier League goals conceded by Palace have been via corners - before this, only three of the previous 36 goals they'd conceded had been from corners.\nMaddison created eight chances for Leicester City today - the last Englishman with more in a Premier League game was Wayne Rooney in November 2013 against Cardiff City (nine).\nSince Rodgers' first league match in charge of Leicester on 3 March, Jamie Vardy has scored 19 Premier League goals - five more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nPalace are away at Chelsea on Saturday, 9 November (12:30 GMT) and the Foxes are at home to Arsenal on the same day (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Everton 1-1 Tottenham: Andre Gomes injury overshadows Everton draw\nEverton midfielder Andre Gomes suffered a serious ankle injury which left Tottenham's Son Heung-min in tears and overshadowed the home side scoring a 97th-minute equaliser to earn a vital point.\nGomes, 26, was tackled from behind by Son and appeared to be injured by an awkward fall which prompted an anguished reaction from players and fans close to the incident.\nSon was sent off by referee Martin Atkinson as Portugal international Gomes received extensive treatment in a lengthy delay and was eventually taken off on a stretcher.\nFormer Everton winger Pat Nevin, who was the analyst for BBC Radio 5 Live at Goodison Park on Sunday, described the incident as \"horrible\".\n\"Players looked devastated and there was utter confusion - players with their heads in their hands,\" the former Scotland international said.\n\"Son was distraught before he was sent off, and Serge Aurier couldn't watch and was praying.\n\"Gomes was led straight to the corner to the ambulance to take him to hospital.\"\nEverton's Gomes to have surgery after horrific ankle injury\nEverton investigating racism allegation at Spurs game\nRelive the action at Goodison Park\nThe atmosphere around Goodison Park darkened as the football became secondary to Gomes' plight, until the mood was lifted by substitute Cenk Tosun heading in from close range.\nEarlier, Spurs midfielder Dele Alli's clinical finish had livened up a dull game where the video assistant referee again proved a controversial talking point when Everton were denied what looked like a penalty.\nSpurs, without a league win on the road since January, seemed set to take all three points when Alli punished a loose pass from Everton's Alex Iwobi to fire in.\nMoments later, Alli looked to have handled in the Everton box but, after a three-minute delay peppered with boos from supporters, a penalty was not given by VAR.\nEverton eventually equalised deep into the 12 minutes of stoppage time following Gomes' injury, with the draw moving Marco Silva's side three points clear of the relegation zone.\nSpurs were set to move eighth with a rare away win, but instead are 11th in the middle of a pack of 13 teams separated by just six points.\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino sent his \"best wishes\" to Gomes, adding \"the most important thing is he recovers quickly\".\nSon initially looked set to be given a yellow card for the challenge before referee Atkinson changed his mind and reduced Spurs to 10 men for the rest of the match.\nPochettino said it was \"not important\" whether Son should have been sent off or not, although added he did think his player was given a red card because of the \"consequence\" of the challenge.\n\"It was a normal action with the bad luck that Andre was injured,\" he told BBC Sport.\nMore VAR confusion leaves everyone baffled\nFor the first hour of the match, there was very little to talk about as both teams illustrated why they are struggling in the bottom half despite each holding much loftier ambitions.\nSo it was once again left to the farcical nature of VAR to give fans leaving Goodison Park something to complain about.\nShortly after Alli put Tottenham ahead, the Spurs midfielder looked to have handled in his own box when jumping to challenge Yerry Mina at an Everton corner.\nInitially it looked innocuous - and certainly accidental - but replays suggested a penalty would be given as, judging by the letter of the law, his arm was raised above his head.\nLoud boos were heard from the Goodison crowd as VAR watched 26 replays in a wait lasting almost three minutes.\nEventually it was decided that the original 'no penalty' decision should stand, leaving the players, managers, supporters at the ground and television viewers alike confused.\nEarlier, Son had felt he was fouled by Mina in the Everton box during the first half, leading to another long delay until the system eventually came to the same conclusion of 'no penalty'.\nEverton manager Marco Silva said he was \"100% sure what happened\" in both incidents after needing only a quick look at the same replays seen by VAR.\n\"I don't know why they needed two or three minutes and then decided what they decided,\" the Portuguese boss said.\n\"It is tough for me but tough for the referee as well.\"\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino added he \"did not know what is going on\".\n\"It is supposed to be helping the referee but it is creating more confusion,\" added the Argentine.\nDeficiencies of Everton and Spurs still clear\nAlthough the game was ultimately overshadowed, the deficiencies in two teams expecting to be challenging for Champions League qualification - and leaving both managers under differing degrees of pressure - were not masked.\nEverton manager Silva badly needed a victory with his side sitting one place above the relegation zone and having earned just three points from their previous six league matches.\nThat is despite the Toffees spending almost \u00a3120m this summer in a bid to close the gap on the Premier League's 'top six'.\nBoth sides played with a lethargy in a first half which saw neither team pressing quickly, leading to a dearth of attacking pressure and just one shot on target - when Everton forward Richarlison turned and shot weakly at Spurs keeper Paulo Gazzaniga - between them.\nEverton improved with their numerical advantage and left Silva claiming his team could have won.\n\"We showed a fantastic spirit. Even after that tough moment we had to keep focus and get a result. We deserved more than just a draw,\" he said.\n\"The first half was tough, we had problems to press a little more and even though they didn't create anything we didn't create either.\n\"In the second half we made some steps forward and started to press a little more. In my opinion we controlled the game until they scored through our mistake.\n\"Of course we reacted and after that tough moment we showed a reaction and could have won 2-1.\"\nEverton's late equaliser means Tottenham, who were without striker Harry Kane through illness, have won just twice in their past 10 matches in all competitions.\n\"We were playing well but it's difficult to assess the last 10 minutes,\" Pochettino said.\n\"Talking only about football, it was a very difficult game. We were good but the game changed after the incident.\"\nMan of the match - Dele Alli (Tottenham)\nSpurs' struggles on the road continue - the stats\nTottenham Hotspur are winless in their last 12 Premier League away games, drawing three and losing nine, and last beating Fulham 2-1 on 20 January.\nCenk Tosun's goal for Everton after 96 minutes and 57 seconds is the latest goal scored in a Premier League game since Alexis Sanchez scored for Arsenal against Burnley in January 2017 after 97 minutes and 14 seconds.\nSpurs avoided a goalless draw for an 82nd consecutive Premier League game, the only two sides to go on longer runs are Ipswich Town (87 between Aug 1994 and May 2001) and Manchester United (114 between May 1999 and May 2002).\nEverton's Jordan Pickford became only the 22nd player in Premier League history to appear in 100 consecutive matches and the first since Darren Fletcher.\nSpurs' Dele Alli has not lost any of the 39 Premier League games he has scored in; only Darius Vassell (46) and James Milner (53) have scored in more games without finishing on the losing side.\nThe match lasted 104 minutes and 52 seconds, making it four minutes longer than any other Premier League match this season.\nWhat's next?\nEverton go to fellow strugglers Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT) in what is surely a must-win game for under-pressure manager Marco Silva.\nTottenham switch their attention back to the Champions League, when they face Red Star Belgrade in the Serbian capital on Wednesday (20:00 GMT), before returning to Premier League action at home to sixth-placed Sheffield United on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Norwich City 0-2 Watford: Hornets' first win of season lifts them off bottom\nWatford earned their first Premier League win of the season as they moved off the bottom of the table at the expense of opponents Norwich.\nThe Hornets' victory, their first in the top flight since April, means they leapfrog Southampton and the hosts, whose own winless run has now stretched to a seventh game.\nGerard Deulofeu's goal after 76 seconds after some lax defending from Emiliano Buendia set Watford on their way and Andre Gray's close-range flick from a Deulofeu cross secured the points.\nBut they had to survive for 25 minutes with 10 men after Christian Kabasele was dismissed for his second yellow card.\nThat provided the hosts with some impetus in the closing stages but Quique Sanchez Flores' side held firm to earn a first league victory since his return to the club.\nThe Hornets, who have struggled for goals this term, displayed a clinical streak that had until now been absent, scoring with their only two efforts on target.\nNorwich have now gone 10 Premier League home games without keeping a clean sheet - a run stretching back to their previous campaign in the top flight - and hold the worst defensive record in the division.\nReaction as Watford claim first win of the season at Norwich\nDeulofeu stars on positive night for Watford\nWatford's season has so far followed a familiar pattern of failing to convert chances in front of goal before being punished at the other end.\nSo this was a welcome reversal of fortune for Sanchez Flores, who had overseen four draws and three defeats in his seven matches in charge since replacing compatriot Javi Gracia in September.\nThe Spanish boss will also have been encouraged by being able to name Troy Deeney in a Hornets squad for the first time since August.\nAnd while the physical presence and bustling firepower that the 31-year-old can provide may yet prove pivotal if Watford are to turn their season around, Deulofeu's pace was crucial in East Anglia.\nDispossessing Buendia, Deulofeu drifted into the Norwich penalty area from the right unopposed and drilled a low left-foot shot past Canaries goalkeeper Tim Krul into the bottom left corner from 15 yards.\nWhile Deulofeu clearly has the capacity to frustrate his team-mates at times, by failing to track back or make runs in behind opposition defences, the former Barcelona and Everton forward also created Watford's second.\nLatching on to a ball down the left channel, the 25-year-old teased Max Aarons before picking out Gray, whose attempted backheel deflected off Jamal Lewis into the bottom left corner.\n\"We need positive energy and scoring early is how you feed the energy of the players,\" said Sanchez Flores.\n\"The players were really strong. They kept their shape and everything was really good. The fans were for a long time waiting, waiting, waiting. This was for the fans, they deserve it.\"\nNorwich lacking firepower and paying for a 'nursery' mistake\nWhile Norwich appeared to regain control of the game in the first half, there was a certain inevitability about the outcome once they had fallen behind to Deulofeu's early goal.\n\"It [Norwich's start] was a disaster,\" said Canaries head coach Daniel Farke.\n\"They switched to five at the back and it was difficult to create chances against them so to invite them with such a nursery mistake was a confidence boost for them. It was a game-defining moment.\"\nFarke's side may have dominated possession but their struggles were underscored by a lack of creativity and thrust in front of goal.\nNorwich are also yet to earn a point this season after conceding the first goal, with Teemu Pukki's form indicative of their problems.\nThe Finland international started the campaign prolifically with six goals in his first five games but has now failed to score in his past seven outings for the club.\nAnd while he worked away industriously all evening, producing more sprints than any other player (19), he barely got into the positions to test Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster.\nCuban winger Onel Hernandez offered some threat down the left, repeatedly beating Kabasele before he was dismissed but he was underused thereafter, with the lively Todd Cantwell also introduced too late.\nIt ensured the hosts ended the evening with their joint-lowest tally at this stage of a top-flight season.\nMan of the Match - Gerard Deulofeu (Watford)\nSuper-sub Gray - the stats\nWatford registered their first Premier League win at the 12th attempt in 2019-20 and ended a run of 15 league games without a victory, stretching back to April.\nNorwich are the sixth newly promoted side to lose as many as nine of their opening 12 Premier League games to a season - four of the previous five went on to be relegated (the exception being Crystal Palace in 2013-14).\nThis was the first away Premier League win by a team starting the day bottom of the table since last November, when Huddersfield Town won 2-0 at Wolves.\nWatford striker Andre Gray has more Premier League goals as a substitute in 2019 than any other player (3).\nIn just two Premier League appearances on a Friday, Watford's Gerard Deulofeu has been involved in six goals, scoring four times and assisting two.\nDeulofeu's goal after 76 seconds for Watford was the second-quickest away goal scored in the Premier League this season, behind only Harry Kane's effort after 47 seconds for Spurs at Liverpool.\nNorwich are still without a home Premier League clean sheet this season, one of only three teams without one, along with Liverpool and Southampton.\nSince returning to the Premier League in 2015-16, Watford have received more red cards than any other top-flight team (17).\nWatford have kept three clean sheets in their last five Premier League games, having kept none in their 19 games prior to this.\nWhat's next?\nNorwich travel to Everton on Saturday, 23 November (15:00 GMT) for their next Premier League fixture, while Watford host Burnley on the same day (also 15:00)."

The older players help the younger ones but they have to realise very quickly what this level is because it's tough. The way they work daily and approach games is great. Can we replicate that through a longer period, that's the test.\n\"We've had teams come here and be difficult to break down, it's a test of not only how you unlock the door, but can you switch on to make sure you don't get hit by the sucker punch? I was really delighted with the game management. I got as much joy out of Kurt Zouma and Fikayo Tomori's performances in defence, and the midfielders shielding in front of them, as I did our attacking play.\n\"I trust in Reece [James]. Azpilicueta is our captain and is a legend of the club but it was just time to give Reece some minutes today because he's playing so well and he's trained so well. It was a really good individual performance. He dealt with [Wilfried] Zaha well and gave him problems going the other way.\n\"Harry Kane is an incredible player and what he's done in recent years and his career is amazing, so Tammy [Abraham] needs to look up to that. That's the next stage for Tammy. He's shown there are so many parts to his game. Today was difficult because there was not much space in to his feet. It's the game where you work a lot for a goal but he did that.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"I thought we weathered the early storm well. We controlled an opponent in very good form.\n\"Eventually they scored a good goal, but the second goal was a little unfortunate as we were starting to grow into the game and looking a little bit likely ourselves. Then it was very difficult for us to get back into it.\n\"It's an unfortunate spell we find ourselves in, but I can't say I'm disappointed with our performance.\"\nAzpilicueta's run halted - the stats\nChelsea have won six consecutive Premier League games for the first time since May 2017 under Antonio Conte, in their last title-winning season.\nThis was Crystal Palace's 100th Premier League London derby (W23 D23 L54), with only Fulham posting a lower points-per-game rate in such games (0.84) than the Eagles (0.92).\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard is the seventh English manager to win six consecutive Premier League matches, and the first since Alan Pardew in April 2012 with Newcastle United.\nWith an average age of 24 years and 88 days, Chelsea named their youngest ever starting XI in the Premier League, and the youngest of any team in the competition this season.\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson oversaw his 300th Premier League game as manager, becoming the 15th boss to hit that milestone.\nC\u00e9sar Azpilicueta's run of 73 consecutive starts in the Premier League for Chelsea ended, with the Spaniard failing to start for the first time since November 2017 against Swansea.\nCrystal Palace failed to attempt a single shot in the first half of a Premier League match for the first time since March 2014 away to Swansea City.\nTammy Abraham is the second youngest player to reach double figures for Premier League goals for Chelsea, after Arjen Robben (21y 342d).\nChelsea's Christian Pulisic is the fourth American to score in three consecutive Premier League games, after Clint Dempsey (three times), Joe-Max Moore and Roy Wegerle.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Manchester City in their next Premier League match on Saturday, 23 November (17:30 GMT). Crystal Palace welcome league leaders Liverpool to Selhurst Park for their next Premier League fixture on that day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Newcastle 2-1 Bournemouth: Steve Bruce says goals by defenders are 'vital'\nManager Steve Bruce said having defenders who can make an impact in attack is \"vital\" after goals from DeAndre Yedlin and Ciaran Clark helped Newcastle defeat Bournemouth at St James' Park.\nThe Magpies recorded back-to-back wins for the first time this season, and they are now in 11th position - two points shy of fifth place.\n\"That's vitally important [to have defenders scoring] and we know how crucial set-pieces are,\" said Bruce, with seven of the Magpies past nine league goals coming from the backline.\n\"When you have three centre-backs playing, if you can capitalise, then good.\"\nBruce also backed his attacking three of Joelinton, Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin, who again failed to find the net. Only Joelinton has scored this season, and that was back in August.\nHe added: \"They are doing everything but [score]. They are creating chances, and as long as they keep contributing, I am sure the rest will come.\"\nThe Magpies overcame a shaky first quarter of the match during which the Cherries took the lead through Harry Wilson.\nThe Welshman, on loan from Liverpool, finished off one of the set-piece moves of the season as Ryan Fraser and Joshua King played a one-two from a corner before the winger finished with a superb low shot.\nIt delighted Eddie Howe in the away dugout as his side produced their seventh league goal from a set-piece this season.\nThe Magpies went close when Saint-Maximin's fierce strike struck the bar before they equalised through Yedlin, who anticipated brilliantly as he converted the Frenchman's deflected strike with a flying header.\nClark completed the turnaround seven minutes after the break when he scuffed a shot past keeper Aaron Ramsdale.\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League action\nRelive the action from St James' Park\nMagpies defence is best form of attack\nIn the build-up to the match, Newcastle defender Federico Fernandez said that his manager likes the centre-backs \"to be more involved with the ball in the offensive part of the game\".\nThat guidance is no surprise as Bruce was a threat himself in the opposition area during his playing days as a central defender at Manchester United. In Fernandez, Clark and Jamaal Lascelles, he seems to have found players in his mould.\nWith the forward line once again misfiring, the team looked to the big defenders, although that aerial threat was depleted when captain Lascelles came off injured early in the match.\nIt was 5ft 8in Yedlin, not renowned for his prowess in the air, who equalised for the home side when he steamed into the six-yard area to power home Saint-Maximin's deflected shot.\nThat restored the confidence of the Magpies, who scored their second when Clark turned in after Fernandez flicked on Jetro Willems' delivery.\nBournemouth blow hot and cold\nHowe might be curious to know why his side appeared to lose their way after the break.\nHis side came into match on the back of three successive clean-sheets and had conceded the fewest goals at this stage of the season since their promotion to the top flight in 2015.\nWhen they scored early on during their period of domination, they appeared set for another three points following last week's victory over Manchester United. They came very close to a second when Ryan Fraser's shot was cleared off the line by Yedlin.\nBut then the game swung in the favour of the home side when they equalised.\nKing, who was spritely in those opening moments, stepped back into the shadows until the final few seconds of the match when he headed wide at the far post from a yard out. England forward Callum Wilson failed to make an impact again in attack, as did Phil Billing.\nThe defeat will not alarm Howe, although he might rue the fact that his side did not make most their early dominance.\nMan of the match - DeAndre Yedlin (Newcastle)\n'We had the initiative of the game but gave it away' - reaction\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"They punished our sloppy mistakes. In the end we created chances, but did not put them away.\n\"We had the initiative of the game, but gave it away, I felt we should have kept the ball better and we need to learn from it.\n\"We are looking for consistency; backing up a great win with another one, and today we missed an opportunity. This result will really hurt for the next two weeks.\"\nOn their goal from a well-worked set-piece: \"Credit to Jason Tindall [Bournemouth's assistant manager] - this is something we work on in training - and credit to the players too.\n\"Moments like that can really win you the games, but right now I have got something else in my mind.\"\nCherries run ends - the stats\nNewcastle have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since April, while this is also the first time they have scored more than once in a home league game this season.\nBournemouth lost a Premier League away game in which they scored the first goal for the first time since September 2017 (1-2 v Everton).\nThey conceded their first goal in four Premier League games, ending a run of 392 minutes in the competition without anyone scoring against them.\nNewcastle had 20 shots in this match - their most in a Premier League game this season, and most since hitting 29 against Huddersfield in February.\nSince the start of last season, Ryan Fraser has provided more Premier League assists than any other player (16).\nWhat's next?\nThe Cherries are at home to Wolves on Saturday, 23 November (15:00 GMT) and Newcastle are at Aston Villa on Monday 25 November (20:00 GMT)."

Instead, the visitors claimed their first away win of the season to climb up from 17th to 13th, a place and a point ahead of Manchester United, who host Brighton on Sunday.\n\"The first half was horrible. No-one wanted the ball any more. You could feel the lack of self confidence,\" Hasenh\u00fcttl said.\n\"It took us until the second half to get positive body language. The second half was OK. We went very offensive and it gave us a little more quality but you expose the defence and the goal killed us.\n\"It is not a nice situation. I can guarantee the players try to fight to win games. At the moment we are not good enough.\"\nTom Davies put the visitors in charge, heading in from close range following Gylfi Sigurdsson's corner but Marco Silva's side were also guilty of wasting several good chances.\nThat allowed the hosts to hit back with substitute Sofiane Boufal laying on a tap-in for Danny Ings to equalise.\nBut Everton, without the injured Andre Gomes, took the points, with Richarlison turning in Djibril Sidibe's right-wing cross from six yards out in the 75th minute.\n\"It [the win] was really important for us. All of us inside the club want to be in a different position but you have to look for a different picture,\" Silva said.\n\"In all the games it is difficult to find one team who is better than ourselves. Pressure - never. It is a privilege to be at Everton Football Club. Many things have come against us but we will keep fighting.\nSouthampton's sixth defeat in seven league matches leaves them in the bottom three on eight points - the same tally as at the same stage last term under former boss Mark Hughes - prompting questions over Hassenh\u00fcttl's desire to carry on.\n\"I have to,\" he added. \"It is my job to be strong in that moment. It is why I am here. I will try to invest everything and try to work hard and get better. I think we can play better.\"\nLeicester v Arsenal plus all Saturday's Premier League reaction\nEverton's long wait is over\nWhile Everton delivered an improved performance in their draw with Tottenham last Sunday, this felt like a pivotal day for manager Marco Silva, with this team starting the day just three points ahead of their opponents.\nA failure to win at Southampton, who were thrashed 9-0 by Leicester City in their last home game, would have only added to any pressure already being felt by the Portuguese boss.\nBut as it was, his team largely delivered another positive display even if their errant finishing handed the hosts a way back into the game.\nSigurdsson, Davies and Schneiderlin gave the Toffees control in midfield and the pace of Theo Walcott and Richarlison saw the visitors continuously carve the hosts open down the flanks.\nCenk Tosun, Davies and Sigurdsson all pressed Saints keeper Alex McCarthy into action, the only downside being Everton did not make the most of their 24 shots on goal to record a wider margin of victory.\nNo home comforts for Southampton\nWhile the boos rang out and Southampton fans threw their scarves on the pitch at full-time, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl's team could not be accused of displaying a lack of effort or spirit.\nConfidence, though, is another matter and the Austrian boss saw his side start hesitantly at St Mary's to hand the initiative to Everton.\nThey were also not helped by Cedric Soares' deployment out of position on the left, which consequently allowed Walcott to repeatedly expose Jannik Vestergaard's lack of pace.\nWith Everton sweeping forward, particularly down that side, the first 45 minutes bore a striking resemblance to their capitulation to Leicester.\nHowever, Boufal's introduction in place of Soares had a transformative effect.\nInstead of surrendering, the Saints drew level and were pressing for a vital second goal but their defensive vulnerability on the left again proved their undoing.\nSouthampton have now conceded 21 goals in their first six home Premier League games this season - that's five more than the next leakiest defence, Norwich.\nMan of the Match - Mason Holgate (Everton)\nDavies ends barren run - the stats\nSouthampton have lost four consecutive home league games at St Mary's for the very first time.\nEverton ended a run of four consecutive away losses in the Premier League, with this their first win on the road in nine attempts, previously earning all three points at West Ham in March.\nSouthampton are only the second Premier League side to earn one point or fewer from their opening six home league games in a season - the other was Birmingham in 2005-06, who were relegated.\nSouthampton have conceded 21 goals in their first six home Premier League games this season - the only top-flight side to concede more in their opening six are Blackpool in 1930-31 (22).\nEach of Southampton's last six league goals have been scored by Danny Ings and James Ward-Prowse (four for Ings and two for Ward-Prowse).\nDanny Ings has now scored 12 Premier League goals for Southampton, his most for a single club in the competition (11 for Burnley and three for Liverpool). All 26 of those goals have been scored from inside the box.\nTom Davies has scored his first Premier League goal for Everton in 553 days, with his previous strike also coming against Southampton in May 2018.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal in their next Premier League match on Saturday, 23 November (15:00 GMT). Everton host Norwich in their next Premier League fixture also on Saturday, 23 November (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 3-0 West Ham: Clarets end losing run with comfortable win\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini said his team \"need to change\" after a dispiriting 3-0 defeat at Burnley left them two places above the Premier League relegation zone.\nThe Hammers are now without a win in six league games following a poor performance that included a bizarre own goal by goalkeeper Roberto.\n\"When you concede so many easy goals it does not help,\" said Pellegrini. \"I am concerned at the easy goals we are conceding.\"\nThe Clarets were leading 1-0 through Ashley Barnes' close-range effort when a Chris Wood header was chalked off by the video assistant referee, with the New Zealand striker shown to be just offside.\nBut Wood doubled Burnley's lead just before half-time with a first-time shot, and the hosts were out of sight when Roberto turned the ball into his own net from an Ashley Westwood corner early in the second half.\n\"We need to change. We need to work hard and reverse this situation,\" Pellegrini added.\nBurnley's opener came from a corner, but West Ham's defenders were convinced that they should have had a goal-kick, claiming that the last touch before the ball went over the byeline had come off Barnes.\nAnd the hosts were celebrating what appeared to be a goal for Wood when referee Kevin Friend paused the game before overturning the effort.\nWest Ham had just one touch in the Burnley box before half-time, but seemed to be improving after the break when Roberto, who had often looked uncertain under the high ball, turned Westwood's corner behind him for the third.\nThe Spanish keeper did make some excellent saves following his error, but a bad day for West Ham saw them end the game with 10 men after substitute Manuel Lanzini was carried off with what appeared to be a shoulder injury.\nBurnley put poor run behind them\nBurnley's hard-to-beat image had taken something of a knock before West Ham's visit, with nine goals conceded in three consecutive defeats.\nManager Sean Dyche branded as \"unacceptable\" his side's performance seven days earlier in their 3-0 loss to Sheffield United, where all three goals went in before half-time, but this display at Turf Moor was a marked improvement.\nBoth full-backs were changed, with Phil Bardsley and Charlie Taylor making their first league starts of the season, but reuniting the partnership of Barnes and Wood up front gave Burnley the cutting edge they missed at Bramall Lane.\nBarnes scored his fifth of the season, and his first since 25 August, when he poked home James Tarkowski's nod-down from a corner.\nRelive Burnley v West Ham\nFollow all the Premier League action\nWood had been sorely missed during the previous two matches because of a hamstring injury, and his disallowed goal had seen him elude two defenders to expertly head home Dwight McNeil's accurate cross.\nThe pair combined well for the goal that did stand, with the impressive 19-year-old McNeil latching on to a mistake by Fabi\u00e1n Balbuena to find Wood, who shot first time past Roberto.\nThe West Ham keeper may have gifted Burnley their third, but in truth the hosts already looked to be heading for a comfortable win with centre-backs Tarkowski and Ben Mee giving the Hammers' forward line little to play with.\nMore than a bad day at the office for West Ham\nWest Ham's promising start to the season, which saw them lie in fifth in late September following a fine 2-0 win over Manchester United, is a distant memory after a day to forget.\nMuch went against them, with the disputed corner that led to the first goal followed by an injury to West Ham captain Mark Noble, forced off after 20 minutes.\nLanzini's serious-looking injury continued their misfortune, but Pellegrini's side were architects of their own problems before then.\nRoberto's slack throw out caught Balbuena off guard, with the defender then allowing McNeil in to set up Wood for Burnley's second.\nIt was a truly bizarre display by Roberto, with that throw, uncertainty at crosses and his dreadful own goal contrasted with excellent saves to deny Wood, Bardsley, Jeff Hendrick and Jack Cork to keep the score just within the bounds of respectability.\nBurnley keeper Nick Pope did not have a save to make in the first half, with West Ham failing to score in the league for the fourth time this season.\nThe international break appears to offer Pellegrini some respite, but it is followed by difficult looking fixtures against Tottenham, Chelsea, Wolves and Arsenal within 16 days.\nMan of the match - Dwight McNeil (Burnley)\n'We're conceding too easily' - Manager reaction\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"I don't know if it was an unacceptable performance. We conceded the first goal from a corner that was not a corner.\n\"When you concede so many easy goals, it does not help. I am concerned at the easy goals we are conceding. We need to change.\n\"We have 15 days and we will try to recover. The international break has come at a good time. We need to work hard and reverse this situation. It's more than just confidence - we are conceding too many goals. if you concede too many easy goals, it is very difficult to win.\"\nOn the injury to Manuel Lanzini: \"We will see what has happened with his shoulder but he will probably be out for some time.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"We were off the mark last week. From the very beginning of the game today our body language, intent and belief was there.\n\"Dwight McNeil had a tough game last week but he bounced back with a really good performance. I told him this week I'd kick him somewhere if he didn't smile more!\n\"We have picked up six points from the past five games. It doesn't sound much but when you see the teams we have played then it's not a bad return.\n\"People forget we had one bad game last week - we've actually been going along well this season.\"\nWood you believe it? The stats\nChris Wood has scored in all five of his Premier League games against West Ham, the best 100% scoring record against an opponent in the competition's history.\nBurnley have recorded consecutive top-flight victories over West Ham for the first time since October 1973.\nWest Ham have lost four of their past five Premier League games (D1), after suffering just one defeat in the 11 before that.\nAshley Barnes has hit 37 Premier League goals for Burnley, 12 more than any other player for the club.\nBurnley's Dwight McNeil registered his fourth Premier League assist of the season, a joint-high among English players along with Leicester's Harvey Barnes.\nMcNeil (four) is one of just three teenagers to assist at least four goals in Europe's big five leagues this season, alongside Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho (five) and Parma's Dejan Kulusevski (five).\nWest Ham's Roberto is the first goalkeeper to score an own goal in the Premier League since Huddersfield's Jonas L\u00f6ssl against Brighton in April 2018.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham resume after the international break at home to Tottenham on Saturday, 23 November (12.30 GMT). Later that afternoon, Burnley face struggling Watford at Vicarage Road (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham 1-1 Sheffield United: George Baldock salvages point for Blades\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said the 1-1 draw at Tottenham showed the Blades' Premier League credentials after they were \"ridiculed\" at the start of the season.\nGeorge Baldock's fortuitous equaliser saw United stretch their unbeaten league run to five games and their undefeated away record to six top-flight matches.\nBaldock's mis-hit cross - which came moments after the visitors had a goal disallowed for offside by the video assistant referee - evaded everyone inside the Spurs penalty area before finding the bottom corner.\n\"I'm proud of the players, the performance, and I thought we took the game to the opposition from the off,\" said Wilder.\n\"We feel we have identity. We've restricted world-class players to very few opportunities. I believe we were the better side today.\"\nThe visitors fell behind against the run of play when Son Heung-min capitalised on Enda Stevens' failed clearance before slotting the ball through Dean Henderson's legs.\nDavid McGoldrick thought he had equalised just two minutes after Son's opener, but VAR replays showed that Lundstram's toe had been marginally offside in the build-up - a decision that was so close it took almost four minutes to make.\n\"If they're looking at lines, magnifying it and getting it right, then fine,\" Wilder said of the disallowed goal. \"Of course the length of time is disappointing for everybody, but if it's offside, it's offside.\n\"I'm more interested in the recovery of my players, how they went for the jugular to try and get back in the game. We were ridiculed at the start of the season for how we play but we've stuck to our guns.\n\"To go into the international break undefeated shows what we're all about.\"\nThe point lifts the Blades to fifth in the table, while Spurs drop to 12th.\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League action\nRelive the action from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium\nBlades denied by VAR\nLast weekend's 3-0 win over Burnley lifted United into the top six - their highest league position since the early 1970's and five places above last season's Champions League finalists in the standings.\nOnly third-placed Leicester have conceded fewer league goals than the Blades this term - a record even more impressive when you consider Wilder's side have already faced four of the Premier League's current top-six.\nWilder, quite rightly, is keeping his players grounded with more than two-thirds of the campaign left to play, but if his team continue to display the qualities they showed at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, they should be able to stay out of trouble this season.\nNot only were the visitors defensively organised, they created several clear-cut openings from which they should have opened the scoring.\nLundstram scuffed a low Stevens cross wide from a good position before rifling Jack O'Connell's cutback against the post with Spurs keeper Paulo Gazzaniga beaten.\nAfter the break Lys Mousset drilled a low shot inches wide of the far post before McGoldrick's disallowed strike, which VAR eventually chalked off because Lundstram's toe was adjudged to have been in front of a Spurs defender's kneecap.\nThere was a lengthy delay as the video replay officials scrutinised the evidence, zooming in and drawing a multitude of lines on the screen, before informing the referee it was no goal, to the delight of the home fans.\nBaldock's equaliser may have been fortunate, but a draw was the least Wilder and his players deserved.\nPlenty to ponder for Pochettino\nTottenham's 4-0 Champions League victory at Red Star Belgrade in midweek served as the perfect antidote to a difficult few days for Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino and his players.\nSon, who was involved in the incident that led to Everton midfielder Andre Gomes' horrific ankle injury at Goodison Park, scored twice in a comfortable win which boosted Spurs' hopes of reaching the knockout stages of the competition.\nAnd once again Son was Spurs' liveliest player on Saturday. He had his side's first shot on target - which came nine minutes into the second half - but Henderson got down low to his left to palm the effort away.\nHe then capitalised on Stevens' error and drilled home his eighth of the season, via the tiniest of deflections, under the Blades keeper.\nHowever, the South Korean's performance did little to mask the shortcomings of Pochettino's side, who gifted the visitors possession on numerous occasions.\nThe Blades failed to capitalise on their hosts' generosity until 12 minutes from time, when Baldock's cross-shot found its way into the far corner.\nThe result means Spurs remain without a win in the league since beating Southampton at home on 28 September.\n\"The most difficult thing for us was to match their energy,\" said Pochettino. \"In the second half we were much better and matched them. I think they deserve one point.\n\"The reality is that, for different reasons, we are not showing the performances that we expect. The team is in a period where we are finding the best balance.\n\"I need to look forward and keep working and try to improve. We are not in a good position in the table.\"\nMan of the match - George Baldock (Sheffield United)\nBlades stay unbeaten on the road - the stats\nSheffield United are only the third newly-promoted side to avoid defeat in each of their opening six away games in a Premier League season, after Blackburn Rovers (first 8 in 1992-93) and Nottingham Forest (first six in 1994-95).\nTottenham's tally of 14 points is their lowest after 12 games to a Premier League season since 2008-09 (12).\nTottenham have lost more points from winning positions than any other Premier League side this season (12).\nSheffield United are unbeaten in 15 away league games (W5 D10), a run stretching back to January of last season, equalling their club record previously set in April 2009 (also 15 away league games unbeaten).\nTottenham failed to register a single shot on target in the first half of a Premier League game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first time, and the first in any home league match since January against Man Utd at Wembley.\nSon Heung-Min has scored five goals in his last five games for Tottenham in all competitions, as many as he had in his previous 18 appearances for the club combined beforehand.\nGeorge Baldock scored his first goal in 38 appearances in all competitions for Sheffield United since finding the net against Swansea City in the Championship in August 2018, one year and 97 days ago.\n'We are not showing the performances that we expect' - what the managers said\nTottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to the BBC: \"It was an even game, difficult for us - they are a very good, organised team. It was difficult to play in the first half. We were better in the second half, but overall it's a fair result.\n\"We knew very well how they play, they got a draw at Chelsea and they are playing so well. The most difficult thing for us was to match their energy.\"\nOn the disallowed goal: \"It happened with us against Leicester, similar to today. This type of situation is difficult to talk about but I think in every single fixture we are talking about the VAR.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder, speaking to the BBC: \"We defend from the front, we all have jobs to do. You know that they will, through natural ability and talent, create, but we stuck in there.\"\nOn the disallowed goal: \"The thing I didn't get is the reset - I thought it would get reset and then away you go for the second phase.\"\nWhat's next?\nSpurs travel to London rivals West Ham United after the international break on Saturday, 23 November (12:30 GMT), while the Blades welcome Manchester United to Bramall Lane on Sunday, 24 November (16:30)."

We are working very, very well. We will just concentrate on our performance levels until 10 games to go and assess it then.\n\"I came here to make an impact and create something that we can hopefully sustain over a number of years.\"\nArsenal, meanwhile, are now eight points off the top four and are without a win in the Premier League since beating Bournemouth 1-0 on 6 October.\nArsenal can recover from difficult start to season - Emery\nReaction to Leicester's win over Arsenal\nFree-scoring Foxes always find a way\nEighteen months ago, former Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis hailed the arrival of Emery as a coach who \"plays an exciting, progressive style of football that fits Arsenal perfectly\".\nThat description was certainly accurate about one of the teams on the pitch at King Power Stadium on Saturday, but it was not Emery's side.\nThe Foxes possess a clear identity and a togetherness that appears to be absent from this current Gunners side who, apart from occasional flashes, rarely troubled their opponents.\nLeicester dominated possession from the outset and even though they missed a number of decent chances - Ayoze P\u00e9rez firing just over after capitalising on a defensive error and Maddison putting a free-kick on the roof of the net - there was always the sense that the Foxes would find a way through.\nSo it proved in the second half as they scored the sort of goal that Arsenal teams of the past did with regularity - Barnes picked out Tielemans with a clever backheel and the midfielder immediately found Vardy at the far post where the in-form striker made no mistake.\nFrom then there was only going to be one outcome as Leicester eased to a fourth successive Premier League win.\nRodgers has been linked with replacing Emery at Arsenal, but given where the two clubs are in the table and in terms of form, it is hard to see why he would consider a move to Emirates Stadium.\nPressure mounting on Emery after another blow\nIt has certainly been a tough season for Arsenal boss Emery, both on and off the pitch.\nHe has faced criticism for the way he has handled the much-maligned Mesut \u00d6zil, while it remains to be seen how the decision to remove the captaincy from Granit Xhaka will affect an Arsenal team that already appears to be struggling with confidence.\nAll this has been happening alongside inconsistent performances on the pitch and this was a game Emery really needed to win to relieve some of the pressure on himself.\nThe Gunners had drawn their last four games in all competitions, letting slip a lead in each of those fixtures and in an effort to combat that and also stifle the threat of Vardy, Emery employed a three-man defence for the first time in the league this season.\nArsenal certainly kept their shape better than in recent games but they still lacked conviction in their play, with misplaced passes from the back gifting Leicester chances on a couple of occasions.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang had an effort ruled out for offside but ultimately Arsenal did not show enough of an attacking threat as they finished the game with just a solitary shot on target.\nThis was their 50th league game under Emery and they have won 87 points, one fewer than they won in their final 50 games under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.\nMan of the match - James Maddison (Leicester)\n'Vardy up there with the best strikers in Europe' - manager reaction\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"The way it's been going for a period of time now, it's nice because the players know they have the qualities to win any game against any opposition.\n\"You're playing against a top team with really good players, so you have to be patient but we showed real quality to break through. A very, very important three points.\n\"He [Vardy] is up there with the very, very top strikers in European football with what he brings to a team, his pressing. We've allowed him to do essentially what he wants to do - he's so honest, he'd press the whole back four if he could.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"In the end, a bad result but we did our gameplan, thinking right in the moment and we did that and when they scored the first goal was the moment maybe.\n\"Before the first goal I think we were in the match and in the second half we started to push in and create chances but they are in a good moment and they won.\n\"The second half we started better, we were pushing and showing we wanted to win. They work very well, the players felt comfortable and defended good and we had chances. With Mesut \u00d6zil we keep the ball sometimes like we want and it is the way to carry on.\n\"I am sure we are going to improve after that [the international break]. I think we need to achieve, at home, confidence and to be strong at home. We didn't lose [many games] but we draw so much, that's what's important for the table, but I think we can achieve the balance to be strong and get better in these matches.\"\nLeicester better than 2016 - the best stats\nLeicester have won three consecutive top-flight home games against Arsenal for the first time in their history.\nLeicester have won five Premier League home games in a row for only the second time, last doing so in May 2017 under Craig Shakespeare.\nArsenal had just one shot on target in this match, with that effort coming in the 20th minute from Alexandre Lacazette.\nArsenal are winless in their last five Premier League away games since beating Newcastle 1-0 on the opening weekend (D2 L3).\nLeicester's haul of 26 points from their 12 Premier League games this season is their most ever at this stage of a top-flight campaign, and one more than they had in their title winning season of 2015-16.\nArsenal's record of 17 points and -1 goal difference is their worst start to a top-flight season after 12 games since 1982-83 (15 points). They also had 17 points in 2014-15, but had goal difference of +5.\nLeicester's Jamie Vardy has scored nine goals in his nine Premier League starts against Arsenal - in Premier League history, only Wayne Rooney (12), Robbie Fowler (10) and Harry Kane (10) have scored more against the Gunners.\nVardy is the top Premier League goalscorer so far this season (11), as well as being the top scorer in the competition in 2019 (23).\nWhat next?\nA trip to Brighton is next for Leicester with the sides meeting at Amex Stadium on Saturday, 23 November (15:00 GMT), while Arsenal host Southampton at the same time."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 3-1 Brighton: United go seventh after comfortable win over Brighton\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer described Manchester United's 3-1 win over Brighton as \"their best performance of the season\".\nMidfielder Andreas Pereira and striker Marcus Rashford scored either side of a Davy Propper own goal to give United their biggest home Premier League triumph since August and move them into seventh place, their highest position for two months.\nRashford should have had another but inexplicably fired Daniel James' cross wide of an open goal.\nBrighton keeper Mat Ryan saved from James and Brazilian midfielder Fred, before denying what would have been a memorable solo effort from Anthony Martial.\nSolskjaer added: \"It was exhilarating and entertaining. How we didn't end up with five, six or seven I don't know.\"\nAfter their 3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday, it was the first time United had scored six in two games since March and extended a run of five wins in six games in all competitions since a 1-1 draw with Liverpool.\n\"If we don't get confidence from this, I don't know what to tell them,\" added Solskjaer.\nThe victory came at a cost, though, as midfielder Scott McTominay had to be carried down the tunnel on a stretcher after falling awkwardly and will have a scan on his injured ankle on Monday.\nIt was a familiar story for Brighton, who have never won at Old Trafford and never looked like breaking that sequence and allowed Rashford to restore the hosts' two-goal cushion two minutes after Lewis Dunk's header had given them hope.\nOle's faith in youth\nTwo years ago, respective managers Solskjaer and Graham Potter were operating in very different surroundings.\nSolskjaer had been managing Molde against Kristiansund in the Norwegian League, while Potter was competing in Sweden's equivalent for Ostersunds FK against Jonkopings Sodra.\nPotter has been having a better time of it than Solskjaer this season but amid a number of disappointing results, the United boss was getting credit for the number of youngsters he has put his faith in this season.\nToday was another example, with a side that with an average age of 23 years and 350 days was United's youngest since a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in May 2017.\nWith skipper Ashley Young suspended, Solskjaer picked 19-year-old Brandon Williams for his full Premier League debut rather than rely on the experience of Marcos Rojo, who had performed well in Thursday's Europa League win against Partizan Belgrade.\nWilliams' presence meant Harry Maguire's selection as skipper ahead of David de Gea was almost overlooked. The standing ovation the youngster received at the end proof Solskjaer had been right with his choice.\nFred reborn\nBrazilian midfielder Fred has been heavily criticised since his \u00a347m move from Shakhtar Donetsk in the summer of 2018.\nMany have questioned whether he has the ability to be a United player and there has been suggestions former manager Jose Mourinho only agreed to his arrival because he was desperate for midfield reinforcements and feared if Fred did not move to Old Trafford, he would get no-one.\nEven Solskjaer has seemed uncertain about Fred's capabilities.\nYet, almost from nowhere, he has turned into a central figure.\nFor the first time for United, he has started five successive Premier League games and this performance - efficient and energetic - was one of his best.\nIt was Fred who gently coaxed teenager Williams forward in the early moments of his first top-flight start. It was Fred who found midfield partner McTominay with an impudent back-heeled pass and Fred who sought advice from coach Kieran McKenna during a break in play, showing that his grasp of English is better than some would have you believe.\nHe might have had his first goal of the season too had Brighton keeper Ryan not fumbled his long-range shot onto the bar after half-time.\nBrighton still find the 'big six' tough\nInside the Brighton camp, they feel strongly that the decision to sack Chris Hughton at the end of last season has been vindicated, even if it was criticised externally.\nPotter has installed a passing game which is more fluid and better to watch than what went before.\nIn the whole of 2018-19, they managed 216 sequences of 10 or more passes, an average of 5.7 per game. Before their trip to Old Trafford, they had already registered 119 such sequences this season, an average of 10.8 per match and taking them from 17th to seventh best in the division in that particular metric.\nYet points are the only real currency in the harsh arena of Premier League combat and, for Brighton, trips to the 'big six' remain a problem. They face high-flying Leicester next, but will do so without Dunk, who will be suspended following his fifth booking of the season.\nUnder Hughton, 11 such visits over the past two seasons ended in defeat - a single draw at Arsenal on 5 May breaking the sequence. So far this term, it's three defeats from visits to Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United, and only a single goal to show for Brighton's efforts.\nThis failure meant Brighton were unable to claim the victory that would have taken them fifth, a position which would have represented the highest spot they had occupied in their history.\nMan of the match - Fred (Manchester United)\n'A joy to watch' - managers' reactions\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaking to Match of the Day: \"We should have scored many more goals.\n\"It was an excellent performance from the lads, when you see them going forward it is a joy to watch.\n\"Anthony Martial did not get a goal but he was outstanding. Brandon Williams was excellent too - he has had some good games already and he seems he wants to be out there and enjoy himself.\n\"The table does not really matter at the moment, we need to keep improving and keep winning games and see where it takes us.\"\nBrighton manager Graham Potter, also to Match of the Day: \"They deserved to win the game, if you make any mistake they can turn defence into attack so quickly.\n\"The players gave their best, but sometimes you have to accept you are playing against a better team. We had a decent period in the league and now we need to get ready for another tough match.\n\"They key moment for us was when we went 2-1 down despite not being much in the game, if we could have kept that score for longer it could have made a difference but United responded scoring the third goal so early in transition.\"\nHome comforts for United - the stats\nManchester United are unbeaten in their last seven games at Old Trafford across all competitions (W4 D3 L0), their longest run under the same manager since March 2018, when they went eight without defeat under Jose Mourinho.\nBrighton haven't won any of their 15 Premier League away games against \"big six\" opposition (W0 D1 L14), scoring just four goals and conceding 33 in return.\nDavy Propper's own goal saw Manchester United take a 2-0 lead in the 19th minute (18:50); the quickest they've been 2-0 up in a Premier League game at Old Trafford since May 2017 against Crystal Palace (18:15).\nSince the start of the 2017-18 season, Brighton have scored more own goals than any other team in the Premier League (7).\nMarcus Rashford scored his 30th goal for Manchester United at Old Trafford, with six of those having come in 2019-20 - only in 2017-18 has he netted more home goals in a single season for the club (nine).\nManchester United forward Anthony Martial has been directly involved in eight goals in his last 10 starts at Old Trafford across all competitions, scoring four and providing four assists.\nBrandon Williams became only the second player born in the 2000s to start a Premier League match for Manchester United, following Mason Greenwood.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton's next game is against top-four contenders Leicester City at Amex Stadium on 23 November (15:00 GMT). Manchester United play at Sheffield United the following day (16:30 GMT)."

You can't give any team a 45 minute head start and all I took from the first half was we were only 1-0 down.\n\"In the second half we got a better performance but it didn't take much to achieve that.\"\nWolves, who climbed from 15th up to eighth, to move into the top half of the Premier League for the first time since the opening weekend, were always in control.\nInside a raucous Molineux, Nuno Espirito Santo's side repeatedly carved the visitors open, but had to wait until the stroke of half-time to open the scoring.\nJoao Moutinho's clever free-kick, deceived the Villa defence and allowed Ruben Neves to whip a right-foot effort into the bottom right corner from 18-yards.\nAdama Traore went close to adding a second for the hosts after the break, while Brazilian forward Wesley curled Villa's best chance over.\nRaul Jimenez and Diogo Jota also missed good opportunities before Jimenez's sweeping right-foot shot confirmed Wolves first top-flight win over Villa since 1978.\nLive text commentary of all Sunday's Premier League action\nTraore terrorises former employers\nThis was another performance that suggested Wolves are now up and running after their slow start to the season.\nAlready on the brink of reaching the Europa League knockout stages, Nuno's side are now unbeaten in seven Premier League matches and were worthy winners against out-of-sorts opponents.\nIt was one-way traffic in the first half as Jota, Jimenez and Matt Doherty all failed to convert chances that could have put the hosts out of sight by the interval.\nWith the game being played almost exclusively in the Villa half the visitors did not manage an effort on goal until the half-hour mark.\n\"We played very well, we dominated the game, especially in the first half. I'm happy with the performance and atmosphere,\" said Nuno.\n\"We're happy because we made the second goal and could have made more.\"\nAnother feature throughout was the sight of Adama Traore, who has been called up to the Spain squad, terrorising the Villa defence.\nThe 23-year-old, who scored in his one and only start during his time at Villa Park, repeatedly skipped past Matt Targett and his replacement Neil Taylor.\nTraore's searing pace also created Jimenez's decisive second goal, with the winger eluding Douglas Luiz, before picking out the Mexican on the left-side of the penalty area.\nIt capped a fine individual display from Traore, who is now beginning to fulfil the potential he exhibited in Barcelona's 'La Masia' youth system.\nVilla flatter to deceive\nAston Villa made the 20-mile trip to Molineux looking to do a double over Wolves having knocked their local rivals out of the Carabao Cup 11 days ago.\nHowever, they delivered a disjointed and disappointing performance and struggled to gain any sort of foothold in the game until the final quarter.\nThe absence of the injured Heaton and defender Bj\u00f6rn Engels were keenly felt at the back, while without Grealish, their was a distinct lack of spark to their attacking.\nJohn McGinn struggled to impose himself in midfield, while Marvelous Nakamba was a peripheral figure and was later replaced by Henri Lansbury.\nThey were also not helped by an early injury to replacement goalkeeper, Jed Steer, which saw Norwegian Orjan Nyland, make his first appearance for almost 12 months.\nWhile Trezeguet did offer some threat down the flank, the Egyptian did not come to the fore until Villa were chasing an equaliser late in the game.\nMan of the match - Adama Traore (Wolves)\nFortress Molineux - the stats\nWolves picked up their first top-flight home victory against Aston Villa in 10 games (W1 D3 L6), since a 3-1 win in May 1978.\nWolves have only lost one of their past 14 Premier League home games (W8 D5), a 2-5 loss to Chelsea in September.\nAston Villa have only kept one clean sheet in their last 24 Premier League matches on the road, a 0-0 draw with West Brom in January 2016.\nRuben Neves has now scored 14 goals for Wolves in all competitions, with 11 of those coming from outside the box.\nAmong Premier League players, only Raheem Sterling (14) has scored more goals in all competitions this season than Wolves' Raul Jimenez (13), who netted on his 50th Premier League appearance.\nSince the start of last season, Joao Moutinho has provided more Premier League assists than any other Wolves player (11). In fact, only Matt Jarvis (13) and Kevin Doyle (12) have registered more assists in Premier League history for Wolves than Moutinho (11).\nAston Villa's Jed Steer made only his second Premier League appearance (which lasted just eight minutes), 1,631 days after his first in May 2015 (v Burnley) - it's the largest gap between two appearances for a Villa player in the competition's history.\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith is winless in five league meetings with Wolves (D1 L4), since defeating them 3-0 as Brentford manager in a Championship tie in February 2016.\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to Bournemouth for their next Premier League match on Saturday 23 November (15:00 GMT). Aston Villa resume their Premier League duties at home to Newcastle on Monday 25 November (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-1 Man City: Reds go nine clear of champions with fine win\nLiverpool struck a potentially decisive blow in the Premier League title race as victory over reigning champions Manchester City at Anfield opened up an eight-point lead at the top of the table.\nThe confrontation between the two domestic superpowers had been billed as a defining moment in Liverpool's 30-year quest to land the title - and this outcome leaves them with a commanding advantage over Leicester City in second place.\nLiverpool took the lead after only six minutes when Fabinho flashed a 25-yard drive past keeper Claudio Bravo, deputising for injured Ederson, the goal given after a video assistant referee check for handball against Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nManchester City were threatening in possession but J\u00fcrgen Klopp's team are ruthless in attack, as proved when Mohamed Salah doubled their lead six minutes later, heading in at the far post from Andrew Robertson's superb cross.\nRaheem Sterling missed a headed chance and Sergio Ag\u00fcero saw a shot deflected on to the post as City tried to find a foothold but it was all over six minutes after the break when Jordan Henderson's pinpoint delivery lured Bravo into a critical moment of hesitation and Sadio Man\u00e9 headed in.\nBernardo Silva pulled one back with 12 minutes left but it was too late for City, who will rue not making the most of their plentiful possession and opportunities as they now lie nine points off the top in fourth place.\nGuardiola was fuming at the final whistle, appearing to thank referee Michael Oliver sarcastically before leaving the pitch, shortly after being enraged when another penalty claim against Alexander-Arnold was waved away.\nLiverpool, meanwhile, celebrated a victory that gives them a real hold at the Premier League summit.\n'They keep telling me it's not over' - Peter Crouch analysis\nWas this the 21 seconds that swung the title?\n'A statement win that leaves Liverpool looking unstoppable' - Phil McNulty\nI don't know if we can catch Liverpool, says Guardiola\nHow the players rated\nLiverpool's title to lose\nThe manner in which Klopp and Anfield celebrated this victory said everything about its magnitude - if self-belief was not surging through them before, then it surely is now after last season's champions were overcome.\nA huge roar went up from the Kop as Liverpool's players gathered in front of it after the final whistle. Such is their form this season, with 11 wins from 12 league games, that it is surely their title to lose now. This is a team who have lost one of their past 51 league games - where will the numerous slips needed for them to lose this lead come from?\nLiverpool's defence was actually seriously troubled by City, but Klopp's side can score from anywhere at any time makes them so dangerous - as it proved here.\nCity opened well but were stunned by Fabinho's superb strike and once Robertson provided that terrific arcing cross for Salah, Liverpool were in control of what may well come to be seen as a pivotal moment in the season.\nLiverpool were relieved when City missed what opportunities they had and the scoreline was flattering - but Klopp and his players will not care.\nThey have game-changers in all areas of the pitch and carry an ominous threat even when under pressure.\nThere is a growing sense of destiny about Liverpool's season, although they will still look in the direction of Brendan Rodgers' excellent Leicester City side and Chelsea after seeing off Manchester City at an exultant Anfield.\nManchester City miss their chance\nPep Guardiola's touchline rage late in the game, after referee Michael Oliver had ignored another claim for handball against Alexander-Arnold, was a mirror into his mood.\nGuardiola will know this may well be the moment when a third successive Premier League title was pushed out of reach.\nYet he will also feel City had the chance to take something from this match, with chances created and missed, especially by Sterling and Ag\u00fcero.\nThis was not a poor performance but City's defence is vulnerable without Aymeric Laporte and the loss of Ederson to injury not only robbed them of his outstanding goalkeeping ability but also his important contribution to their overall possession game.\nBravo was not at fault for Liverpool's first two goals but he was suspect for the third. He simply does not give off the assurance and confidence of City's Brazilian first choice.\nDavid Silva's midfield influence was also missed but the bottom line is that over the season so far Liverpool have looked the more driven and less flawed team, a fact reflected in the league table.\nManchester City and Guardiola will not give up the fight, as it is only November after all, but it looks a long way back now to catch a Liverpool team that will feel the force is with them.\nMan of the match - Fabinho (Liverpool)\n'What a game' - manager reaction\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking on BBC 5 Live: \"What a game. If you want to win against City you have to do something special and we had to be intense.\n\"When City started to control it more in the last 15 minutes, it was tense, but then you saw the quality and what the boys can do it. The boys did 75 minutes of unbelievable stuff.\"\nOn the early VAR incident, when a handball claim against Trent Alexander-Arnold was rejected: \"I feel sympathy for Pep but I did not see the situation, what I heard is that the ball hit first David Silva's arm and then Trent Alexander-Arnold.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking on BBC 5 Live: \"We lost - we'd liked to win but now we have to rest and prepare for Chelsea next.\n\"We played an incredible performance, I don't know how many teams can come to this stadium and play the way we did. They scored with the first shot on target, but we played incredibly well.\n\"There are three teams that have more chances to win the Premier League than us. We're in November so let's see what happens.\"\nAnfield continues its hold over Man City - the stats\nLiverpool have won 11 of their first 12 Premier League games this season and lead the table by eight points - only Manchester United in 1993-94 have had a bigger lead after 12 games of a Premier League season (nine points).\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola has lost eight matches in all competitions against Jurgen Klopp - three more than he has against any other manager.\nGuardiola has lost more away games at Anfield against Liverpool than he has at any other ground in all competitions (four defeats).\nThis is the fewest points Guardiola has won through his first 12 top-flight league matches of a season (25), and the first time he has been more than three points behind the top of the table at this stage of the season (nine points currently).\nThis was the second time this season that City have conceded three goals in a Premier League game (also 3-2 against Norwich) - they only did so once last season, losing 3-2 to Crystal Palace in December 2018.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 17 home Premier League games against Manchester City (W12 D5 L0) since losing 2-1 in May 2003.\nMohamed Salah has been involved in 69 goals in 60 appearances at Anfield for Liverpool in all competitions (51 goals, 18 assists), scoring in three of his four home appearances against Manchester City in that time.\nFabinho's goal was Liverpool's ninth from outside the box in all competitions this season - more than any other Premier League side.\nSince August 2018, Sadio Man\u00e9 has scored 22 Premier League goals at Anfield for Liverpool - more than any other player has scored at a single venue in that time.\nManchester City conceded twice in the opening 15 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time since December 2016 against Leicester City.\nSince the start of last season, only Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser (16) has provided more Premier League assists than Liverpool full-back Andrew Robertson (15).\nThis was Sergio Ag\u00fcero's ninth match at Anfield against Liverpool in all competitions for Manchester City - he has never scored there for City, attempting 14 shots without success across those nine games.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to south London to play Crystal Palace on Saturday, 23 November at 15:00 GMT, while City are at home to Chelsea at 17:30 later that afternoon."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Jose Mourinho leads Tottenham to win at West Ham\nJose Mourinho enjoyed a winning start as Tottenham manager with a 3-2 London derby triumph over West Ham at London Stadium.\nFirst-half goals from Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura and a third from Harry Kane four minutes after the break gave Tottenham their first Premier League away win since 20 January.\nIt was about as comfortable as Mourinho could have hoped for after a tumultuous week, in which he replaced Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked by Daniel Levy less than six months after guiding the club to the first Champions League final in their history.\nThe result piles pressure on West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, whose side have now collected two points from their last seven games.\nUnder-fire keeper Roberto made an error for Son's opener and the hosts were booed off at half-time.\nLate goals from substitute Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna gave the final scoreline a flattering look, but the result made a mockery of an ill-advised post from West Ham's social media team following Mourinho's appointment, highlighting previous difficulties the 56-year-old has endured at London Stadium.\n'It's not about me', says Mourinho after Spurs win his first game in charge\nFollow reaction - plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nA comfortable start for Mourinho\nIn the build-up to the game, Mourinho indicated there would be no massive changes to a side that, for the first five years of Pochettino's reign, have been used to challenging for honours, even if they have never actually won any.\nAlthough Mourinho's first in-match conversation with Son was to remind the South Korean of players behind him who needed marking, evidently, his strength is going forward.\nSon's shot for Tottenham's opener was fierce enough. But the ball was close enough to Roberto as it flashed past the West Ham keeper for him to make a more passable attempt to keep it out.\nIt was raw pace that allowed Son to stride forward into open space and cross for Moura to covert the visitors' second.\nMourinho greeted the opener with a celebratory punch towards the ground. His reaction to the second was far more businesslike, screaming at his players, then shouting at Toby Alderweireld when he was ignored, to deliver an instruction to do with team shape.\nThree hundred and forty two days after his last match as a manager - and another derby of sorts - this was about as far removed from Manchester United's 3-1 defeat at Liverpool as it was possible to get.\nKane's 11th Spurs goal of the season came a minute after Moura had fluffed a chance to finish off a length-of-the-field break.\nThere were no more goals but plenty of instructions from Mourinho, who, as he strolled calmly towards the bench at the final whistle, will know there are much harder days than this to come.\nThe Eriksen conundrum\nMourinho's first team selection was followed by his first warning, to midfielder Christian Eriksen, who he left on the bench.\nUncertainty over Eriksen's future has been one of the dark clouds hanging over Tottenham since the Champions League final. Out of contract next summer and out of sorts on the pitch, Mourinho dismissed a pre-match question about continuity being the reason for the Dane's absence by stating that he needed to know \"what is in his mind and his heart\".\nMourinho has never been one for accepting passengers on his managerial journey and evidently, he is not about to start now.\nEriksen is not on his own in having an uncertain future.\nCentral defenders Alderweireld, who gave an assured performance here, and Jan Vertonghen are out of contract at the end of the season. Danny Rose has a deal which runs to 2021 but the England man has already said the chances of him signing an extension are zero.\nYet Eriksen feels like the key. So influential in Tottenham's success down the years, it does not seem to be a coincidence that his club's form has collapsed at the same time as his.\nHis introduction for Dele Alli 13 minutes from time underlines Eriksen has not been excluded from Mourinho's plans. But how the new Spurs boss deals with that situation may prove pivotal in whether Tottenham clamber back into the fight for a Champions League place or linger in mid-table for the rest of the campaign.\nPellegrini's problems\nIf this day was to be all about Mourinho, West Ham fans used it as an excuse to turn on their own.\nGoalkeeper Roberto was in the firing line. From the moment he came for a punch and missed it, home fans baited the former Malaga keeper repeatedly.\nIronic cheers accompanied the simplest of kicks and catches. Confidence in the Spaniard, who has conceded three times in each of his last three games, is at rock bottom.\nThe ire goes beyond that. Carlos Sanchez' introduction for Issa Diop - a move designed to give Declan Rice some time in central defence given a fifth yellow card means Diop is banned for next weekend's trip to Chelsea - was greeted by loud boos.\nThe word from West Ham following their hammering at Burnley a fortnight ago was that Pellegrini would be given more time. After this, there will be fresh doubt about that.\nEvents of the last week prove no manager is safe after a run of bad results.\nMan of the match: Son Heung-min\nMatch stats - Mourinho's debut streak\nHaving lost his first ever competitive game as manager, with Benfica in September 2000, Jose Mourinho has gone unbeaten in his first game in charge at each of his eight clubs since, including two different spells with Chelsea (W5 D3).\nMourinho won as many points in this game as Mauricio Pochettino mustered in his final 12 away Premier League games with Tottenham (W0 D3 L9).\nWest Ham have picked up just two points from their last 21 available in the Premier League (W0 D2 L5).\nTottenham have won three consecutive away league games against West Ham for the first time in their history.\nAll four of Michail Antonio's Premier League goals for West Ham against Spurs have come at different venues - Upton Park, White Hart Lane, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and London Stadium.\nAntonio is one of four players to score at four different venues for a single club against a single opponent in the Premier League, alongside Steed Malbranque (Fulham v Manchester City), Dele Alli (Tottenham v Watford) and Christian Eriksen (Tottenham v Everton).\nTottenham's Harry Kane has scored eight goals in his last nine Premier League games against West Ham. Indeed, Kane has scored 29 goals in 46 Premier League London derbies - only Thierry Henry (43), Teddy Sheringham (32) and Frank Lampard (32) have netted more.\nKane has now scored 175 goals in 269 appearances for Tottenham - only Jimmy Greaves (266) and Bobby Smith (208) have netted more.\nSon Heung-min (19) is Tottenham's leading goalscorer in all competitions in 2019, netting one more than Kane (18) this calendar year.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham are next in action at Chelsea in another London derby on Saturday, 30 November (15:00 GMT). Tottenham host Olympiakos in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00) before a home Premier League game against Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00)."

A trip to north London to face Jose Mourinho's Tottenham.\nMan of the match - Joao Moutinho (Wolves)\nWolves continue scoring run - the stats\nWolves are unbeaten in their last eight Premier League games, their longest run in the top flight since February 1974.\nOnly Liverpool (22) have scored in more consecutive Premier League games than Wolves (12).\nEight of Bournemouth's 16 Premier League goals this season have come from set-pieces (excluding penalties), the highest share in the division (50%).\nBournemouth have been shown seven red cards in the Premier League since they were promoted in 2015 - four of them have been for Simon Francis.\nMoutinho's goal was the fourth direct free-kick Wolves have scored in the Premier League - with three of them coming in the last two seasons.\nRaul Jimenez has scored in all three of his Premier League appearances for Wolves against Bournemouth.\nSince the start of last season, Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser has provided more assists than any other player in the Premier League (17).\n'We deserved something' - what the managers said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to Sky Sports: \"In the first half we weren't particularly good.\n\"They scored from two set plays and we're disappointed with the second one. The first one was sensational, but we're not very pleased with the second - we should have defended that one much better.\n\"In the second half, we were down to 10 men but I thought we were excellent. Arguably we deserved to get something from the game.\"\nWolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"The first half was really good. It was a reference for us. We've played a lot of games already and this was a dangerous one.\n\"What happened in the second half must serve as a warning to us. It was very difficult. Bournemouth showed a lot of character, with a lot of set-pieces and long balls.\n\"Eddie and his players are amazing. They've done a brilliant job.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in their next league game on Saturday, 30 November (15:00 GMT)\nA point against Sporting Braga on Thursday, 28 November (17:55) will secure Wolves' place in the Europa League knockout stages.

They didn't create anything and it was really hard for us when they scored with the first time they shot. Craig Dawson was leading the defensive line and losing him was difficult for us.\"\nSean Dyche: \"In the first half we were miles off. We had a word at half-time and we set out in a different manner in the second half.\n\"I was surprised the penalty was not given in the first place but I think that is what VAR is for and they made the right decision.\"\nChris Wood: \"It is important to get a win and we had to dig deep with a solid performance. Our defence has been top class and that's what we built the result on.\"\nThe stats - Watford's struggles continue\nWatford have won just once in their last 17 Premier League games (W1 D6 L10), and once in nine games since Sanchez Flores returned to the club.\nThe Hornets have picked up just eight points from their 13 Premier League games this season - their lowest return at this stage of a top-flight season.\nBurnley's 3-0 win is their joint-biggest away victory in the Premier League, alongside 4-1 v Hull in 2010 and 3-0 v West Ham in 2018.\nAshley Barnes has scored 15 Premier League goals in 2019 - more than any other Burnley player in 2019 (Chris Wood has 14).\nWood has scored six goals in his last six Premier League appearances, as many as he'd bagged in his previous 19 in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nWatford face a vital game against fellow strugglers Southampton at St Mary's next Saturday (17:30 GMT). Burnley return to Turf Moor to take on Crystal Palace earlier that day (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-2 Southampton\nArsenal's winless run continued as they drew against Southampton to increase the pressure on manager Unai Emery.\nThe result leaves the Gunners in seventh, nine points worse off than at the corresponding stage last term, while the Saints remain 19th.\nEmery's side, who were second best throughout, were booed off at the final whistle after delivering a disjointed performance which suggests they may struggle to compete for a place in the top four this season.\nDanny Ings' early goal had put the visitors in front, with the forward catching the home defence asleep to race onto Ryan Bertrand's free-kick and score with a right-foot shot from close range.\nThat set the tone for what was to follow, with the visitors wasting several good chances to extend their lead before Alexandre Lacazette turned in a close-range equaliser.\nThe goal did little to kick-start Arsenal though, who fell behind for a second time when James Ward-Prowse scored on the rebound after seeing his second-half penalty saved by home goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\nNot even Lacazette's second goal of the day, which came late in stoppage time, could raise spirits at the Emirates, with the forward appearing embarrassed to celebrate.\nPressure mounts on Emery\nPrior to Saturday's games respective managers Unai Emery and Ralph Hassenhuttl shared the unenviable tag of being the bookmakers' joint favourites to be the next Premier League manager dismissed.\nHowever, while Southampton's dreadful record in north London suggested they could be ideal opponents for Emery to alleviate some of the pressure on him, things did not go to plan for the Arsenal boss or his team.\nAnd until Lacazette's late goal, his 24th at home of his 31 Premier League goals, his side had appeared likely to slip to a first home defeat against the Saints since 1987.\nThat was largely due to familiar failings once again resurfacing, with Southampton's pressing game and ability to bypass the Arsenal midfield clearly evident.\nThey were also not helped by Emery's deployment of a three-man defence of Sokratis Papastathopoulos, David Luiz and Calum Chambers.\nThe trio were repeatedly pulled apart by the pace of Ings and Southampton's 19-year-old Republic of Ireland forward, Michael Obafemi.\nObafemi's early dart away from Sokratis served as a warning, while Chambers' withdrawal at the interval appeared to be an admission that Emery had got his tactics wrong.\nWhile the introduction of club record signing Nicolas Pepe did at least spark their attacking play, they always remained vulnerable in defence and were fortunate to escape with a point.\nNasty Saints return\nRalph Hasenhuttl had called on his team to become \"nasty\" again in the prelude to this match and his team appeared to have heeded those words with a performance brimming with energy.\nThe Austrian felt his team had been too passive in their opening 12 games of the season, so Stuart Armstrong's first-minute attempt on goal - coming after they had pressed Kieran Tierney into a mistake - would have been a welcome sight.\nAnd they maintained that intensity throughout, stifling Arsenal's attempts to play out from defence, which in part, contributed to their 21 shots on goal compared to the Gunners' 12.\nIngs and Obafemi were the triggers for much of that work, though Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Ward-Prowse, Nathan Redmond and Armstrong also featured prominently.\nFor large parts of the game there was also a resoluteness about their defending which had been absent so far this season.\nThey may still have the worst defensive record in the Premier League, but this represented a marked improvement, with Jan Bednarek playing a central role in that with seven clearances, more than any other player.\nThe only negative for Hasenhuttl - who looked distraught to have not claimed all three points - was his side's failure to convert any of half a dozen excellent chances to put the game beyond the hosts.\nSubstitute Moussa Djenepo was particularly at fault, twice failing to score from close range in the closing stages.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League action\nLive text coverage of the match at the Emirates Stadium\nMan of the Match - Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Southampton)\n'My job is to find the solution' - what they said\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"We will take one good result to give us the confidence and chance to improve. Today we lost that opportunity.\n\"I can understand how the supporters feel about the team and about me. I can only say to them I'm going to work hard for a good performance and to show we can be better.\n\"Today the attitude was good. They [the players] wanted it, they wanted to win. We imposed ourselves for 20 minutes in the second half but overall we didn't. We are very frustrated in the dressing room, the players and I.\n\"I understand them [the fans] 100% because they didn't watch their team play like they want. But my job is to find the solution.\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We were critical and tried to go back to basics. The key today was we were more on the front foot. We have to big up the positive things.\n\"The only way to get something from the Premier League is to be as energetic as we were today.\"\nArsenal's winless run continues\nArsenal are unbeaten in their last 25 home league games against Southampton (W18 D7) since a 1-0 loss in November 1987.\nSouthampton have played more Premier League away games against Arsenal without winning than any side has against another in the competition's history (21 - W0 D6 L15).\nArsenal are winless in their last five Premier League games (D3 L2), since a 1-0 victory against Bournemouth in October, picking up just three points from the last 15 on offer.\nArsenal have failed to win six consecutive matches across all competitions (D5 L1), for the first time since November-December 1998.\nSouthampton are winless in their last eight Premier League games (D2 L6), since a 1-0 victory against Sheffield United in September.\nWith 24 of Alexandre Lacazette's 31 Premier League goals having been scored in home games (77%), it is the highest ratio among all players with at least 30 goals in the competition.\nArsenal have faced five penalties in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. Bernd Leno became the first Arsenal goalkeeper to save a Premier League penalty since Peter Cech against Watford in March 2018, ending the Gunners' run of conceding 12 consecutive penalties they had faced in the competition.\nAlexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have started 35 games together for Arsenal in all competitions, netting a combined 40 goals in those matches (Lacazette 16 and Aubameyang 24).\nArsenal were shown six yellow cards in a Premier League game for the first time since November 2017 against Manchester City.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday, 28 November at 20:00 GMT. They then travel to Norwich in the Premier League on Sunday, 1 December 14:00 GMT.\nSouthampton's next Premier League match is on Saturday, 30 November when they play Watford at St Mary's (17:30 GMT kick-off)."

        "article_text": "Everton 0-2 Norwich City: Marco Silva says his side 'look afraid'\nEverton manager Marco Silva has said the club \"has to come first\" as pressure grows on his position after a 2-0 loss at home to struggling Norwich City.\nThe Canaries condemned Silva's side to their seventh defeat of the season through second-half goals from Todd Cantwell and Dennis Srbeny.\nEverton lacked threat throughout, and came closest to scoring when Cenk Tosun's shot in the second half was turned away by Norwich goalkeeper Tim Krul.\n\"We started to be afraid and that was the problem,\" Silva said. \"You can never, ever, ever be afraid to play football.\"\nEverton's third home loss of the current campaign saw them slip to 15th place, while Norwich, who were bottom of the Premier League at kick-off, moved up to 18th.\nA number of fans sang \"sacked in the morning\" at the end of the game but Silva insists he can only focus on performances.\n\"I think it is not the main thing to talk about the situation. It is not the moment to talk about individual positions,\" Silva said.\n\"We have to look what is best for us as a club and for myself and the players as well - but always the club has to be at the top.\n\"If you are really disappointed with the afternoon I can imagine they [fans] are as well and they have the reaction to the manager and the players.\n\"When you lose a match, the first person they look to is the manager. Football is like that.\n\"The message is I respect what is their feeling, for sure. It is not the first time they felt the way they felt this afternoon.\"\nRelive Norwich's win over Everton\nReaction to all today's Premier League games\nGylfi Sigurdsson had several chances as the hosts improved for a spell in the second half, but the Everton's captain could only shoot straight at Krul with the best of them.\nSigurdsson also seemed well-placed for a chance from a free-kick late in the game, but Lucas Digne stepped up instead and could only fire in a weak effort that Krul saved comfortably.\nCantwell scored early in the second half, and substitute Srbeny sealed the Canaries' first three points since they beat champions Manchester City on 14 September with a goal in stoppage time.\nOriel Hernandez had gone close for Norwich before the break when he forced Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford into an excellent low save.\nOff-colour Everton slip up at home again\nFour points from a possible six just before the international break would have given Everton fans hope that a corner had been turned after an inconsistent start to the season.\nSilva's side looked confident in the opening stages against Norwich, but as the game wore on an edginess in the stands seemed to transfer to the pitch, and by full-time that frustration was evident for players and supporters.\nNorwich sat deep, but Everton did not have the enough ideas to open them up, either in open play or at any of their seven corners.\nOf their 18 shots, Everton only managed seven on target, although Cantwell's opener for Norwich roused them, with Sigurdsson trying his luck on three occasions within a few minutes.\nBut with their next three games against Leicester, Liverpool and Chelsea coming inside the next two weeks, Silva admitted that this defeat against the side who were propping up the Premier League was a missed opportunity for progress.\nHe added: \"We are trying to get consistency. We came from good results and we lost an opportunity today. The way we played this afternoon, we did not deserve to win.\n\"It was frustrating. We share the fans' frustration.\"\nCanaries shake off recent dip in fortunes\nFrom the outset, Norwich did not play like a side on such a poor run, having more ideas and creativity than their hosts.\nHernandez posed problems on the left flank, and the Cuban was only denied a goal when Pickford dropped low to his right to thwart Norwich's best chance of the first half.\nCantwell, who was so crucial to Norwich's memorable win over Manchester City, had been recalled to the starting line-up and the 21-year-old gave Daniel Farke's side a lift with an energetic display.\nHis goal came about thanks to an excellent knock-down from Kenny McLean that allowed Teemu Pukki to pick him out as he glided into the Everton area before placing the ball past Pickford.\nThe Canaries looked comfortable after the first goal, despite the expected surge from Everton, and Srbeny had been on the pitch for only a few seconds when the German latched onto a rebound from the unlucky Sigurdsson inside the Everton area.\nNorwich now face Arsenal, Southampton and Sheffield United in quick succession, but if they can ensure that this kind of performance becomes the norm rather than exception then Farke's side could soon be out of the relegation zone.\nMan of the match - Kenny McLean (Norwich City)\n'We're buzzing' - Manager reaction\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was such a good away game, the dressing room was buzzing and we deserved the win.\n\"I was very confident of getting something from the game. The first half was good but I went in knowing we could be leading and we had to go out and want to win it in the second half.\n\"A win is always good for the spirit f the team. We have showed we have confidence and deserve to be at this level.\"\nBack-markers haunt Silva - again: The stats you may have missed\nEverton manager Marco Silva has lost all four of his Premier League home games against sides starting the day bottom of the table - 2-0 v Sunderland in May 2017 (with Hull), 2-1 v Swansea in December 2017 (with Watford), 3-1 v West Ham in September 2018 (with Everton) and 2-0 v Norwich City today (with Everton).\nEverton have lost five of their past six Premier League games versus newly promoted teams (W1), as many as in their previous 48 combined.\nNorwich picked up their first away Premier League win in 10 games, drawing one and losing eight of the previous nine.\nNorwich have kept a clean sheet in two of their past three away Premier League games, as many as in their previous 33.\nTeemu Pukki has been directly involved in nine Premier League goals in 13 games this season (6 goals, 3 assists) - four more than any other Norwich player.\nNorwich City's Todd Cantwell scored his first ever away goal in English league football, in what was his 18th appearance.\nWhat's next?\nNorwich host Arsenal at Carrow Road on Sunday 1 December, starting at 14:00 GMT, while Everton travel to high-flying Leicester for a 16:30 kick-off on the same day."

        "article_text": "Brighton 0-2 Leicester: Jamie Vardy scores again as Foxes maintain winning run\nJamie Vardy maintained his brilliant scoring streak as Leicester beat Brighton for their fifth successive Premier League win to strengthen their hold on second spot.\nThe Foxes remain eight points behind leaders Liverpool, but are now three clear of third-placed Chelsea and four points above Manchester City before those teams meet later on Saturday.\nVardy has been key to the Foxes' form and he once again was the shining light on a dark, rainy day on the south coast.\nThe striker set up Ayoze Perez for the 64th-minute opener after swift counter-attack and then added the second from the spot, after his initial spot-kick, saved and headed in by James Maddison, had to be retaken for encroachment.\nFoxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel failed to be tested once by the home side, although Wilfred Ndidi made a brilliant block to deny Martin Montoya from hitting the target.\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive the action at the Amex Stadium\nVardy too good for England to ignore?\nIs it time for the England manager to drop Vardy a line?\nThe 32-year-old effectively called time on his international career after the World Cup in 2018, but Gareth Southgate said at the start of the month that he had been \"monitoring\" the striker's progress this season.\nThere was a suggestion that Southgate wanted to focus on younger players in that position, but can he continue to leave out a player who has now scored nine goals in seven league games?\nToday, when his supply line failed to service him, Vardy turned provider for his team-mates and himself.\nThe first goal was about his searing pace as he flew down the right before setting up Perez, who had moments earlier missed a similar chance.\nHe then got his goal from the spot after his initial effort had to be retaken, the penalty award coming after Demarai Gray had been fouled by Adam Webster.\nVardy's effort was saved by Mat Ryan before the ball was headed in by James Maddison, but the England midfielder's celebrations were cut short when VAR informed referee Mike Dean of encroachment, gifting Vardy a reprieve.\nSeagulls home run ends after below-par display\nBrighton came into this game having won their previous three at the Amex, but it never looked like they would make it four.\nThey were on the back foot in the opening period and needed Ryan to produce a brilliant save to prevent Vardy's header going in, shortly after Perez's header hit the woodwork.\nGraham Potter's side gave the home support a little more to cheer about in the second half, Montoya and Neal Maupay denied by the brilliant defending of Ndidi and Caglar Soyuncu.\nThe Seagulls remain comfortably in mid-table but it is a trip to Anfield next.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\n'We could have scored more' - reaction\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers speaking to Match of the Day: \"We played very, very well considering we've come back from the international break. In the first 30 minutes we had control of the game and had chances to go in front.\n\"They started strongly in the second half, but the boys have got great resilience. You can be a good side by keeping the ball and creating chances from deep, but that's what we have (good counter-attacking).\n\"It was to be expected that Brighton would come on strong. Brighton are a good side. They have good football ideas and pass the ball. With a better selection of passes we could have scored more though.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter speaking to Match of the Day: \"I thought we started the second half really well. We looked like we might do something. With their goal they broke really well.\n\"We did a lot well but not enough. Leicester had opportunities and chances on the break.\n\"They started better than us. We hung in there and grew into the game. We were much better after the break.\n\"I saw their penalty - it didn't look the strongest appeal. Sometimes they go for you and sometimes they don't, but that's not the reason we lost the game.\"\nPerez finding form - stats\nLeicester have equalled their Premier League-best run of five consecutive victories, with the Foxes winning these matches by an aggregate score of 17-1.\nBrighton lost their first home league match since August, ending a run of four without defeat at the Amex Stadium (W3 D1).\nBrighton failed to register a single shot on target in a Premier League home game for only the second time, also failing to do so against Liverpool in January.\nLeicester have conceded a league-low eight Premier League goals this season, with this their fourth consecutive clean sheet.\nPerez has scored four goals in his last four Premier League games for Leicester, having failed to find the net in his first eight for the Foxes.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton are at Liverpool next Saturday (15:00 GMT) and Leicester are at home to Everton next Sunday (16:30)."

In a game like this you have to make sure you are ready to fight for the result.\n\"We are not out there to show that we invented football, because we didn't. We have a job to do and hopefully we can continue.\"\nLiverpool, who rested Mohamed Salah, have now gone 30 games unbeaten in the Premier League and have dropped only two points in the league all season.\nBut they were also helped when Palace defender James Tomkins had a goal ruled out in first-half stoppage time by the video assistant referee after Jordan Ayew was adjudged to have fouled Dejan Lovren.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nFirmino underlines Liverpool resilience\nWith Klopp deciding to keep Salah on the bench following an ankle problem, the timing of Firmino's scrappy winner was immaculate.\nNot only did it end his run of nine games without a goal, it also meant Klopp could change his intention to throw Salah onto the pitch to help his side find a winner.\nLate goals are becoming a trademark of Liverpool's season and the winner should not have come as a surprise given the league leaders have claimed more points with goals after the 85th minute than any other Premier League team this term.\nFollowing an international break where many of their players were in action, they demonstrated their resilience as they came under fire from a Palace side who tested Alisson on several occasions and should have opened the scoring when Ayew skewed wide with a first-half chance.\nThe visitors were however far from their best, with Trent Alexander-Arnold having an erratic day and Palace wingers Zaha and Andros Townsend regularly causing the visiting defence problems.\nBut with Virgil van Dijk typically solid, Mane continued his incredible scoring run against Palace with his eighth goal in 10 league games against the Eagles.\nThat was before Firmino, who had a relatively quiet game, proved his value with a fourth goal of the season to earn a fifth successive win over Palace.\nPalace end tough run with another defeat\nDefeat for Roy Hodgson's side was their fourth in five games during a tough run of games against clubs in the upper echelons of the table.\nHaving faced Manchester City, Arsenal, second-placed Leicester and Chelsea before playing Liverpool, they now travel to sixth-placed Burnley next weekend.\nBut with more composure from Zaha they could easily have earned a draw that their play in an evenly-balanced game deserved.\nThe home supporters were understandably aggrieved by the VAR decision that went against their side, as Kevin Friend had awarded the goal after Tomkins nodded in unmarked at the back post from a free-kick.\nReplays, however, showed Ayew appeared to push Lovren in the back as the Liverpool defender shaped to head the ball.\nThat incident was just before the break and Mane scored four minutes after it, so Hodgson will take heart that his players' heads did not drop after those two blows in quick succession.\nIndeed they were always a threat to Klopp's side and substitute Jeffrey Schlupp had Alisson scrambling to make a fine save before Zaha's fine strike ended his drought at Selhurst Park that stretched back to 9 February.\nThe fact the Eagles equalised so late on but could not earn a point will be the biggest disappointment to the former Liverpool and England manager.\nMan of the match - Andros Townsend\nOur best display of the season - Hodgson\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"The players should be congratulating themselves on taking a point from the leaders but it wasn't to be. I have praise for my own team for having a go, if you can be bold enough to praise your team when you're not winning.\n\"Throughout there was not an awful lot of clear-cut chances. That was testament to the defensive work we did throughout the team. The fact is you must take your chances and we only took one of ours.\n\"The late winner is a cruel blow but I have nothing to complain about from my side. I want to be positive, I think it was our best performance so far this season.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to Sky Sports: \"At the end we won the game and it was deserved as well. There were not too many mistakes but the goal they scored was good. We have to bring plans together after the international break.\n\"I'm happy with the result and big parts of the performance because I know it's not possible to be brilliant every game.\"\nMatch stats - Liverpool, the set-piece kings\nLiverpool are unbeaten in 30 Premier League matches (W25 D5); only Arsenal (49 games in October 2004) and Chelsea (40 in October 2005) have had longer runs without defeat in the history of the competition.\nSince the start of last season, Liverpool have scored 38 goals from set-pieces in the Premier League (including penalties), eight more than any other club.\nSadio Mane is only the third Liverpool player to score in five consecutive Premier League games against a particular opponent, after Michael Owen against Newcastle and Luis Suarez against Norwich.\nCrystal Palace have lost three consecutive home league games for the first time since March 2018, when the third such defeat in that run was also against Liverpool.\nCrystal Palace have lost each of their last five league meetings with Liverpool, their longest losing run against them.\nWilfried Zaha scored his first goal in 14 Premier League games for Crystal Palace, ending a period of 1,245 minutes on the pitch without scoring.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Burnley next Saturday while Liverpool host Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday before welcoming Brighton to Anfield three days later."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 Chelsea: Champions come from behind to go third\nPremier League champions Manchester City got back to winning ways by coming from behind to beat in-form Chelsea in an entertaining game.\nThe visitors, who had won their previous seven away games, led when N'Golo Kante slipped the ball past Ederson from Mateo Kovacic's aerial pass.\nAt that stage City were facing back-to-back Premier League defeats which would have left them 12 points behind leaders Liverpool and given them an uphill task to retain their title.\nBut the hosts rallied and equalised when Kevin de Bruyne's shot hit Kurt Zouma and wrongfooted goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nRiyad Mahrez put the reigning champions - who move above Chelsea into third place - ahead with a fine finish after cutting in from the right wing.\nBoth sides could have scored more in a chaotic first half, City going closest when Sergio Aguero hit the crossbar after a poor clearance by Kepa.\nThere were fewer incidents in the second half although Aguero hobbled off and had to be replaced by Gabriel Jesus, with Pep Guardiola worried it is a bad muscle injury.\nRaheem Sterling thought he had scored a late third for City but it was ruled out by the video assistant referee in a very tight offside call.\nCity only had 46.74% of the ball, the lowest percentage by any Guardiola team in any of his 381 top-flight matches in charge of Barcelona, Bayern Munich or City.\nThey sit nine points behind leaders Liverpool, who beat them 3-1 in the last game before the international break.\n\"Chelsea are an incredible team,\" Guardiola told BBC Sport after the game. \"We knew it, but we beat them.\n\"It was a typical high-level game. Our back four played so good today. In the most difficult period of the game, we scored on the counter.\n\"We created enough chances to score more goals.\"\nCity ride their luck in first half\nBoth sides had plenty of opportunities in a manic first half.\nDe Bruyne went close after two minutes from Aguero's pass while Tammy Abraham had a hand in four Chelsea efforts, setting up Willian and Fikayo Tomori to shoot wide and having two efforts himself.\nThey then tore City apart as Willian picked out the unmarked Emerson Palmieri on the left wing but his powerful shot was saved by Ederson.\nTheir goal eventually came though, when Kante held off Benjamin Mendy before turning the ball past Ederson, who may have been advised to stay on his line.\nHowever that 21st-minute goal would prove to be Chelsea's final shot on target of the game.\nThere was a degree of fortune to City's equaliser. David Silva's pass to De Bruyne took two deflections, including one off Zouma, to find the Belgium playmaker, whose shot - which looked as if it was heading for Kepa - also hit the France centre-back to leave the keeper helpless.\nFrom that moment, City were on top and Mahrez produced a wonderful effort to give them the lead. The Algeria winger was fed by Rodri down the right, skipped between two defenders as he cut in before firing a shot between the legs of Tomori and into the net.\nCity's fightback should have been even more comprehensive when Kepa passed the ball straight to Aguero, but the Argentina striker lifted the ball over the Spain goalkeeper but off the bar.\n\"We were controlling the game,\" Chelsea boss Frank Lampard told BBC Match of the Day. \"We were playing some great stuff and we felt in control but you can't be absolutely in control against Manchester City.\n\"It was bad luck for their first goal, and absolute quality from Riyad Mahrez for the second and that changed the game.\n\"Maybe we were a bit slow with our movement at the back. I know we were giving them a good game but I am disappointed with the small details.\n\"If you look at City they are an example, and we're at the absolute start of that process. A few of our players were in the Championship last season, but we want more.\"\nDrama at both ends in dramatic finish\nGuardiola's side did enough to see the game out after the break, restricting the visitors - who had won their previous six Premier League games - to only five shots, all off target.\nThe hosts had most of the second-half opportunities - despite their unusually low amount of possession - with De Bruyne, Fernandinho and Phil Foden all having shots saved by Kepa.\nHowever Chelsea were inches away from equalising in injury time when substitute Mason Mount's 30-yard free-kick went just wide.\nSeconds later City were celebrating for a third time as Mahrez headed the ball on for Sterling to blast home - but a VAR check ruled that the England forward was marginally offside.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez\nMatch stats - Chelsea only lose to top-six teams\nManchester City have won four Premier League games against Chelsea despite conceding the first goal, more than they have against any other opponent in the competition.\nWhile Chelsea have scored more away goals than any other Premier League side this season (19), no side has conceded more on the road than the Blues in 2019-20 (14).\nCity have conceded the first goal in three of their last four home league games, as many as they had in their previous 51 at Etihad Stadium.\nChelsea's last four Premier League defeats have been against last season's top six, including all three so far this season.\nCity's Kevin de Bruyne has been involved in more home goals than any other player in the Premier League this season (nine - three goals, six assists).\nChelsea's N'Golo Kante has scored with all three of his shots on target in the Premier League this season.\nWhat's next?\nCity host Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT), before visiting Newcastle in the Premier League next Saturday (12:30).\nChelsea are at Valencia on Wednesday (17:55) and host West Ham on Saturday (15:00) in the same competitions."

They have also failed to keep a clean sheet in their past 12 top-flight away games, their worst streak since a run of 15 in 1985-86.\nWith more points dropped, Manchester United sit nine points adrift of the top four Champions League qualification spots.\nThey managed just one shot on target during a woeful first-half showing - Anthony Martial testing goalkeeper Simon Moore, who was making his first Premier League start, in the 29th minute.\nTheir second shot on target started the comeback - Williams' shot nestling in the corner before Greenwood's equaliser after good work by Rashford, who converted the third from Daniel James' cut-back.\nSpirited Blades battle to the end\nWilder did not know whether to laugh or cry at the final whistle after a game which provoked an incredible roller-coaster of emotions.\nDespite missing first-choice keeper Dean Henderson - on loan from Manchester United and ineligible to play against them - as well as ever-present defender John Egan, the Blades turned on the style.\nMousset is proving one of the bargain buys of the season. Since joining from Bournemouth for \u00a310m in the summer, the French forward has four Premier League goals and three assists.\nHe was heavily involved in his side's first before producing a sublime finish to double the lead.\nWilder will be concerned at the way his defence capitulated but Sheffield United's never-say-die spirit was once again evident.\nThis was the fifth time this season they have come from behind to salvage a point in the Premier League.\n'I would have been disappointed if we came away with nothing' - reaction\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder:\n\"Can we forget about that period, please? We just dropped off our energy levels. The old saying '2-0 is a dangerous scoreline' turned into 'oops, we're 3-2 down'.\n\"And you've got to give them credit, just as you have us with the way we fought back at the death to get something out of the game.\n\"I would have been really disappointed had we not got anything from this game because for the majority of the time we were right up there in terms of the performance levels.\"\nMan of the match - Lys Mousset (Sheffield United)\nMan Utd dangerous when two-goals down - the stats\nManchester United have avoided defeat in 25 Premier League games when losing by two or more goals - three more than any other side.\nThis was the highest-scoring Premier League draw involving Manchester United since January 2016, when they drew 3-3 with Newcastle United.\nSheffield United are the first newly promoted team to score three goals against Manchester United in a Premier League game since Leicester City won 5-3 in September 2014.\nIn Brandon Williams and Mason Greenwood, Manchester United had two teenagers score in a Premier League match for the first time since Wayne Rooney and Giuseppe Rossi scored against Sunderland in October 2005.\nSheffield United have benefited from more goals (five) from substitutes in the Premier League this season than any other side.\nManchester United striker Marcus Rashford has been involved in eight goals in his past five Premier League appearances against newly promoted opponents.\nPhil Jagielka made his first Premier League start for Sheffield United since May 2007, a gap of 4,578 days. The only player to have a longer gap between starts for a club is Wayne Rooney for Everton between 2004 and 2017 (4,837 days).\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United are away to in-form Wolves next Sunday (14:00 GMT) while Manchester United face a near 7,500-mile round trip to Kazakhstan to face Astana in the Europa League on Thursday (15:50 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 2-0 Newcastle: Villa win on Steve Bruce's return\nAston Villa ended a run of three successive Premier League defeats as they beat Newcastle United to ruin Steve Bruce's return to Villa Park.\nConor Hourihane's curled free-kick gave Villa the lead before his enticing set-piece set up Anwar El Ghazi to finish from close range four minutes later.\nBruce, sacked as Villa boss in October 2018, saw his side denied by goalkeeper Tom Heaton, who saved from Federico Fernandez and Allan Saint-Maximin.\nThe win takes Villa up to 15th place.\nNewcastle would have moved up to ninth with a win, but the defeat keeps them 14th, one point ahead of Villa.\nRelive Aston Villa's win over Newcastle as it happened\nNewcastle undone by free-kicks\nNewcastle paid the price for some defensive indiscipline as they conceded twice from needless free-kicks just after the half-hour mark.\nA two-handed push right on the edge of the penalty area from DeAndre Yedlin on Jack Grealish, who had got the wrong side of the Newcastle right-back, led to the opener.\nHourihane nudged the stationary ball to Grealish, who stopped it and, from the better angle, the Republic of Ireland midfielder curled the ball around the wall and into the net.\nThe lively Grealish, back after missing three games with a calf injury, saw a fine run crudely ended when he was brought down by a clumsy Federico Fernandez challenge, again just outside the 18-yard box.\nThis time Hourihane - back in the Villa side after being an unused substitute in the loss to Wolves - was the provider as his excellent delivery was steered in by El Ghazi.\nThe Netherlands winger thought he had scored Villa's third before half-time, but he slightly mis-timed his run onto a John McGinn pass and was adjudged offside after putting the ball into the net.\nGrealish was a constant threat with his dribbling ability and came close to getting the goal he deserved but curled over from 15 yards after neat link-up play with El Ghazi.\nWesley should have added a third in the 77th minute but failed to beat Martin Dubravka from close range but Villa, who had been beaten in successive Premier League matches by Manchester City, Liverpool and Wolves, suffered no late scares and collected three points.\nAn unhappy return to Villa Park for Bruce\nThis was Bruce's first game on the touchline at Villa Park since he was sacked by the club just over a year ago, when they were in the Championship.\nHe had a two-year spell in charge of the Birmingham club and nearly took them into the Premier League - losing in the play-off final in May 2018 - but lost his job after a poor run saw a section of the fans turn against him.\nBefore Monday's game Bruce described his final days as Villa's boss as \"one of the most unsavoury times of my career\", culminating in a fan throwing a cabbage at him in his last match in charge.\nThere was to be no happy return to Villa Park after his side fell two goals behind, with Heaton in fine form.\nThe England keeper, who held a Jonjo Shelvey free-kick when it was goalless, preserved Villa's advantage with an excellent reaction stop to push Fernandez's header over the bar at the end of the first half.\nHe then produced a good save low down to his left to keep out a well-struck effort from Allan Saint-Maximin and was well placed to deny Isaac Hayden.\nBruce, who received a polite if unenthusiastic reception from Villa's fans before the match, brought on striker Andy Carroll in an attempt to get back in the game and the former England man did well to volley on the turn but his effort was straight at Heaton.\nDwight Gayle also came on for the ineffective Joelinton but could not make an impact in a disappointing evening for Bruce and Newcastle.\n'Entitled to chuck cabbages at his team' - analysis\nFormer Aston Villa striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live\n\"I think Steve Bruce will feel humiliated. He would have been quite entitled to chuck cabbages at his own team at half-time.\n\"Villa really deserved their victory. They needed the three points, they got the three points and Dean Smith got his performance.\n\"It was important Villa stepped up and played with confidence after three defeats.\n\"Newcastle helped them immensely by the fact they were so passive. Villa did have to weather a little bit of a Newcastle storm at the start of the second half but it was a big performance and they're back on track.\"\nMan of the match - Conor Hourihane (Aston Villa)\nMore set-piece joy for Villa - the stats\nAston Villa's last four Premier League goals have come from set-pieces, while four of the last five Premier League goals Newcastle have conceded have come from set-pieces.\nJack Grealish (two goals, four assists) has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Aston Villa player this season.\nConor Hourihane scored his fifth goal of the season in all competitions, but this was his first at Villa Park.\nAston Villa ended their 12-game winless run against Newcastle in the league, with this their first victory against the Magpies since a 1-0 win in April 2011.\nNewcastle conceded two goals in a league game against Aston Villa for the first time since February 2008 (a 4-1 defeat) - indeed, Villa scored as many goals as they managed in their previous seven encounters against the Magpies.\nVilla have won four of their 13 Premier League games in 2019-20 (drew two, lost seven), one more than they won in all of their previous top-flight season in 2015-16 (three).\nNewcastle have lost 13 of their last 16 Premier League games played on a Monday (won two, drew one), failing to score in 11 of those matches.\nSteve Bruce has lost three of his last four games in all competitions against sides he's previously managed (drew one), losing each of his last two such games against Aston Villa.\nNewcastle's Miguel Almiron has had more shots without scoring than any other player in the Premier League this season (22) - the Paraguayan is still yet to score his first goal (41 shots) or register his first assist (22 chances created) in the competition.\n'Really pleased with the clean sheet' - what they said\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith speaking to Sky Sports: \"This is a really tough league and we have just gone through a period of playing Manchester City and Liverpool, which were games I thought we actually played well in.\n\"The table is so tight but you need to put a run together, be tough to beat and keep a clean sheet. I'm really pleased with the clean sheet as we haven't had too many of those this season.\n\"Our form has been good; we knew it would be hard, but I think we've been competitive. It takes time to gel defensively but we achieved that against Newcastle.\"\nOn goalscorer Conor Hourihane, Smith added: \"I explained to Conor why I left him out against Manchester City [on 26 October]. He has scored goals in every league he's played in and I always had him earmarked to come back in and he showed us what he was about.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce told Sky Sports: \"The first half in particular we did not do enough with or without the ball. We felt we were harshly done by with two free-kicks, but the way Conor Hourihane has executed them made it a difficult night.\n\"Conor is very good, I have seen it many times and he has the accuracy and power to score. The second one, our defenders have to defend better, too many stood and watched it.\n\"The game was gone in two minutes although we had chances before and after half-time when Tom Heaton made some good saves.\n\"Jamaal Lascelles [out with a knee injury] is our captain and has been playing very well. Last week the defenders were excellent but you are always going to miss your best players.\"\nWhat's next?\nVilla now have a tough run of fixtures, with two successive away games - at Manchester United on Sunday and then Chelsea on Wednesday, 4 December - before a home game against second-placed Leicester City.\nNewcastle entertain reigning champions Manchester City on Saturday, before an away match at Sheffield United on Thursday, 5 December."

They're a very good team also and they have a little change and finally the score was against us again.\n\"One goal for us now is a tragedy, even when we are in control of the match it's a tragedy.\"\nHe added: \"I came here and I'm trying and fighting a lot, although the circumstances are bad for us.\"\nThe hosts appeared set for a damaging defeat until Ings bundled home Moussa Djenepo's cross with 12 minutes remaining.\nWard-Prowse then found the top corner with a superb free-kick five minutes later to complete the turnaround.\nIsmaila Sarr had given the Hornets a deserved lead in the first half, capitalising on poor defending by Jack Stephens before lifting the ball beyond Alex McCarthy for his first Premier League goal.\nSouthampton's first league win since September moves them above Norwich and to within two points of safety, while Watford remain six points adrift of 17th place.\nSecond-half substitutions inspire Saints\nOnly Southampton's profligacy prevented them from leaving Arsenal's Emirates Stadium with all three points last weekend.\nHasenh\u00fcttl's side managed 21 shots against the Gunners in north London, but they started anxiously against the Hornets and almost fell behind within the first two minutes.\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg's stray back-pass fell straight into the path of Sarr, who could only drill his shot into the arms of McCarthy.\nSaints remained nervous in possession as the half wore on with Stephens bundling an attempted clearance into the path of Sarr, allowing the Senegal forward to race clear and stroke home the opener.\nBoos greeted Michael Oliver's half-time whistle, but there was little change to the pattern of play until the introductions of Boufal and Shane Long 13 minutes into the second half.\nRepublic of Ireland forward Long twice struck the woodwork, seeing his header tipped on to the crossbar by Ben Foster before scuffing another shot against the post from close range.\nIngs eventually restored parity after fine work by Djenepo on the right as he worked his way into the box with some excellent footwork, before Ward-Prowse curled a magnificent free-kick beyond Foster as Southampton won after trailing at half-time for only the second time in 44 league matches.\nHornets made to rue missed opportunities\nHaving admitted he was under pressure in the build-up to this game, Flores has now picked up just seven points from a possible 30 since replacing Javi Gracia as head coach in September.\nWatford's haul of eight points after 14 games is also their worst ever return at this stage of a Premier League campaign.\nThe Hornets were much the better side in the early stages, restricting their hosts to efforts from distance while attacking with purpose at the other end.\nSarr, who was handed his third Premier League start of the season in place of Andre Gray, was a constant threat to the home defence, easily shrugging off Stephens before lifting the ball confidently over McCarthy for the opener.\nThe summer signing went close to doubling his tally either side of half-time, volleying straight at McCarthy from close range in the first half before sending a curling effort over the crossbar in the second.\nFlores will feel his team should have been out of sight by that stage, but there appeared little danger of Watford surrendering their narrow lead as the visitors continued to hold firm.\nThat all changed in the final quarter of an hour, however, as Southampton's late pressure finally told.\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)\nOver-reliant on Ings and Ward-Prowse? - the stats\nSouthampton ended a run of eight Premier League games without a win (D2 L6).\nWatford have registered just one win in their past 18 Premier League games, drawing six and losing 11.\nWatford's Sarr is the 27th Senegalese player to score in the Premier League, with only Nigeria boasting more different scorers (31) among African nations.\nIngs has netted seven of Southampton's 15 Premier League goals this season, (46.7%), the highest proportion of a side's goals by a player in the competition in 2019-20.\nEach of Southampton's last 10 Premier League goals has been scored by either Ings (6) or Ward-Prowse (4).\nOnly Matt le Tissier (7) has scored more direct free-kick goals for Southampton in the Premier League than Ward-Prowse (5).\n'Let's do it again on Wednesday' - what the managers said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, speaking to Match of the Day: \"The first half was a completely different performance to last weekend and it was unbelievable it could happen.\n\"At half-time, we were very critical and in the second half it was a good reaction. After 10 minutes we made two subs and they had a big impact in the game and it was a big big win for us.\n\"We have not had one good start so far this season. Now we have to push it away and our crowd deserve it. Let's do it again on Wednesday [when they host Norwich].\"\nWatford head coach Quique Sanchez Flores, speaking to Match of the Day: \"At half-time we had the feel that we were in a match we wanted. But they went up another level and we didn't do the same.\"\nOn his future: \"I cannot control it. When we lose we can say sorry to the fans, the owners and players, but we have the same feeling, we want to fight.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Norwich City in another key game at the bottom of the Premier League on Wednesday, 4 December (kick-off 19:30 GMT), while Watford travel to high-flying Leicester City at the same time."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-1 Brighton & Hove Albion: Leaders move 11 points clear despite Alisson red card\nLiverpool keeper Alisson was sent off for a blatant handball outside his penalty area as the Reds moved 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League with victory over Brighton.\nJurgen Klopp's side were coasting to victory after two Virgil van Dijk headers from Trent Alexander-Arnold assists in the space of six first-half minutes.\nBut Alisson's red card - for handling as Brighton substitute Leandro Trossard bore down on goal - gifted the visitors a lifeline.\nSubstitute Adrian's first touch was to gather the ball out of his own net after Lewis Dunk's cute free-kick left the keeper - who was still organising his wall - stranded, before Liverpool's stopper saved late on from Aaron Mooy.\nEarlier in the day, defending champions Manchester City were held to a 2-2 draw at Newcastle United.\nLeicester City will cut Liverpool's lead to eight points if they beat Everton on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nLiverpool do it the hard way\nVictory means Liverpool have equalled their longest ever unbeaten run in the top flight, having also gone 31 games without defeat between May 1987 and March 1988.\nYet this was anything but straightforward for the leaders as Alisson became the first Reds keeper to be sent off in a Premier League game since fellow Brazilian Doni in 2012.\nWith his side 2-0 up and closing in on three points, Alisson came rushing out of his penalty area to handle the ball as Brighton attacked.\nAs a result, Alisson will now miss the Merseyside derby with Everton at Anfield on Wednesday.\nHis actions set up a nerve-wracking finale and Dunk's free-kick - an awful goal to concede from Liverpool's point of view - means Klopp's side are still without a clean sheet since 28 September.\nAdrian saved his side by keeping out Mooy as mid-table Brighton piled forward in search of an equaliser.\nThe Reds had looked like coasting to victory after Van Dijk's double, and Brighton keeper Mat Ryan made three fine saves to frustrate Roberto Firmino, twice, and Mohamed Salah.\nLiverpool head into a demanding December, a month during which the club will play nine fixtures in four different competitions, with a fifth successive league win - but this was far too close for comfort.\nSpirited Brighton give leaders a scare\nBrighton slipped to 15th in the table after a third straight defeat, but there are grounds for optimism before a busy December programme.\nIn a week during which Seagulls boss Graham Potter extended his contract to 2025, his side gave the leaders a real scare even before the hosts were reduced to 10 men.\nDunk went close from a Pascal Gross corner before scoring his second goal in as many games, while teenage forward Aaron Connolly also showed flashes of real promise.\nWith his side trailing 2-0, the 19-year-old managed to create space for himself inside Liverpool's penalty area and test Alisson despite close attention from Dejan Lovren and Van Dijk.\nOne worry for Brighton is their defending from set-pieces as Van Dijk was allowed to dominate the aerial duels. That will be a real concern for Potter with matches against Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea on the horizon.\nMan of the match - Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\n'Lots of positives' - what they said\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"It was unnecessary [for the game to be nervy at the end], of course, because we had unbelievable chances. Their keeper made some good saves.\n\"It was difficult this game because Brighton are a good football side. They had a lot of possession and we had to work really hard.\n\"I loved that the boys were prepared to do that after a busy week.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter: \"There were lots of positives for us. In the first 10-15 minutes we weren't quite as aggressive and didn't have the belief we needed.\n\"We gave a really good account of ourselves against a top team. We are disappointed because we came away with nothing but with the performance and the effort, we could have come away with something.\n\"We had good chances at 2-0 down. Virgil van Dijk was so powerful in his two actions for their goals and we weren't as good. That's the reality.\n\"But over the 90 minutes we put so much into the game and we need to take that forward and carry on improving.\"\nBrighton skipper Lewis Dunk: \"To come here and be disappointed speaks volumes. There's so much to move forward with and at times we were excellent.\n\"The game was decided by the first 15 minutes, but not many teams will come here and feel like this.\"\nWhy Alexander-Arnold is the assist king - the stats\nSince the start of last season, no player has provided more Premier League assists than Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold (17).\nBrighton have lost nine of their 11 away league games against Liverpool, with their only victory coming in the top flight in March 1982.\nBrighton are without a win in their past six away Premier League games - losing each of the past four.\nLiverpool have registered 14 consecutive home wins in the Premier League, their second longest home top-flight winning run behind a 21-game streak between January-December 1972.\nSince the start of last season, Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk has scored more Premier League goals than any other defender (7).\nLiverpool have scored 40 Premier League goals via set-pieces (including penalties) since August 2018, the most of any side in this period.\nThe Reds are unbeaten in each of their last 98 Premier League games at Anfield when leading at half-time since losing to Arsenal in December 2009.\nWhat's next?\nThere's a busy midweek of Premier League action coming up with Liverpool hosting neighbours Everton on Wednesday (20:15 GMT), while Brighton are at Arsenal on Thursday (20:15)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-2 Crystal Palace: Roy Hodgson's side end losing run\nA goal in either half earned Crystal Palace their first Premier League win in six games in a cagey affair at Burnley.\nWilfried Zaha struck the opener right on half-time with a low drive, despite Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope getting a hand to the ball at his near post.\nJeffrey Schlupp sealed victory nine minutes after coming on as a substitute as he capitalised on Ben Mee's mistake to fire between Pope's legs from inside the area.\nChris Wood had Burnley's best chance but he could only smash his effort over the crossbar from close range.\nPalace move up to 10th in the table, level on points with Burnley, who are eighth.\nRelive the action as it happened\nBurnley run out of ideas after making crucial mistakes\nThe Clarets came into the game in fine form, having won their previous two games 3-0, but their attack lacked a cutting edge against the Eagles.\nPalace remained resolute in their shape, restricting the hosts to just three shots in total during the first half.\nZaha handed the visitors the lead in first-half injury time, but Pope will be disappointed to have let the ball squirm past him at the near post.\nSean Dyche's side improved after the break but top scorer Ashley Barnes was replaced by Jay Rodriguez after a quiet hour, and strike partner Wood spurned their best opportunities.\nThe New Zealand international latched on to Cheikhou Kouyate's misplaced header back towards Vicente Guaita, but with only the keeper to beat from six yards out, he shot over the crossbar.\nPalace doubled their lead against the run of play when Mee made a hash of his unopposed clearance to play the ball over his head, back towards his own goal, and Schlupp made no mistake.\nBurnley continued to push forward but Guaita pulled off another brilliant save to deny Wood, who diverted the ball towards goal off his back to highlight his disappointing afternoon.\nThe hosts have now lost all three home games this season in which they have conceded.\nLow-scoring Palace show clinical edge\nLeague goals have been a concern for Roy Hodgson's side this season. Before kick-off, only bottom side Watford, with eight, had scored fewer than Palace's 11.\nBut the visitors, who had not won since 5 October, were aided by their hosts' mistakes and took their chances with aplomb.\nZaha is crucial to Palace's hopes and the forward appears to have put his quiet start to the season behind him. Having scored his first goal of the campaign against Liverpool a week ago, he struck a second in two games against Burnley.\nThe Ivorian showed he was up for the battle at Turf Moor when he clashed with Phil Bardsley in the second half - and he also made more key passes (two) and won more fouls (three) than any of his team-mates.\nThe opener came when he quickly shifted the ball to his left foot to beat Bardsley before firing past Pope in clinical fashion.\nSchlupp was introduced off the bench to increase the visitors' threat on the break, as Burnley continued to search for the equaliser. Hodgson's decision paid off when the substitute secured all three points as Palace maintained their 100% conversion rate from just two shots on target.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\n'We got sucked in' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I think we got sucked in to what Palace do. We could not break it down and then we let in a soft goal just before half-time. I thought we improved in the second half. I think you have to give credit to Palace; they slow the game down.\n\"We were not a million miles off but it just did not quite gel. We have moved a long way from last season. We try to build an environment where we can move. Disappointed today but not disappointed overall.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I think the way we got the balance right between having to defend and attacking was really good. The way Burnley throw balls into the area is hard to defend time after time again.\n\"It's a very good victory, we are very satisfied with the result and the performance. We are grateful for the three points but now we need to use this feeling going forwards.\"\nOn Wilfried Zaha: \"Zaha has been extremely good in recent games. He has not allowed players to aggravate him and that is really important. We are also getting a lot out of him defensively. He works very very hard; it's an important factor in us winning the game.\"\nPalace win again outside the capital - the stats\nCrystal Palace have won their past four league meetings with Burnley, as many victories as they managed in their previous 18 encounters (W4 D8 L6).\nBurnley have lost four of their past six Premier League games (W2), after losing just two of the eight before that.\nPalace ended a run of five Premier League games without a win and kept a clean sheet for the first time in seven in the competition.\nBurnley mustered 15 shots in total against Crystal Palace, the most they have managed in a Premier League home game without scoring since August 2017 (20 v West Brom).\nPalace have won six of their past seven Premier League games played outside of London (L1).\nWilfried Zaha has scored two goals in his past two Premier League games for Crystal Palace, as many as he managed in his previous 21.\nZaha scored with Crystal Palace's first shot on target of the game.\nPalace midfielder Jeffrey Schlupp netted for the first time in 21 Premier League games, since scoring against Fulham in February.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley return to Turf Moor to take on defending champions Manchester City on Tuesday, 3 December (20:15 GMT), while Crystal Palace host Bournemouth on the same night (19:30)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 Bournemouth: Mourinho praises Alli after third win\nJose Mourinho hailed Dele Alli's \"phenomenal\" contribution as the midfielder starred in Tottenham's third straight win under their new Portuguese boss.\nWhile Bournemouth mounted a late fightback, Alli's two goals helped Spurs to their first back-to-back Premier League victories this season as they moved up to fifth in the table.\nThe 23-year-old has now scored three goals in three games, including their midweek Champions League win, after scoring just three in 23 appearances before Mauricio Pochettino's departure.\n\"He plays in a position where he feels happy and comfortable,\" Mourinho said of Alli. \"We also give him space for his creativity which he always has.\n\"I think he played three phenomenal matches since I arrived.\"\nToby Alderweireld's raking pass created Alli's opener, with the England midfielder racing on to Son Heung-min's touch to tap the ball past Cherries goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.\nAlli's second came from the same source, as he superbly controlled Alderweireld's pass before holding off Jack Stacey and flicking the ball over Ramsdale.\nWhen Moussa Sissoko added Spurs' third goal with a close-range volley from Son's exemplary cross, the hosts appeared to be en route to an emphatic win.\nFollow all Saturday's Premier League action and reaction\nTottenham v Bournemouth as it happened\nBut Bournemouth substitute Harry Wilson scored a superb free-kick and then reduced their arrears further six minutes into stoppage time.\nHowever, it proved too little too late for the Cherries, who have now conceded 16 goals on their last five visits to Tottenham, and have dropped to 12th in the league.\n\"The disappointing thing is to concede two goals from long balls. That killed us,\" said manager Eddie Howe.\n\"We should have dealt with them better. These are not the type of goals you expect to concede coming here.\"\nJose all smiles and Alli reborn\nWhile smiles were in short supply towards the end of Mourinho's tenure at Manchester United, the Portuguese manager has started life at Tottenham with a cheerful and airy disposition.\nWith his proclamations of humility, celebrations with ball boys and decisions to deploy players into positions they favour, his approach has clearly had the desired effect.\nHis new employers have so far reaped the rewards, and this was the first time Spurs have won three consecutive matches (across all competitions) since April.\nWhile this was far from a vintage performance overall, one player who appears to have benefitted under the new regime is Alli.\nThis game suggested he is not only back to his influential best as a playmaker behind Harry Kane and Son, but also as someone capable of making a considerable contribution in front of goal.\nHis first goal on Saturday was all about anticipation and timing, running adjacent to Son and ensuring he was on hand to deliver the simplest of finishes.\nHis second showcased all of his talents - running power, control, strength and the composure in front of goal to apply the deftest of touches under pressure.\n\"For me Dele is not a midfield player, he is a player to play like he is playing, close to Harry. I think this is the best position for him,\" added Mourinho.\n\"He's the best thing that can happen to a coach because everybody speaks about him, you [media], the fans speak about him for the right reasons. He's playing really, really, really well and I could not ask any more from him.\"\nWhile Alli was unable to register his first hat-trick for the club, it was still his first two-goal haul in a home game for Tottenham since January 2017 and ensured he received a standing ovation when he was withdrawn late on.\nSame old story for Bournemouth\nWhile Mourinho or Alli will deservedly take the acclaim, this all had a touch of deja vu for Bournemouth, who arrived in London seeking to avoid their third straight defeat.\nDespite their attractive football, they once again struggled against one of the Premier League's established top-six teams.\nThe Cherries have managed two away victories in 26 games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, both Manchester clubs and Tottenham - a miserable run that could have been made all the worse by a hammering here.\nFrustratingly though for the Cherries supporters, their team came to life at 3-0 down, largely due to Harry Wilson's endeavour.\nThe 22-year-old Wales midfielder, who was surprisingly omitted from the starting XI, signalled his intent with a shot on goal a minute after being brought on.\nHis trademark free-kick, which flew into the top right corner from 20 yards, ensured that no other Premier League players has scored more goals from outside the penalty area this season.\n\"Harry Wilson is a goalscorer, and we had other moments during the game,\" Howe added.\n\"It is just a shame we were coming back from 3-0 down. In this league if you're not quite where you need to be you can get punished.\"\nMan of the match - Dele Alli (Tottenham)\nSissoko ends goal drought - the stats\nTottenham have registered back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time this season, last doing so in April.\nBournemouth have lost three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2018 (a run of four).\nTottenham conceded 20 shots against Bournemouth, last conceding more at home in a Premier League game in September 2015 against Manchester City (22).\nDele Alli has been directly involved in three goals in his two Premier League games for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho (2 goals, 1 assist), as many as he managed in his last 12 under Mauricio Pochettino.\nSon Heung-Min has registered 71 Premier League goal involvements (46 goals, 25 assists), 31 more than any other Asian player (Park Ji-Sung on 40).\nMoussa Sissoko scored for the first time in 69 Premier League appearances for Tottenham - since netting against Huddersfield in September 2017.\nNo player has scored more goals from outside the box (3, level with James Maddison) or from direct free-kicks (2, level with Riyad Mahrez) in the Premier League this season than Bournemouth's Harry Wilson.\nSince the start of last season, Bournemouth's Jefferson Lerma has picked up 18 yellow cards in the Premier League, more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United in the Premier League on Wednesday 4 December (19:30 GMT). Bournemouth visit Crystal Palace, also in the Premier League, on Tuesday 3 December (19:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-1 West Ham United: David Martin 'in tears' after Chelsea victory\nGoalkeeper David Martin was \"in tears\" after a debut where West Ham ended a seven-game winless run with victory at Chelsea.\nMartin, the son of Hammers legend Alvin, was picked by boss Manuel Pellegrini instead of Spanish keeper Roberto, who had conceded nine goals in three games.\nAnd it proved an inspired choice as the visitors kept a first clean sheet since 22 September and achieved a first victory at Chelsea for 17 years.\nAaron Cresswell scored the winner three minutes after the break as he cut inside and fired low past Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nChelsea had plenty of chances early on as Christian Pulisic missed the target from a few yards out. The American also wasted a great opportunity late on.\nBut West Ham relieved the pressure on Pellegrini as 33-year-old Martin also made it a Premier League debut to remember.\nThe former Millwall and MK Dons keeper sank to his knees before celebrating in the stands with his father, who played in the West Ham defence for 21 years.\n\"It still doesn't feel real,\" said Martin, who is a boyhood fan. \"I'm just pleased I got through it, I didn't let anyone down and actually I enjoyed it in the end.\n\"My dad didn't say much - I think we were both in tears. For my dad to play for the club for 21 years and see it, and for me to make my debut, keep a clean sheet and get win for the boys, it is so pleasing.\n\"I was struggling to eat for two days; Cressa [Cresswell] was laughing at me because my plate was taken away because I couldn't eat my food.\n\"I hope I've given myself a good chance [to keep my place] but I have to work hard and keep grounded.\"\nVictory lifted West Ham four points clear of the relegation zone while Chelsea failed to close the three-point gap to second-placed Manchester City and Leicester City in third.\nEmotional Martin helps engineer win\nThird-choice keeper Martin came into the side after a woeful run of form by Roberto, which had contributed to the Hammers slipping to one place above the relegation zone before kick-off.\nA lack of confidence in the Spaniard seemed to be affecting the team, who had not kept a clean sheet since their last Premier League win - against Manchester United - more than two months ago.\nAnd prior to the game at Stamford Bridge, there were some reports that Chilean Pellegrini had two games to save his job.\nBut Martin, who was also on Liverpool's books early in his career, seemed to lift his defence as the likes of centre-back Fabian Balbuena were in fine form.\nDespite his nerves in advance of such a momentous occasion, they did not show during the game as he made a fantastic double stop to deny Mateo Kovacic and Oliver Giroud.\nAnd he was roundly cheered during the match by the West Ham fans, who had booed Roberto during the 3-2 defeat by Tottenham last Saturday.\nThe visiting supporters were delirious when they thought their team had gone 2-0 up after 69 minutes, before Michail Antonio's goal was ruled out after a VAR review for handball.\nBut it proved a mere footnote at the final whistle, as Martin was surrounded by his team-mates and began to let a career highlight sink in.\nChelsea pay for profligacy\nAlthough West Ham held firm, Chelsea paid for failing to take their chances with Pulisic perhaps the most guilty after lifting an effort over early on and slicing a chance wide after being put through by substitute N'Golo Kante.\nTo blame Pulisic, who has scored five goals in his last four Premier League games, would be unfair, though. He was among Chelsea's best players as he attacked from the left, with Reece James also showing plenty of endeavour down the right.\nManager Frank Lampard, who had a stellar record against former team West Ham while playing for Chelsea, was missing top scorer Tammy Abraham, who injured his hip in the 2-2 draw at Valencia in the Champions League in midweek.\nThe Chelsea boss also made several changes as Kante started on the bench, and Mason Mount came back into the side where he battled against best friend Declan Rice in midfield.\nBut after the first 25 minutes where they were in the ascendancy, the game changed course after Arrizabalaga saved well from Antonio's header.\nThe visitors grew in confidence from that chance and Chelsea struggled to contain their counter-attacks which eventually led to Cresswell's goal.\nWithout the more mobile Abraham, Chelsea found their best openings came from the wings, but Giroud was poor and Mount was not clinical when he was presented with a sight of goal.\nWillian came on to provide a boost towards the end, but Chelsea showed once again that when they cannot score, teams can find a soft core in their defence.\nThey have now conceded 20 goals in their 14 Premier League games, and following six successive wins, they have now suffered back-to-back defeats following last Saturday's loss at Manchester City.\nMan of the match - David Martin\n'Picking Martin was a risk' - what the managers said\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"It was very difficult [to drop Roberto]. It's a position you must be very careful of when you change it. I gave him the most amount of matches you can as a manager, but at the moment we needed a reaction.\n\"It was a risk with Martin because he had never played before in Premier League but he did very well. They are a complete team and the defenders helped him a lot to keep a clean sheet.\n\"It was a very important win, because we have had results that are not expected or deserved. You must be solid and consistent. That was the major change that we did compared with other games and it allowed us to keep a clean sheet and beat a team like Chelsea who are in a very good moment.\"\nChelsea head coach Frank Lampard: \"We were not at our best, that was very clear. We came up below par and that's something I've not had to say much this season. If anything it's a test for us here and a reality check for us to react very quickly.\n\"We can't use playing in Valencia as an excuse, that's why we have a squad. We didn't create as much as we normally do, and we gave away too many opportunities. For a long time people have given us a lot of credit but football doesn't work like that, it's a test of character for us now.\n\"Tammy has been playing well and scoring goals, and when we lose him you're looking for goals not just in his area but different areas of pitch. We didn't have a enough punch in the final third in our game. We missed Tammy but that is not an excuse.\"\nChelsea fail to make a single foul - the best stats\nWest Ham ended a run of 13 games without victory at Stamford Bridge (D4 L9).\nWest Ham's Aaron Cresswell has scored three goals in just nine Premier League appearances this season, his best-ever scoring return in a single campaign in the competition.\nChelsea didn't concede a single foul in this game, the first time they've ever done so in an entire Premier League game since Opta started recording data (2003-04).\nChelsea are yet to gain a single point from a losing position in the Premier League this season, losing all four games in which they've fallen behind this term.\nChelsea had 19 shots in this match but failed to score - their most in a league match at Stamford Bridge without finding the net since January 2018 against Bournemouth (21).\nWhat next?\nChelsea host Aston Villa on Wednesday (kick-off 19:30 GMT) before travelling to Everton next Saturday (12:30). West Ham are at Wolves on Wednesday (19:30) before hosting Arsenal the following Monday (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 2-1 Watford: I suffer for fans, players and owner - Sanchez Flores\nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores said he \"suffers\" for the fans, players and owner after defeat at fellow strugglers Southampton.\nThe Saints came from behind to win with late goals from Danny Ings and James Ward-Prowse, easing the pressure on their own boss Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl and leaving the Hornets bottom of the Premier League.\nSanchez Flores said: \"I suffer for the fans, I suffer for the players and I suffer for the owner.\n\"It's a difficult time for our fans after we had the feeling we were in the right way.\n\"Little by little the circumstances in the second half they change. They're a very good team also and they have a little change and finally the score was against us again.\n\"One goal for us now is a tragedy, even when we are in control of the match it's a tragedy.\"\nHe added: \"I came here and I'm trying and fighting a lot, although the circumstances are bad for us.\"\nThe hosts appeared set for a damaging defeat until Ings bundled home Moussa Djenepo's cross with 12 minutes remaining.\nWard-Prowse then found the top corner with a superb free-kick five minutes later to complete the turnaround.\nIsmaila Sarr had given the Hornets a deserved lead in the first half, capitalising on poor defending by Jack Stephens before lifting the ball beyond Alex McCarthy for his first Premier League goal.\nSouthampton's first league win since September moves them above Norwich and to within two points of safety, while Watford remain six points adrift of 17th place.\nSecond-half substitutions inspire Saints\nOnly Southampton's profligacy prevented them from leaving Arsenal's Emirates Stadium with all three points last weekend.\nHasenh\u00fcttl's side managed 21 shots against the Gunners in north London, but they started anxiously against the Hornets and almost fell behind within the first two minutes.\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg's stray back-pass fell straight into the path of Sarr, who could only drill his shot into the arms of McCarthy.\nSaints remained nervous in possession as the half wore on with Stephens bundling an attempted clearance into the path of Sarr, allowing the Senegal forward to race clear and stroke home the opener.\nBoos greeted Michael Oliver's half-time whistle, but there was little change to the pattern of play until the introductions of Boufal and Shane Long 13 minutes into the second half.\nRepublic of Ireland forward Long twice struck the woodwork, seeing his header tipped on to the crossbar by Ben Foster before scuffing another shot against the post from close range.\nIngs eventually restored parity after fine work by Djenepo on the right as he worked his way into the box with some excellent footwork, before Ward-Prowse curled a magnificent free-kick beyond Foster as Southampton won after trailing at half-time for only the second time in 44 league matches.\nHornets made to rue missed opportunities\nHaving admitted he was under pressure in the build-up to this game, Flores has now picked up just seven points from a possible 30 since replacing Javi Gracia as head coach in September.\nWatford's haul of eight points after 14 games is also their worst ever return at this stage of a Premier League campaign.\nThe Hornets were much the better side in the early stages, restricting their hosts to efforts from distance while attacking with purpose at the other end.\nSarr, who was handed his third Premier League start of the season in place of Andre Gray, was a constant threat to the home defence, easily shrugging off Stephens before lifting the ball confidently over McCarthy for the opener.\nThe summer signing went close to doubling his tally either side of half-time, volleying straight at McCarthy from close range in the first half before sending a curling effort over the crossbar in the second.\nFlores will feel his team should have been out of sight by that stage, but there appeared little danger of Watford surrendering their narrow lead as the visitors continued to hold firm.\nThat all changed in the final quarter of an hour, however, as Southampton's late pressure finally told.\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)\nOver-reliant on Ings and Ward-Prowse? - the stats\nSouthampton ended a run of eight Premier League games without a win (D2 L6).\nWatford have registered just one win in their past 18 Premier League games, drawing six and losing 11.\nWatford's Sarr is the 27th Senegalese player to score in the Premier League, with only Nigeria boasting more different scorers (31) among African nations.\nIngs has netted seven of Southampton's 15 Premier League goals this season, (46.7%), the highest proportion of a side's goals by a player in the competition in 2019-20.\nEach of Southampton's last 10 Premier League goals has been scored by either Ings (6) or Ward-Prowse (4).\nOnly Matt le Tissier (7) has scored more direct free-kick goals for Southampton in the Premier League than Ward-Prowse (5).\n'Let's do it again on Wednesday' - what the managers said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, speaking to Match of the Day: \"The first half was a completely different performance to last weekend and it was unbelievable it could happen.\n\"At half-time, we were very critical and in the second half it was a good reaction. After 10 minutes we made two subs and they had a big impact in the game and it was a big big win for us.\n\"We have not had one good start so far this season. Now we have to push it away and our crowd deserve it. Let's do it again on Wednesday [when they host Norwich].\"\nWatford head coach Quique Sanchez Flores, speaking to Match of the Day: \"At half-time we had the feel that we were in a match we wanted. But they went up another level and we didn't do the same.\"\nOn his future: \"I cannot control it. When we lose we can say sorry to the fans, the owners and players, but we have the same feeling, we want to fight.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Norwich City in another key game at the bottom of the Premier League on Wednesday, 4 December (kick-off 19:30 GMT), while Watford travel to high-flying Leicester City at the same time."

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-1 Sheffield United: Matt Doherty header denies Blades\nWolves remain sixth in the Premier League after Matt Doherty's equaliser against Sheffield United extended their unbeaten run to nine games.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side were second best until Doherty headed in Raul Jimenez's cross after 64 minutes.\nBut they finished the game stronger as the Blades, who were fortunate not to have George Baldock sent off, hung on to extend their unbeaten run to six games.\nIt was a sharp contrast from earlier in the match as the visitors took the lead after 63 seconds.\nLys Mousset took a touch from Baldock's right-wing cross before firing in his fifth goal of the season.\nBut Chris Wilder's team paid for costly misses by David McGoldrick early in the second half when they were in the ascendancy.\nSheffield United, who have not lost away in the league since January, remain a place below Wolves in seventh.\nMousset underlines value to Blades\nWilder would have been pleased his side continued their impressive start to the season, especially as Baldock rode his luck by avoiding a second yellow when he fouled Diogo Jota with 10 minutes left.\nBut it was a game where Mousset's value was underlined once again, especially as McGoldrick showed why he has not scored this season.\nMousset did not have much Premier League pedigree when he was at former club Bournemouth, scoring only five goals during three seasons after signing from French side Le Havre for about \u00a35m in 2015.\nBut the 23-year-old, who was captured by the Blades for a then-club record \u00a310m in July, has proven a key player for Wilder's side by adding crucial goals to the team's defensive solidity.\nGiven he has scored five goals and has three assists, while his fellow strikers have struggled, the Blades' lofty league position would be far inferior without him.\nHe wasted little time in making his mark at Molineux and set up John Fleck for what should have been a second after 38 minutes when he nutmegged Leander Dendoncker, but the Blades midfielder's low shot was saved by Rui Patricio.\nAlthough McGoldrick was full of endeavour, he toiled in front of goal. The Republic of Ireland international had two chances to double the lead when the Blades were well on top after the break. Both times he could not beat Wolves keeper Patricio.\nIt proved costly when Doherty headed in at the back post minutes later, with McGoldrick failing to track his runner.\nHe was eventually substituted to be replaced by Oli McBurnie, who had a late chance to win it when he headed over, but Wilder will not mind too much about McGoldrick's form while his team are still picking up points.\nWolves resilience impresses again\nThe draw meant that Wolves matched a top-flight unbeaten run last set by the club in 1973.\nMore pleasing for Nuno will be the way his side reacted to going behind, especially as they played against Braga in Portugal in the Europa League on Thursday.\nThis was their 27th game of the season and their resilience in combining both domestic and European form after a stuttering start to the campaign has been impressive.\nThey looked rusty as the visitors took the lead early on but once Jimenez tested Dean Henderson with a header after 18 minutes, they found their feet, and Adama Traore was a dangerous outlet down the right as he outmuscled Enda Stevens on several occasions.\nHad there been better composure from Sheffield United's forwards, the hosts may not have been able to respond, yet Doherty's goal seemed to provide a catalyst.\nIt was an emotional goal as he kissed his black armband in tribute to former Wolves team-mate Benik Afobe, who has lost his two-year-old daughter.\nWolves, who handed a first Premier League start to defender Max Kilman, making him the first former England futsal player to play a full game in the top flight, pressed for a winner.\nHowever, Sheffield United's desperate defending kept clear-cut chances at a premium as the scores remained level.\nMan of the match - Lys Mousset\n'It meant a lot for Doherty to score' - manager reaction\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It's very demanding on the players but it is a good challenge. We must use it to grow and improve as a team. We don't have time to practice, we rest and we repeat. I'm very proud. The draw was well deserved.\n\"It means a lot for [Matt] Doherty to score today - he had some bad news about a dear friend of his. It was a bad moment in his life so I wish him well. It meant a lot for him and it meant a lot for us as a team.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder: \"We started both halves terrifically. We had plenty of chances and we should have scored more than one.\n\"We knew they'd fight back after we went ahead because of the fight they have as a team. This is always a tough place to come so I'm delighted we've kept our away record going.\n\"Lys Mousset showed he can finish against Man Utd and he showed it again today. His partnership with David McGoldrick is going brilliant, too. We're doing a lot of things right at the moment - both with and without the ball.\n\"We were disappointed with their goal but I'm delighted with how we adapted our game plan.\"\nBlades continue fine away form - the best stats\nSheffield United are the first newly promoted side to remain unbeaten in their first seven top-flight away games since Blackburn in 1992-93 (W1 D6).\nLys Mousset's goal in the second minute is Sheffield United's second earliest goal scored in a Premier League match, behind only Dane Whitehouse's first-minute opener against Everton in August 1993.\nMatt Doherty scored in back-to-back games in all competitions for Wolves for the first time since December 2016.\nRaul Jimenez has been directly involved in 21 goals in 25 appearances in all competitions this season (15 goals, 6 assists) - the most of any Premier League player.\nWhat's next?\nWolves host West Ham on Wednesday (kick-off 19:30 GMT) while Sheffield United entertain Newcastle United on Thursday (19:30)."

        "article_text": "Norwich City 2-2 Arsenal: Freddie Ljungberg says Gunners can '100%' make the top four\nArsenal can \"100%\" make the top four according to Freddie Ljungberg, whose first match as interim manager ended in a draw against struggling Norwich.\nThe Gunners, with the Swede at the helm after Unai Emery was sacked on Friday, have not won for eight games.\nThe result leaves Arsenal eighth in the Premier League, seven points off a place in the top four, while Norwich remain 19th, three points from safety.\nHowever, asked if they can get into one of the automatic Champions League spots, the 42-year-old said: \"Yes, 100%. Like you have seen, people drop points here and there and we drop points and it is a bit of a crazy league at the moment.\"\nWhile Arsenal started brightly, familiar defensive failings resurfaced as Teemu Pukki ended his eight-game goal drought with a shot that deflected off Shkodran Mustafi.\n'Astonishing how often Arsenal just retreat' - Keown analysis\nAll the Premier League reaction\nThe hosts' lead only lasted eight minutes though, with Christoph Zimmermann penalised for handball and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang levelling for the visitors with a retaken penalty, after four Norwich players had encroached when his original effort was saved by Tim Krul.\nMore calamitous defending allowed Todd Cantwell to re-establish Norwich's lead, with the midfielder slicing through the Gunners defence and placing an effort into the bottom corner on the stroke of half-time.\nHowever, Aubameyang again drew the visitors level, turning in a loose ball from a corner to ensure Arsenal gained a share of the points.\nNew boss, same leaky defence\nArsenal have a number of issues that they will need to resolve before they can hope to compete for a Premier League title again, and the most pressing remains in defence.\nThe Gunners arrived in Norfolk having kept just two clean sheets in the league all season and left with the joint worst defensive record of any club in the top half of the table.\nAn absence of leadership or quality in central defensive areas appears a fundamental flaw and not one easily addressed in the short term by Ljungberg.\nArsenal have bought defenders in recent years, but none fit the mould of a Tony Adams, Sol Campbell or Martin Keown, who were known for being commanding and who seemed to enjoy nullifying their direct opponents.\nFor both Norwich goals, Arsenal's current central defenders played a passive role. With the opener, David Luiz was not tight enough to prevent Pukki from turning once he had reached Kenny McLean's ball forward.\nThe Brazilian and his defensive partner Mustafi compounded matters by standing off and inviting the Finland forward to shoot.\nFor Norwich's second, Cantwell was allowed to run towards the Arsenal goal and Mustafi remained stationary as the England Under-21 international placed his effort into the far right corner from the left of the area.\nOn a trying afternoon for Luiz and Mustafi, Pukki was unfortunate not to add to his tally after turning the German inside out.\nThe duo were also thankful to goalkeeper Bernd Leno for pushing McLean's effort on to the post after he had run through the centre of the Arsenal defence unchecked.\nUnfortunate Norwich\nWhile Norwich may remain in the bottom three, they can consider themselves unfortunate not to have claimed back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since April 2016.\nThey matched the Gunners for shots on target and arguably had better chances overall in a performance full of energy, grit and determination.\nPukki's willing running provided an outlet from which to launch attacks, while Ibrahim Amadou showed plenty of industry in midfield and Max Aarons was solid at right-back.\nDaniel Farke's side also appear to have been buoyed by the renewal of their first-choice central defensive partnership - Christoph Zimmermann and Ben Godfrey.\nThe solidity of that pairing was noticeable when the Canaries captain returned from injury at Everton eight days ago, and while the German conceded a penalty here he was otherwise excellent.\nThe 26-year-old read the game in exemplary fashion throughout and completed more clearances (eight) than any other player.\nMan of the match - Max Aarons (Norwich)\n'Only winning that counts' - what they said\nArsenal interim manager Freddie Ljungberg told Sky Sports: \"We started the game really well, that's how I want to play football.\n\"But we need to work on the transitions, we dominated and they break us too easily. In the beginning I saw a lot of things we worked on in training, but we need to score goals and take the lead. I want this club to do well, it is only winning that counts. I wanted to win the games so I am disappointed but I have also seen some positive things.\nOn the penalty incident: \"From what I heard it was quite obvious, that's what the results are for. The most important thing was for Aubameyang to have the mental strength to score the second penalty after missing the first one.\"\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke told Match of the Day: \"We put a great performance today against a great side: one point against Arsenal is always a great result. But we deserved to take all the three points.\n\"In general I was not happy with the quality of the decisions, each and every throw-in or corner-kick was given against us. Also the situation that led to the penalty against us, it was never a free kick on [Granit] Xhaka.\n\"And to retake this penalty was also a strange decision, just because somebody's foot was inside the area. There were some strange decisions against us.

        "article_text": "Man Utd 2-2 Aston Villa: Red Devils held by resolute Villans\nManager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United's league position is not a concern after a home draw with Aston Villa left them ninth after 14 games.\nTyrone Mings' first Premier League goal levelled the scores shortly after Victor Lindelof had given United a 64th-minute lead, though, the England defender did have to wait to see if it would be ruled out by the assistant video referee (VAR).\nBut the assistant referee kept his flag down and VAR proved he was correct to do so as Villa avoided defeat at Old Trafford for the first time since 2009.\nVilla skipper Jack Grealish gave his side a deserved lead with a magnificent curling shot after 11 minutes only for United to equalise against the run of play just before the interval when a Marcus Rashford header hit the inside of a post before bouncing in off the back of former United keeper Tom Heaton.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's men pushed forward looking for a late winner but Anthony Martial failed to convert their best chance as United had to settle for a second successive draw against a promoted team.\nUnited have now taken just 18 points from their opening 14 league games. That means Solskjaer must guide them to wins in their next three games if they are to surpass the 26 points Jose Mourinho amassed when he was sacked after 17 games in 2018-19.\n\"I wouldn't have sat here and talked about us being fifth if we had got that one goal extra, so the league table at this point is not the biggest concern because it is so tight,\" Solskjaer said.\n\"I just need to make sure that we get performances and get three or four performances after each other - and results.\n\"So far we have had the lead in so many games and we haven't been able to win those games, six or seven times we've been 1-0 up, or 2-1, or 3-2 like last week.\n\"We should be better at seeing those games into wins.\"\nAs it happened: Man Utd 2-2 Aston Villa\nNo improvement from United\nSeven days ago, Solskjaer said he could have replaced all 10 outfield players after an especially dismal first half at Sheffield United.\nThe general feeling in the media room - from journalists, former players and staff alike - was that their performance before the break here had been no better.\nThere was no obvious benefit gained from Solskjaer's decision to excuse his entire starting line-up, plus coaches Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna, from the draining midweek Europa League trip to Astana.\nUnited's equaliser came against the run of play and the lack of invention in midfield contrasted sharply with the threat posed by Grealish.\nThere were sporadic boos for the home side at the final whistle but in a period where Tottenham and Arsenal have both sacked their managers, United are behind both in the table, putting Solskjaer under scrutiny, even if the United hierarchy remain supportive of the Norwegian.\nGrealish a throwback\nWith his socks rolled down and his shorts pulled up, Grealish looks like a throwback to a different era.\nHe plays a bit like it too. Pulling wide to the left of a three-man support line to lone striker Wesley, the Aston Villa skipper seems a peripheral figure for much of the time.\nBut somehow, when Villa spark into life, he is central to it. United's midfield were petrified every time Grealish ran at them. Most of the time, their only way of stopping the danger was to foul him.\nFor the goal, Grealish chased down an over-hit Anwar el Ghazi cross before fronting up Andreas Pereira on the edge of the penalty area, beating him with a deft feint to the right and finally sending his curling shot over David de Gea and into the roof of the United keeper's net.\nIt was magnificent, way beyond anything produced by the hosts during another tepid 45 minutes.\nGareth Southgate was not at Old Trafford to witness it but it was another of those moments that makes you wonder how Grealish is still waiting for a senior England cap.\nHad the 24-year-old turned home Trezeguet's deflected shot shortly before Lindelof's header, it would have been the first time he had ever scored twice in a game.\n'Multi-year squad evolution analysis'\nWith his best two midfielders, Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay, both missing through injury, Solskjaer again had to rely on Andreas Pereira and Fred in his midfield.\nBoth have been heavily criticised this season as part of an underperforming squad containing players some feel are simply not good enough who have, nevertheless, been awarded new contracts in recent times.\nPereira signed a four-year deal in the summer. Phil Jones, the one man dropped from last week's largely dismal draw at Sheffield United, was given a new four-year deal in February.\nBoth decisions seem odd. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward explained the principle in an interview with fanzine 'United We Stand'.\n\"It's a multi-year squad evolution analysis,\" he said.\n\"It's hard enough to get three players done in a transfer window. To get six or seven done is extremely difficult if you are getting proper talent.\n\"If you choose to churn every player because they are not good enough and you're not extending contracts, you are putting yourself at risk of execution. Sometimes you have to take a broader view.\"\nMan of the match - Jack Grealish (Aston Villa)\n'We huffed and puffed' - what they said\nAston Villa defender Tyrone Mings: \"It's a tough point and a well-deserved point. We made a few mistakes in the build-up to their goals, and they had a few chances, so we are satisfied with a point.\n\"I thought I was onside for my goal, but I didn't want to celebrate just in case. I got back into position.\"\nManchester United defender Harry Maguire: \"As a team we are improving but we want to improve a lot more. To not win games at home is disappointing. We huffed and puffed but we need to do better and Wednesday [home to Spurs] gives us a great opportunity to put that right.\n\"We were poor after their first goal. It knocked us and we were edgy and nervous. To concede straight away after going in front its disappointing.\"\nUnited fail to keep clean sheet again - the stats\nManchester United have won just 18 points in the Premier League this season; their fewest after 14 games of a top-flight campaign since 1988-89 (18), when they went on to finish 11th in the table.\nAston Villa avoided defeat against 'big six' opposition for the first time since November 2015 in the Premier League (0-0 v Man City) - they had lost each of their previous 11 such games coming into today.\nSince keeping three consecutive Premier League clean sheets in February, United have only kept two in their last 25 games in the competition (36 goals conceded).\nExcluding penalties, Aston Villa have conceded more goals from set-pieces than any other team in the Premier League this season (nine).\nThere were just 112 seconds between Manchester United taking the lead through Victor Lindelof (63:21) and Tyrone Mings levelling for Villa at 2-2 (65:13).\nVictor Lindelof's goal was just his second in 84 appearances for United in all competitions. They've both been scored at Old Trafford past goalkeeper Tom Heaton - the other coming when he was in goal for Burnley in January.\nVilla named an unchanged starting XI for the fourth time in the Premier League this season - as many as they did in their 49 games in the Championship in 2018-19 (including play-offs).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United are next in action when former manager Jose Mourinho takes his Tottenham side to Old Trafford on Wednesday (19:30 GMT). On the same night, Villa visit Chelsea (also 19:30)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-1 Everton: Kelechi Iheanacho grabs late winner for hosts\nLeicester City inflicted the cruellest of blows on beleaguered Everton manager Marco Silva as Kelechi Iheanacho's stoppage-time winner - awarded by the video assistant referee - kept the Foxes on the heels of Premier League leaders Liverpool.\nSilva appears to be managing Everton on a game-by-game basis after the club's power-brokers met to discuss his future following the dismal home defeat by Norwich City - and it looked like he would claim a precious point here until just seconds before the end of a pulsating game.\nIheanacho placed a composed finish past Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford with the linesman's flag raised for offside but after a lengthy wait, the goal was given amid wild celebrations from Leicester's players and manager Brendan Rodgers as they kept Liverpool's lead at eight points.\nEverton deservedly led at half-time after Richarlison headed in powerfully from Djibril Sidibe's cross, although Leicester had a penalty rightly ruled out by VAR after Ben Chilwell went down in a challenge with Mason Holgate.\nSilva's side were pulled back after 68 minutes when Jamie Vardy arrived unmarked at the back post to steer in Iheanacho's effort as it flew across the face of goal.\nVardy missed a good chance to win it for Leicester but then came that dramatic finale - and now Silva must wait to see if he is in charge for Wednesday's Merseyside derby at Anfield.\nFollow all the Premier League reaction\nCan Silva survive?\nEverton manager Silva was seconds away from a result that may just have offered him breathing space and respite from the sense he is one defeat away from dismissal.\nSilva's players had battled for their manager and put a shift in that was a sharp contrast to the capitulation against Norwich City at Goodison Park. If Everton had left King Power Stadium with a point, no-one would have begrudged them and he may have earned himself some wriggle room.\nInstead it was more heartbreak and pressure for the 42-year-old Portuguese, who once again saw an Everton game heavily influenced by VAR, as it was when they lost controversially at Brighton after a penalty harshly awarded against Michael Keane saw a lead eventually turn to defeat.\nEverton pushed Leicester all the way and, with more of a cutting edge, could have cashed in on spells when they were comfortable and in relative control, with Sidibe causing all sorts of problems down the right flank.\nSilva was animated, his players dug deep - and yet the manager was left broken again and looking a lonely figure as Leicester players and staff danced in jubilation after that most dramatic of conclusions.\nAll eyes will now turn towards the Everton boardroom, with majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, chairman Bill Kenwright and director of football Marcel Brands having already discussed Silva's future before this game.\nThis was not the performance of a team trying to get its manager the sack but it is another loss - and Silva's fate is sure to be the subject of more discussion before Wednesday's visit to Premier League leaders Liverpool in the Merseyside derby.\nLeicester take a leaf out of Liverpool's book\nLiverpool's relentless charge towards what would be a first Premier League title for 30 years has been built on battling through periods of adversity before emerging victorious late on, as they have done in recent times against the likes of Tottenham, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Leicester City.\nLeicester City copied the good habits of their main title rivals to see off an Everton side in dogged and defiant mood, trailing until well into the second half before picking up momentum from Vardy's equaliser then snatching that winner.\nIt is what teams chasing titles do, pick up points even when they are not at their best and this was a reminder to Liverpool that the Foxes are not going away any time soon.\nLeicester's case is helped considerably by having Vardy, who is playing as well as at any time in his career and has now scored 22 Premier League goals since Rodgers arrived as manager in early March - more goals than any of the side's other players.\nVardy has scored in six successive league games and has scored 13 in his last 13.\nWhile there is this much life in Vardy, there will be plenty of life in Leicester's title challenge.\nMan of the match - Kelechi Iheanacho\n'We didn't deserve it at all' - what they said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers speaking to BBC Sport: \"I thought we deserved it. It was difficult in the first half, they sat in but we tried to stay positive and play our offensive game. To come from behind as well demonstrates the quality and mindset of this team to keep going.\n\"In any good team you have to have that. The best teams have spirit. This is a team that is so strong together. Kelechi is a wonderful demonstration of someone who trains with a great attitude every day. They allow this team to develop to the level it has been at because they work hard in training.\n\"Momentum is really important. I'm just so happy to see the players have the patience and the belief that they can consistently get results. We found a way with quality and determination. It's a very good win, now we have a big game again here on Wednesday.\"\nOn his conversation with substitute Kelechi Iheanacho: \"It was just to give him the confidence to get him to do what we wanted him to. We had a shape we wanted to go to; it was giving him the confidence and reinforcing his role. The rest was him. I'm absolutely delighted for him.\"\nEverton manager Marco Silva speaking to Match of the Day: \"It's really harsh for us - we didn't deserve it at all. We deserved to take something more in this game.\n\"Nothing to say about the attitude and commitment. We were playing against a confident team. Of all their games at home this might have been the toughest they had. In the beginning of the second half it was good for us. We created some good moments to kill the game.\n\"But they have a top striker who in one moment can kill us. The VAR goal (...) was tough for us and our fans. It was a decision, and maybe in some seconds before we should have made better decisions.\n\"I have no doubts that I don't have their [players] backing. No-one can say nothing about the attitude of my players. They showed a reaction for the last game.\"\nVardy's hot streak - the stats\nLeicester scored only their sixth-ever 90th-minute winning goal in a Premier League match - three of which have come since the start of last season (Maguire v Southampton, Morgan v Burnley, Iheanacho today).\nLeicester have won six consecutive top-flight matches for the first time since their club-record run of seven in March 1963.\nEverton have conceded more 90th-minute goals than any other Premier League team this season (four).\nEverton failed to win for the first time in 10 Premier League games in which they scored the opening goal.\nEverton have won just once in their last 10 away league outings, drawing three and losing six.\nLeicester conceded a goal for the first time in five Premier League games, ending a run of 446 minutes without shipping a goal in the competition for Brendan Rodgers' side since Chris Wood's goal against them for Burnley in October.\nJamie Vardy has scored in six consecutive Premier League games for Leicester (eight goals), his best streak since his record-breaking 11-match run in November 2015.\nOnly against Arsenal (nine) and Liverpool (seven) has Leicester striker Jamie Vardy scored more Premier League goals than he has against Everton (six).\nEverton forward Richarlison has scored in back-to-back away games in the Premier League for only the second time, last doing so back in September 2017 with former club Watford.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host bottom club Watford on Wednesday, 4 December (19:30 GMT) in their next Premier League game.\nOn the same evening, in their next Premier League game, Everton travel to Anfield to face league leaders Liverpool in the Merseyside derby (20:15 GMT)."

Palace have won 15 games in 2019 - more than Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham.\nHowever, it did come at a cost. With Sakho now set for a three-match ban and Van Aanholt facing a possible spell on the sidelines, Palace are threadbare in defence with Gary Cahill and Scott Dann already absent through injury.\nOpportunity missed for Cherries\nThree wins in their first six Premier League games gave Bournemouth fans hope of challenging for a top-six finish, but they have lost their way since then with just one win since the end of September.\nBoss Eddie Howe felt his side had done enough to win any one of their previous three games, but the same could not be said about this one as they failed to make the most of the extra man.\nThey lacked urgency and creativity and, as they pushed forward in the closing stages in a desperate bid to end their losing run, left themselves exposed to Palace's effective counter attack.\nWith three of their next four games coming against Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal, this was a fixture Bournemouth really needed to get something from.\nMan of the match - Jeffrey Schlupp\n'It wasn't a lucky win' - what they said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson told Match of the Day: \"It was a great victory. I'm full of praise for what the players did today. To firstly lose your centre-back to a challenge which the referee deems to be a red card, and then to lose a left-back in an area where we have no cover...\n\"The last place we could really cover injuries was at the back, but we did and I thought the players showed an outstanding attitude at the back.\n\"Normally when you win 1-0 with 10 men you think you were lucky, but that wasn't really the case and we had a few chances of our own so I'm delighted for the players.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe told Match of the Day: \"It is a tough one for us to take. We needed to get something from tonight's game and we are hugely disappointed we haven't.\n\"We didn't do enough with the ball and we didn't hurt them enough. Credit to them for how they defended in their shape. We should be able to do better and I have to take responsibility for that.\n\"When you're in this form, it is a tough one to work out, we could have won all of these games but we have lost them narrowly.\"\nLondon woes continue for Bournemouth - the stats\nCrystal Palace have won consecutive Premier League games without conceding a goal in both matches for the first time since August 2018.\nBournemouth have lost four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2018.\nSince their promotion to the Premier League in 2015-16, Bournemouth have seen their opponents pick up 19 red cards, six more than any other side.\nCrystal Palace received their first Premier League red card since Wilfried Zaha was sent off against Southampton in January.\nBournemouth have lost their last six Premier League games in London, conceding 20 goals in the process. The Cherries had lost just one of their previous six in the capital prior to this run (W3 D2).\nSince the start of last season, Bournemouth's Jefferson Lerma has picked 19 yellow cards in the Premier League, more than any other player.\nCrystal Palace midfielder Jeffrey Schlupp has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time ever (142 apps, 10 goals).\nWhat next?\nCrystal Palace head to bottom club Watford on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Bournemouth host Liverpool at the same time."

The team had come away with two narrow wins and a draw in their three visits to Turf Moor under the Catalan.\nThis one did not feel like such hard work.\nThey created plenty of chances against a side just trying to contain them - and thought they had led early on when Jesus flicked in from Angelino's volley but was flagged offside.\nThe 22-year-old did not look like a player out of form - he had not scored in 10 games for club and country - when he curled home from the edge of the box from David Silva's pass.\nKevin de Bruyne - who was involved in the build-up to that goal - was instrumental in midfield with a couple of shots on target, as well as his usual passing game.\nCity looked comfortable all the way through and the second goal came when De Bruyne passed to Bernardo, whose cross was volleyed into the top corner by Jesus.\nThe only Brazilians to score more Premier League goals than Jesus (32) are Liverpool players past and present Philippe Coutinho (41) and Roberto Firmino (52).\nHe went close to a hat-trick when he swept a shot wide of the far post from a tight angle.\nHis return to goalscoring form has come at an important time with the club's record top scorer Sergio Aguero out for a few weeks with a thigh injury.\n\"Sergio is a legend of football. I have to score when I play because Sergio scores every time,\" Jesus said after the game.\nGuardiola told BBC Sport: \"We need him. I am so glad for him because he is an incredible fighter. He needs to score goals. We spoke about him - 'you have to score, my friend; you do a lot of things, but you have to score goals' - and today he did it.\n\"That is what I want, for him to try to be aggressive in this position, to not have doubts. The important thing is how you approach - the mentality. There's never doubt in the quality or the arrogance in the good sense. He is so important and he make two exceptional, brilliant goals.\"\nCity had time for two more goals.\nClub record signing Rodri blasted home on the bounce from outside the box after David Silva's shot was blocked. And Bernardo set up Mahrez, who took on several Burnley defenders before guiding home his 50th Premier League strike.\nThe late Brady goal will be a frustration as it means City have not kept a clean sheet in eight games, since a 3-0 win over Aston Villa on 26 October.\nNot worth Burnley dwelling on defeat\nBurnley will not have identified this game as one they would expect anything from. They have won only once in the past 27 games against the 'big six' in the Premier League.\nManager Sean Dyche said his team had \"made a few mistakes lately, against the big guns, that we can't make again\" and only played Chris Wood up front, relegating Ashley Barnes to the bench.\nThey spent the entire game on the back foot, at one stage with all 11 players in their own penalty area.\nTheir first shot was Dwight McNeil's blocked effort after 42 minutes - and their first effort on target was the youngster's 25-yard free-kick on the hour mark.\nBrady will have enjoyed his late goal - his first in club football since Burnley's win at Bournemouth on 29 November 2017 - set up by his childhood friend Jeff Hendrick, but it was merely a footnote.\nIn such a tight league - with three points the gap behind fifth-placed Crystal Palace and Burnley in 11th - Dyche should not worry too much about this defeat.\n\"City are a top-class side and they showed it tonight,\" he said. \"We kept it tight first half and made it awkward but they were excellent second half and we never got to grips with it.\n\"We didn't come out at all after half-time. They were by far the better side tonight. Whoever beats you it's frustrating. It's been a tough week.\"\nMan of the match - Gabriel Jesus\nMatch stats - Silva almost matches last year's total\nCity have won back-to-back top-flight away games against Burnley for the first time since March 1968.\nThis was the 36th time that Manchester City have won a Premier League game by three or more goals under Pep Guardiola - the most of any team in the competition since the start of the 2016-17 season.\nBurnley have conceded 11 goals in their three home games against \"big six\" opposition in the Premier League this season (L3), compared to only two goals in five home games against the rest (W4 L1).\nCity manager Pep Guardiola is unbeaten in his nine games against Sean Dyche (W8 D1).\nManchester City's Algerian winger Riyad Mahrez became the ninth different player from Africa to reach 50 Premier League goals, netting 39 for Leicester and 11 for Manchester City (177 appearances).\nDavid Silva has made six assists from open play in the Premier League this season; just one fewer than he managed in 33 appearances last term.\nWhat's next?\nCity host Manchester United in the derby on Saturday (17:30 GMT), with Burnley going to Jose Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur (15:00 GMT)."

Mourinho's task is to show his best days are not behind him.\nHe didn't make a particularly brilliant job of that in his last weeks in Manchester and, as happened so often then, tonight he spent long periods in his technical area with his hands in his pockets watching his team get outplayed.\nHis substitutes failed to inspire and with eight goals conceded in four games, Mourinho evidently has some work to do defensively.\nAt the end, he moved to shake Solskjaer's hand before striding purposefully away to try and lift his players.\nDele's delightful goal\nFor months, there had been a debate about what had happened to Dele Alli.\nOnce one of the golden boys of the English game, he had been reduced in influence and effectiveness and lost his place in Gareth Southgate's national squad.\nWho knew the answer was replacing the manager he loved?\nOne of the first things Mourinho did after replacing Mauricio Pochettino was to ask Alli whether it was him or his brother who had been playing for Tottenham in recent times.\nThis is definitely him.\nHis third goal in three Premier League games - he only scored three in his last 17 under Pochettino - was extraordinary.\nFred thought he had the situation under control as the ball looped up on the edge of the six-yard box.\nBut Alli leaned into the Brazilian, then rolled round him after a beautiful piece of control before turning a shot past De Gea into the far corner.\nIt was as breathtaking as the Cristiano Ronaldo-esque 35-yard shot Rashford rattled the bar with - and Mourinho loved it.\nSolskjaer needs help\nIn his pre-match press conference, Solskjaer had dismissed as \"lies\" suggestions he had told his players he would be sacked if United lost against Tottenham, and again at Manchester City on Saturday.\nThe word remains from United that the Norwegian is under no immediate danger of losing his job amid an acceptance from those in senior positions that there will be bumps in the road this season.\nThis was the type of performance that gives credence to Solskjaer's belief genuine progress is being made.\nYet one look at the respective substitutes' bench shows United are crying out for reinforcements when the transfer window opens next month.\nWhereas Mourinho had six experienced full internationals to turn to as he tried to change the game in Tottenham's favour, Solskjaer had two and neither Luke Shaw nor Juan Mata have won a cap for quite some time.\nAt the end, Solskjaer milked the rapturous reception he was given.\nIf Sheffield United and Arsenal fail to win on Thursday, United will stay sixth. In order to stay there, Solskjaer will need more than the crowd behind him.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\n'Rashford's best performance' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaking to BBC Sport: \"You are always happy when you win. The boys are learning and improving all the time but tonight we were fantastic for long, long spells.\n\"The three points are massive for us. We've had too many draws this season and given too many points away from winning positions. It's a great lesson the last two games [Sheffield United and Aston Villa] and we came back in a great manner.\n\"We've started the rebuilding. We've made decisions that we had to and we're looking to build this club to be better again and I can't think short term when I'm trying to do that. When we turn the corner and win three or four games on the run, they will get that Man Utd feeling again.\"\nOn Marcus Rashford: \"It's the best game he's had under me. He was mature and strong against good Premier League players. His penalty was calm and composed, and his [first] goal, we know he's got those strikes in him, and he had three or four chances.\n\"It's like he was back on the playground or in the back garden. We want them to have fun, there's nothing dangerous out there - just 75,00 people wanting to see the best [of them].\"\nTottenham head coach Jose Mourinho, also to BBC Sport: \"We started the second half with a goal that it is impossible to concede.\n\"We were not alert, sleeping at the throw-in and we let [Marcus] Rashford attack. Once he is inside the box it's more difficult to defend and he was clever and waited for the touch. In the first half they started more aggressive and more intense and deserved to be in front, maybe even 2-0, then we took control of the game.\n\"The goal at the start of the second half gave United the chance to play the way they did.\"\nOn Dele Alli: \"Dele is fine, he gave a good performance and tried everything, even in the second half when it's more difficult and they are more compact.\"\nOn Marcus Rashford: \"When he plays from the left he is really dangerous and I knew that and gave the players the best information about it. His first goal is a typical Rashford goal coming on the inside. Our boys knew that clearly.\"\nUnited blues continue for Tottenham - the stats\nManchester United are unbeaten in their last nine home matches in all competitions (W5 D4) since losing 2-1 to Crystal Palace in August.\nTottenham Hotspur have lost more Premier League matches against Manchester United than against any other team (35 defeats).\nFormer Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has won none of his last five away Premier League matches against the Red Devils (D3 L2), failing to beat four different managers in that time (Ferguson, Moyes, van Gaal and Solskjaer).\nMarcus Rashford has been directly involved in 11 goals in his last 10 appearances in all competitions for Manchester United (9 goals, 2 assists).\nDele Alli has scored in three consecutive appearances for Tottenham Hotspur in all competitions for the first time since March 2017 (a run of four).\nManchester United have lost none of their last 138 home Premier League matches when scoring first (W125 D13).\nTottenham have conceded twice in all of their four matches under Mourinho in all competitions - they only had a run of conceding 2+ goals in four consecutive matches once under Mauricio Pochettino, doing so in February and March 2015.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United are next in action against Manchester City at Etihad Stadium on Saturday, 7 December (17:30 GMT). Tottenham are at home to Burnley on the same day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 2-0 West Ham: Leander Dendoncker & Patrick Cutrone goals extends unbeaten run to 10\nWolves are on their best unbeaten run in the top flight since 1972 after seeing off West Ham with strikes from Leander Dendoncker and Patrick Cutrone at Molineux.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side are back up to fifth in the Premier League after the Hammers failed to reproduce the kind of display that helped them to a shock win against Chelsea.\nIt has been quite a turnaround for the Midlands side, who failed to record a win in their first six games but have now not lost any of their past 10, a run that began after their 5-2 home defeat by Chelsea on 14 September.\nSpanish winger Adama Traore has played a key role over this period and was excellent again on Wednesday, but the goals came from Dendoncker and substitute Cutrone. The Belgian defender gave Wolves the lead when he poked in from Joao Moutinho's corner in the 23rd minute, before Cutrone found the corner with a low drive, two minutes after replacing Raul Jimenez.\nWest Ham's best chances fell the way of Pablo Fornals and Robert Snodgrass. Fornals forced a good save from Rui Patricio with a curling shot, before Snodgrass' heavy touch allowed the Portuguese keeper to snuff out the danger.\nReaction to all of Wednesday's Premier League matches\nTraore terrific for Wolves\nThe Wolves supporters were singing Traore's name within the first 20 minutes of the match. Praised by manager Nuno for his performance in the side's 2-1 win against Bournemouth last month, he followed that with another excellent run-out against Sheffield United on Sunday.\nOn Wednesday, the former Barcelona player gave Aaron Cresswell and Fornals a workout right from the first whistle. The 23-year-old has always been lauded for his great pace, but his crossing has improved noticeably this campaign.\nHe provide two great balls from the right in the opening quarter, one of which needed a headed clearance from Fabian Balbuena to prevent Jimenez from nodding in.\nJimenez, with seven goals in the past nine Wolves games, also produced a bright display. His excellent surge and cross from the right would have resulted in Wolves' second had Jonny kept his composure with keeper David Martin to beat.\nThe former Benfica player also should have done better with his strike, from Traore's through-ball, which was beaten away by the Hammers keeper.\nWolves' two goals were very different. The first owed a lot to the Hammers' poor marking, as they allowed Dendoncker space to poke home Moutinho's dead ball.\nAnd the second was a result of Jonny's superb lung-busting run which was followed by a pinpoint finish from Cutrone.\nHaller disappoints for the Hammers\nWest Ham were poor. Striker Sebastien Haller, who joined the club for \u00a345m in the summer and scored three goals in his three games, was once again anonymous having replaced Michail Antonio in attack.\nHis one and only effort was an angled dinked shot from eight yards that cleared Patricio's bar by a few feet.\nTeam-mate Fornals was far better in attack. His strike tested the agility of the Wolves keeper before he set up Snodgrass, whose awful second touch allowed Patricio to make a save.\nThe former Scotland international was injured in the incident when his stretched leg collided with the goalkeeper, and was substituted as a consequence.\nManuel Pellegrini's side have now only managed one win in their past nine league games.\nMan of the match - Adama Traore (Wolves)\n'We're always competing' - reaction\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to Match of the Day about their 10-match unbeaten league run: \"I'm proud of the players and fans. Everybody was part of it. Everything we've achieved is common effort. It's the way we embrace our effort.\"\nOn success during an the intense schedule: \"We're trying to create habits and routines we didn't have, but want to have on a daily basis. Every day we have to be committed. It's about the way players play, rest, recover, eat and sleep. They are fit and competing until the last minute.\n\"I'm proud - we've already played 28 games. We're always competing, always competing.\"\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini speaking to Match of the Day: \"We wanted to go and win two games in a row. We didn't play a bad game, but they scored on a set-piece. We had an option to score through Snodgrass but didn't do it.\n\"I said before that when we didn't win games it was down to conceding at set-pieces. We never thought before this game we were going to win just because we beat Chelsea.\n\"We must now try to win our home game against Arsenal.\"\nWolves on a roll - stats\nWolves have won three league matches in a row against West Ham for the first time.\nWest Ham have now won just one of their last nine Premier League matches, conceding 18 goals across those games (D2 L6).\nWolves have scored in each of their last 10 Premier League games at Molineux - their best period in the top flight since February 2004 (also 10 in a row).\nWolves have lost just one of their last 15 home Premier League games (W8 D6 L1), a 5-2 defeat by Chelsea in September.\nMoutinho has assisted 12 goals in the Premier League - only Matt Jarvis has provided more assists for Wolves (13).\nWhat's next?\nWolves are at Brighton on Sunday (16:30 GMT) and West Ham host Arsenal on Monday (20:00 GMT)."

Saints were 18th when the Austrian took over, and secured Premier League survival, finishing 16th in 2018-19.\nHasenhuttl gained his 14th win in 43 games in charge in all competitions with an impressive first-half display to continue Saints' revival which has seen them pick up seven points in three matches.\nWard-Prowse or Ings had scored all of the Saints' last 10 Premier League goals before this match - a run which started on 20 September - and the pair combined for the opener.\nWard Prowse's delivery from the free-kick was excellent and Ings got in between Kenny McLean and Ben Godfrey to glance a header in past Tim Krul.\nThe Dutchman did well to tip over Moussa Djenepo's well-struck effort from 25 yards, but it was not long before Norwich conceded again.\nOnce more, Canaries boss Daniel Farke will be unhappy with his side's defending as Bertrand was left unmarked to finish from close range after Long had flicked on a fine right-wing corner from the impressive Ward-Prowse.\nLong, starting a league match for only the second time this season, nearly grabbed his first goal of the campaign but prodded an effort wide from 12 yards in the second half.\nIngs was unlucky to not score his second and Southampton's third when he did well to control Nathan Redmond's pass on his chest and then, under pressure from two City defenders, volleyed just wide.\nOne concern for Hasenhuttl will be Saints again failed to keep a clean sheet and their tally of 33 goals conceded in 15 matches this season is the highest of any top-flight team.\nNorwich continue to struggle on the road\nNorwich had won their last away game - 2-0 at fellow strugglers Everton on 23 November - but were poor in the first half here and wasteful late on, this defeat meaning they have only picked up four points from eight away league games.\nBefore the game, Farke said his side \"remained favourites for position 20\" and, although they remain 19th in the table, are now four points behind 17th-placed Southampton.\nNorwich had twice led against Arsenal in their previous match but did not threaten Alex McCarthy's goal at St Mary's Stadium in the first half, with a wayward McLean effort from 20 yards their only shot in the opening 45 minutes.\nFarke made a double change at half-time - bringing on Marco Stipermann and Tettey for Tom Trybull and Ibrahim Amadou - and Pukki had an effort on target within seconds but McCarthy did well to push the 25-yard strike over the top.\nByram, without a competitive goal since December 2015 when he scored for Leeds against Nottingham Forest, also had a chance for the visitors but his weak shot was easily saved by McCarthy.\nBut Norwich grabbed a lifeline in the 65th minute when Tettey's fine through ball found Pukki and the Finnish striker scored for the second successive game after he had gone eight club matches without a goal.\nFarke's side could have secured a point they barely deserved in injury time but both Buendia and Byram missed the target when they should have done better.\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)\nRare back-to-back success for Saints - the stats\nSouthampton have lost just one of their past 14 home games against Norwich in all competitions (won nine, drew four), winning the last four in a row.\nSouthampton claimed back-to-back league wins for the first time since March.\nSaints are yet to keep a clean sheet at their own ground this season.\nDanny Ings has scored in four successive league games - the first Southampton player to do so since Jay Rodriguez in March 2014.\nNorwich have won just one away fixture in the Premier League this season.\nTeemu Pukki, with eight goals, is the first Norwich player to score more than seven goals in a top-flight campaign since Grant Holt in 2012-13.\nAs well as scoring in back-to-back games for the first time since August, Pukki has netted his 22nd league goal of 2019; only Hull's Jarrod Bowen (24) and Leicester's Jamie Vardy (26) have scored more such goals within England's top four tiers this year.\nRyan Bertrand's goal was his first in 31 Premier League games since scoring against Leicester in August 2018.\nIngs has now scored more Premier League goals in 15 appearances this season (eight) than he managed in 24 in 2018-19 (seven); only in 2014-15 (11) has he had a more prolific campaign in the competition.\n'We showed a great reaction' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport: \"It is clear we used a lot of energy in the first 70 minutes, until 2-1 it was a good game from us. They thought something was possible for them and in the last 15 minutes we were a bit tired.\n\"We knew when December came it was games we needed to take points from. There is still a lot of games to go, we have found a shape and a core and that helps us to play in an aggressive way and that's what the supporters like to see here.\n\"We have lifted ourselves from the relegation zone and you see how quickly things change but there is still a long way to go.\"\nOn Danny Ings, who has scored nine times in 10 matches, Hasenhuttl added: \"He scores nearly every game, it is a massive run. I'm very happy with his fitness, last season he was always injured and he is really helping us.\"\nNorwich City boss Daniel Farke told BBC Sport: \"We always have to be on our best level because in the first half it was not great from us. We said we had to stick to our principles, but conceded two goals from set-pieces and in the second half we went back to our principles.\n\"It was a really good reaction in the second half but it is important to play this way for 90 minutes. I would be concerned if we don't show any reaction, but we showed a great reaction. In the end we deserved at least a draw and had good chances but were unlucky we were not able to equalise.\n\"I'm a bit more annoyed in the first half we weren't brave enough. We need to stick to our plan, they did not play us out of the park, they didn't have chances in the first half apart from two set-pieces.\"\nWhat's next?\nNorwich, who have not won at home since beating Manchester City on 14 September, host Sheffield United on Sunday, 8 December (14:00 GMT), while Southampton play at Newcastle on the same day (14:00)."

Talk of a second Premier League title may still be premature but they certainly appear ready to pounce should Liverpool slip up during a busy December.\nA change in the dugout but Watford's woes continue\nWatford dispensed with their second manager of the season at the weekend with the departure of Flores, and it was tasked to Under-23s boss Hayden Mullins to inspire the beleaguered Hornets to only a second win of the season.\nThe former defensive midfielder tried to stamp his mark on the team by switching from a back five to a back four and it certainly led to an improved defensive display from the Hornets as they looked solid in possession and kept a normally free-scoring Leicester at bay for almost an hour.\nBut Watford's familiar failings in attack were once again laid bare as they failed to create anything of note in the final third. Gerard Deulofeu was largely anonymous while Troy Deeney showed plenty of endeavour without being able to trouble a disciplined Leicester side.\nThe Hornets have now failed to score in eight of their 15 league games this season - the worst record in the Premier League - and it highlighted the size of the task facing an incoming manager.\nMan of the match - Harvey Barnes (Leicester)\n'We had to be patient' - what they said\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a tough game for us. Hayden Mullins had Watford very well organised. We had to be patient this evening and worked very hard for that but I thought we deserved it.\n\"Jamie Vardy is absolutely fantastic. I thought he should have a penalty in the first half. I don't know why that was overturned. In the current rules that is normally given but it wasn't and we gathered our composure and continued to work away to get the goal.\n\"It was a real team effort tonight and to get seven wins on the spin in the Premier League is a great achievement. The team is developing and are proving they have a winning mentality and mindset. We will do our best (to stay in top two), we fight and work and see where it takes us.\"\nWatford caretaker manager Hayden Mullins: \"I think up until the penalty we were in the game and even after it we were still in the game. We have come away from home to a team that has done really, really well and put a performance in.\n\"What I saw tonight was a side in us that came away from home and showed good levels of fitness, good intelligence on the field, put in a great performance and took it right to the wire. There were loads of positives.\n\"The boys have responded fantastically well. I'm so proud of what they did tonight.\"\nVardy closing in on record run - the stats\nLeicester City have now equalled their top-flight league record for consecutive wins (seven games), with the only previous occasion coming between December 1962 and March 1963.\nWatford have won just eight points in their last 18 Premier League games (W1 D5 L12) - opponents Leicester City have won more than this in their last three league games alone (three wins, nine points).\nWatford have scored just nine goals in 15 Premier League matches this season; an average of 0.6 per game. The only team to have averaged less in the top five European Leagues this season are La Liga team Leganes (0.53 per game).\nLeicester City's Jamie Vardy has scored in seven successive Premier League appearances, his best streak since his record-breaking 11-match run in November 2015.\nJamie Vardy has now scored 50 Premier League goals at home for Leicester City; 30 more than any other player (Muzzy Izzet: 20).\nLeicester City striker Jamie Vardy has scored 23 goals in 25 games under Brendan Rodgers in the Premier League; the same tally as he scored under the management of Claude Puel in 51 Premier League games.\nWhat next?\nLeicester travel to Aston Villa on Sunday, 8 December (14:00 GMT) while Watford host Crystal Palace a day earlier (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-1 Aston Villa: Tammy Abraham scores on return from injury\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard praised striker Tammy Abraham's growing influence as the Blues rediscovered their winning touch against Aston Villa.\nAbraham reinforced his importance to Lampard's side, scoring the opener and setting up the second on his return from injury in Chelsea's 2-1 Premier League victory at Stamford Bridge.\nThe 22-year-old England international missed the Blues' home defeat by West Ham with a hip injury and put them ahead against Villa with a firm header from Reece James' cross.\nAfter Villa equalised against the run of play when Trezeguet bundled in, Chelsea regained the lead shortly after the restart when Abraham neatly chested Willian's cross into the path of Mason Mount who thumped home a volley.\n\"Tammy is a personality that's growing in our dressing room every day with his enthusiasm and his will to win,\" said Lampard.\n\"He is a striker that's near the top of the goalscoring charts in the league, he's showing his all-round game, stretches defences and he starts our press.\n\"And of course if a player's on such a good run it's normal that if they go out of the team that you can miss them, and he came straight back in as he left off.\"\nChelsea, like they did in the first half before Trezeguet's leveller, dominated possession and territory as they looked to increase their advantage.\nAbraham twice came close to adding a third against the club he helped fire to promotion last season, while Willian - one of Chelsea's other star performers - hit the post with an exquisite free-kick.\nThe Blues ended a run of back-to-back defeats with a victory which helps them consolidate fourth place, moving them six points clear of nearest rivals Wolves, while narrowing the gap on third-placed Manchester City to three points.\nVilla, who have won just once on the road this season, remain in 15th place, a point above the relegation zone after Southampton's win.\nFollow live text and reaction to all Wednesday's Premier League matches\nAbraham's return lifts Chelsea\nFollowing a tough week in which Premier League defeats by Manchester City and West Ham came either side of a Champions League draw at Valencia, Chelsea were looking to avoid three top-flight defeats in a row for the first time in four years.\nThey did that against a toothless Villa side, albeit with a tighter margin of victory than their performance deserved.\nMount's stunning finish proved the difference but, with a refreshed Blues line-up featuring five changes from Saturday's defeat having 25 attempts at goal, they should have been out of sight.\nWhile England attacking midfielder Mount will take the plaudits for the winner, it was Abraham's return from injury which was the real catalyst for change.\nThe Blues had been wasteful against West Ham and Abraham provided a clinical edge after holding his line to head in from 12 yards.\nIt was a richly deserved lead for the home side with Villa rarely having ventured into the Chelsea box, but it was greeted with muted celebrations from the striker, who scored 25 league goals in 38 Championship matches for Villa in his season-long loan.\n\"I said the club will always be close to my heart, last season was a long, hard season so I pay all my respects to them,\" he said afterwards.\nBlues boss Lampard said before the match that Abraham was still suffering some pain in his hip, yet he worked tirelessly throughout in a physical battle against muscular Villa centre-backs Tyrone Mings and Ezri Konsa.\nAfter showing exceptional awareness and composure to tee up Mount's winner, he was unfortunate not to score another himself - clipping wide of the left-hand post and being hustled out of a close-range chance by Mings - before departing to a standing ovation with seven minutes left.\nAbraham looked to walk off gingerly after taking a knock a few moments earlier, although Lampard played down any injury concerns.\nBattling Villa fall short again\nVilla have performed admirably against the Premier League's leading lights since returning to the top flight, without earning the rewards their performances have merited.\nDean Smith's side opened the scoring in four of their five matches against established top-six opponents this season, pushing Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United close, with only defending champions Manchester City beating them with relative comfort.\nAlthough these displays provided plenty of encouragement, Villa earned a solitary point.\nAt Stamford Bridge, they again showed the basic prerequisites of hard work and organisation, but were unable to stretch Chelsea as their forays into the opposition half were limited.\nA quick-thinking pass from skipper Jack Grealish, who Smith complained afterwards needs more protection from referees, was key in the attack which led to Villa's equaliser, allowing Ahmed Elmohamady to cross to Trezeguet who bundled in at the second attempt.\nOther than that, Villa rarely threatened as they managed just three shots on target in the whole match, although Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was required to deny Douglas Luiz what would have been an undeserved equaliser late on.\n\"We're not far away, I don't want to keep using the word 'competitive', we can be as good as these teams, we showed that in pockets,\" Smith said.\n\"We need to be more consistent in what we do and braver on the ball.\"\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante (Chelsea)\nPost-match reaction\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard:\n\"I thought we were great. I'm pleased because that was us again, we had a blip against West Ham and today we were back.\n\"Our character at half-time was important and we carried off where we left off. The disappointment of the day is we didn't score two or three.\n\"Villa are stubborn, have picked up results on the road and you can see why. They have good players and are well organised.\"\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith:\n\"I thought it was a fair result, the better team won.\n\"We had pockets of play throughout the game but not enough relentless pressure. We didn't start either half well and they put us under pressure. We gave the ball away too cheaply, but got back into the game and when we showed a bit of belief we showed we could give them problems.\n\"They had the initiative, we knew they would start well after losing a London derby on Saturday.\n\"You don't get much from officials here and I wasn't happy with their performance tonight. Jack Grealish must have been the most-fouled player on the pitch, there were five or six not given.\"\nChelsea continue to dominate Villa - the stats\nChelsea have lost just one of their last 56 Premier League home games against newly promoted teams, winning 45 and drawing 10.\nAston Villa have picked up just one point from their last 42 available in away games against sides starting the day in the top four.\nChelsea have won nine of their last 10 Premier League meetings with Aston Villa, losing the other in March 2014.\nChelsea have won five consecutive home league games against Aston Villa for the first time in their history.\nTammy Abraham has scored 11 goals in 14 Premier League appearances this season - the only Chelsea players to score more in their first 14 appearances in a single Premier League season are Diego Costa (12) in 2014-15 and Nicolas Anelka (12) in 2008-09.\nOnly Jamie Vardy (17) has been directly involved in more Premier League goals this season than Abraham (14 - 11 goals, 3 assists).\nTrezeguet is the first Aston Villa player to score in three consecutive Premier League starts since Tom Cleverley in May 2015.\nTrezeguet's goal, assisted by Ahmed Elmohamady, is the first Premier League goal to be scored and assisted by Egyptian players.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea go back on the road with a trip to struggling Everton on Saturday (12:30 GMT), before Villa host second-placed Leicester City on Sunday (14:00)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 5-2 Everton: Marco Silva sees pressure build after derby loss\nLiverpool pushed Everton manager Marco Silva closer to the sack and retained their eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a crushing win at Anfield which dropped the Toffees into the relegation zone.\nReds boss Jurgen Klopp, already missing suspended goalkeeper Alisson and injured Fabinho, still felt able to rest key attacking duo Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino from his starting line-up and win in comfort.\nLiverpool effectively won the game with four goals in the first half - Sadio Mane creating two early strikes for Divock Origi and the recalled Xherdan Shaqiri.\nMichael Keane pulled one back for shambolic Everton but Liverpool were soon back in control when Origi controlled Dejan Lovren's pass for a brilliant third and Mane got the goal he deserved when he crowned a sweeping counter-attack from Trent Alexander-Arnold's inviting delivery.\nRicharlison took advantage of Liverpool's own vulnerable defending to make it 4-2 on the stroke of half-time but in reality Everton were never seriously in contention at any point.\nBoth sides missed chances in the second half, with the brilliant Mane and Everton substitute Moise Kean culprits, but Liverpool completed the humiliation for Silva and his team with Georginio Wijnaldum's low shot for the fifth in the final minute of normal time.\nThe question now, as Everton lie in the bottom three, is how long the beleaguered Silva can survive, with Chelsea scheduled to visit Goodison Park on Saturday lunchtime.\n'I don't have the answer' - Everton boss Silva says his future is uncertain after derby defeat\nFootball Daily: Divock's derby delight & Rashford ruins Mourinho's night\nSilva under siege\nSilva, 42, is suffering a slow, lingering demise as Everton manager - and this dismal showing is only likely to hasten his exit from Goodison Park.\nThis was a Liverpool side nowhere near full strength but the game was up for Silva and Everton once they were two down inside 17 minutes.\nSilva's five-man defensive system was ripped to shreds, by Mane in particular, and it was no surprise when he removed defender Djibril Sidibe before half-time to introduce Brazilian attacker Bernard.\nEverton were a team in chaos at times in the first half, with Sidibe, Mason Holgate, Tom Davies and Keane all arguing among themselves after Shaqiri's goal then Holgate and Lucas Digne also in animated discussion after Origi put Liverpool 3-1 up.\nDirector of football Marcel Brands cut a concerned figure at half-time, deep in discussion with fellow director Sasha Ryazantsev - and there will surely be more discussions among the Everton hierarchy post-match.\nEverton did create some chances but never looked like ending a winless Anfield sequence stretching back to September 1999.\nIt is also the first time Everton have conceded four goals in the first half of a Merseyside derby since 1935.\nSilva now faces an uncertain future - and Everton face what increasingly looks like a relegation fight.\nLiverpool march relentlessly on\nLiverpool continue their relentless march towards what will be a first league title for 30 years and this victory was a graphic illustration of the strength at manager Klopp's disposal.\nIt was Klopp's 100th Premier League victory - he is the second-fastest manager to reach a century in the competition - and it extends the Reds' run of 32 matches without defeat, their longest such run in top-flight history.\nLiverpool, who lost only one Premier League game since the start of last season, were not even at full tilt or full strength and yet eventually overwhelmed their struggling Merseyside neighbours.\nSalah was able to have the night off and Firmino and captain Jordan Henderson were only introduced as late substitutes as Klopp rotated his resources.\nLiverpool's defence was vulnerable but their sheer potency in attack more than compensates, led by the world-class Mane, who tormented Everton all night and only blotted his copybook by missing two chances to make the scoreline even more emphatic.\nAnd Origi is fast becoming Everton's bogeyman, scoring twice in the first half after grabbing that dramatic 96th-minute winner in this same fixture last season.\nLiverpool were nowhere near their best, not that they needed to be, but this was an impressive demonstration of the power assembled by Klopp that has put them in such a commanding position in the title race.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane\nA flashback to 20 years ago - the best of the stats\nEverton find themselves in the relegation zone after playing at least 15 Premier League matches for the first time since April 1999 (after 32 games).\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 32 Premier League games (W27, D5), their longest ever run without defeat in top-flight history.\nKlopp has won 100 of his 159 Premier League games, he is the second fastest manager to reach 100 wins in the competition, after Jose Mourinho (142 games). In fact, he is the fastest Liverpool manager to 100 wins in top-flight history.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 18 Premier League games against Everton (W8, D10). It's their longest ever unbeaten run against a specific opponent in the competition.\nSilva is the first Everton manager to concede five league goals against Liverpool in a single match since Howard Kendall in November 1982 (5-0 against Bob Paisley's Liverpool).\nSince the start of last season, Trent Alexander-Arnold has provided more Premier League assists than any other player (18), with 15 of those coming in 2019.\n'I loved it a lot!' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Match of the Day: \"All the goals were incredible, outstanding. Wonderful goals, sensational passes, super pieces of football. I loved it a lot!\n\"We needed fresh legs and I had to show my respect to the boys in the squad, that's all. They proved it. It is much more fun making changes, all of the boys are ready to deliver performances like this.\n\"It was a massive moment in my first season when Divock Origi got injured in the derby. It changed his career for a bit.\"\nEverton boss Marco Silva, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We cannot concede goals in the way we conceded. We knew everything about them before the match and how they like to play whether with Origi, Salah or Firmino, we know how they would play. There was a lot of mistakes.\n\"I am not the right person to answer about the situation, this question is for different people. We are making some mistakes which put us under big, big pressure. The type of mistakes we are making is because the players are playing under big pressure because of the position in the table.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Bournemouth on Saturday for another Premier League match (15:00 GMT), while Everton host Chelsea in the early kick-off on the same day (12:30)."

The midfielder ran through before slotting past Dean Henderson, whose half-hearted challenge suggested he was expecting the effort to be ruled out.\nHowever, with referee Stuart Attwell having waved play on the goal was checked by VAR, which correctly awarded it after replays showed Carroll was onside when he provided the assist.\nAllan Saint-Maximin had earlier opened the scoring with his first goal for Newcastle, heading home Javier Manquillo's cross.\nThe frustrated hosts dominated much of the game only to find Martin Dubravka in wonderful form, the Newcastle goalkeeper twice saving excellent headers from Oli McBurnie, as well as keeping out a deflected Enda Stevens strike.\nThe result ends Sheffield United's seven-game unbeaten Premier League run, stretching back to a 1-0 defeat by Liverpool on 28 September.\n'Football is sucking the life out of me' - Wilder frustrated by VAR controversy\nReaction and analysis from Bramall Lane\nPlay to whistle - VAR does its job\nVAR has provided plenty of moments of controversy this season, but in this case did exactly what it was supposed to do.\nWithout it, an incorrect offside call would have been missed and Newcastle would have entered the closing stages of the game trying to protect a one-goal lead against determined hosts who, until that moment, had looked the more likely to add to the scoring.\n\"We've spoke many times about whether VAR is adding or taking away from the game but that's exactly why it came in,\" former Everton midfielder Leon Osman told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Without it, Newcastle would have had that goal taken away from them when he was clearly onside.\n\"Great credit must go to Stuart Attwell too for just following Jonjo Shelvey as he ran forward and slotted it into the net as the Sheffield United players stopped.\"\nBlades frustrated but play well again\nWhile this was Sheffield United's first defeat in seven games, it was a fourth consecutive game without a win - a run that may be starting to concern some fans following their fine early-season form.\nBut recent results are perhaps not a fair reflection of their performances.\nAgainst Newcastle, they once again played some slick, expansive football and had their opponents pegged back in their own half for almost the entirety of the game.\nHowever, in Dubravka they came up against a goalkeeper in inspired form and his save in the first five minutes from Stevens' deflected effort was particularly crucial. Had that gone in it could have been a very different game.\nMan of the match - Martin Dubravka\n'The game's changed. It is sucking the life out of me' - what they said\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder, speaking to BBC Sport: \"A missed opportunity. I am OK with that performance, it was always going to be difficult against a team that never shifted. The first goal is really important and it is super difficult when you go behind against a team like Newcastle.\n\"I was told at the start of the season that the linesman would not put his flag up and let it go. He put his flag up and the referee was about to blow his whistle.\n\"Everyone in the ground stopped. Jonjo Shelvey even nonchalantly went up and took an opportunity. His body language said to me he had seen the linesman had put the flag up and he was going to be offside.\n\"The game has changed. This game now is completely different to what I experienced as a 16-year-old lad as an apprentice. This game in a heartbeat has changed. I don't know where it is going and it is sucking the life out of me and the supporters.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce: \"I was delighted with the spirit of the players. To come here has never been easy over a number of years. Chris Wilder has done a remarkable job.\"\nOn the second goal: \"Down the line we are going to have a few that will go against us. I have to say well done to Jonjo for keeping on going. If that is an opportunity the linesman keeps his flag down because it looked borderline. Maybe he could have kept the flag down and checked later. Ultimately it was the correct decision.\n\"The referee will not blow the whistle and he has done that. Usually it is clear and obvious for the linesman to put his flag up but let's remind everyone it was the second goal, which wasn't important anyway.\"\nCarroll's long wait ends - the stats\nNewcastle have won three of their last five Premier League games (D1 L1), as many as they had in their previous 13 combined before this (W3 D4 L6).\nSheffield United have lost each of their last four league meetings with Newcastle, their longest ever such losing run against them.\nOnly Southampton (five) have lost more Premier League games on home soil this season than Sheffield United at Bramall Lane (four).\nSaint-Maximin's goal (14:58) was the earliest Sheffield United have conceded in a league game at Bramall Lane since March 2017, when Ricky Holmes scored in the third minute for Charlton.\nNewcastle scored with their first two shots on target of this game, with Shelvey's 70th minute goal their first attempt of any kind since Saint-Maximin opened the scoring in the 15th minute.\nSaint-Maximin scored his first Premier League goal in his 11th appearance in the competition and with what was his 17th shot across those 11 games - he had failed to score with his last 46 shots for Nice and Newcastle in Ligue 1 and the Premier League respectively before this game.\nShelvey has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the very first time in his career, and in back-to-back league games overall for the first time since November 2011 for Blackpool.\nCarroll started his first Premier League game for Newcastle in eight years and 342 days - the second longest run between starts for the club in the competition after Pavel Srnicek (nine years, 62 days), and the seventh longest gap between starts by any player at a single club in the competition's history.\nWhat next?\nSheffield United travel to Norwich on Sunday, 8 December (14:00 GMT) while Newcastle host Southampton on the same day (14:00)."

We all get to a certain point by doing something and everyone's path is different. Ostersunds was mine.\"\nThe Seagulls had given leaders Liverpool a late score on Saturday and, on a night to remember, they carried on from where they left off at Anfield to climb three places up the table to 13th - one point behind Arsenal.\nBrighton's first Premier League win since 2 November was built on guts and determination.\nWhile Maupay, who now has five goals this season, and 19-year-old Aaron Connolly tormented lacklustre Arsenal, Webster and Dunk were solid at the back for the visitors.\nIn addition, Potter's arrival at Brighton has seen them become a menace at set-pieces.\nSeven of Brighton's last 10 league goals have been scored via set-piece situations.\nMan of the match - Mat Ryan (Brighton)\n'This is not Arsenal' - what they said\nArsenal interim boss Freddie Ljungberg: \"We didn't show up in the first half, didn't work hard and want to play.\n\"Second half we had a word and were better but we are suspect on the counter and we have no confidence. I need to work on that and get confidence back into the boys.\n\"At half-time we said 'This is not Arsenal, we have to give it a crack.'\n\"We're in a difficult situation, we've lost a lot of games and the confidence has gone down.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter: \"It's a nice moment for us. It gives us a little bit of belief. It was a good game for us, not perfect but we showed real courage and belief.\n\"Credit to our players, they did what I think an away team has to do in terms of frustrating but it still takes courage from the players and that's what I'm pleased with.\n\"We dug in, I'm very pleased.\"\nMiserable times at Arsenal - the stats\nArsenal have faced 52 shots on target in Premier League home games this season - in the entire Invincibles season in 2003-04, they allowed just 48 opposition shots on target at home.\nIncluding caretakers, only one of Arsenal's last five managers has won their first home game in charge - Pat Rice against Sheffield Wednesday in September 1996.\nBrighton have beaten 'big six' opposition away from home in the Premier League for the very first time at the 17th attempt; they had lost 15 of the previous 16 such games.\nArsenal's Alexandre Lacazette has scored 25 of his 32 Premier League goals at the Emirates Stadium.\nBrighton ended a six-match winless run away from home in the Premier League this season.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal do not play again until Monday when they visit West Ham (20:00 GMT) in a London derby while Brighton are in action on Sunday when they host in-form Wolves (16:30 GMT)."

He was suited and booted - determined to relish every second.\nIn some respects the Scot was last man standing because he has been on the coaching staff under Roberto Martinez, Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardyce and Marco Silva.\nThis was his time and he certainly left a lasting impression with his fierce intensity, touchline demands and wild goal celebrations.\nFerguson emerged just before kick-off to a raucous reputation and wasted no time reconnecting with the fans who adored him as a player.\nNever mind the smart shoes, he was off down the touchline at a fair lick whenever celebrating.\nThe most important thing for Everton and Ferguson was the result - and that came deservedly from a set of players who should actually question themselves over how they showed a competitive edge and fire that was missing under Silva.\nEverton were resilient in a way they have not been this season, while Calvert-Lewin channelled the spirit of Ferguson by giving Chelsea's defenders a nightmare afternoon.\nIt is only one result - but how Everton needed it and Ferguson fully deserved to celebrate his part in it.\nChelsea pay the price for defensive shambles\nChelsea have been described many times as a work in progress under Lampard - and this showed exactly why.\nThey have been vulnerable defensively all season but here at Goodison, with Everton inspired, all the flaws were on display.\nCalvert-Lewin was the main beneficiary, taking advantage of chaos in the penalty area to score the Toffees' second, then striking again late on after Kepa compounded a poor clearance by letting the forward's his shot through his legs.\nChelsea can enter the market in January after their transfer ban was reduced to one window on appeal - and on this evidence Lampard will be spending a large part of his funds on stiffening a leaky defence.\n'Not good enough' - what they said\nEverton caretaker manager Duncan Ferguson: \"It was an unbelievable atmosphere for myself but it's the players who need to take the pride and the praise. We were just trying to get the communication working.\n\"I thought they were fantastic; we really got the players working well together. To get the early goal was really important. When you are leading a team and the fans need you to get three points, it is so much more important than anything else.\"\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard: \"I knew they were going to have a go today but I am more worried about us. It was not good enough.\n\"We conceded three horrible goals. The last thing we want is to go down so early.\n\"We have to get our shots away, especially against a team who have lots of players around the box. It's really important to move on but I am flat because we should come here and get a result and we didn't.\"\nThree in a row for Richarlison - match stats\nThis was Everton's third win in 12 Premier League games and ended a run of three straight defeats.\nChelsea lost a game against a team with a manager taking charge of their first Premier League match for the only the second time. The other was in their game against Oldham on the first day of the 1992-93 season.\nChelsea have lost three of their past four Premier League games, as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 20 in the competition.\nEverton have beaten Chelsea twice in a row in the league for the first time since November 1994.\nChelsea have had only one clean sheet in 17 Premier League away games in 2019, a joint-low among teams to play in both seasons (Tottenham also have one in 16).\nEverton forward Richarlison has scored in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time (89 appearances).\nMan of the match - Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\nWhat's next?\nEverton are away to Manchester United in the league on Sunday, 15 December in their next match (14:00 GMT).\nChelsea host Bournemouth in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00) after a home Champions League group game against Lille on Tuesday (20:00)."

We lost another two players today. It is what it is.\n\"The squad is stretched. It is there to cope with the injuries but the difficulty for us is we are getting injuries but not getting players back.\n\"The mentality of the group is strong but damaged in confidence. We can always do better. We can always question ourselves and say we could have done better today, but the quality of the opposition was very strong.\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a professional performance - controlled, scoring wonderful goals. We didn't want to make it exciting again, so we wanted to control Bournemouth.\n\"The most used word in the dressing room at the moment is 'clean sheet '...finally! [The injury to defender] Dejan Lovren was hopefully cramp but apart from that it was a perfect game.

        "article_text": "Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace: Disappointing stalemate at Vicarage Road\nThe Premier League's lowest-scoring teams Watford and Crystal Palace played out a disappointing goalless draw at Vicarage Road.\nAfter an uninspiring first half that produced no shots on target for either side, bottom side Watford improved following the break but Gerard Deulofeu fired their best opportunity wide.\nThe visitors' Wilfried Zaha endured a difficult and physical afternoon as he picked up a yellow card after tangling with Christian Kabasele in the first half.\nWatford, who are without a home win this season, were being watched by new manager Nigel Pearson as Hayden Mullins took charge of his final game as interim boss.\nRelive the action as it happened\nThe Hornets are six points from safety, while Palace stay seventh, a point outside the Europa League places.\nWork to do for Pearson\nWatford took the decision to appoint former Leicester boss Pearson on a deal until the end of the season on Friday, and the new manager was presented to the home supporters before kick-off.\nPearson is the club's third manager of the season, and this performance gave some indication of why they are struggling.\nThe Hornets are the lowest scorers in the league with nine goals, and they failed to register a single shot on target in the first half.\nThey started both halves brightly and showed glimpses of promise through Ismaila Sarr but his final ball often failed to match up to his exciting build-up play.\nDeulofeu had their best opportunity soon after the interval when he latched on to Troy Deeney's flick-on to drive at the Palace defence, but his low shot went wide.\nThe hosts showed some fight as they poured forward in search of the winner late on, and they were nearly gifted three points when Martin Kelly headed back towards his own goal.\nThere was a scramble for possession which eventually fell for Sarr, but Vicente Guaita was quick off his line to close down the space and claim the ball off the forward's toes.\nWatford are winless in their past 12 home Premier League games, their longest run without a victory on home soil in the league ever, but Pearson may just believe he can turn Vicarage Road into a fortress with the spirit on display late on from his players.\nCompact Palace lack cutting edge\nPalace came into the game having risen to seventh on the back of consecutive league victories, following a run of five games without a win before that.\nBut like Watford, Palace have struggled in front of goal this season, only their hosts on target less often.\nWatford paid particular attention to talisman Zaha and managed to rile the Ivorian from the opening stages.\nZaha was incensed after picking up an unfortunate yellow card in a tangle with Kabasele before continuing to tussle with Etienne Capoue throughout the afternoon.\nGetting under Zaha's skin can sometimes backfire for opponents, but Watford's plan paid off as the visitors failed to register a single shot on target, and only two in total all game.\nAt the other end, centre-back pairing James Tomkins and the returning Gary Cahill repelled the physical challenge of Deeney.\nExperienced defender Cahill made more blocks than any other player on the field (three) as Palace stood firm, and he did just enough to prevent Deeney from making sufficient contact with his close-range header late on.\nPalace have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since March 2017, and their steely determination at the back may just keep them out of trouble this season, when the forwards struggle to fire.\nMan of the match - Gary Cahill (Crystal Palace)\n'It's been a good week' - what they said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson said: \"We are pleased with the point, especially after the week we have had. To go to Burnley and then play against Bournemouth with 10 men, it was a very fatigued team. It was a sterling effort from the players. We were running on empty but I'm pleased we earned a point and it's been a good week.\n\"Gary Cahill made two fantastic challenges to stop them scoring a goal on the counter-attack, but we should have covered that better. There were a lot of tired minds and bodies, and as a result, I have to be delighted with the players' character to ensure we came away from here with a point. It was a team effort and Jordan Ayew worked his socks off up front.\"\nOn Wilfried Zaha: \"I thought he did excellently well, and I'm certain I'm not speaking out of turn here, but the yellow card and foul against him was obviously wrong. He is just turning and the defender moves across him and hits the ground. It certainly wasn't a foul but I thought he did exceptionally well in the second half to play as well as he did and he was a constant threat.\"\nWatford interim manager Hayden Mullins said: \"It was a hard-earned point and if there was one team that deserved to win it in the second half, it was probably us. I'm happy with the energy levels and the commitment.\n\"There are a couple of decisions that could have gone either way but we just didn't really get anything clear-cut today. They are a good side but we wanted to impose the game on them.\n\"At times, I think we did that, and it is important to get the fans on side and we did. I have had a fantastic six or seven days to work with the lads every day. I absolutely loved it. Nigel [Pearson] was in today and we are in tomorrow so we will see what happens with training.\"\nZaha's rough treatment - the stats\nWatford are winless in their past 12 home Premier League games, their longest run without a victory on home soil in the league ever.\nCrystal Palace have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since March 2017.\nWatford are the only side in the top four tiers of English football yet to hit double figures for league goals this season (9).\nWatford have failed to score in nine Premier League games this season, more than any other side.\nThis is only the second Premier League game this season not to see a single shot on target in the first half (also Leicester v Wolves in August).\nCrystal Palace failed to direct a single shot on target for the first time in a Premier League game this season, last doing so in April against Everton.\nSince his Premier League debut in December 2013, Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha has been fouled 503 times, with only Eden Hazard winning more fouls in that time (521).\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to league leaders Liverpool for Pearson's first game in charge on Saturday, 14 December (12:30 GMT), while Crystal Palace host rivals Brighton on Monday, 16 December (19:45 GMT)."

When I got the ball l tried to pass to Dele Alli and waited for his movement.\n\"But I couldn't find him so I just went and went. I'm happy to score this goal.\"\nGoals galore for Spurs - and finally a clean sheet\nMourinho's standing as one of the world's leading managers, having delivered trophies at a host of top clubs, has been built on the defensive organisation and stability of his teams.\nBut it was the attacking nature of his new side's performance which again caught the eye, with Spurs producing their most devastating display under the Portuguese to date.\nLooking to make amends for Wednesday's limp defeat at Manchester United - their first loss under Mourinho - Spurs hassled and harried from the first whistle, pressing Burnley quickly and putting them under an amount of pressure with which they could not cope.\nKane's quick opener set the tone and even from that point it looked as though Burnley would struggle to come away from north London with anything other than defeat.\nSpurs' position was strengthened by Moura and once Son added that stunning third, their focus primarily came on keeping a first clean sheet under Mourinho.\nGiving Spurs a solidity which disappeared in the dying embers of Mauricio Pochettino's reign was high on the Portuguese boss' list of tasks.\nIn the build-up Mourinho again called for his side to stop conceding \"cheap goals\" and, despite allowing Burnley chances which they could not take, finally got his wish.\nAnd it was a clear sign of Mourinho's pleasure that the first thing he mentioned in his post-match interview in the tunnel was the clean sheet.\n\"There are still a few holes and chances to opponents but we were much, much, much more solid,\" he said.\n\"It's the best day because it is the complete performance. It was perfect.\"\nBurnley rue defensive sloppiness as losing run continues\nBurnley's results over the past six weeks have fluctuated between comfortable wins and one-sided defeats - with this clearly in the latter category.\nBut even when Spurs were leading 2-0, the Clarets were generously allowed chances to get a foothold in the game.\nStriker Chris Wood saw his follow-up to Brady's header, which hit the underside of the bar and then the left-hand post, blocked by Davinson Sanchez, while Jay Rodriguez perhaps should have converted one of two close-range headers.\nUltimately their inability to take these chances did not cost them - it was a lack of the defensive discipline which has served them so well under manager Sean Dyche.\n\"We have given the ball away five times at the start and we can't do that,\" the Clarets boss said.\n\"It is unlike us to be so open and to give the ball away in so many bad areas. It was a tough day. We had lots of the ball, couldn't open them up.\n\"We have proven before we can make these games hard and we have to get back to that.\"\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\nA high five for Mourinho - the stats\nJose Mourinho has seen his side score five goals in the Premier League for the first time since January 2015 (Chelsea 5-0 Swansea) - his Manchester United team never scored more than four goals in his 93 league games with the club.\nMourinho has never lost a Premier League game against Burnley - winning five and drawing three of eight matches - only against Swansea City (nine) has he played more games without tasting defeat in the competition.\nTottenham's Son Heung-min has been directly involved in 15 goals in his 15 appearances at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in all competitions, more than any other player (nine goals, six assists).\nTottenham midfielder Dele Alli has been directly involved in seven goals in five games under Jose Mourinho in all competitions (four goals, three assists), over twice as many as he registered under Mauricio Pochettino this season (two goals, one assist in 10 appearances).\nAlli has provided two assists in a Premier League game for just the third time and the first since December 2017 (two assists against Southampton).\nBurnley's 5-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur is their joint-biggest margin of defeat in the Premier League.\nBurnley have won just one of their last 28 Premier League games against the 'big six' sides (drawn six, lost 21), losing each of their last seven in a row.\nBurnley have lost each of their last 10 Premier League games against sides starting the day in the top half of the league, scoring six and conceding 29.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham round off their Champions League group-stage campaign with a trip to German champions Bayern Munich on Wednesday, a match that has nothing at stake with both sides having already qualified for the knockout phase.\nMourinho's men return to Premier League action when they go to nearest rivals Wolves next Sunday (14:00 GMT).\nBurnley, meanwhile, entertain Newcastle in an encounter where victory would give each side breathing space from the relegation zone."

Until now, Norwich were the only side they had beaten on the road.\nSolskjaer's side set that record straight in scintillating fashion here, tearing City apart in the early stages when they could conceivably have scored two or three goals more.\nEderson was the only reason that did not happen, making superb saves from Daniel James, Jesse Lingard and Rashford with the score at 0-0.\nWhen United did take the lead, the way they controlled the game was also impressive - conceding possession and territory to their hosts, but limiting their shooting chances.\nIt was an excellent all-round performance and United's players clearly enjoyed it too, celebrating with the away fans at the final whistle.\nIt is less than a week since Solskjaer's future as United boss was being seriously questioned but back-to-back wins over Tottenham and now their neighbours have offered an emphatic response to his critics.\nCity's flaws exposed again\nWhile City's midweek win over Burnley saw them at their electric best going forward, this was a reminder of the defensive flaws that have cost them so often this season.\nWith Rodri and the rest of City's midfield unable to track United's players when they surged forward, their backline was left embarrassingly exposed again and again in the early stages.\nAngelino was given a torrid time by James down City's left and both he and Rodri were guilty of standing off Martial when he fired home United's second goal from that side of their area.\nTrue, Guardiola was again left frustrated by important VAR decisions going against his team - particularly when Fred blocked Kyle Walker's cross with his hand just before the break - and he had a long discussion with fourth official Mike Dean about it during the interval.\nBut his own side's shortcomings were painfully obvious and right now it is hard to make a case for City clinching a third successive title, even if Liverpool's form fell away.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\n'We will remember this one' - what they said:\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We will remember this one - we look so dangerous when we get he ball and go forward against arguably the best team in the world.\n\"They are an unbelievable team and to get a result and defend like we did and create as many chances... we should have been three or four up but for some good goalkeeping. It's hard to take the ball off them. They can football teams to death but with the pace and threat we have, we look dangerous every time we go forward.\n\"It does not matter where you win the ball it's that you are positive when you get it. The team shape was spot on, but individually they had to dig deep against some of the best players in the world. That's part of the game.\"\nOn reports of racist abuse: \"I've seen it on the video, it was Jesse and Fred and the chap must be ashamed of himself. It's unacceptable and I hope he will not be watching any football any more.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"Yes we lost but I congratulate my team: my players were fantastic, we are a fantastic team. They are so fast, so quick and sometimes when you lose the ball it is more difficult. We tried, we got to the last third many, many times and they can run. Maybe a bit more than usual.\"\nOn the title race: \"We have to try to continue; there are many things to play for. It's difficult because the opponents are on an incredible run winning 15 games out of 16.\"\nOn reports of racism: \"Of course [it's not acceptable]. I think the club are making a statement and I support that.\"\nPep's worst points return - the stats\nIn English top-flight history, no side has ever gone on to win the title after being as many as 14 points behind the top side at the end of a day's games.\nManchester United are unbeaten in their past five Premier League games (W3 D2), winning consecutive league matches for the first time since March.\nThis is Pep Guardiola's worst points return after the first 16 matches of a top-flight season in his managerial career (32 pts).\nGuardiola has lost two home league games in a single season for only the third time in his managerial career (also 2014-15 with Bayern Munich and 2008-09 with Barcelona).\nUnited's Anthony Martial has been directly involved in 10 goals in his past 13 Premier League starts (6 goals, 4 assists).\nMarcus Rashford has scored 13 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions this season - equalling his best goalscoring return for United in a single season (13 goals in 47 apps in 2018-19 and 13 goals in 52 apps in 2017-18).\nRashford has been directly involved in 15 goals in his past 14 games in all competitions for Manchester United and England (13 goals, 2 assists).\nUnited have both taken (8) and scored (4) more penalties in the Premier League this season than any other side.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City head for Croatia to play Dinamo Zagreb in their final group fixture in the Champions League on Wednesday (17:55 GMT). They are already through to the last 16 as guaranteed group winners.\nUnited switch their attention to Europe in midweek too, hosting Dutch side AZ Alkmaar (20:00) in the Europa League on Thursday. They are also already through to the knockout stage, but need to avoid defeat in order to finish top of Group L.\nBoth teams play their next Premier League game on Sunday 15 December. United are at home to Everton (14:00 GMT) while City are away at Arsenal (16:30 GMT).\nMore to follow."

I felt we were flat and it was not really until we changed things at half-time and went higher up the pitch we caused them some problems. They stuck at it, they showed a bit of spirit.\n\"The introduction of 'Big Andy' [Carroll] had glimpses today of what he had 10 years ago. He looks well at the moment. Big Andy Carroll coming on was a huge help.\"\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I thought [defeat] was not deserved. It was our best away performance of the season. We had chances to be more than 1-0 up. It was a pity. Really frustrated for the guys.\n\"After we scored, I think we stopped a little bit playing. They had a big guy in front and only went for long balls. The first goal we didn't defend well and the second was a shot from outside the box. It is a pity, I didn't see a lot of chances for Newcastle today, plenty for us. We didn't get the result but it was a very good game from us.\"\nMan of the match - Allan Saint-Maximin\nSurpassing expectations - the best of the stats\nNewcastle are unbeaten in seven Premier League games at St James' Park - they never surpassed this number under Rafael Benitez, last having a longer such run in April 2012 under Alan Pardew (nine games).\nThey have also earned 22 points from their opening 16 games this season, nine more than they had at the same stage last season.\nIngs is the third player to score in five consecutive Premier League games for Southampton, after James Beattie and Matt Le Tissier, who both did so twice.\nSouthampton's last 13 Premier League goals have been scored by Englishmen.\nShelvey has netted six goals in his last 12 appearances - his previous six Premier League goals were spread across 116 matches.\nSaint-Maximin attempted 18 dribbles against Southampton, the last Newcastle player to attempt as many in a Premier League game was Hatem Ben Arfa in December 2013 against Stoke City (also 18).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Turf Moor to take on Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday, 14 December (15:00 GMT), with Southampton hosting West Ham in the late kick-off on the same day (17:30)."

But they were blown away by Leicester on Sunday.\nAt times, captain Grealish must have felt like he was leading the fight on his own, and he cut a frustrated figure - sarcastically applauding the award of a throw-in in the first half and getting booked in the second.\nThe 24-year-old was up against another number 10 in Maddison who, albeit a playmaker of a different ilk, will be challenging him for a place in England's European Championships squad next summer.\nGrealish, cutting in from the left, where he has been deployed in recent weeks despite saying he sees himself as more of an '8', got on the scoresheet and started the move in which Anwar El Ghazi scuffed Matt Targett's low cross against the bar with the game goalless.\nGrealish is yet to get the Three Lions call at senior level, while Maddison made his debut against Montenegro last month and has been told by national boss Gareth Southgate to be \"high-performance and low maintenance\".\nIt was the Leicester man who left Villa Park the happier of the pair after his corner was headed in by Evans to effectively seal the visitors the points, and the 23-year-old might have got on the scoresheet himself after Vardy unselfishly teed him up on the edge of the Villa area, but his effort was narrowly wide.\nIt means Villa, and Grealish, find themselves teetering on the edge of the relegation zone with just one point to show from three games this week.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\nRodgers effect continues - the stats\nLeicester City have won their last eight Premier League games in a row - their best-ever winning run in their top-flight history.\nAston Villa suffered their heaviest home league defeat since losing 4-0 to Chelsea in April 2016.\nLeicester striker Jamie Vardy became the first player to score in eight consecutive Premier League appearances since Vardy himself did so back in November 2015 (11 in a row).\nJamie Vardy became the second player to have scored in eight consecutive Premier League appearances on more than one occasion, along with Ruud van Nistelrooy who did so twice in 2002 and 2003.\nJack Grealish has scored six goals in all competitions this season, equalling his best tally in a single season for Aston Villa (also six in 2018/19).\nLeicester City have won their last four away Premier League matches by an aggregate score of 17-1.\nKelechi Iheanacho has been involved in six goals in his two starts in all competitions against Aston Villa (four goals, two assists), scoring three goals and assisting one for Man City in January 2016 in the FA Cup and scoring and assisting today for Leicester.\nSince Brendan Rodgers' first Premier League game in charge on 3 March, Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has scored 25 Premier League goals - eight more than any other player.\nWhat next?\nVilla travel to Sheffield United on Saturday, while Leicester will look to make it nine wins on the bounce when they host Norwich City at the same time. Both sides are then in EFL Cup quarter-final action - Villa at home to Liverpool on Tuesday, and the Foxes at Everton on Wednesday."

        "article_text": "Norwich City 1-2 Sheffield United: Blades fightback leaves Canaries deep in trouble\nSheffield United came from behind to earn their first win in five Premier League games and leave Norwich City still four points adrift of safety.\nGeorge Baldock provided the cross for Enda Stevens' equaliser and then turned to fire in what proved to be the winner in a vastly improved second-half performance from the Blades.\nIn doing so, the visitors maintained their record of going unbeaten away from home in the top flight this season, a feat matched only by league leaders Liverpool.\nAs United moved eighth, two points behind fifth-placed Manchester United, Norwich, in 19th, missed the chance to close the gap on Aston Villa and Southampton, who were both beaten.\nThey deservedly led at the break after Alexander Tettey capitalised on confusion in the United box to lace in a skimming shot.\nBut the Canaries' defence buckled in the face of Blades pressure and paid the price for being both timid and static.\nThey might have seen a way back into the game when Chris Basham was shown a straight red card for a lunging challenge on Kenny McLean, only for VAR to downgrade the dismissal to a yellow for the first time in the Premier League.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League live\nBlades' week of VAR\nA bizarre second goal in United's 2-0 home defeat by Newcastle on Thursday led Blades manager Chris Wilder to say that football was \"sucking the life\" from him.\nWhether or not today's events have changed his opinion, there is no doubt that the visitors' final 16 minutes would have been much more uncomfortable had the red card been allowed to stand.\nOn first look, Basham's connection with McLean seemed reckless, but the United player lingered on the touchline as the decision was checked and reversed.\nA week on from a 2-2 draw at home to Arsenal punctuated by VAR checks, the Carrow Road crowd sang that the technology has made the game \"not football any more\".\nIn fairness, it did appear that the replays had ensured the correct decision was made.\nBlades back on track\nFor all their deserved plaudits and impressive results so far this season, United arrived in East Anglia on the back of three draws and that poor defeat by Newcastle.\nIn the first half, it looked like that run would continue as Norwich made most of the running and Lys Mousset cut an isolated figure in the Blades attack.\nWhatever was said at half-time produced an instant improvement from Wilder's men, led by the enterprising wing-backs on whom much of their success has been built.\nBaldock's deep cross from the right was met by Stevens, who overpowered Max Aarons to bullet a header past Tim Krul.\nThree minutes later, the turnaround was complete when the excellent Baldock won the ball in the 18-yard box and smartly pivoted to unleash a handsome finish across Krul.\nThough United rarely looked like surrendering the lead, they were still indebted to goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who denied substitute Todd Cantwell with a fine save low to his left.\nContrasting fortunes for promoted sides\nNorwich were promoted ahead of Sheffield United as last season's Championship winners, but are finding life in the top tier much more of a struggle.\nThey have improved of late, a struggle in front of goal ended with a win at Everton and that draw with Arsenal.\nAnd they looked sharp in the first period, a front four led by the running of striker Teemu Pukki causing problems for the tight Blades defence.\nWhen the visitors failed to clear a corner, Tettey lashed in a finish from around 12 yards out to give Norwich due reward for their first-half endeavour.\nHowever, wile their cutting edge has returned, the Canaries' defence has remained leaky and they have now conceded at least two in six of their past seven league games.\nAarons was bullied by Stevens for the first goal and Baldock was given too much time to steal, turn on and hit the ball for the second.\nFrom there - bar the momentary confusion over the red card - the result seemed in little doubt and could have been more emphatic had David McGoldrick not wasted two late chances.\nMan of the match - George Baldock\n'The swear kitty is into the 100s' - what they said\nNorwich City manager Daniel Farke told BBC Sport: \"I can't complain about the attitude, but if you make mistakes you are punished at this level. It is always a concern to lose a game and to concede goals. Today we were not good enough.\n\"We will be down after this hard knock. It was a big game for us. It's important to feel this disappointment and then we will have to go again.\"\nOn VAR: \"Its not my topic today. We lost and we are self-critical. All the VAR decisions against us we can't do anything about. I was not sure it was a clear and obvious mistake, but I am more concerned about the mistakes we made today.\"\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder told BBC Sport: \"They needed a bit of a stir at half-time - maybe we were feeling sorry for ourselves after losing on Thursday night. They looked leggy in the first half but I think we deserved to win the game.\"\nOn what was said at half-time: \"If there's a swear kitty I think it's into the 100s quite easily. I know my players. They listened. We were too safe in the first half and allowed Norwich to dictate. We were more like Sheffield United in the second half.\"\nOn VAR: \"My point on Thursday was not about the decision, but the amount of decisions. Today we have 29,000 singing the same song and its at the forefront of everything. There are some really good referees who have earned the right to referee in the Premier League and make those decisions. I'm not sure if the percentages that we're looking for in improvement are offset by the controversy that's being stirred up.\"\nHappy Blades travels - the stats\nSheffield United are still unbeaten away from home this season (W2 D6), their longest run without defeat from the start of a top-flight season since 1899-1900 (10 games).\nSheffield United are the first promoted side to remain unbeaten in their opening eight away Premier League games since Blackburn Rovers in the 1992-93 campaign.\nOnly Southampton (23) have conceded more home goals than Norwich in the Premier League this season (20), with the Canaries conceding at least twice in each of their last seven at Carrow Road.\nNorwich lost a Premier League game from ahead for the first time this season, while this was Sheffield United's first comeback win of the campaign.\nSheffield United's George Baldock has been involved in five Premier League goals this season (2 goals, 3 assists). Among defenders in the competition, only Liverpool full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold (7) and Andrew Robertson (6) have been involved in more.\nNorwich's Alexander Tettey scored his first Premier League goal in 1463 days, since netting against Southampton in January 2016.\nSheffield United forward David McGoldrick has had more shots without scoring than any other Premier League player this season (28), with the Irishman having a further three unsuccessful attempts in this match.\nWhat's next?\nNorwich travel to in-form Leicester City next Saturday (15:00 GMT). At the same time, Sheffield United host Aston Villa."

        "article_text": "Brighton 2-2 Wolves: Diogo Jota scores twice as Wolves keep unbeaten run going\nDiogo Jota scored twice as Wolves stretched their unbeaten run in the Premier League to 11 games with a 2-2 draw at Brighton.\nAll four goals were scored in an entertaining first half, with Jota putting the visitors ahead following a quick counter-attack, playing a one-two with Raul Jimenez before slotting in.\nThen came a crazy couple of minutes as Brighton turned the game on its head.\nFirst, Neal Maupay equalised after latching on to a long ball from Dale Stephens before thumping a strike beyond Rui Patricio's reach.\nThen, just 96 seconds later, the Seagulls took the lead when Davy Propper headed in Leandro Trossard's cross.\nBrighton went close to adding a third when Aaron Mooy swept an effort just wide of the far post, before Jota equalised a minute before half-time. Jonny pounced on a defensive mistake before finding Jota inside the area and the Portuguese forward turned and tucked a shot in at the far post.\nThe second half failed to match the high tempo of the first, with Brighton's Maupay going closest to finding a winner when he fired a fierce shot that was held by Patricio.\nThe point moves Wolves up to sixth in the table, while Brighton remain 12th.\nFearless Seagulls keep up attacking intent\nThe late afternoon Sunday game may not have featured one of the Premier League's traditional big guns but it nevertheless offered the prospect of an entertaining game, with both these teams having shown plenty of willingness to attack this season.\nThey certainly delivered in a fast-paced first half in which both sides scored twice - only the third time that has happened this season after Norwich's 3-2 defeat by Chelsea and Liverpool's 5-2 victory over Everton.\nFresh from beating Arsenal 2-1 last-time out, Brighton showed no fear against a Wolves side that had not lost in their previous 10 games and could easily have been out of sight in the first half, with Maupay's energy and Mooy's creativity proving a constant menace for the visitors' backline.\nBut Wolves' attacking flair is a lot for many Premier League teams to handle and in the end a draw was perhaps a fair result.\nHowever, if Brighton continue to play with this level of positivity they are unlikely to be looking too nervously over their shoulders in the second half of the season.\nWolves' unbeaten run continues\nIt is already hard to believe that relegation looked a serious threat for Wolves this season but that was certainly the case after they failed to win any of their first six Premier League games and appeared to struggle with juggling domestic and Europa League commitments.\nBut Nuno Espirito Santo's side have roared back impressively since recording their first Premier League win of the season on 28 September, when they beat Watford.\nThey had won three of their four league games prior to the trip to the Amex and another win would have taken them back above both Tottenham and Manchester United into fifth in the table.\nLike Brighton, they lacked that bit of extra energy in the second half as a third game in seven days perhaps took its toll.\nBut an 11th game without defeat means they are now on their longest unbeaten run in the top flight since 1962 and are looking well placed to challenge for a top-six finish.\nMan of the match - Diogo Jota (Wolves)\nWhat next?\nBrighton are not in action again until Monday, 16 December when they travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League (19:45 GMT) while Wolves host Besiktas in their final Europa League group game on Tuesday, 12 December (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "West Ham 1-3 Arsenal: Gunners gain first win under Freddie Ljungberg\nArsenal came from behind to end their nine-match winless streak as Freddie Ljungberg enjoyed his first victory as interim manager at the expense of his former club West Ham.\nEighteen-year-old Gabriel Martinelli marked his full Premier League debut by side-footing an equaliser which cancelled out Angelo Ogbonna's deflected first-half opener at London Stadium.\nWithin nine minutes, Nicolas Pepe had curled a magnificent second into the top corner and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired in a third.\nThe salvo turned the game on its head and piled the pressure on West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, whose side have taken four points from their past nine league games and conceded three times in three successive home games.\nThe Hammers remain a point above the relegation zone in 16th and face a trip to third-bottom Southampton on Saturday. Arsenal move up two places to ninth.\nPellegrini 'not worried' about relegation after loss to Arsenal\nLjungberg working on 'game-by-game basis'\nWest Ham v Arsenal as it happened, reaction and analysis\nFootball Daily: Ljungberg's Arsenal pull three points out of the bag\nArsenal recover from dismal start\nArsenal's victory was all the more remarkable because until Martinelli added to the seven goals he has scored in cup competitions this season, the visitors had been utterly woeful.\nClub officials had spoken before kick-off about the improved atmosphere triggered by Ljungberg's appointment as Unai Emery's replacement but it appeared this game would end in frustration, just as the previous two had done under the Swede.\nThe visitors were bereft of confidence and mild boos from the travelling support accompanied the end of a first half in which their side failed to have a shot on target and went behind when Ogbonna's header bounced in off Ainsley Maitland-Niles.\nTrue, they did not have much luck. Hector Bellerin was injured in the warm-up and when Kieran Tierney was helped off in obvious pain with a shoulder injury sustained in a seemingly innocuous tangle with Michail Antonio, Ljungberg had lost both his first-choice full-backs in the space of half an hour.\nNevertheless, it was pitiful stuff and when Aubameyang surged down the right wing and sent over a cross that flew over everyone and straight out for a throw-in on the other side of the pitch, it was symptomatic of a club apparently heading nowhere fast.\n'Nerveless' Martinelli rewards Ljungberg's faith\nIt was 1977 when Arsenal last went 10 matches without a win. With an away Europa League game against Standard Liege followed by a home encounter with Manchester City to come, at the interval it was not beyond the realms of possibility that the 12-game barren sequence from 1974 was going to be threatened.\nWith Alexandre Lacazette and David Luiz on the bench, it was two of Arsenal's most inexperienced players who sparked the change in fortune.\nLjungberg had obviously seen enough of Martinelli in two substitute appearances to trust the Brazilian with his first league start. The reward was a nerveless finish when his side needed it most. Sead Kolasinac provided the cross but there was still a lot to do for the Brazilian, who steered a first-time effort into the corner.\nEmery paid a club record \u00a372m for Pepe in August. With one league goal all season, the Frenchman has not really lived up to his billing but his goal here, a curling shot into the right-hand corner of David Martin's net, was perfect in its execution.\nAubameyang made certain of a win few would have anticipated 10 minutes earlier when his clinical finish took his tally for the season to 13. It disguised the fact he had been a virtual spectator for the first hour.\nAt the final whistle, Ljungberg ran to applaud the visiting fans, knowing he had given his own chances of replacing Emery a significant boost.\nWhat now for the unhappy Hammers?\nWhen they beat Chelsea 1-0 nine days ago to end their own winless sequence, it appeared West Ham were on an upward curve.\nThe combination of boos and thousands of empty seats that accompanied the final whistle on Monday underlined the truth of the matter.\nWest Ham are perilously close to dropping into the relegation zone, something the club cannot countenance after moving to the 60,000-capacity London Stadium.\nEven if Pellegrini survives this defeat, if West Ham lose again at Southampton on Saturday the calls for his dismissal will become piercingly loud.\nThis was the third home game running in which they had conceded three goals.\nThe Hammers were not particularly convincing when they were in front. Once they lost the advantage, the lack of confidence so clear in Arsenal's play transferred to theirs.\nRecord signing Sebastien Haller was left on the bench and even when he was introduced 20 minutes from time, he made no noticeable impact.\nMan of the match: Gabriel Martinelli (Arsenal)\n'Like a Duracell battery' - what they said\nArsenal interim boss Freddie Ljungberg told BBC Sport: \"The players have belief and tried to move the ball with more tempo. West Ham got tired.\n\"The players ran their socks off and fought. I believe in them. When I could see them put their shift in, I could see the quality. I thought 'it is here for the taking'.\n\"Martinelli did amazingly. He is like a Duracell battery, he keeps going. Laca [Alexandre Lacazette] is a tremendous player but I had to make a tough decision.\"\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini told BBC Sport: \"For 60 minutes there was just one team on the pitch. But football can be like this.\n\"We made mistakes in moments of defending. The problem was a lack of patience and quality to decide the game with a second goal and we made important mistakes in defence.\n\"The pressure for me is exactly the same if we win or lose. When you don't have results things are more difficult. If I had not seen the team play the way they did in the first 65 minutes, I might have doubts [about his ability to turn things around].\n\"After Southampton at the weekend we have a break. We must try to recover as quickly as we can and we must try to win those three points.\"\nRare Arsenal recovery away from home - the stats\nWest Ham have lost three in a row at home in the Premier League for the first time since August 2015.\nArsenal came from a half-time losing position to win a Premier League away game for the first time since October 2011 (5-3 v Chelsea).\nGabriel Martinelli is Arsenal's fourth-youngest scorer in the Premier League (18 years 174 days), after Cesc Fabregas, Serge Gnabry and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\nArsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been involved in 12 goals in his past 11 Premier League London derbies (nine goals, three assists).\nSince his Premier League debut in February 2018, Aubameyang has scored 43 goals in the competition, a joint-high along with Jamie Vardy.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal conclude their Europa League group phase campaign at Standard Liege on Thursday (17:55 GMT), still needing a draw to be sure of qualification before entertaining Manchester City at Emirates Stadium in the Premier League on Sunday (16:30). West Ham visit Southampton on Saturday (17:30)."

At this stage you have to show resilience and I believe we did that today. We have so many games but we are happy with this. Watford had their chances but we scored ours. We could have made the game easier for us but it's intense to be constantly in charge of the game. We have to defend with passion not organisation sometimes and that was sometimes now, right?\"\nWatford manager Nigel Pearson speaking to BT Sport: \"I have already told the players our destiny is in our own hands and that intensity of performance and decisive counter-attacking and creativity at times will serve us well for the rest of the season, we need to emulate that.\n\"It's always hard to come to places like this. There is a bit of risk and reward. We knew we would have to absorb pressure. The disappointment was their goal came from our set piece and that is something we need to address. I think we put them under strain and caused them problems but they have unbelievable players. We need to reflect on the performance and that going forwards will serve us well in the fight. I have seen more positives than negatives today. We have to make things happen and hopefully people have seen encouragement today.\"\nWorrying times for Watford - the stats\nLiverpool are unbeaten in 34 Premier League games (W29 D5), the third-longest run in the history of the competition after Arsenal (49) between May 2003-October 2004 and Chelsea (40) between October 2004-October 2005.\nWatford's Nigel Pearson became the ninth manager to face Liverpool at Anfield in their first Premier League game in charge of a team - with all nine losing to the Reds by an aggregate score of 3-19.\nWatford have won just nine points from 17 games this season - each of the nine previous teams to accumulate nine points or fewer after 17 Premier League matches were eventually relegated.\nLiverpool have won their last 16 home top-flight matches - they've only had one longer run at Anfield in their history, winning 21 in a row between January and December 1972.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has won seven Premier League games against Watford; against no side has he picked up more victories in the competition (level with Crystal Palace).\nMohamed Salah has now scored 84 goals in 126 appearances in all competitions for Liverpool - two more than Luis Suarez (82) netted in 133 games for the Reds.\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah has scored eight Premier League goals against Watford; more than he has netted against any other team in the big 5 European leagues.\nSadio Man\u00e9 has had a hand in nine goals in six Premier League appearances against Watford for Liverpool, scoring five and assisting four.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool's congested schedule continues with two matches on two continents in two days: they meet Aston Villa in their Carabao Cup quarter-final at Villa Park on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before travelling to Qatar for their Club World Cup semi-final the following day (17:30 GMT).\nWatford host Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday 22 December (14:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-0 Newcastle United: Chris Wood heads winner for Clarets\nSteve Bruce and Sean Dyche both questioned the appointment of referee Tim Robinson as the official took charge of a Premier League game for the first time in Burnley's 1-0 win over Newcastle at Turf Moor.\nBruce was unhappy when Robinson awarded a corner instead of a foul on Federico Fernandez 13 minutes into the second half, the official initially giving a goal-kick only to change his mind on the advice of his assistant.\nAshley Westwood took the corner and his delivery found Chris Wood, who headed home his seventh Premier League goal of the season to end Burnley's run of three straight defeats.\n\"Both teams huffed and puffed all day and we were hoping it's not going to rest on a refereeing decision and unfortunately, that's what's happened,\" Bruce told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"There were so many decisions that were strange and the big decision that wins or loses the game, he has got wrong.\"\nRobinson also took charge of Newcastle's Carabao Cup defeat by Leicester earlier this season, when Bruce was highly critical of his decision to only book Hamza Choudhury for a foul on Matt Ritchie, describing it as a \"horror\" tackle.\nThe Scotland international suffered an ankle injury as a result and has not featured for the club since.\n\"The same referee missed a challenge that has had Matt Richie not kicking a ball all season,\" added Bruce. \"So I understand how difficult it is but, for me, Burnley versus Newcastle on a day like today, is it really the right occasion for him to make his debut? I'm sorry but it didn't look quite right from the first whistle.\"\nBurnley boss Dyche also questioned why Robinson was handed this fixture, rather than a match involving some of the division's bigger sides.\n\"A few of us have fed back to the powers that be that it seems that teams like us do get these first-time referees and then you go, 'Well, why don't you put them in the big games?' because if they've got to learn, they've got to learn - because these are big games for us,\" said Dyche.\n\"These can decide up and down in a division so I think there's just a little bit less tolerance, not because of the referee you understand, but if you are going to blood these people into the highest division, which needs to happen, why is it only our games? Why is it not the big games? If they're deemed good enough for the Premier League then put them in the big games.\"\nBurnley have kept clean sheets in all five of their Premier League home wins this season and rarely looked like conceding against a Newcastle side without several creative players, including top scorer Jonjo Shelvey and winger Allan Saint-Maximin.\nThe win lifts Burnley up to 12th, six points clear of the relegation zone and one point and one place behind opponents Newcastle, who suffered their first defeat in four matches.\nAs it happened: Burnley 1-0 Newcastle\nFollow reaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nBurnley end losing run\nBurnley went into the game on the back of six defeats in eight and having lost their past three league games by an aggregate score of 1-11, leaving them within three points of the bottom three.\nBut in this remarkably tight Premier League a few wins can make a huge difference and Saturday's victory moves the Clarets to within three points of the top six.\nDyche was able to recall Ashley Barnes after missing the last two games with a groin problem, meaning he could resume his profitable partnership with Wood.\nThe pair have scored 62% of Burnley's goals in 2019, though they struggled to get much joy out of a resolute Newcastle backline.\nBurnley's only opportunity during the first half was an optimistic long-range effort from Dwight McNeil that was pushed away by Martin Dubravka.\nWood remains a fearsome threat from set-pieces and his winner was his 10th headed goal in the Premier League since the start of last season, at least two more than any other player.\nJack Cork should have sealed the win when he robbed Sean Longstaff of the ball inside the Newcastle half and evaded Fernandez on the edge of the area, but his low shot was well blocked by Dubravka.\nInjuries catch up with Newcastle\nIn contrast to Burnley, Newcastle went into this game on the back of successive victories, scoring twice in each game, to raise hopes that the second half of the campaign will be spent competing in the top half of the table.\nBut a mounting injury list looks to have caught up with Bruce's side, particularly in attack, as they failed to have a shot on target for the third time this season.\nHitting the ball towards lone striker Andy Carroll was an obvious tactic, with Newcastle attempting 20 crosses from open play.\nBut bar an early Isaac Hayden cross that Carroll headed wide, Newcastle's delivery into the box was poor, even from set-pieces.\nBrazilian forward Joelinton was deployed on the left wing in the absence of Saint-Maximin but again struggled to make an impact.\nHis best chance was a swerving volley from just outside the area that hit the side netting on 71 minutes.\nMan of the match - Ashley Westwood\n'We've had a tough week' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche told Match of the Day: \"We've had a tough week with three losses. Against two top sides we didn't perform as we can do. We've got a tight win today. Chris Wood has been ill for a few days and he stuck at it.\n\"We have a tight group here. I was really pleased with the mentality today. I'm pleased with the performance but I'm most pleased with the result today.\n\"It was a tight, awkward game but we've done the right things and come out on top.\"\nWood uses his head again - the stats\nBurnley stopped their opponents from registering a shot on target for the first time in their 207 Premier League games.\nA team has failed to direct a shot on target on nine occasions in a Premier League game this season; Newcastle United have bene responsible on three occasions.\nEach of Burnley's past seven Premier League victories have come without conceding a goal.\nNewcastle have lost five of their past seven Premier League away games, after losing just one of the five before that (W3 D1).\nChris Wood has netted 15 goals in the Premier League in 2019 for Burnley, a joint-high for the Clarets along with Ashley Barnes.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to the south coast to take on Bournemouth while Newcastle host Crystal Palace in the Premier League next Saturday, 21 December (both 15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Leicester 1-1 Norwich: Foxes fall further behind Liverpool with draw\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers says he is not thinking about the growing gap behind league leaders Liverpool after his side were held to a draw by a battling Norwich at King Power Stadium.\nThe Foxes, who remain second, now lie 10 points behind league leaders Liverpool, following their hard-fought win over Watford in Saturday's early game.\nWhen asked about the blow to his side's title ambitions, Rodgers said: \"It's not something we've spoken about, everyone else has.\n\"These players have been brilliant, it says everything we have drawn a game and everyone is disappointed.\n\"We weren't quite at our level but we managed to get back and get a point. We'll press the rest button and get ready for a [Carabao Cup] quarter-final on Wednesday [at Everton].\"\nNorwich, who were impressive, deservedly took the lead when Teemu Pukki slotted home after being sent through by Emiliano Buendia.\nBut their lead only lasted 12 minutes as Leicester equalised when Jamie Vardy's bullet header was turned into the net by Norwich keeper Tim Krul.\nBoth sides pressed hard for a winner in an entertaining second half, with Vardy twice going close, but neither side could find a way through.\nThe point sees Norwich close the gap on Aston Villa and Southampton to three points but they remain 19th.\nAs it happened: Leicester 1-1 Norwich\nFollow reaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nFoxes frustrated by resolute Canaries\nHaving reached a club-record eight consecutive Premier League wins last week with victory over Aston Villa, the Foxes had the chance to equal their club record for wins in all competitions against the Canaries (10).\nHowever, they failed to produce either the result or the performance that had seen them sweep aside the likes of Villa, Watford and Brighton in weeks gone by.\nOf course there were chances for Brendan Rodgers' side to win it but the ruthless touch they have displayed throughout 2019-20 eluded them.\nJames Maddison was bright as usual, as was Youri Tielemans, but neither of them were able to prise open a resolute Norwich backline; Wilfred Ndidi should have twice done better with free headers from Maddison deliveries.\nVardy, who had found the net in his previous eight league games, was expertly denied by Krul late on while the former England man could only find the woodwork after rounding the Canaries keeper early in the second half.\nAnd while he may have thought he'd kept up his impressive run of scoring when his first-half header was deflected in by Krul, his streak was ultimately ended by one of the Premier League's leakiest defences.\nWhere does this leave Leicester's title charge?\nThe Foxes were flying coming into this game.\nThey had won their last eight league games, nine including the Carabao Cup victory over Burton Albion, and they had overtaken reigning champions Manchester City as Liverpool's chief rivals in the Premier League title race.\nBut despite having picked up 25 of the last 27 points on offer to them, they sit 10 points adrift of the league leaders.\nAnd while they still have the division's best defensive record, there are sterner tests to come.\nNamely, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City next weekend.\nIf Rodgers' side are beaten at the Etihad their chances of replicating their stunning 2015-16 title-winning campaign are surely almost all but diminished.\nHowever, if they can pick themselves up after this setback and pull off an unlikely victory against the reigning champions their confidence will go through the roof ahead of a massive Boxing Day clash with Liverpool.\nStruggling Norwich show up again\nNorwich have already lost to fellow Premier League strugglers Southampton, Watford and West Ham this season, preferring, it seems, to save their best performances for the big games.\nHaving taken points off Manchester City, Arsenal and Everton, they continued the trend at Leicester and produced a fine performance against the division's in-form side.\nThey played with confidence throughout and, while there were a few nervy moments at the back, they threatened the Foxes' goal consistently.\nEven after Pukki had scored with a nerveless finish, he continued to find himself in space behind the Leicester backline and he could well have netted again had it not been for excellent defending from Caglar Soyuncu and Ricardo Pereira, who both produced potentially goal-saving blocks.\nPukki could have also found the net in the first half when he turned Max Aarons' cross wide from close range - his efforts are made all the more impressive as he played the second half with a fractured toe, according to manager Daniel Farke.\nNorwich's Pukki plays on with broken toe\nMeanwhile, Todd Cantwell shone on his return to the side, playing with a real swagger, while Buendia impressed with his ball-playing ability.\nHowever, despite this confidence-boosting result the Canaries still sit in the relegation zone as we near the midway point in the season, illustrating that they have not been able to produce performances like this one consistently enough.\nMan of the match - Caglar Soyuncu (Leicester)\n'We need to hit the reset button' - what they said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"When you play at home you always want to win. I think the players showed a great mentality. Norwich started bright and deservedly went in front but second half we were much better.\n\"It just looked like one of those games. It's a point and we need to look forwards now. The players have been brilliant. When you are on that winning run you believe you are going to win every game but of course it does not work like that. We were not 100% on it. We need to hit the reset button.\"\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke: \"The goal was a fantastic pass and finish. It looks like [Teemu Pukki] has fractured his toe which is a worry but if he had been fully fit he might have got those goals.\n\"He is in brilliant shape at the minute but he is in a lot of pain. The fact he wanted to play on shows his character.\"\nNorwich goalscorer Teemu Pukki: \"I am happy. Leicester is a hard place to come to and they have been on an amazing run.\n\"I am a bit disappointed as I had some chances I could have got in. We had to be more defensive in our tactics and set-up today and go from there but I think we could have had a few more goals today. I am happy to be back scoring again. We have been getting points lately but now we need to start winning games.\"\nLeicester's James Maddison: \"I think it's two points dropped. We know Norwich are a threat even if the table does not show that. They are fighting for their life.\n\"It just didn't drop for us today - it was important that we did not lose today. When the game is not going our way we have to make sure we do not lose, and we managed that.\"\nPukki the Canaries' key man - the stats\nLeicester City are unbeaten in their last nine Premier League games, picking up 25 points in the process (eight wins, one draw). Against Norwich, the Foxes dropped points at home for the first time since the opening weekend against Wolves.\nNorwich have won just once in their last 12 Premier League games (three draws, eight defeats).\nNorwich have won four points in their last three away games in the top-flight, as many as in their previous 16 combined.\nTeemu Pukki has been directly involved in 12 Premier League goals this season (nine goals, three assists), twice as many as any other Norwich player.\nSince the start of last season, Norwich's Teemu Pukki has scored more league goals (excluding play-offs) than any other player in England's top four tiers (38).\nSince August 2018, Emiliano Buendia has provided more league assists than any other Norwich player (17).\nNorwich goalkeeper Tim Krul scored his first ever Premier League own-goal, in what was his 172nd appearance in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester's next match sees them take on Everton in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals at Goodison Park on Wednesday (19:45 GMT), before they travel to the Etihad to face Manchester City on Saturday (17:30).\nMeanwhile, Norwich's next match sees them host Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-1 Bournemouth: Dan Gosling's late goal gifts Cherries win\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe said his side went through \"a lot of soul searching\" before their late win at Chelsea.\nDan Gosling's goal, which was awarded by the video assistant referee (VAR), gave the injury-hit Cherries their first victory since early November in a scrappy encounter at Stamford Bridge.\nThe result ended their five-match losing streak and handed them their third away win of the season. Their last Premier League points had come on 2 November, when they beat Manchester United at home.\n\"It's been a really difficult run, a lot of soul searching has gone on,\" Howe told BBC Match of the Day. \"We've lost a lot of players to injuries and we had to step up to a really tough test.\n\"We had to come up with something slightly different because if you do the same things you get the same result.\n\"In the second half I thought we were a real threat in the match and we could have scored more. Our goalkeeper at the other end made some big saves.\"\nThe match looked to be heading for a goalless draw when Gosling flicked the ball over his and Blues keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga's head, the effort originally ruled out for offside before VAR awarded the goal.\nBournemouth - who move up to 14th in the table - have now beaten Chelsea three times in their five Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge, the latest consigning Chelsea to their fourth league defeat in their last five matches.\nFrank Lampard's side lacked tempo and creativity and were undone by a resolute Bournemouth defence, but their manager rejected suggestions it was a reality check for his team.\n\"Maybe for the fans and the players, but not for me,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"I didn't get excited in the great run that we had, the Premier League is tough and I felt there was a lot of improvement needed, and that's proved true.\"\nHe added: \"I think it's a reaction time for everybody, myself, the players. Fans are coming here and watching us at home struggle to beat teams that we should beat.\n\"I expected us to offer more to break a team down that was as organised as Bournemouth were.\n\"Sometimes you can work on things all week and recreating them on a match day is a difficult thing. Today we were too slow with the ball.\"\nCherries rewarded for battling performance\nWith Howe forced to choose from a depleted squad after Nathan Ake became the latest to join the Cherries' considerable injury list, he made four changes to the side who lost to Liverpool last week, with Gosling - one of four central midfielders selected - making his first start of the season after a hip injury.\nThe visitors started brightly in the first half, Lewis Cook proving troublesome in an unfamiliar wide midfield role before Ryan Fraser had a shot smothered by Arrizabalaga.\nBy half-time, they had enjoyed just 34% of the possession but that was not reflective of the challenge they posed to Chelsea, rarely allowing the Blues a chance on goal with Cherries keeper Aaron Ramsdale stopping those they did carve out.\nThere was a rise in tempo at the start of the second half as Chelsea found a much-needed second gear, with Cook going in the book for a lunging tackle on Emerson.\nBournemouth's ventures into Chelsea's half were few and far between but when they did cross the halfway line, their hosts looked far from comfortable with Joshua King enjoying several forays forward.\nRamsdale denied Emerson from point-blank range as the match headed for a stalemate before substitute Dominic Solanke - replacing King, who rolled off the pitch after picking up a knock - almost got a touch a few feet out from Arrizabalaga's goal.\nBut Chelsea were left shellshocked after Gosling's goal - one of only two shots on target the Cherries had.\nWith his back to goal, Gosling perfectly flicked the ball over and in, with the Bournemouth end of Stamford Bridge erupting as VAR made its decision.\nChelsea lack zest in frustrating show\nChelsea came into this match on the back of a 3-1 defeat by Everton last week, a match in which, once again, their vulnerabilities in defence had been on show.\nLampard brought in Antonio Rudiger to face Bournemouth for only his second league appearance this season and the Germany international shone in the Blues' defence, making more clearances and winning more possession than any of his team-mates.\nIn an uneventful first half, Chelsea's performance was lifeless, Mason Mount having perhaps the best opportunity to put his side ahead only to be denied by a solid Ramsdale save.\nWillian showed glimpses of magic at the heart of every attack the Blues managed to put together, but they went into the interval having been unable to break down Bournemouth's defence - and showing no sign of ideas of how they might.\nWhen the second half got under way, they looked to have raised their game as they rained in attack after attack , with Emerson going closest to scoring.\nBut Mateo Kovacic scuppered a late chance to equalise, and Chelsea have now lost two of their last three league home games - as many as they had in the previous 28.\nMan of the match - Dan Gosling (Bournemouth)\nMatch stats\nSince they were promoted to the Premier League in 2015, no side has won more top-flight away games against Chelsea than Bournemouth (three, level with Liverpool).\nChelsea have lost two of their last three Premier League home games (W1), as many as they had in their previous 28 at Stamford Bridge (W16 D10 L2).\nHaving scored in 14 consecutive home league games, Chelsea have now failed to score in two of their last three at Stamford Bridge.\nChelsea have lost five of their 14 home games in all competitions this season, just one fewer than they had in 62 games over 2017-18 and 2018-19 combined.\nBournemouth had just two shots on target in this match - the first of the game in the third minute before Gosling's 84th-minute winner.\nGosling scored his first Premier League goal since April, in what was his first start of the season.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel across London to face Tottenham on Sunday, 22 December (16:30 GMT), while Bournemouth host Burnley the day before (15:00 GMT).\nChelsea v Bournemouth - as it happened"

Our play was effective and all managers are after that.\"\nAfter an uneventful first half, Fleck finished off a sumptuous move - started by Chris Basham's back-heel before John Lundstram's quality delivery - to give the hosts the lead.\nThe Scotland midfielder doubled the advantage with a composed finish following David McGoldrick's clever hook before Villa missed a penalty awarded following a video assistant referee (VAR) check for a John Egan handball.\nHowever, Jack Grealish's effort cannoned off the bar as Villa sank to a 10th Premier League defeat of the season.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nRelentless Blades showing no let-up\nWilder said before this game that his team still faced a battle to retain their Premier League status\n, external\ndespite their impressive form, which has included beating Arsenal and coming from behind to hold Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea.\nThis hard-earned win leaves them on 25 points, while a sixth clean sheets ensures the Blades have the best defensive record outside the top two.\nThey turned on the style after a drab opening 45 minutes in which neither side managed a shot on target.\nHaving been booked in the first half to trigger a one-match suspension against Brighton next weekend, Fleck doubled his tally for the season with two well-taken goals.\nHis sweeping finish broke the deadlock after Basham's delightful back-heel caught out Villa's defence, while Fleck showed composure to beat Tom Heaton and make it 2-0.\nThe Blades remain unbeaten on the road since 19 January, yet their home form - which includes defeats by Southampton and Newcastle - has been unpredictable.\nThis gritty performance, however, ensures they launch a busy spell of four games in 13 days, starting with next Saturday's visit to Brighton, with confidence sky high.\nCrunch time for Villa\nWhile Sheffield United are flying high at the top end of the table, Villa are flirting with danger at the other end.\nHaving lost three games in a row, their next three top-flight matches are against fellow strugglers Southampton (home), Norwich (home) and Watford (away).\nDespite missing key defender Tyrone Mings through injury, Dean Smith's side stifled the Blades for long periods but their inability to keep a clean sheet after the interval once again cost them.\nFleck's double means Villa have conceded 22 of their 30 goals after half-time.\nIt is not only in defence where there is need for improvement. At the other end of the pitch, striker Wesley rippled the side-netting yet the Brazilian is now without a goal in nine games.\nTrailing 1-0, Grealish headed a good chance wide while his miss from the penalty spot, after the Blades had doubled their lead, extinguished any hope of a comeback.\nIn the end, Villa left Bramall Lane without managing a single attempt on target - not good enough for a team that is leaking goals at a worrying rate.\nMan of the match - John Fleck (Sheffield United)\n'Class act' - what they said\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder: \"I have to say, Dean Smith and John Terry were in the tunnel clapping our players because they recognise our players' performance today. That's a class act and people won't see that but I want to mention it.\n\"It was a proper second-half performance. It was a cagey first half and I don't think we had many big opportunities, but I felt it was coming before half-time and we stepped it up in the second half.\n\"We rode our luck with Jack Grealish missing the penalty, but I think the right result has happened today.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"Our overall performance wasn't what I wanted from this group of players. We didn't cause them enough problems.\n\"The second goal was a bit of a killer but they probably deserved the win on the day.\n\"The players need lifting, we've lost three games on the spin but I just said to the players that a few games ago we were walking off the pitch at Old Trafford a couple of days after beating Newcastle and we should have got a win at Manchester United.\"\nPenalty woes for Villa - the stats\nOf the 16 Premier League sides to take a penalty in the competition this season, Aston Villa are the only ones yet to score a spot-kick.\nSheffield United's John Fleck has scored four goals in his last four league games at Bramall Lane, one more than he managed in his previous 73 in the league on home soil.\nFleck has scored a double for the first time in his 314 English league games.\nAston Villa have lost six of their last eight Premier League games (W1 D1), after losing just one of the five before that.\nSheffield United have lost just one of their last 10 Premier League games (W4 D5), after losing three of the five before that.\nWhat's next?\nWhile Sheffield United have a free week to prepare for next Saturday's game at Brighton (15:00 GMT), Aston Villa are back in action on Tuesday when they host a weakened Liverpool - whose first-team are at the Fifa Club World Cup in Qatar - in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals (19:45 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-1 West Ham: Sebastien Haller settles relegation clash\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini says he \"never lost trust in what we do\" after a deserved win at relegation rivals Southampton which could ease some pressure on him.\nThe Chilean could reportedly have lost his job\n, external\nhad they lost, following a run of only one win in 11 games.\n\"I don't read the media but I am not stupid,\" he told BBC Sport. \"If you don't get results, if you have five points from 30, you're in a difficult moment.\"\nSebastien Haller scored the only goal from Pablo Fornals' knock-down in the first half.\nThe Hammers - who had a strong penalty appeal turned down by the video assistant referee - thought they had doubled their lead through Michail Antonio but his goal was ruled out by the VAR for handball.\nSaints improved after the break and Danny Ings hit the woodwork twice - although the offside flag had gone up for one of them - and he then had a goal ruled out for a Moussa Djenepo foul.\n\"I can't divide myself from the team,\" said Pellegrini. \"For West Ham it was an important three points.\n\"I said before the game that I felt every day the commitment of the players in the work that they do. I am happy for the players. We started the season very well and I hope now we have recovered our best performance for the next games.\"\nSouthampton - whose manager Ralph Hasenhuttl is also under pressure - remain in the relegation zone, with the Hammers now four points clear in 15th place.\n\"To stay in the league we need to win these home games against these type of opponents,\" said the Saints manager.\nFollow reaction to the game here\nWest Ham boost morale despite VAR controversies\nWest Ham's struggles are perhaps best illustrated by the fact Haller is their top scorer despite this goal - only his second since August - ending an eight-game drought.\nThe Hammers had only won once in their past 11 games in all competitions but Pellegrini's side put in one of their best performances of the past couple of months, with Antonio and Haller lively up front.\nThe London side started on the front foot, with Declan Rice having a header from Robert Snodgrass' free-kick rightly disallowed for offside in the opening two minutes.\nWest Ham then had a penalty appeal - in fact two penalty appeals in one - turned down. Ryan Bertrand appeared to push Haller as Jan Bednarek was grappling with Antonio at the same time - but the VAR did not give a penalty for either.\n\"I was in a headlock and he got pushed,\" said Antonio afterwards.\nWest Ham fully deserved the breakthrough when Antonio kept the ball in play and pulled it back for Snodgrass, whose cross was headed back by Fornals to Haller to smash home a shot on the bounce.\nIt looked as if it was 2-0 when Antonio controlled the ball, blocked Bednarek's clearance and blasted in. But VAR discovered that Antonio had used his hand in the initial bit of control. West Ham players and fans were furious but this season's handball laws mean that you cannot use your hand and then score even if it was accidental.\n\"I think I'm going to cut my hands off,\" Antonio said. \"It happened to me at Chelsea and it happened to me today. It is like they are magnets or something.\"\nThe Hammers did not look quite so comfortable after the hour mark, although Haller almost doubled their lead with a fine header wonderfully saved by Alex McCarthy.\nBut West Ham saw the game out for only a second win since beating Manchester United on 22 September.\nThere was a worry at the end as David Martin hurt himself while taking a goal-kick in injury time but he played the final seconds because the visitors had already made three substitutions.\nSaints struggle despite Ings' best efforts\nSouthampton looked as if they might have turned the corner with 2-1 wins against relegation rivals Watford and Norwich in their past two home games.\nBut they are back to square one, having also lost at Newcastle last time out.\nThey only managed two shots on target against West Ham, with neither Shane Long's header nor James Ward-Prowse's 20-yard shot really threatening Martin.\nHasenhuttl - who had gone to a 4-4-2 formation in recent weeks - made a system change at half-time, bringing on midfielder Oriel Romeu for winger Nathan Redmond - and they were better afterwards, but still not good enough.\n\"We took more risks in the second half - we had to,\" Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport.\nIt would have been a smash and grab had Ings scored when he controlled Djenepo's cross before rifling a shot off the crossbar. Long turned the rebound wide.\nThe former Liverpool striker, who had scored in his previous five games, then hit the post after latching onto a long ball. The offside flag had gone up - although he appeared to be onside so it is likely a goal would have been given by VAR had he hit the back of the net.\nHe did finally beat Martin with a fine 20-yard curling effort but the whistle had already gone for a foul by Djenepo - again a debatable decision.\nBut Southampton, who have only scored 18 goals and conceded 36 this season, will need to play better than this if an eight-season stay in the Premier League is going to be extended.\n\"We know we have a difficult situation but we have seen a team fighting for three points but today we were not good enough,\" said Hasenhuttl.\n\"We knew it would be a very tough game for us. In the first half we had big problems with the long balls.

        "article_text": "Man United 1-1 Everton: Mason Greenwood secures draw for Red Devils at Old Trafford\nManchester United substitute Mason Greenwood scored a 77th-minute equaliser to deny Duncan Ferguson a second successive win as Everton's interim manager.\nEverton looked set for back-to-back league victories for the first time since April when Victor Lindelof turned Leighton Baines' first-half corner into his own goal, with VAR ruling David de Gea had not been impeded by Dominic Calvert-Lewin as they jumped at the near post.\nIt was fitting that 18-year-old Greenwood should come off the bench to rescue a point with a fine shot from the edge of the area, given that this game marked the 4,000th consecutive game in which United have named an academy player in their matchday squad.\nEverton's fans were delighted at the end though, singing Ferguson's name in tribute to the Scot's impact since replacing sacked Marco Silva.\nDespite the cold and rain, Ferguson spent most of the game in nothing more than a shirt and tie, and long after the final whistle went over to acknowledge the visiting fans.\nThe result means United have collected 25 points from their first 17 games, one fewer than they had at the same point last season when Jose Mourinho was sacked.\n'Haaland has decided future' - Solskjaer\nWas Everton's Kean harshly treated?\nWhat now for Everton?\nEverton's hierarchy have some serious thinking to do.\nOwner Farhad Moshiri and chairman Bill Kenwright sat side-by-side in the Old Trafford directors' box. Kenwright chewed furiously on a piece of gum as the stresses of the game took hold.\nFerguson has stressed repeatedly he does not wish to be considered for the manager's job full-time. Yet it is clear the Everton fans love him and the Scot's exuberant goal celebrations demonstrate his love for the club. More importantly, their players have a sense of purpose that so often seemed to be lacking during Silva's reign.\nThe notable draw was achieved without the experience of Morgan Schneiderlin and Theo Walcott, who were ruled out with calf injuries, and Gylfi Sigurdsson, who was taken ill at the team hotel.\nIt included a brutal substitution of substitute - and big-money signing - Moise Kean, who had only been on the pitch 18 minutes when he was replaced in the closing stages, blanked by his manager as he trudged off down the touchline towards the tunnel.\nWith a Carabao Cup quarter-final against Leicester on Wednesday to come before the packed Christmas schedule, there must be a temptation for Moshiri and Kenwright to leave things as they are and reassess in the New Year.\n\"It was a fantastic performance,\" said Ferguson. \"We couldn't hang on but I can't complain and I'm delighted with a point.\n\"The players seem to be motivated. They are in a perilous position and understand that - they have to fight for the shirt and that's what I'm doing. They should have been doing it all season. I've managed to galvanise them and push them on.\"\nGreenwood a United star\nIt has been an excellent few days for Greenwood, who rescued United on this occasion just three days after scoring twice in the Europa League against AZ Alkmaar.\nSolskjaer spent a large chunk of his post-match press conference on Thursday talking about the striker. and that praise was justified as the teenager scored in a league game at Old Trafford for the first time.\nSpeaking after Greenwood's performance against Everton, the United manager continued in the same vein.\n\"You wanted the ball to drop to Mason, because he's so calm and composed - when he gets chances, he takes them.\n\"It is just so natural for him, he knows what to do. If you open or get close, he bends it round you. Too many chances are missed in general, or strikers rush the finish, but the best have that extra half second, and he does.\"\nOnly Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck have scored at a younger age in the Premier League at Old Trafford for United. Greenwood has already scored more goals than Macheda and will hope to stay clear of the injuries that dogged Welbeck at United.\nWith seven goals to his name, Greenwood is now clear as United's second top scorer behind Marcus Rashford this season.\nUnited's creative gap\nThere was plenty of talk about Solskjaer's trip to Austria to see Red Bull Salzburg's Erling Haaland on Friday in the build-up to the game.\nHaaland is evidently of interest to United and Solskjaer's positive relationship with the 19-year-old, who played under him at Molde, is an advantage.\nAsked about his visit to Austria and the speculation over Haaland following the draw with Everton, Solskjaer would only say: \"He knows what he wants to do and what he's going to do.\"\nBut it is a lack of creativity in midfield that really needs addressing.\nUnited have managed to amass 14 points from six games against the remainder of England's 'big six', plus current title challengers Leicester, but have registered only 11 from their other 12 matches against teams less likely to attack them and leave spaces for the counter.\nPaul Pogba is Solskjaer's most creative player but the Frenchman has featured just twice since August and not at all since the draw against Arsenal on 30 September.\nHe is due to start training again this week after ankle surgery amid continuing speculation about a move away from Old Trafford next summer.\nMan of the match - Tom Davies (Everton)\nEverton's poor Old Trafford record won't go away - the stats\nManchester United have lost just one of their last 27 home league games against Everton (W20 D6 L1).\nEverton have won only one of their last 12 away Premier League games (D4 L7), taking just seven points from a possible 36.\nManchester United are without a keep clean sheet in their last 12 league matches - their worst run since a 12-game stretch between April and August 1971.\nEverton have gone ahead in four away Premier League games this season but won just one of those, away at Southampton (W1 D1 L2).\nManchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has now gone 12 consecutive Premier League matches without keeping a clean sheet - the longest run of his career.\nOnly Marcus Rashford (13) has more goals in all competitions for Man Utd this season than 18-year-old Mason Greenwood (7).\nGreenwood is the youngest scorer (18y 75d) at Old Trafford for Manchester United in the Premier League since Federico Macheda in April 2009 against Aston Villa (17y 226d).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United are next in action against League Two Colchester in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday (20:00 GMT) before a Premier League trip to bottom side Watford on 22 December (14:00 GMT). Everton are also in the Carabao Cup last eight and entertain Leicester on Wednesday (19:45) before hosting Arsenal on 21 December (12:30)."

They are not just there for the top six. They can do more. They are a fantastic team. This is a big victory.\n\"This game is a special game because the opponent is a special opponent. Nuno [Espirito Santo] has to be very proud of Wolves' record.\"\nOn his own side's progress, he added: \"We went about a year without winning a Premier League game away and we've managed two in a short amount of time. Now we are not looking to the bottom of the table, we're looking higher up.\"\nAnalysis: 'Why Spurs' midfield should concern Mourinho' - Jermaine Jenas\nFollowing a breathless opening period, Lucas Moura's mazy run and exquisite finish into the roof of the net had put Tottenham ahead after eight minutes.\nSpurs had to withstand intense pressure as Wolves chased an equaliser, but it was they who went closest before half-time as Eric Dier struck the post from Dele Alli's delightful, dinked pass.\nTottenham goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga produced an excellent save from Romain Saiss' header in the closing stages as Mourinho's visitors appeared to be hanging on, before Vertonghen's decisive goal.\nVictory sees Tottenham climb above Wolves to fifth, three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea who they face next Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nLive coverage of Sunday's Premier League games\nSpurs weather storm to close in on top four\nAhead of his side's trip to Molineux, Tottenham boss Mourinho made clear his belief that Spurs will qualify for next season's Champions League via a top-four finish in the Premier League.\nVertonghen's late header has suddenly turned that into a very realistic prospect, with Spurs set to welcome the Blues - who slumped to a fourth league defeat in five against Bournemouth on Saturday - to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next weekend.\nAiming for a fifth consecutive top-four finish, Spurs have narrowed an 11-point gap to the Champions League places with four wins from five league games since Mourinho's appointment.\nWith the top-four door ajar, Spurs made a purposeful start as Son Heung-min saw an attempt stopped by Rui Patricio, but it did not take long for their early enthusiasm to pay off as Moura's fast feet and emphatic finish stunned Wolves.\nA second goal always appeared crucial for Mourinho's side, who had conceded at least two goals in five of their six games under the Portuguese prior to kick-off, as the energetic hosts dominated in possession and territory.\nOften unconvincing, the Spurs backline weathered the storm and allowed for counter opportunities - but Dier was unable to provide the finish that Alli's sublime pass over the Wolves defence deserved.\nOutplayed and having not kept a clean sheet away from home since New Year's Day - a club-record run of 16 matches - Traore's equaliser came as no surprise.\nWhat will delight Mourinho, however, was the determined manner of his side's response to conceding, and a confidence-boosting late winner that puts their top-four hopes firmly in their own hands.\nResult harsh on impressive Wolves\nAs the halfway stage of the season approaches, a Wolves side which could be forgiven for suffering a hint of fatigue played with an intensity and determination that was fully deserving of a point - if not all three.\nNuno Espirito Santo has praised his players' commitment and togetherness during their packed campaign, which has seen them play 31 games as they juggle domestic competition with their first European campaign in almost 40 years.\nWolves typically relish their match-ups with the Premier League's big sides and responded to their early setback in style with a swashbuckling home display.\nThe ever-improving Traore's low drive forced Gazzaniga into action, while Raul Jimenez dragged wide and Diogo Jota saw an attempt blocked following a swift counter as the hosts began to pick their way through the Tottenham defence.\nDespite contesting their fifth game in 15 days, Wolves pressed and harried Spurs, boasting 87.5% of possession in the final five minutes of the first half, but to no avail.\nThey emerged in the second half with the same intent, as Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves continued to dictate the play and Jimenez again went close before Traore's spectacular equaliser after 67 minutes.\nA menace all game, Toby Alderweireld and Vertonghen struggled to cope with Traore's frightening pace down the right, with Spurs resorting to fouling the 23-year-old as he threatened to burst away on several occasions.\nWith a point on the horizon, conceding in the 91st minute will come as a huge disappointment to Nuno's side - though once the dust settles they will surely feel proud of another excellent showing.\nMan of the match - Adama Traore (Wolves)\n'Three incredible points' - what they said\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho: \"We knew the game was going to be difficult. They didn't catch us by surprise. We had a very good start like we tried to. We almost scored a second goal but against Wolves that would not have killed the game.\n\"We knew if we arrive in the last part we could score. After that we had to close the door for the last five minutes. Three incredible points.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo: \"Of course I'm pleased with the performance. We played very good. We weren't perfect, almost. We should have defended better. We played well and created chances. I'm very pleased with the boys.\n\"The final moments require a lot of focus. We must stay in the game until the end. We were more obsessed about scoring than defending.\"\nLast-gasp winners a rarity for Spurs - the stats\nTottenham have won two of their three Premier League away games under Jose Mourinho, as many as they did in Mauricio Pochettino's final 14 away from home in the competition.\nSince a 3-1 defeat as Chelsea boss in October 2015, Mourinho has not lost any of his last 54 Premier League games when his side has scored the opening goal.\nLucas Moura has scored three goals in five Premier League appearances under Mourinho after managing only one in 10 games under Pochettino earlier this season.\nJan Vertonghen scored Tottenham's first 90th-minute winner in the Premier League since Harry Winks against Fulham in January.\nWolves suffered just their third home defeat in the top flight in 2019 and their first since a 5-2 defeat by Chelsea in September.\nAdama Traore's equaliser for Wolves was his fourth goal of the season in 26 appearances, which is twice as many as he scored in his previous 82 matches as a Premier League player in all competitions.\nNo two players have combined for more Premier League goals this season than Traore and Raul Jimenez.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham will learn their Champions League last-16 opponents in Monday's draw, with Barcelona, Juventus, Paris St-Germain, Valencia and RB Leipzig possible opponents.\nThey will then have their shot at leapfrogging current fourth-placed Chelsea on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nThe likes of Ajax, Inter Milan and Sevilla are potential opponents for Wolves in the Europa League last-32 draw, with a trip to Norwich to come on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 0-3 Manchester City: Kevin de Bruyne scores twice as City outclass Arsenal\nManchester City pushed Arsenal deeper into crisis as they won with embarrassing ease at Emirates Stadium.\nKevin de Bruyne produced a first-half masterclass as Pep Guardiola's side cruised into a three-goal lead by the interval with two superb strikes, either side of a perfect pass that laid on City's second for Raheem Sterling's simple finish.\nIt was a harrowing experience for Arsenal caretaker manager Freddie Ljungberg, who was a powerless low-key presence, his minimal impact since succeeding the sacked Unai Emery reflected in a record of one win from his five matches in interim charge.\nArsenal's lack of inspiration in an Emirates Stadium devoid of life and atmosphere will surely only increase the urgent need to appoint a full-time manager - although at this stage it is still unclear which direction the Gunners hierarchy intends to go.\nCity, meanwhile, remain 14 points behind leaders Liverpool after this win, which was a classic reminder of the quality the reigning Premier League champions possess.\nDe Bruyne tops player ratings\nLjungberg will 'deal with Ozil'\nArsenal in serious decline\nThis was as grim as it gets for Arsenal and Ljungberg, a caretaker manager who has not been able to coax an ounce extra out of the squad he inherited after Emery was shown the door.\nFirst things first - this is not all the Swede's fault, as this was a rot that set in long before Emery's dismissal, although Ljungberg had a close-up view as a member of his backroom staff.\nWhat has been disturbing, however, is Ljungberg's lack of impact on Arsenal, exemplified by the manner in which they were treated almost with contempt by Manchester City.\nThis result leaves the Gunners stuck between the top four and the relegation zone, seven points away from both, and the thousands of empty seats and a game concluded in resigned silence from the home support spoke volumes.\nArsenal had no spark, no creation and no fight - City actually went easy on them in the second half.\nAnd while relegation talk is a stretch, that spark is something they must find soon, whether it is under Ljungberg or a new full-time manager.\nCity still possess such class\nManchester City's quest to claim a third successive Premier League title is surely beyond them as they languish so far behind Liverpool - but this team is still a superb sight in full cry.\nAnd at the hub of it all was the brilliant Belgian De Bruyne, who ripped through Arsenal at will in that first half, scoring twice and making another.\nDe Bruyne's first goal was a masterpiece of technique, a flashing side-footed finish into the top corner, while his third was precisely placed into the bottom corner.\nHe created Sterling's goal with a left-flank run that left the England attacker with the simplest of finishes, and would have scored a supreme hat-trick had Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno not shown great athleticism to fingertip his rising shot onto the woodwork.\nThis was a very easy day at the office for City as they overran timid opponents. The title may be gone, but they still have the class and firepower to beat any team when they get it right.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City)\nCity's hold over Arsenal rolls on - the stats\nArsenal have lost their last five Premier League meetings with Manchester City - their longest losing streak against a top-flight opponent since losing five times to Manchester United between September 1983 and August 1985.\nThis was the sixth time Manchester City have beaten Arsenal in the Premier League under Pep Guardiola (P7 W6 D1 L0), as many wins as City managed against them in the competition before Guardiola's arrival (P38 W6 D9 L23).\nArsenal have gone six games without a win at Emirates Stadium across all competitions (D3 L3); their longest run without a home win since between December 1994 and February 1995 under George Graham at Highbury (eight games).\nManchester City have scored 25 away Premier League goals this season; the joint most by a team in their first nine away games of a single campaign, matching City's 25 goals in 2011-12).\nArsenal conceded three first-half goals in a home Premier League game for only the second time, with the other also coming against City in March 2018.\nArsenal managed only one shot on target - their joint fewest in a Premier League game at Emirates Stadium (also one v Everton in 2010, Chelsea in 2015 and 2016).\nManchester City's Kevin de Bruyne has been directly involved in 19 Premier League goals in 2019 (seven goals, 12 assists); the most of any midfielder in this period.\nCity's Raheem Sterling netted his seventh away league goal this season; already his joint-highest return away from home in a single campaign (also seven in 2017-18).\nDe Bruyne's opening goal (one minute 29 seconds) was the second quickest that Arsenal have conceded at Emirates Stadium in the Premier League, after David Healy for Fulham in August 2007 (51 seconds).\n'We were better in loss to United' - manager reaction\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"We made an incredible result but the way we played against Manchester United [a 2-1 defeat last weekend] was better in many, many things.\n\"I know we are judged on the result but I have a duty to judge the performance, not just the result.\"\nArsenal interim manager Freddie Ljungberg: \"We tried to keep the ball and be the Arsenal we want to be.\n\"The problem was the transitions, they scored on the counter. De Bruyne is a fantastic player but when they start like that it's very difficult to get going again and I felt we got low and they got confident.\n\"I said to the players at half-time it was about pride, you need to show some heart out there and show that you're proud.\"\nWhat's next?\nThe Gunners face Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday, 21 December (12:30 GMT). Before that, City play Oxford United on Wednesday, 18 December (19:45) in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup, but return to league action when they host second-placed Leicester City on Saturday (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-1 Brighton & Hove Albion: Wilfried Zaha rescues Palace point\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson said Wilfried Zaha has improved the mental side of his game after the forward rescued a point against rivals Brighton & Hove Albion.\nZaha smashed in an equaliser from the edge of the box for injury-hit Palace, who toiled for 70 minutes and trailed to Neal Maupay's fine finish into the top corner shortly after half time.\nIvory Coast winger Zaha - the second-most fouled player in the Premier League this season, behind Aston Villa's Jack Grealish - was impeded five times at Selhurst Park.\nBut he kept his composure to score his sixth goal against the Seagulls, who paid for failing to take their chances when on top.\n\"Wilf is doing extremely well mentally because things happen in the game - taunts from the crowd and little fouls off the ball - which he isn't allowing to upset him as he might have done before,\" said Hodgson, who was marking his 100th match as Palace manager.\nPalace's recovery extended their unbeaten run to four games, as the point moved them above Arsenal into ninth place; Brighton are 13th.\n\"It was an incredibly gusty performance, full of character and determination because when they took the lead you could not say it was unjust,\" said Hodgson.\n\"But for us to stay in it with all the problems and ending up playing with a central midfielder [James McArthur] at left-back against a very good team like Brighton [was impressive]. Brighton's performance was as good as any team we've seen here at Selhurst Park this season.\"\nBrighton manager Graham Potter told BBC Sport: \"Apart from a five-minute spell, we were really good and controlled the game. Of course, we didn't get the second goal. We played really well but one action from a top player does you.\"\nBrighton pay the price again\nIt was a familiar tale for Brighton - dominating possession, creating chances and failing to win.\nThey played like the home team in one of the Premier League's more unusual derbies, which developed in the 1970s because of a rivalry between the two clubs' managers at the time - Terry Venables at Palace and Alan Mullery at Brighton.\nMost of Brighton's efforts in the first half were from long range, as Palace held them at arm's length.\nAaron Mooy curled wide from outside the box, while Yves Bissouma and Pascal Gross had efforts from distance saved.\nThey had a strong penalty appeal when Jairo Riedewald clipped Martin Montoya as the full-back was shooting - but after a long delay for a video assistant referee review, nothing was given.\nIt was more of the same after the break and Albion's goal involved some fine football. Bissouma sprayed a ball out right for Leandro Trossard, who volleyed a cross - which Gross diverted into the path of Maupay, with the forward scoring for a third consecutive game.\nDavy Propper, Maupay, Bissouma, Trossard and Montoya all had shots saved as Brighton looked to end the game.\n\"In the Premier League you know if you don't get a second goal - and the home crowd get behind the team - the environment changes,\" said Potter.\nThey were made to pay when Zaha crashed in the equaliser. With Palace then looking the more likely winners, Potter brought on defenders Shane Duffy and Bernardo for midfielders in the closing stages to see the game out.\n\"We could always look to improve and do something better but you have to hold your hands up to the quality of the strike,\" said Potter.\n\"They were putting balls into the box and we could have dealt with that better. But we created a lot of opportunities. There is lots to take forwards in a positive way.\n\"We dealt with it [Palace's play] OK but not well enough because they scored. We kept them as quiet as we could but not enough.\"\nPalace snatch a result again\nIf Brighton seemed to be following a familiar story, so too did Palace.\nOnly Watford, who are bottom of the table, have scored fewer than Palace's 15 Premier League goals. The Eagles' total number of shots this season - 161 - is lower than anybody else in the top flight, and yet they are in the top half.\nHodgson said before kick-off that he was experiencing the worst injury crisis he has had at the club, with six first-team players out. \"The team you see tonight is the team we can field,\" he said - and added that he hopes to sign players in January.\nAfter a first half in which his side failed to create a single chance, Hodgson brought on James McCarthy at half-time for Riedewald, who had been making his first Premier League start since February 2018.\nTheir first shot - excluding a Christian Benteke cross which hit the crossbar - did not come until the 68th minute, with Max Meyer missing the target. Yet in the final 22 minutes, they had 11 shots.\nZaha was Brighton's nemesis again. Luka Milivojevic crossed from the right and James Tomkins headed the ball down to the Ivory Coast international, who controlled the ball and cut on to his left foot before smashing a shot into the near top corner of the net.\nFrom that stage on, Palace were the more likely winners. Benteke - who has scored one goal for Palace since April 2018 - forced three saves from Mat Ryan, while Jordan Ayew shot over from outside the box.\n\"We got the tactics wrong. We were determined to take the game to them and play on the front foot but it didn't work because they played around us and we didn't win the ball back as we thought we might,\" said Hodgson.\n\"We shored things up in the second half by bringing Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew into a deeper position. We gave Brighton the wing space more than the central space and we restricted them largely to shots from distance.\"\nMan of the match - Davy Propper (Brighton)\n'Palace will need to change' - analysis\nFormer Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I like what Brighton are doing. A new manager has come in and they're playing exciting football - but I don't think that is [ever going to be] Crystal Palace.\n\"Under Roy Hodgson, they are never going to change. Hodgson is really good at what he does; he sets them up to be hard to beat and they play a lot on the counter-attack.\n\"But when they lose Wilfried Zaha - and it's going to happen either in January or the summer - they are going to have to change their style of football because they aren't going to have Zaha there who can win a game individually.\"\nMatch stats - Hodgson joins Dowie and Warnock club\nCrystal Palace are unbeaten in four Premier League games (W2 D2), after losing four out of five before that.\nBrighton are unbeaten in three Premier League games for the first time since January (W1 D2).\nRoy Hodgson oversaw his 100th game as Crystal Palace manager in all competitions (W37 D24 L39), becoming the third manager to reach the milestone for the club in the 21st century, after Iain Dowie (123 games) and Neil Warnock (146 games).\nNeal Maupay's opener for Brighton was the first goal Crystal Palace conceded in 329 minutes of Premier League action.\nMaupay has scored in each of his past three Premier League appearances, as many as his previous 13 in the division.\nHe is only the second player to score for the Seagulls in three consecutive Premier League games, after Glenn Murray in November 2017.\nPascal Gross has provided 14 assists in the Premier League for Brighton, twice as many as any other player for the club.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are in Premier League action on Saturday at 15:00 GMT. Crystal Palace are away to Newcastle, with Brighton hosting Sheffield United."

The Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat by Leicester City only came on penalties after a stirring comeback from 2-0 down.\nEverton were in a deep hole when Ferguson stepped in after Silva's sacking, and the pure theatre of the Scot on the touchline and the manner in which he has reignited the crowd means 60-year-old Ancelotti can start work on the back of an unbeaten league run.\nFerguson will now remain a key part of Ancelotti's backroom staff with his reputation enhanced; his short spell has proved to be a memorable one.\nThe decision to replace substitute Tosun raised eyebrows and the player himself was clearly furious, but this was very different to the substitution of Kean at Old Trafford.\nTosun had been given plenty of time to make an impact. He did not and, on reflection, he can have no complaints.\nFerguson will now step back - but he will be an important figure in the new Ancelotti era.\nArteta's huge task\nAs with Ancelotti, new Arsenal boss Arteta faces a massive job to revive a giant club, and nothing he saw here will have come as a surprise.\nIndeed, he may be happy that the Gunners came away with a point having had a ringside seat to witness just how average this side are when his former club Manchester City romped to a 3-0 win at Emirates Stadium on 15 December.\nArsenal actually had the better opportunities but there was a lack of cohesion and confidence about this performance, and their fragile defence escaped without being seriously tested by a tired-looking Everton.\nDefender David Luiz was too impetuous and dangerman Aubameyang was a relatively subdued presence before being substituted late on.\nArteta watched impassively and the serious work begins on Sunday when he gets his new charges on the training ground.\nArteta to Arsenal is a move 20 years in the making - Guillem Balague column\n'This is a good decision' - Emery backs Arteta as Gunners successor\nMan of the match - Yerry Mina (Everton)\nRare goalless draw for youthful Gunners - the stats\nEverton have kept consecutive league clean sheets against Arsenal for the first time since August 1978.\nThis was Arsenal's first 0-0 in 77 Premier League games, since an away match at West Ham in December 2017.\nArsenal's first shot came in the 44th minute - the latest in one of their league games since May 2015 against Manchester United (51 minutes).\nAt an average age of 24 years 50 days, this was the Gunners' youngest Premier League starting XI since May 2011 (24 years 24 days against Fulham).\nIt was the also the first time Arsenal have started with three teenagers - Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe - in a league game since March 2007 against Reading.\n'I feel like I've steadied the ship' - what the managers said\nEverton caretaker manager Duncan Ferguson: \"I think a point was fair. We struggled with energy levels and they probably had the better chances, but we're happy with a point. The players dug deep today.\n\"I've enjoyed it but I knew it was going to be tough today. The boys were on their last legs to be honest, after working so hard in the past three games.\n\"We still covered every blade of grass - we just lacked a bit of quality in the final third.\"\nOn Carlo Ancelotti: \"What he's done in the game is incredible so I can't wait to get started working with him. I'll be here as long as the club want me here - so I'll be back on Monday.\"\nArsenal interim boss Freddie Ljungberg: \"We dominated possession but we would have liked to get more out of it. We put a lot of young players out because I wanted to reward players who had trained well.\n\"I've learned a lot and it's been a proud time for me to lead this amazing club. I knew I was interim manager to steady the ship and I feel like I've done that. It's great the club has taken the decision and now we move forward.\"\nOn Mikel Arteta: \"Mikel knows the club very well - he's been here a long time. The club has told me they want me to stay, so I will speak to Mikel tomorrow and go from there.\"\nWhat's next?\nAncelotti takes charge of Everton for the first time at home to Burnley on 26 December (15:00 GMT kick-off), while Arteta's Arsenal face Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium at the same time."

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 1-0 Crystal Palace: Miguel Almiron ends drought with winner\nManager Steve Bruce said he \"hadn't heard a roar like it\" as Newcastle fans celebrated Miguel Almiron's first goal for the club.\nThe Paraguayan midfielder scored a late winner in a drab contest against Crystal Palace to send the Magpies above the Eagles to ninth in the Premier League.\nIt also saw the 25-year-old break his Newcastle goal drought on his 27th Premier League appearance since joining from Atlanta United for a then-club record \u00a320m in January.\n\"I think the crowd showed their appreciation for him,\" said Bruce. \"I think relief is the wrong word - we're all just delighted for him.\n\"Since he came to the club in January he lit the place up with his pace, trickery and skills. Day in, day out, he works and works, but unfortunately he's not been able to manage a goal. Today he's got the winner and we're all delighted for him.\n\"It took a long time, he's been unfortunate on so many occasions. Today when it fell to him, it was a difficult chance, coming from behind him, and he's managed to smash it in.\n\"He's a great pro, a great lad, and he works really hard. When you've got a gem like that they deserve all the success I'm sure will find him.\"\nThe game looked set to end in a stalemate before Andy Carroll headed a cross down for an unmarked Almiron to volley home, and Newcastle comfortably held on for their third victory in four games.\nPalace had most of the possession and it seemed their injury-hit defence had dealt with the aerial threat of former England striker Carroll before he played a crucial role in the winner.\nThe Eagles also had the better chances, with Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke denied by home goalkeeper Martin Dubravka in each half, but the visitors slipped one place to 12th after their four-match unbeaten run came to an end.\nNewcastle 1-0 Crystal Palace - as it happened\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nReturn of midfield pair boosts Magpies\nNewcastle welcomed back Almiron and Jonjo Shelvey after they missed last Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Burnley with minor injuries and they provided a welcome boost as the Magpies remained unbeaten at home since the opening day of the season.\nThe midfield pair had been instrumental to their team's run of seven points from nine before the Turf Moor setback and added some guile to go with Newcastle's grit.\nBoth showed some neat touches in midfield while Almiron curled a tame effort straight at Palace goalkeeper early on while Shelvey sent a speculative effort just over from near the halfway line.\nThen with time running out, Almiron found himself in space in the box to pounce on Carroll's knock-down and his relief was clear, the 25-year-old peeling off his shirt in celebration, which saw him receive a booking.\nBruce sprang a selection surprise by asking Joelinton to play up front with Carroll, not out on the left, but for the most part the strike pair struggled to connect and the Magpies did not give him enough service.\nBut, just as Palace were beginning to pile on the pressure, all that changed as Fabian Schar's right-wing cross found Carroll at the far post to lay on Almiron's match-winner.\nPalace stand firm till late lapse\nScott Dann and Jairo Riedewald both dropped out of Palace's starting line-up after Monday's 1-1 draw with Brighton, with left-back Patrick van Aanholt returning from the hamstring injury that forced him off early in the win over Bournemouth.\nMidfielder James McCarthy also came in for just his second league start since his summer move from Everton.\nBut with Jeffrey Schlupp, Gary Cahill and Joel Ward injured and Mamadou Sakho still serving the suspension for his red card against Bournemouth, midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate had to fill in as a makeshift centre-half.\nYet despite being up against a two-man attack, the Senegal international and the rest of the Palace defence dealt comfortably with most of what Newcastle could throw at them.\nThe Eagles even ventured forward, with Zaha testing Dubravka from a wide angle in the first half. James McArthur then twice went close after the break, while Benteke's low strike was saved by Dubravka on 74 minutes.\nBut Almiron's late volley denied Palace the point their manager Hodgson felt they deserved, inflicting their first defeat since losing to leaders Liverpool on 23 November.\n'You can't get carried away'\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce: \"I always thought maybe one goal would decide it because Palace don't give much away. We try to prime ourselves the same way. My goalkeeper made a few good saves but I don't think anybody would deny that Almiron deserved the winner.\"\nOn being in the top half of the table: \"I'd have taken it because it was difficult at the start [of the season] but in the Premier League you can't get carried away.\n\"I look at our fixture list coming up and think 'wow' - we've got some tough games in a close period of time. We'll accept where we are because the lads and the staff have worked so hard. There's a good spirit amongst them, that can go a long way, and they showed that again today.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"We had a lot of chances and were in pole position to win the game. We had done very well to stop the crosses but didn't do well with that one at the end.\n\"We had chances but didn't take them and you now that at the end, if one team scores it's going to be very difficult to come back into it.\n\"Andy Carroll beat Martin Kelly in the air, that's what he does, and maybe we could have done better with the knock-down. But the back four was good today.\n\"I'm sad we couldn't get more from the game, a point was the minimum we deserved. I'm not disappointed with the performance, I'm just sad they didn't get the result their performance deserved.\"\nMan of the Match - Paul Dummett (Newcastle)\nBruce's first win against Hodgson - the stats\nMiguel Almiron is the sixth different Paraguayan goalscorer in the Premier League after Diego Gavilan, Roque Santa Cruz, Antolin Alcaraz, Cristian Riveros, and Fabian Balbuena.\nNewcastle United are unbeaten in their last eight home Premier League matches (W4 D4), their longest run at St James' Park since in April 2012 (nine unbeaten).\nCrystal Palace have failed to score in eight of their 18 Premier League games this season; only bottom side Watford have failed in more (10).\nAfter seven games unbeaten against Steve Bruce (W3 D4), Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson has tasted his first Premier League defeat against the Newcastle manager.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace have a London derby at home to West Ham on Thursday, 26 December (15:00 GMT), before Newcastle play Manchester United at Old Trafford (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 0-1 Burnley: Jay Rodriguez scores last-minute winner for Clarets\nBurnley's Jay Rodriguez scored an 89th-minute winner to beat Bournemouth in a dire match at Vitality Stadium.\nThere had not been a single shot on target from either side until substitute Rodriguez headed in from close range following Ashley Westwood's cross.\nJefferson Lerma's 30-yard effort for the hosts went well over the top and Chris Mepham's second-half header went wide.\nA physical Burnley side had offered little as an attacking threat in a disrupted match littered with fouls and strong challenges before Rodriguez's winner.\nSix players were booked - two from Bournemouth and four from the Clarets.\nBournemouth v Burnley as it happened\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's full predictions v Serge from Kasabian\nDefenders impress as Burnley gain rare away win\nThe three points for Burnley takes them up to 10th in the Premier League table and comes after Sean Dyche's side frustrated the hosts, who failed to register a single shot on target.\nFor a second successive game, goalkeeper Nick Pope did not have a save to make, after Burnley shut out Newcastle in a 1-0 victory a week ago.\nBut, in a match played in filthy wet and windy conditions on the south coast, the Clarets' central defensive partnership of Ben Mee and James Tarkowski were excellent - both making seven clearances.\nBurnley won 3-1 at the Vitality Stadium last season on 6 April but had only gained one away Premier League victory since then before this latest success.\nIt was not pretty, but no-one from Burnley will care about that as they picked up another three valuable points, their second win in a row having lost the previous three games.\nBournemouth injury problems provide test for Howe\nThis match featured the two longest-serving Premier League managers. When Eddie Howe left Burnley to return to Bournemouth for a second spell as manager in October 2012, it created the vacancy for Sean Dyche, who has been Clarets boss ever since.\nBut while Dyche will see his side in the top half at Christmas, these are worrying times for Howe, whose team are 14th but only four points above the relegation zone.\nBournemouth have not been helped by a lengthy injury list that includes Nathan Ake, Adam Smith, Steve Cook, top scorer Harry Wilson, Charlie Daniels and David Brooks, although England striker Callum Wilson, who missed the 1-0 win over Chelsea with a hamstring injury, returned to action when he came on as a half-time substitute.\nThe hosts' injury problems looked to have continued early on when captain Simon Francis was caught by a boot to the head by Burnley's Ashley Barnes.\nHowever, after a lengthy stoppage, Francis was able to carry on and saw out the rest of the match sporting a large bandage on his head.\nRyan Fraser was also on the receiving end of a number of strong challenges, including a header from Tarkowski that left Fraser with a bloodied nose after he landed heavily on the turf.\nThis loss means Bournemouth have now only won twice in 13 matches in all competitions, although those wins came against Manchester United and Chelsea.\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski (Burnley)\n'Hugely disappointed' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe said: \"It was not a great game, the conditions played a part in that.\n\"Burnley did what they do, we expected the game that it was but we need to do better. It was a much better second half and we were the better team but could not break down a physical defence.\n\"It is how they play, it is up to the referee to control the game. We paid the price for not marking from a ball into the box.\n\"We feel hugely disappointed to lose the game. The first half was very scrappy, to lose the game is a devastating blow. It was not one for the purists, a lot of free-kicks given away and you know every free-kick will come into your box.\n\"There were a lot of challenges in the game that need reviewing.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said: \"It was super poor conditions, a poor game but we stuck to the task. It is hard to find ways of winning and we managed to do that.\n\"The pleasing thing is, in the second half they were better than us, but we stayed resolute to the task.\n\"[Nick] Pope has had minimal to do regarding saves and we found a moment. There was not a lot of goalmouth action, not a great game but we get three points. We hope and want to play better but we get the three points.\n\"What a header from J-Rod. We know we have to play better away. At this stage of last season we were on 12 points, it was really ugly, but we managed to find a way.\"\nLongest wait for a shot on target in more than 10 years - the stats\nBurnley have registered two wins in their last three away Premier League games, as many as they managed in their 14 before that (drew six, lost six).\nBournemouth have lost three consecutive home league games for the first time since April 2016.\nBurnley have won five of their seven Premier League meetings with Bournemouth (lost two), including each of the last three fixtures.\nThe total of five shots produced in the game is the lowest tally of attempts in a Premier League game since 2003-04 (when this data was first recorded).\nThe first and only shot on target of the game came in the 89th minutes, the longest wait for a shot on target in a Premier League game since May 2009 (90 minutes, Bolton v Sunderland).\nBurnley's Jay Rodriguez has scored four goals against Bournemouth in the Premier League, more than he has managed against any other side in the competition.\nBurnley's Ashley Westwood has registered two assists in his last two Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 18.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are next in action on 26 December in the first of three Premier League games each inside a week. Bournemouth entertain Arsenal in Mikel Arteta's first match in charge of the Gunners before the Cherries are away at Brighton two days later and travel to West Ham on New Year's Day.\nOn Thursday, Burnley are away at Everton, who will be managed by Carlo Ancelotti for the first time. The Clarets then have two home fixtures - against Manchester United on 28 December and Aston Villa on 1 January."

It was a great goal in a tight game.\"\nMcBurnie's effort earned the Blades a third successive top-flight win for the first time since 1993.\nUnited could have been out of sight, twice having goals ruled out by the Video Assistant Referee and watching David McGoldrick hit the side-netting after rounding Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan.\nBrighton's best move of the match resulted in Neal Maupay tapping in from close range, but Martin Montoya was offside earlier in the move.\nThe Blades go fifth for now, with Tottenham and Manchester United both still to play.\nBrighton v Sheffield United as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nWorld Cup winner Peters dies aged 76\nMcBurnie rewards Wilder switch\nMcBurnie netted 24 times in the Championship last season but has found goals and starts hard to come by so far in the top flight.\nLys Mousset has been the man leading the line for Wilder's side but the boss trusted McBurnie on Saturday and was repaid inside 23 minutes.\nMcBurnie did superbly to outmuscle Brighton centre backs Adam Webster and Lewis Dunk to go through on goal and fire in off the post.\n\"He's been knocking on the door during the week which is something that we always look at - away from the light Monday to Friday,\" added Wilder.\nThe striker praised Wilder's gameplan afterwards while insisting he had to \"put myself in the gaffer's thoughts\".\nHe certainly did that with a hard-working performance before being replaced by Mousset just after the hour-mark.\n\"I know Oli's quality and I know he's capable of scoring. It was nice for him but not nice for us,\" said Brighton boss Potter.\n\"I wish him well in the rest of his career because he's a good lad and was great for a year at Swansea.\"\nWilder wins battle of homegrown bosses\nIn a battle of two emerging English managers at the Amex, it was Sheffield United's Wilder who came out on top.\nThe Blades have been superb since returning to the Premier League but few would have banked on them occupying such a lofty position at Christmas.\nPotter and Wilder have met before, in the Championship last season when on both occasions the former Swansea manager was victorious.\nBut Wilder's outfit headed into this one unbeaten away from home this term and took the game to the hosts early on when John Egan bundled in from a corner.\nThat was ruled out by VAR for handball, as was Jack O'Connell's effort in the second half for offside, as Wilder, who BBC Sport columnist Charlie Webster wrote this week is \"making having an English manager look sexy and attractive\", got the better of the tactical battle with his opposite number.\nWilder is pragmatic in his approach and his side were happy to sit in and soak up a spell of Brighton pressure late on, while looking dangerous on the break.\nForward McGoldrick dribbled round the goalkeeper only to miss an open goal as the visitors failed to give themselves a more comfortable finish.\nMeanwhile, Seagulls chiefs have been so impressed with Potter's start to life at the club they have already offered him a two-year extension on the four-year deal he signed when taking the job in May - seeing the 44-year-old through to 2025.\nBut after climbing into the top half of the table at the beginning of November, Brighton have won just once in seven games since in the Premier League.\nThat leaves them on 20 points after 18 games, one fewer than under Chris Hughton at this stage last term.\nMan of the match - Oliver McBurnie (Sheffield United)\n'We have structure, organisation and desire'\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder speaking to Match of the Day: \"We weren't at our best with the ball but we have a structure, organisation and a desire to keep the ball out of the net. We had to show all those qualities this afternoon.\n\"We did a job on them, should have had more possession, but we had the better chances on the counter attack and we're delighted to keep the away run going. The next two are Manchester City and Liverpool!\n\"We kept our shape well and were really disciplined. It's a big three points for us. You always want to get off to a good start.\n\"It's the Premier League, every team you come across are good and have qualities but we have some qualities as well and we've worked very hard.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter speaking to Match of the Day: \"We weren't good, Sheffield United did what they did well. First half they were better than us and deservedly it was 1-0.\n\"It wasn't a game of many chances and we put a lot into it, but not enough. It was a disappointing day for us.\n\"We didn't play well today. They made it difficult for us and we weren't as good as we like to be. We can look at ourselves and learn from the game, we can do better.\n\"We had the change the dynamic of the game at 1-0 down. Second half it was better in terms of pressure but not enough in terms of chances.\n\"You get set-backs in this competition, but we have to get ourselves ready for another tough match.\"\nThe stats - Blades continue away run\nSheffield United have become only the second newly-promoted side in English top-flight history to go unbeaten in their opening nine away league games of a season, after Burnley in 1947-48 (10).\nBrighton have never won a Premier League home game in which they have conceded the first goal. This is the most a team has conceded first at home in the competition without ever coming from behind to win.\nSince the start of last season, no side in the top four tiers of English football have kept more league clean sheets (excluding play-offs) than Sheffield United (28 - level with Leeds United).\nSheffield United have won three consecutive top-flight matches for the first time since they won four in succession under Dave Bassett between May and August 1993.\nSheffield United have won each of their last three league meetings with Brighton, their best such run against them since October 1960 (four in a row).\nSheffield United striker Oliver McBurnie scored his first away goal in the Premier League in what was his 16th appearance on the road in the competition.\nWhat next?\nBoth are back at it on Boxing Day, with Brighton travelling to Tottenham in the 12:30 GMT kick-off and Sheffield United welcoming Watford at 15:00."

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 1-3 Southampton: Ings double helps Saints out of the bottom three\nRalph Hasenhuttl says his Southampton side will get a \"lift mentally\" after climbing out of the Premier League's bottom three with a convincing win at Aston Villa.\nThe result sees the Saints move up a place to 17th, leapfrogging Villa who drop to 18th after a fourth consecutive defeat.\n\"It's not June, it's December but it gives us a lift mentally to see we can win,\" Hasenhuttl said.\n\"We know it's a tough race. This win gives us a lift not only out of the relegation zone but also mentally and is exactly what we need.\"\nSouthampton arrived at Villa Park having been in the bottom three in seven of the last eight weeks but deserved their victory after controlling the game from start to finish.\nHasenhuttl's team were assisted by some shambolic defending from Villa and Danny Ings' two-goal contribution, as they registered their biggest win since their 3-1 victory over Wolves in April.\nIngs opened the scoring, tapping in from close range after Shane Long's initial effort was saved by Villa keeper Tom Heaton.\nAnd Long could have added a second before Jack Stephens met James Ward-Prowse's corner to double Saints' lead with a towering header into the bottom right corner.\nIngs punished Marvelous Nakamba's loose control to add Southampton's third after the break.\nAnd while Jack Grealish's superb effort flew into the top right corner for the hosts to reduce the arrears it was not enough to prevent Saints from claiming only their fifth win of the season.\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nLawro's full predictions v Serge from Kasabian\nVilla plot their own downfall\nIf Villa manager Dean Smith had hoped that their Carabao Cup win over Liverpool's youthful side on Tuesday would raise morale, there was little in this performance which will have encouraged him.\nVilla's struggles this term have been underpinned by two main problems, failing to capitalise on winning positions and on occasions delivering abject displays where they have been well beaten.\nThis was the latter.\nWhile they conceded late goals in narrow defeats by Liverpool and Chelsea and possibly merited more than the point they collected at Manchester United, from the moment Ings put Southampton ahead, Villa - who had already lost John McGinn to an injury - looked shorn of confidence.\nAnd all three goals were easily avoidable.\nBjorn Engels was caught out for the first with Nathan Redmond's clipped ball over the top allowing Long to outstrip him for pace.\nStephens was allowed to run towards the near post unchecked for the second and Nakamba's poor control compounded a defensive horror show for the hosts.\n\"Whenever we concede a goal it feels like the end of the world at the moment,\" Smith said.\n\"The manner we conceded the goals is very poor. We weren't good enough today to win the game.\"\nWorryingly for Villa supporters, Villa were equally inept as an attacking force with three of their five shots on target coming from the 74th minute onwards, when they were already 3-0 down.\nHaving identified the importance of this fixture prior to kick-off, Smith and his team must now regroup with games against Norwich and Watford who sit below them in the table.\nSuper Ings steals the show\nVilla's lack of potency was in sharp contrast to Southampton, who with Ings and Long, punctured the hosts' defence with regularity, particularly in a devastating first period.\nWhile Long is still searching for his first goal since April, the Republic of Ireland forward's pace caused havoc in a charitable Villa defence until he was replaced in the 82nd minute.\nBy that stage Long could have scored at least three goals, heading over Ryan Bertrand's fizzing cross early on and twice seeing Heaton deny him, albeit with Ings profiting, for Saints' first goal.\nIngs' performance was one of a man re-establishing his credentials as an effective Premier League forward after seeing his mid-20s disrupted by injuries.\nNow 27, Ings registered his seventh goal in seven games, with his first down to having the pace to position himself in the correct place, and his second, showing his alertness and ability to finish from an acute angle.\n\"Danny is fantastic at the moment, he's absolutely outrageous at the moment and I'm very happy for him,\" said Hassenhuttl.\nThose goals also brought up a notable landmark, as he became the first Saints player to score 10 goals or more in a Premier League season before Christmas, emulating Matt Le Tissier in 1994-95 and James Beattie in 2002-03.\nMan of the match - Danny Ings (Southampton)\nVilla's aerial weakness - the stats\nSouthampton scored three goals in a Premier League away game for the first time in 364 days, since winning 3-1 at Huddersfield on 22 December 2018.\nAston Villa have conceded as many goals in their last two home Premier League games as they had in their first seven at Villa Park this season (7).\nEach of Southampton's last 16 Premier League goals have been scored by English players - excluding own goals, it's the longest such run in the competition since Queens Park Rangers between March 1996-September 2011 (17 goals).\nAston Villa have conceded more headed goals (9) and more goals from corners (8) than any other side in the Premier League this season, with Jack Stephens' goal for Southampton today being a header from a corner.\nSouthampton's Danny Ings has scored 11 Premier League goals this season, his joint-most in a single campaign in the competition (level with 2014-15).\nNo Southampton player has scored more Premier League goals before Christmas in a season than the 11 Ings has netted this term (level with James Beattie in 2002-03).\nJames Ward-Prowse has been involved in 42 Premier League goals for Southampton (21 goals, 21 assists) - more than any other current player at the club.\nAston Villa's Jack Grealish has scored three goals in his last five Premier League games - as many as he had in his previous 45 in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa are back in action in the Premier League when they host Norwich on Boxing Day (15:00 GMT), while Southampton travel to Chelsea on the same day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Norwich 1-2 Wolves: Raul Jimenez scores late winner at Carrow Road\nRaul Jimenez scored his 16th goal of the season as Wolves came from behind to win 2-1 at Norwich, who are now six points from safety in the Premier League.\nThe Canaries dominated the first half and deservedly took the lead when Todd Cantwell fired home from the middle of the box after pouncing on a loose ball.\nBut Wolves hit back after the break when Romain Saiss headed powerfully home.\nJimenez then snatched victory for the visitors when he fired in after Tim Krul had denied Matt Doherty.\nIt was a disappointing result for Norwich, who could have been out of sight in the first half after Teemu Pukki was twice denied when one on one with keeper Rui Patricio, while Alex Tettey hit the post.\nThe Canaries remain in 19th place but Southampton's win against Aston Villa means the Saints move up to 17th, six points clear of Norwich.\nMeanwhile, victory for Wolves moves them up to sixth and gets them back to winning ways after their 11-match unbeaten run was ended by Tottenham last week.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nWorld Cup winner Peters dies aged 76\nFirst-half fight not enough for struggling Canaries\nHome form is likely to be key to Norwich's hopes of staying in the Premier League and it is something that needs to drastically improve if they are to survive for a second season in the top flight.\nThis defeat means they are now without a win in front of their own fans since their impressive 3-2 victory against champions Manchester City on 14 September.\nDespite that worrying run, there were positives to take from this performance as they dominated a surprisingly subdued Wolves side for well over an hour.\nThis display, coupled with the one in their 1-1 draw with second-placed Leicester last weekend, should give concerned home fans some comfort, but having let slip a lead for a second game in a row, Daniel Farke's side need to start improving their ability to close out matches.\nWolves leave it late again\nWolves are once again on course for a season in which they surpass expectations and are looking capable of bettering their seventh-place finish last term.\nHowever, while they did not get the result their performance warranted against Tottenham last time out, this was a game they were fortunate to win, with Patricio called upon to make several excellent saves in the first half to restrict Norwich to a one-goal lead at the break.\nBut under Nuno Espirito Santo, Wolves are team that fight until the very end of games, and they made the most of their limited chances to turn another potential defeat into victory.\nThis is the 11th time in the Premier League this season they have conceded the first goal - the joint-most alongside Arsenal - but on eight of those occasions they have fought back to get a result and that was the case once again.\nMan of the match - Rui Patricio (Wolves)\n'Small details the difference' - what they said\nNorwich boss Daniel Farke, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were 1-0 up, played fantastic, we had two or three one on ones and hit the inside of the post. No-one could complain if we were 4-0 up at half-time. It feels like the most unfair sport in the world but you have to accept it.\n\"The small details were the difference today. I can't accuse my players too much. They played fantastic today. They were able to use two of their few chances - but we could not use our 10 or 12 chances.\n\"They are not machines. Even your best striker who is in red hot form missing chances. It is not a day to punish players.\n\"It is a tough setback and we will be disappointed, but we go again.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We had a very poor first half. We didn't block with the vertical balls that broke our lines, but I am happy we gave a very good second half.\n\"When you see you are making mistakes and try and learn from them, that is what the players did. The players recovered a lot of balls in Norwich's half and didn't let them play. We did that and took control of the game, we scored and managed the win very well.\n\"We had to find new solutions to block Norwich. They are a very good team but I think we were better in the second half because we learned from our mistakes. It is part of us. We are relentless and go to the end. Every game is very important. Every game is a cup final, a final you have to compete in.\"\nClean sheet eludes Norwich again - the stats\nWolves have beaten Norwich away from home in the top flight for only the second time, and the first since February 1980.\nNorwich have failed to keep a clean sheet in 13 Premier League home games, their longest such run in the competition.\nRaul Jimenez has been directly involved in 12 goals (seven goals and five assists) for Wolves in the Premier League this season, double that of any team-mate.\nSince the beginning of last season, Wolves' Joao Moutinho has assisted eight league goals from corner situations, at least two more than any other player\nEmiliano Buendia created nine chances in this match, seven of which came in the first half. The last Norwich player to create as many in a league game was Nathan Redmond, who set up nine chances in a Championship match against Birmingham in September 2014.\nWhat next?\nNorwich travel to Aston Villa on 26 December (15:00 GMT), while Wolves host Manchester City on 27 December (19:45)."

Their hopes of defending their title are out of their hands now but, when his side play like this, few teams can live with them.\nIf the departure of Guardiola's assistant Mikel Arteta to become Arsenal's new manager disrupted Manchester City's week, then they did not show it here.\nWill Leicester lack belief against Liverpool?\nWith Liverpool heading to King Power Stadium on Thursday, this week was always going to define the direction of Leicester's season - and this was obviously not the start they would have wanted.\nRodgers' gameplan of conceding territory and possession was understandable given the weapons his side have but, with Manchester City on their game, giving them so much of the ball was asking for trouble.\nJust as they did when they went to Anfield in October, Leicester made life difficult for their hosts, but created little and ended up leaving empty-handed.\nThe scoreline would have been more damaging if not for the performance of Schmeichel, who made a series of fine stops against his former club - the pick of the bunch coming when he clawed away a fierce Mahrez strike.\nLeicester's title challenge is far from over with this defeat - a win over the leaders would quickly regain some of the momentum they lost here and in their home draw with Norwich last weekend.\nBut aside from a positive result, what they really needed going into their showdown with the only team above them in the table was a performance to give them belief they can live with the very best. Being outclassed by Manchester City is unlikely to provide them with much of that.\n\"When the season started, no-one expected us to be there,\" said Rodgers.\n\"There was a flash-up yesterday [on TV] about the title race and the top four. There were six players on the screen and not one of ours were there. Obviously we are not thought of as a team who can challenge for the top four, or the top six for that matter.\n\"We are learning. If you had asked me in August when we started 'would you take second in the league and the semi-final of the first cup competition?', we would have taken it and there is still so much for us to improve on.\"\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nMatch stats - Mahrez joins Joachim and Heskey club\nManchester City have won 250 Premier League games in the 2010s, becoming just the second side to win that many in a decade (Manchester United won 255 games in the 2000s).\nLeicester conceded three goals in a Premier League game for the first time since February (4-1 against Crystal Palace). The Foxes had not conceded more than twice in any of their last 28 Premier League games.\nKevin de Bruyne became the first player to register double figures for assists before Christmas in a single Premier League campaign since Arsenal's Mesut Ozil in 2015-16 (15).\nSince his Premier League debut in March 2012, Raheem Sterling has won more penalties than any other player in the competition (17).\nRiyad Mahrez became the fifth player to have played for Leicester in the Premier League and then score against the Foxes in the competition, after Julian Joachim, Emile Heskey, Chris Wood and N'Golo Kante.\nMahrez had 10 shots in this match, the most by a player in a single Premier League game since Andre Schurrle against Burnley in August 2018 (11).\nHis leveller for Manchester City was the 500th Premier League goal scored this season. It is the earliest date the milestone has been reached in a single campaign in the competition since 2009-10 (19 December).\nSince his maiden Premier League campaign in 2014-15, Leicester's Jamie Vardy is the competition's top or joint-top scorer against both Liverpool (7) and Manchester City (5), while he is also the second or joint-second highest scorer against Arsenal (9) and Tottenham Hotspur (5).\nGabriel Jesus netted his first goal in 12 home games for Manchester City in all competitions, since netting against Schalke in March. Each of his last 14 goals for the club before today had been scored away from the Etihad.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host Liverpool on Thursday (20:00 GMT). Manchester City travel to Wolves on Friday (19:45)."

The players committed to the game exceptionally well.\n\"I'll be very confident we can get out of this situation.\"\nWatford were helped on their way courtesy of David de Gea's error for their opening goal, with the Spanish keeper allowing Ismaila Sarr's mishit shot to bounce through his arms and strike him in the face as it entered the net.\nTroy Deeney compounded a miserable day for United as he registered his first league goal since April with a penalty after Aaron Wan-Bissaka's foul on Sarr.\nNot even the introduction of Paul Pogba - returning after a near three-month absence - as a substitute could raise United, who failed to register a shot on target until the hosts were already two goals ahead.\nAnd while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side did attempt to chase the game, Watford also had chances to add to their tally and deserved only their third league victory ever over United.\n'Why Man Utd should build their team around Pogba' - Peter Crouch analysis\nReaction to Watford v Man Utd, plus Tottenham v Chelsea\nLawro's full predictions v Serge from Kasabian\nPonderous United punished again\nSolskjaer celebrated his first anniversary in charge of Manchester United on Thursday but while his first game in charge resulted in a thumping 5-1 victory at Cardiff, this performance was the polar opposite.\nA recurring complaint throughout the season has been United's lack of midfield creativity and the ability play through teams in the bottom half of the table.\nAnd this was another unimaginative and ponderous display, which was eventually punished by their resolute opponents.\nFred and Scott McTominay both struggled to impose any rhythm from midfield while Daniel James, Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial failed to provide any spark in the final third.\nLingard has now gone over 25 hours since his last goal or assist in the Premier League, and notably missed United's best opportunity of the afternoon, chipping over when one-versus-one with Ben Foster with the game goalless.\nAnd that made it easy for Watford to follow the same template used by Crystal Palace, West Ham, Newcastle and Bournemouth in their victories over United while struggling towards the bottom of the table.\nUnited's best performances have tended to arrive against teams where they have been able to launch quick counter-attacks, but as in their draw with Everton last week, Watford left little space in behind their back four and outworked their opponents.\nHornets have renewed hope\nSince Nigel Pearson's appointment as Watford manager on 7 December, the Hornets have taken four points from three fixtures, with their only defeat coming against runaway leaders Liverpool.\nThe display at Anfield, where they were narrowly beaten, showed a level of commitment and endeavour rarely seen under former bosses Javi Gracia and Quique Sanchez Flores this season.\nAnd this was very much a continuation of that effort, albeit against a side without the same attacking finesse as the leaders.\nAided by the return to full fitness of their talismanic forward Troy Deeney, who was starting just his sixth game of the season after a knee injury, Watford made this a scrappy affair and ultimately deserved their win.\nDeeney covered nearly a kilometre more than his United counterpart Martial as he made life uncomfortable for the visiting defence and that was replicated all over the pitch, with Pearson's side running over 5km more than their opponents.\nThat hard work was also rewarded by a level of good fortune as they scored with the first two shots on target in the game.\nThis victory will provide renewed hope that they can follow Burnley, Swansea, Sunderland and West Brom and survive in the Premier League having earned 12 points or fewer after 18 matches.\nMan of the match - Ismaila Sarr (Watford)\n'We were too slow' - Solskjaer\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We didn't deserve to win the game by the way we played. We were too slow in possession, too slow without the ball, not enough intensity.\n\"We didn't have enough to get back. You have to be out there and ready. First half both teams were slow. If you don't take your chances you get punished. We didn't deserve it today. They took their chances. We didn't take our chances. You have to earn every inch, every chance.\"\nOn David De Gea's mistake: \"It's one of those things. He's been so good in training and focused. One goal is a mistake and the second is penalty. David's been very confident lately and I don't look at any other way.\"\nOn Paul Pogba's comeback: \"The big plus is Paul coming on. And that's the one plus. He added urgency, quality, some great passes. The boy has been working hard. He's fit and leaner. He'll bring us a lot. He is important for us. He makes us create more chances.\"\nOn-the-spot Deeney - the stats\nWatford ended a run of 12 home Premier League matches without a win (D5 L7), with this their first win at Vicarage Road since a 4-1 win over Fulham in April.\nManchester United suffered their heaviest Premier League defeat against a team starting the day bottom since April 2005, a 2-0 defeat to Norwich City.\nThis was the first time Watford had won a Premier League game against a team starting the day in the top eight of the division since October 2018, when they beat Wolves 2-0.\nThree of Manchester United's last six Premier League defeats have been against teams starting the day in the relegation zone (also vs Cardiff in May and Newcastle in October).\nIn the Premier League, Troy Deeney has scored a penalty for Watford against Manchester United at Vicarage Road in four of the last five seasons.\nSince saving a Leighton Baines penalty in October 2014, David de Gea has failed to save any of the last 15 penalties he has faced in the Premier League. Among goalkeepers to face 20 or more, only Paul Robinson (6%) has saved a lower percentage than de Gea (8%, 2/25) in Premier League history.\nUnited's Jesse Lingard has now gone over 25 hours without registering either a goal or assist in a Premier League game, last doing so in December 2018 against Huddersfield Town (one assist).\nManchester United have won just one of their last 17 Premier League matches when they've had more possession than their opponents (W1 D8 L8), a 3-1 victory at Norwich City in October. They had 64% of possession at Watford.\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to Sheffield United for their next Premier League outing on 26 December (15:00 GMT). Manchester United play on the same day when they welcome Newcastle to Old Trafford (17:30)."

Spurs remain in seventh place - six points adrift.\nRacism allegations mar match\nLampard becomes the master over Mourinho\nLive reaction as Chelsea win at Tottenham\nUnsavoury scenes at Spurs\nThe attention should be on a superb performance from Chelsea and a tactical masterclass from Lampard, who completely flummoxed Mourinho on what was the Portuguese's worst day in charge since succeeding Mauricio Pochettino.\nSadly, the subject of players being subjected to racist abuse will once again top the agenda, casting a cloud over Chelsea's deserved celebrations at the final whistle.\nRudiger appeared to be the target after he was floored by Son's raised boot which earned the South Korea international a deserved red card just after the hour.\nTottenham fans reacted angrily to Rudiger, who they felt over-reacted, even though he was clearly fouled.\nThe Chelsea defender signalled to indicate what he had apparently been subjected to by sections of the home support.\nChelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta immediately spoke to referee Taylor; the unsavoury episode concluded with a succession of warnings over the stadium loudspeaker.\nLampard's joy unconfined\nLampard's wild celebrations in front of Chelsea's supporters after the final whistle were a graphic illustration of what he saw as the significance of this victory.\nThe subplot to this game had been built around the meeting between managerial rookie Lampard, in his first season at Chelsea and only his second in management after a single campaign at Derby County, and Mourinho, the self-styled 'Special One'.\nMourinho had shared such glories alongside the former England midfield man during his time at Stamford Bridge, where they won two Premier League titles together.\nOn the pitch at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, there was only one winner: Chelsea were sharp and incisive while Spurs were ponderous and second best in all areas.\nMourinho and Spurs seemed totally unprepared for Chelsea's three-man defensive system while the deployment of Dele Alli in a variety of positions in the first half hinted at the home side's disarray.\nThe Tottenham manager introduced Christian Eriksen for Eric Dier at half-time, but Son's red card snuffed out slim hopes of a comeback.\nChelsea regained their air of superiority as they returned to form having lost four of their previous five league games.\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\n'Does Rudiger have broken ribs?' - Mourinho on red card tackle\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho: \"Today was bad, we didn't start well. Chelsea started better than us. They scored from a short corner and that disappoints me. We were not focused.\n\"The second goal is a bad goal to concede. The penalty is a penalty, good decision by VAR.\n\"The Son situation was handled badly. The ref has to book Rudiger and the reaction from Son is not an aggression. Does Rudiger have broken ribs going to the hospital? Other people call it intelligent by Rudiger.\"\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard: \"It means a lot to me but it's about the club and the fans. The fans have come here after a number of losses and they have backed us. They know we are a young team and what we are trying to achieve.\n\"My players showed they could fight and play against a top team, because Tottenham are a good team. Today we were everything and that's why we should be celebrating. We are not over-excited, but we are pleased with the performance.\n\"They are a major rival and it shows the players what they can do under pressure and what they need to do to survive in games. You cannot fault their commitment.\"\nMourinho loses old club record - the stats\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho suffered his first home defeat against a team he had previously managed, having won 12 and drawn one of the previous 13 across all competitions.\nChelsea have won three consecutive games against Spurs across all competitions for the first time since January 2008 - current Spurs boss Mourinho oversaw two of the three wins in that previous run (2-1 in March 2007 and 1-0 in April 2007).\nWillian's penalty was Chelsea's 100th Premier League goal against Tottenham - in the history of the competition, only Manchester United against Everton (101), Liverpool against Newcastle (101) and Arsenal against Everton (107) have scored more goals against a single opponent.\nChelsea kept an away clean sheet for the first time under Frank Lampard in the Premier League, while they won without conceding away from home in the competition for the first time since December 2018.\nSince Mourinho's first game in charge of the club, no Premier League team have conceded more goals than Spurs across all competitions (14 - joint-most, along with Arsenal).\nSpurs' Son Heung-min was sent off for the third time in the Premier League, making him the first player to be shown three red cards in a calendar year in the competition since Lee Cattermole in 2010.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham have a home Premier League fixture with Brighton (12:30 GMT) on Thursday while Chelsea welcome Southampton to Stamford Bridge on the same day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Brighton & Hove Albion: Harry Kane and Dele Alli goals complete turnaround for Spurs\nTottenham renewed their pursuit of a place in the Premier League top four as they came from behind to beat Brighton in north London.\nThe result lifts Spurs up to fifth in the table, three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, who lost 2-0 at home to Southampton later on Thursday.\nAdam Webster had given the visitors a richly deserved lead, heading in from Pascal Gross' right-wing delivery towards the end of the first half.\nHowever, Spurs, who played at a pedestrian pace during the first period, raised their tempo after the interval to fight back.\nHarry Kane levelled matters with a right-foot shot into the bottom left corner after Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan had brilliantly parried his first effort.\nAnd Dele Alli's sublime lobbed finish then found the top left corner to complete the turnaround.\nIt ensured Brighton's miserable record on 26 December continued - with the Seagulls now winless in their last 11 games on this date.\nNdombele asked to be left out - Mourinho\nFollow all today's Premier League action\nGovernment warning over football racism\nKane, Alli and Moura galvanise Spurs\nTottenham won 60% of their Premier League matches while finishing fourth last term and although this win ensured an improvement (71%) on that ratio during Mourinho's first seven games in charge, the Portuguese boss still faces a significant challenge to steer his side into a Champions League place at the end of the season.\nDefeats against Manchester United and Chelsea have been damaging in that respect and Tottenham went into this match needing 15 victories from their remaining 20 games just to replicate last season's 71-point tally.\nBut the manner of this victory and the second-half performances of Kane, Alli and Lucas Moura will at least provide Mourinho with optimism.\nMourinho had won just one of his last 21 Premier League matches when his side trailed at the interval but that trio galvanised Tottenham after the break, prompting their recovery.\nBrazil winger Moura was pivotal to that, instigating many of Tottenham's attacks and helping to shift the momentum of the game.\nWhile in Kane, Spurs have one of the deadliest finishers in the top flight.\nThe England forward had the ball in the net with his first chance midway through the first half, but the video assistant referee deemed he was offside when receiving Harry Winks' long pass.\nKane was then brilliantly denied by Ryan, but exhibited his predatory instincts to drive in a follow-up and bring up his eighth goal in five Premier League games on 26 December.\nAlli, who covered more ground than any other home player, continued his and Spurs' resurgence under Mourinho, with an exquisite finish to register his fourth Premier League goal under his new manager.\nBrighton fall short again\nThis felt like a typical Brighton performance throughout, one brimming with promise and endeavour but ultimately lacking the cutting edge required for them to profit from their free-flowing passing.\nA bright start by the visitors saw Colombia midfielder Steven Alzate twice manoeuvre into good positions in front of goal.\nHowever, the former Leyton Orient midfielder fired tamely wide after four minutes and then saw Spurs keeper Paulo Gazzaniga parry his firmer effort to safety nine minutes later.\nHaving been reprieved by VAR - when Kane's first-half goal was disallowed - Brighton then put themselves in the position to win for the first time on 26 December since 2005.\nWebster reprised the role played by Guy Butters that day, climbing highest from Gross' exemplary delivery from the right to nod the ball into the bottom left corner.\nIt was no more than the visitors deserved and in many ways it was emblematic of the first half, with stationary marker Toby Alderweireld unable to stop his man.\nAnd while Gross twice went close to earning his side a point from distance - with Gazzaniga saving both - his efforts represented the Seagulls' only two shots on target after the break and underlined where they had fallen short again.\nMan of the match - Dele Alli (Tottenham)\n'Our spirit was fantastic' - what they said\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho: \"The spirit in the second half was so important. We did not start very well, we scored a beautiful goal which was offside and then they went on and scored. Brighton were very difficult to control. Our spirit was fantastic. We made some adjustments in the second half, we equalled their numbers in midfield and that gave us more possession. It was hard until the end but very important.\n\"We cannot lose two in a row, the work-rate was really brave. I told the boys to focus on this game and to give every last piece of energy we have. I think when you lost a game it hurts. If you are not hurt then you are not committed. You need to be emotionally strong. You need to recover quickly and that did not happen today. It was hard. Fantastic spirit by the players.\"\nOn Brighton: \"I want to say that Brighton were good - tactically. They can adapt, they can change. They are very dangerous on set-pieces.\"\nBrighton manager Graham Potter, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I thought it was quite an even game in terms of shots and chances. You would expect Tottenham to have a bit of pressure. We are disappointed to come away with nothing. Those fine little margins, little details we need to do better.\n\"I thought we had some good moments in the half and we contributed to a good first-half performance. The little details you need to go your way they didn't. We need to dust ourselves down and go again. We need to stick together, stick to what we are doing and move forward.\"\nKane shines in December again - the stats\nTottenham are unbeaten in their last 14 Boxing Day league games (W11 D3), since losing 2-0 at Portsmouth in 2003 - extending their longest unbeaten run on December 26th.\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho has never lost in eight Premier League games on Boxing Day (W6 D2), managing more games without defeat on the day than any other manager in the competition.\nBrighton have lost five of their last six away league games played on Boxing Day (D1), including losing both such games in the Premier League (also 2-0 against Chelsea in 2017).\nDele Alli has been directly involved in more goals in all competitions under Mourinho than any other Tottenham player (five goals and three assists in eight appearances).\nTottenham's Harry Kane has scored eight goals in five Premier League games on Boxing Day - only Robbie Fowler (nine goals in 10 appearances) has scored more on 26 December in the competition. Indeed, Kane has bagged 26 Premier League goals in the month of December - 10 more than he has in any other month in the competition.\nKane has now scored 100 home goals in 172 appearances in all competitions at club level, with 90 of those coming for Spurs (five for Millwall, three for Leyton Orient, two for Leicester City).\nPascal Gross has provided 15 assists for Brighton in the Premier League, eight more than any other Seagulls player in the competition.\nBrighton defender Adam Webster has scored as many goals in his 15 Premier League games this season (three) as he netted in 44 Championship matches for Bristol City last term.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to Carrow Road to face struggling Norwich on Saturday, 28 December (17:30 GMT), while Brighton host Bournemouth on the same day (12:30)."

In terms of attitude, desire and commitment it was better than I expected.\"\nMidfielder Gosling gave the hosts the lead from close range after Jack Stacey's cut back before Arsenal's captain came to the rescue.\nAubameyang struck with a first-time shot after Reiss Nelson's attempt from the edge of the penalty area deflected into the Gabon forward's path.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Thursday?\nWork ahead for Arteta\nArsenal reach the midway point closer to the relegation zone than the top four and have now dropped 24 points from the last 11 top-flight games, with home matches against Chelsea on Sunday and Manchester United on 1 January coming up.\nAs the Arsenal players went to applaud the away fans at the end of an entertaining game, there was a special cheer for Arteta.\nThe Spaniard saw his side create plenty of chances in the opening 45 minutes yet Aubameyang's goal, a sweeping instinctive finish, was their first attempt on target after a string of missed opportunities, mainly by Alexandre Lacazette.\nThe Gunners once again made life hard for themselves, a careless pass allowing Gosling to put Bournemouth ahead towards the end of the first half - dashing hopes of back-to-back clean sheets away in the Premier League for the first time since February 2016.\nMesut Ozil began the Arteta era with a recall and started well creating a couple of chances before being replaced by Joe Willock.\nThe young substitute had a chance to win it in the closing stages but Arsenal were far from clinical in front of goal and his shot was comfortably kept out by Aaron Ramsdale as Bournemouth secured a deserved point.\nCherries dig in for vital point\nBournemouth are just two points above the relegation zone yet this was a spirited performance by Eddie Howe's side whose character has been questioned during the first half of the season.\nTheir first 19 games include losing to a Crystal Palace side reduced to 10 men for 71 minutes, losing at Newcastle after leading, allowing Burnley to score an 89th-minute winner and letting leads slip against Sheffield United and West Ham.\nAgainst Arsenal, the Cherries produced the kind of defiant performance their fans have become accustomed to since promotion in 2015.\nSteve Cook marked his return from a fractured wrist with a gutsy performance at the back while Stacey, a League One player with Luton last season, produced a lovely assist for Gosling.\nFormer Everton and Newcastle player Gosling followed up his winner at Chelsea this month with a clever finish to score against the run of play.\nBournemouth had failed to manage a shot on target in two of their previous three matches.\nThey managed four in this game as they showed a determination that will have pleased Howe ahead of back-to-back away games at Brighton and West Ham, who sit immediately above and below them in the table.\nMan of the match - Lucas Torreira (Arsenal)\n'We didn't know what to expect' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I'm pleased with the performance, it was a very difficult game in tough conditions. We had a slight readjustment in our backline again with Simon Francis missing out and Jack Simpson playing left-back.\n\"Those adjustments considered, I thought the players gave everything to win. It could have gone either way at the end, they had chances and we had chances, but we'll take the point and try to build on it.\n\"We didn't quite know what to expect from Arsenal, we assumed the philosophy would change and I think it did, it was quite visible to see Arsenal playing in a slightly different way.\n\"The system was different but we couldn't plan for that as we had no idea really what they were going to do - we had to plan for us and make sure we were better than we were against Burnley and learn from that experience - and I think we did.\"\nAway-day specialist Aubameyang - the stats\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored 73% of Arsenal's away Premier League goals this season (eight out of 11).\nBournemouth have scored just three goals in their last six Premier League home games, and never more than once in a match in that time.\nArsenal had more shots in this game (17) than they did in their previous two Premier League games combined (12 - six each v Everton and Manchester City).\nBournemouth's Jefferson Lerma has been booked 20 times since the start of last season, more than any other player in the Premier League.\nBoth Bournemouth and Arsenal's goals in this match came from their first shots on target.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth don't have long to prepare for their early kick-off at Brighton on Saturday (12:30 GMT).

        "article_text": "Everton 1-0 Burnley: Carlo Ancelotti starts Toffees tenure with win\nCarlo Ancelotti made a winning start as Everton manager as his side edged past Burnley at a packed and passionate Goodison Park.\nThe 60-year-old Italian, who won the Premier League and FA Cup double as Chelsea boss in 2009-10, took over at Everton last week and received a fantastic reception from the home fans.\nBurnley, after two successive wins, nearly scored inside three minutes but Jay Rodriguez's header was cleared off the line by Yerry Mina.\nAway goalkeeper Nick Pope did excellently to keep out Mason Holgate's close-range shot and also a later effort from Djibril Sidibe.\nAncelotti's special day' gives Everton hope\nRelive the action as it happened\nBut the hosts finally broke the Clarets' brave resistance when Dominic Calvert-Lewin produced an excellent diving header, which went in off the inside of the post, from Sidibe's cross.\nThe win extends Everton's unbeaten league run to four matches and takes them up to 13th, one place below Burnley.\nAncelotti's Everton fight hard to win\nIt is just over eight-and-a-half years since Ancelotti was sacked in a corridor at Goodison Park, not long after the Toffees had beaten his Chelsea side 1-0 in the final game of 2010-11. He was dismissed after a season without silverware, even though he had won two trophies 12 months earlier.\nSince then, he has managed Paris St-Germain, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Napoli before making an unexpected return to England following Everton's decision to sack Marco Silva earlier this month.\nAncelotti has won three Champions League titles and four domestic championships in a glittering managerial career and was given a rapturous standing ovation from the home fans, whose side have not won a trophy since the 1995 FA Cup.\nHe was joined on the touchline by Duncan Ferguson, who had been in charge for three league games as interim boss and remains part of Ancelotti's coaching team.\nWhen Silva was dismissed, Everton were in the bottom three, but they were rejuvenated under Ferguson as they beat Chelsea and drew with Manchester United and Arsenal.\nAnd Everton continued their recent revival by finally breaking down Burnley, who defended excellently for 80 minutes.\nBut the visitors were undone when Dwight McNeil sloppily gave the ball away near the left flank, dispossessed by Gylfi Sigurdsson. He released Sidibe, whose cross was met by Calvert-Lewis's diving header to spark joyous scenes among the home fans.\nResolute Burnley finally broken down\nBurnley came into this match 10th in the table, five points and five places better off than Everton, and on the back of 1-0 wins against Newcastle and Bournemouth.\nRodriguez, who scored the winner against the Cherries after coming on a substitute, was rewarded with a starting spot and nearly justified his manager's decision inside three minutes.\nThe impressive Ben Mee headed the ball across the goal and Rodriguez's looping header went past Jordan Pickford, but Mina was excellently positioned to clear the danger.\nClarets goalkeeper Nick Pope did not have to face a single shot on target in his previous two games, but Everton proved a much tougher test and he had to make good saves to deny Holgate, Sidibe and Calvert-Lewin before he was eventually beaten.\nThese two teams met on the same day at Turf Moor in 2018, with Everton winning 5-1, but the Clarets defended much better this year, with the central defensive partnership of Mee and James Tarkowski excelling.\nOne disappointment for manager Sean Dyche will be the lack of clear-cut chances and the fact his side did not force Pickford to make a save in the final 10 minutes as they looked to salvage a point.\nNevertheless, at the halfway point of the season, Burnley still find themselves six points above the relegation zone and in a good position for a top-half finish in the top flight for only the second time in 45 seasons.\nMan of the match - Ben Mee (Burnley)\n'The perfect day' - what they said\nCarlo Ancelotti told BBC Match of the Day: \"For me, it was a really special moment [being introduced to the crowd]. After that, I saw a good performance and a good result. Today was a perfect day. I'm happy because we need points to move up the table. It was a difficult game because Burnley played a strong game but we deserved the result.\n\"We tried to build up with three defenders to put more players between the lines, and some situations were good for us and others have to improve. This is normal and I didn't want to change a lot for the players. I have seen some good things. The spirit of the team, the fact Everton is a family and we have fantastic facilities.\"\nOn the festive schedule: \"We are used to recovering after three days, but after two days is too much in my opinion. We have to play but it is impossible to recover so it affects the performance, not just for us, but also for Newcastle.\"\nSean Dyche told Match of the Day: \"I thought we coped with it [Ancelotti's first game]. We quelled the game in the first half, which was the game plan because we thought they would play with energy. We never really looked in too much trouble and then we wanted to progress in the second half. It was a giveaway in the second half and they nicked it.\n\"It was a poor mistake, Dwight [McNeil] is a fantastic footballer and he will learn. Our two centre-halves were excellent today and I was pleased with the defensive side of the team.\n\"We know we have to work for those collective moments of quality in the final third. The next pass and the next detail is what we are trying to consistently improve on. But it was a good ball in and a great finish to credit them.\"\nAncelotti maintains Goodison charm - the stats\nCarlo Ancelotti has only lost his first game in charge of a team in all competitions once in his managerial career (W7 D2 L1), going unbeaten in his last eight such matches. This sole defeat came with Parma in 1996.\nNo permanent Everton manager has lost their first Premier League game in charge when it's taken place at Goodison Park, with Ancelotti the eighth to avoid defeat (W5 D3).\nBurnley have won just one of their last 16 away league games played on Boxing Day (D4 L11), with that victory coming at Barnsley in the Championship in 2010.\nAfter losing back-to-back home Premier League games in September, Everton have lost just once in their last six at Goodison Park (W3 D2 L1).\nBurnley failed to land a single shot on target in this game, attempting six shots in total (all off target).\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has scored six goals in 17 Premier League appearances this season, as many as he bagged in 35 games last term.\nCalvert-Lewin has scored three goals in his last three Premier League games at Goodison Park, as many as he netted in his previous 21.\nOnly Trent Alexander-Arnold (6) and Andy Robertson (5) have more Premier League assists this season amongst defenders than Everton's Djibril Sidibe (4).\nWhat's next?\nEverton now have a run of three away games, beginning with Newcastle on Saturday (15:00 GMT), then Manchester City on New Year's Day (17:30) and the Merseyside derby at Liverpool on Sunday, 5 January (16:01 GMT) in the third round of the FA Cup - a match you can see live on BBC One.\nBurnley are at Turf Moor three times in a row - against Manchester United on Saturday (19:45), Aston Villa four days later (12:30), then League One side Peterborough United in the FA Cup on 4 January (12:31)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-2 Southampton: Saints claim vital win at Stamford Bridge\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard called on his players to show \"personality\" after they were condemned to consecutive home defeats for the first time since 2011 by an impressive Southampton.\nLampard's side fell behind to Michael Obafemi's superbly taken strike at Stamford Bridge and had fewer shots than in any game since he took charge during the summer.\nThe introduction of Mason Mount for defender Kurt Zouma at the break injected some energy but only a vital Fikayo Tomori intervention denied the away side a second.\nAnd with 20 minutes remaining, a fine team move saw the ball break for Nathan Redmond and his simple finish from 10 yards wrapped up six points for Ralph Hasenhuttl's side from festive away games at Aston Villa and the Blues.\nIt means Chelsea have now lost five of their last seven league games and three times in a calendar month for the first time since 2015.\n\"We control a lot of the ball but we do not do enough with the ball around the box,\" Lampard told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"I think it's been the story for us for a while, not just in recent times. We need to get better because we need a better home record.\n\"What we need to do, the players on the pitch, whoever they are need to make goals and score goals. It's the hardest thing to do in football. It's a challenge for all of us.\"\nRelive Southampton's win at Chelsea\nAll the action and reaction from Boxing Day's games\nAbject Chelsea fail to get going\nHasenhuttl was suitably impressed and raced on to the pitch with his fists clenched on the final whistle after a result which moved his side up to 14th in the Premier League - three points above the drop zone.\nSouthampton - on 21 points - are six better off than they were at the same halfway stage last season. Lampard's Chelsea are fourth in the Premier League but eight points worse off than they were under Maurizio Sarri after 19 games last term.\nDespite coming off Sunday's win at Tottenham, Chelsea found no sort of rhythm and when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg found Obafemi, he was allowed time and space to progress, shift the ball on to his left foot and fire high into the net from the edge of the box.\nChelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta flicked a corner into the six-yard box - forcing the impressive Alex McCarthy to help the ball away from danger - but it took the home side until the stroke of half-time to find the target with a tame effort from 30 yards.\nMount came off the bench and quickly gave Tammy Abraham the chance to fizz a shot into the side-netting but Chelsea were collectively poor and both Tomori and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga make key second-half interventions to keep the score at 1-0.\nLampard's side ran over 5km less than the visitors overall and generally lacked creativity and energy. The January transfer window - where they can again sign players after serving a ban - looks key to giving them the chance to inject something fresh and change their recent fortunes.\n\"We have found now that when teams make it difficult for us and do not give us space, we are finding it tough and so it clearly needs to improve,\" added Lampard.\n\"We need to tough it out and get over it quickly. Personality is a huge thing in football - you cannot let that beat you.\"\nBrave Ralph and a brave display\nArsenal and Liverpool were the last sides to record back-to-back wins at Chelsea in 2011 and Southampton deserved to follow Bournemouth in leaving Stamford Bridge with all three points in December.\nHassenhuttl made the brave call to leave Danny Ings on the bench, despite his 11 goals leaving him second to only Jamie Vardy in the top-scorer charts this season.\nObafemi - who had not netted in over a year - and Che Adams - who is yet to score for Saints - worked relentlessly up front for the away side, while James Ward-Prowse was the only player on the pitch to run over 12km in a tireless display.\nThe midfielder contributed nine tackles - three more than anyone on the pitch - while the Southampton back four repeatedly seemed well positioned, with Jack Stephens and right-back Cedric Soares constantly turning crosses away.\nWhen composure was needed, the away side found plenty and their second goal saw them run the clock down with a lengthy spell of possession that ended with Redmond netting his second league goal of the season.\nThe fact the ball was turned into his path by a Chelsea player may hide the large number of passes in the build-up, but Saints could then ease home as they ended a run of 13 league games without a clean sheet.\nHassenhuttl will also get the chance to strengthen in January but he looks to have harnessed a superb spirit, a feat that looked unlikely after a 9-0 home defeat by Leicester just 10 games ago. His side have now lost just twice in seven league outings.\n\"In the first two or three months we played like a relegation team and now we are playing like a Premier League team,\" said Hassenhuttl afterwards.\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse\nShots falling for Blues - key stats\nChelsea have lost seven Premier League games this season - only one fewer than they lost in the entirety of the 2018/19 season under Maurizio Sarri (8).\nChelsea have lost three Premier League games during December 2019, their most in a calendar month since October 2015 (also three defeats).\nSouthampton have won four of their last six Premier League matches (L2), one more than in their previous 20 games (W3 D6 L11).\nSouthampton won an away Premier League match against a team starting the day in the top four of the division for the first time since May 2016, a 2-1 win at Spurs.\nChelsea had just 10 shots against Southampton, their fewest in a Premier League game under Frank Lampard and fewest since April against Liverpool (six).\n'Maybe our best game' - reaction\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard: \"Teams are making it difficult here. We are not making enough chances, we were at the beginning of the season. I think we have enough to be better than we were today. It needs to be a quick learning process now.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hassenhuttl: \"I think we saw the passion from every player on the pitch today. It was maybe the best game of the season. With fixtures coming, we needed to rest players but everyone played a fantastic game.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton now have back-to-back home games against Crystal Palace on Saturday and Tottenham on New Year's Day. Chelsea face a trip to Arsenal on 29 December and then go to Brighton on 1 January."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-1 West Ham: Jordan Ayew nets brilliant late winner to beat Hammers\nJordan Ayew's sensational 90th-minute winner will \"live long in the memory\", says manager Roy Hodgson after his Crystal Palace side came from behind to beat West Ham at Selhurst Park.\nAyew danced through the Hammers defence on the edge of the box and then brilliantly beat goalkeeper Roberto with a calm chip to claim the three points.\nHe also set-up Cheikhou Kouyate with a knock-down for Palace's equaliser, as the midfielder swept home a volley from seven yards to cancel out Robert Snodgrass' opener.\n\"It was a fantastic effort,\" Hodgson said.\n\"I thought Jordan did ever so well to set up the first goal.\n\"The second was one of those wonderful individual efforts that will live long in the memory and get lots of airings on TV.\n\"He deserves that - it's a fine reward for his performance today and this season so far.\"\nThe win takes Palace up to eighth in the Premier League table but West Ham fall to 17th, just a point above the relegation zone as pressure increases again on manager Manuel Pellegrini.\nCrystal Palace v West Ham United as it happened\nReaction to all of Boxing Day's Premier League action\nAyew magic grabs deserved three points for Palace\nGhanaian Ayew unsurprisingly said afterwards his goal was one of the best he has scored in his career.\nHe drove in from the right wing, beat Declan Rice with a drag-back and dribbled around two more defenders before showing brilliant composure to send Selhurst Park delirious.\nA dreary first half did not hint at what was to come later, but the winner was deserved reward for Palace's second-half performance.\nAyew and Luka Milivojevic had both gone close before Snodgrass' curled the opener inside the far post against the run of play.\nThat said, the Scotland international could have scored again moments before Ayew's goal if not for an excellent block from Jairo Riedewald.\nPalace have rarely grabbed the headlines this season but they now go into the second half of the season with 26 points - just three off the top six - and have a chance to secure just a second top-10 Premier League finish.\nPressure back on Pellegrini's stuttering Hammers\nWhen Snodgrass put West Ham in front, the Hammers were en route to a second successive Premier League win which would have moved them well clear of the drop zone.\nInstead, not helped by wins elsewhere for Southampton and Aston Villa, they are looking worryingly over their shoulders once again.\nThey have had 12 days without a match since their win at Southampton but have followed those three points with defeat - as they did when they beat Chelsea in November.\nPellegrini was reportedly facing the sack had his side lost at Southampton\n, external\nand will have to face more questions about his position after this defeat.\nThey only had two shots on target in the 90 minutes and will wonder how Ayew was able to beat so many defenders for the winner.\nThe Hammers have a difficult game against Leicester at London Stadium on Saturday before they host Bournemouth on New Year's Day.\n\"We need to recover as soon as we can,\" said Pellegrini, whose side have only won twice at home this season.\n\"We need to play our home game where we are not having good results - we have two games in a row there and I hope we start winning.\"\nInjuries mount for Palace\nThe only negatives for Palace were further additions to their growing injury list.\nThe Eagles were already without five first-team players - Scott Dann, Gary Cahill, Joel Ward, Andros Townsend and Jeffrey Schlupp - before striker Christian Benteke was ruled out of this game with a muscle injury that Hodgson said would sideline the Belgian a \"few weeks\".\nFull-back Patrick van Aanholt was then substituted in the second half after pulling up with what looked to be a hamstring injury.\nHodgson said he will try to sign \"a few\" players in January to bolster their squad.\nMan of the match - Jordan Ayew (Crystal Palace)\nAyew the late goal specialist - the best stats\nCrystal Palace recorded a Premier League double over West Ham for just the second time, having previously done so in the 2013-14 season under Tony Pulis.\nThe team scoring first has not won any of the past six Premier League meetings between Crystal Palace and West Ham (D3 L3), with the Eagles coming from behind to win 2-1 in both meetings this season.\nCrystal Palace are unbeaten in their past three London derbies at Selhurst Park in the Premier League (W2 D1) - their longest such run since between March 1993 and September 1994 (also three games).\nNo fewer 76% of Crystal Palace's goals in the Premier League this season have been scored in the second half of games (13 out of 17), including eight of their nine at Selhurst Park.\nAyew has scored 21 goals in the Premier League, with 20 of those being netted in the second half (95%) - the highest such ratio of any player with 20 or more goals in the competition's history.\nSnodgrass has scored four league goals against Crystal Palace - only against Bristol City (five) has he netted more in English league competition.\nKouyate became the fourth player to score for both the Eagles and West Ham in the Premier League, after Iain Dowie, Michael Hughes and James Tomkins.\nWilfried Zaha completed 12 dribbles for Crystal Palace in this game; the most by a player in a Premier League outing since Chelsea's Eden Hazard in February (13 versus Huddersfield).\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are back in action in two days time. Crystal Palace travel to Southampton on 28 December (15:00 GMT kick-off) while West Ham host Leicester later the same day (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 1-1 Watford: Hornets off foot of table with gutsy draw\nNigel Pearson says he has renewed hope his Watford side can avoid relegation after they moved off the foot of the Premier League table with a draw at Sheffield United.\nPearson's team went ahead in the first half through Gerard Deulofeu's breakaway goal, but Oliver Norwood's penalty pegged them back before the break.\nUnited's Oliver McBurnie was thwarted early on by a fine save from Watford's Ben Foster, who pulled off another excellent stop to deny John Fleck from point-blank range in the second half.\n\"We were far from at our best today,\" said Pearson. \"But what should give us encouragement is even when we have not been playing as fluently as we can do, we get something out of it.\n\"We still have enough time and games to affect our own season, and it is as simple as that in my view.\"\nThe result ends a run of three straight wins for the Blades, who drop into sixth place, while Watford move up one place above Norwich City.\nWatford have looked like a much more solid unit since Pearson took over on 7 December, and now have a win and two draws in four games under him.\n\"It is a good point for us,\" Pearson added. \"I think it important we turn into the new year with some hope we can fight for results, even when we are not at our best.\"\nChris Wilder's Blades drop below Tottenham, who beat Brighton in the day's early kick-off, but they are still on an impressive run with just one defeat in their past 12 league outings.\nHow Sheffield United v Watford unfolded\nFollow all the day's Premier League action\nSlight stumble but Blades are still impressing\nThe Blades' rise into the upper reaches of the Premier League has been one of the stories of the season so far - and despite this draw, it shows no sign of ending.\nSix of Wilder's starting line-up against Watford have begun every one of United's 19 league matches so far, giving them a solid look and feel - by contrast, Foster is the only ever-present for Watford.\nBut despite having the better of the opening phase of the match, United could not unlock Watford's resilient defence and were then caught out for the opening goal.\nFoster's long clearance was nodded on by Nathaniel Chalobah into the path of Deulofeu, who then raced away before sliding his shot underneath Dean Henderson. It was the first goal conceded by United since Alexander Tettey's opener for Norwich on 8 December.\nNorwood's emphatic penalty, following a foul by Will Hughes on George Baldock, signalled an improvement from the hosts, who were the dominant side after half-time.\nHad Fleck's first-time touch at close range gone inches either side of Foster, United would surely have gone ahead but it was not to be.\nUnited's next two outings are trips to Manchester City and Liverpool, which they can approach with confidence given that they have still yet to lose a Premier League away match this season. In both games, though, they will need to take what could be rare chances in front of goal.\nIs a great escape building momentum for Watford?\nPearson's appointment had galvanised Watford, who have gleaned five points from his three games in charge.\nIn the Premier League era, only Burnley, Swansea, Sunderland and West Brom have managed to stay up with 12 points or fewer after 18 matches - Watford's total at kick-off. But on this evidence, the Hornets are going to be a much tougher proposition in this season's second half than for much of the first.\nDespite being pegged back for long spells - and owing much Foster for his excellent early save to thwart McBurnie - the visitors had the awareness to take their chance when it came.\nDeulofeu had menaced the home defence prior to his goal, his third of the season, and continued to make things difficult but this was a solid team performance.\nPearson spoke after the match of the need for an attitude of \"if you can't win, don't get beaten\", and his side certainly showed that determination.\nAnd while they were helped enormously by Foster's heroics, the return from injury of the talismanic Deeney in all five of Watford's games in December also seems to have boosted the side.\nTwo consecutive home games for the Hornets now give Pearson and his team the chance to build upon this gritty performance.\nMan of the match - Ben Foster (Watford)\n'We were not quite at it today' - manager reaction\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We got our first penalty of the season, which is good - and we stuck it away successfully, which I am delighted about. It was not really one of our better performances but you have to give Nigel Person and his players credit. They are fighting for their lives.\n\"It was not the result we were after and certainly not the performance we are after. Their goalkeeper made some fantastic saves but we never found that last little bit to win a tight game.\n\"My players were really not at it today as well as they have been. These are precious points in the Premier League and we will take one and move on. We have a positive result even if it was not one of our best and most positive performances.\n\"We never played with our drive and energy that got us into this position. If you are not at full tilt, you will not get the result you want.\"\nDeulofeu leads the way for Hornets - the stats\nSheffield United have only lost four of their opening 19 Premier League games this season (W7 D8 L4) - the Blades last lost fewer in a campaign in the top two divisions of English football in 2005-06 (two losses).\nWatford have only kept two Premier League clean sheets in 20 away games in 2019, conceding 41 goals; only Tottenham (one) kept fewer of ever-present clubs in the calendar year.\nSheffield United have only lost one of their past 12 Premier League games (W5 D6 L1), a 0-2 home defeat by Newcastle. In fact, the Blades are unbeaten in their past four (W3 D1).\nWatford are winless in their past eight Boxing Day away games (D4 L4); their last win coming in 1992 against Southend in the English second tier.\nThey are one of three teams that Sheffield United midfielder Oliver Norwood has scored more than one league goal against (also Brentford and Huddersfield).\nWatford midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah provided his second Premier League assist - and his first since October 2016 when playing for Chelsea (v Leicester).\nGerard Deulofeu has scored 14 Premier League goals since his Watford debut in January 2018, more than any other Hornets player.\nDeulofeu has been directly involved in nine goals in his past seven Premier League appearances against newly promoted teams (six goals, three assists)\nWhat's next?\nWatford have less than two days to prepare for their next match, at home to Aston Villa on Saturday 28 December, with a kick off time of 15:00 GMT. Sheffield United are back in action on Sunday 29 December, when they play Manchester City at Etihad Stadium at 18:00 GMT."

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 1-0 Norwich City: Conor Hourihane grabs winner\nAston Villa captain Jack Grealish said it felt as if they had \"won a cup\" as they beat fellow strugglers Norwich to end a four-match losing streak.\nConor Hourihane came off the bench to score the only goal, laid on by midfielder Grealish, before Tom Heaton produced a fine save to deny Norwich substitute Onel Hernandez a late equaliser.\nOn their return to the Premier League this season, both sides came into Christmas in the relegation zone after going five games without a win.\nAnd although Villa remain third-bottom, they are back within a point of safety while Norwich have slipped to the bottom of the table below Watford, who drew at Sheffield United.\n\"It was absolutely massive today,\" said Grealish. \"It almost feels like we've won a cup.\n\"It was a bit of a scrappy one but it was all about the three points. The record hasn't been good but that was one for the fans today.\n\"In the warm-up we had a little chat and just said 'we need to win' - even a draw wouldn't have been good enough.\"\nNorwich were more positive during the first hour, with Sam Byram's header bouncing against the top of the crossbar, but within eight minutes of coming on, Irish midfielder Hourihane swept the ball in from one of Villa's two shots on target.\nAston Villa 1-0 Norwich - As it happened\nFollow all of the day's Premier League action live\nHourihane comes off bench to deliver Christmas cheer\nSaturday's 3-1 home defeat by Southampton saw Villa drop into the bottom three for the first time since beating Norwich 5-1 in the reverse fixture on 5 October. They also lost John McGinn to a fractured ankle as they lost to the Saints.\nVilla are set to be without the influential midfielder for up to three months and Hourihane also dropped out of the starting line-up after Saturday, with manager Dean Smith making four changes.\nAnd although Anwar El Ghazi twice went close before the break, for the first time at home this season Villa failed to record a single shot on target in the first half. They also looked susceptible to the counter-attack.\nNorwich continued to look most likely to break the deadlock after the interval until the introduction of Hourihane, who swiftly showed he could be the man to ease the creative burden of Jack Grealish during McGinn's absence.\nEl Ghazi came in from the left and found Hourihane, who played it first time to Grealish. Villa's top scorer dummied past Alex Tettey, sticking the Norwich midfielder on his backside, before nudging it back to Hourihane and the Republic of Ireland international fired in his third Premier League goal of the season from just inside the box.\nVilla were also indebted to Heaton for his late save - and to some dominant defending by centre-half Kortney Hause - but victory brought some much-needed Christmas cheer to the Villa faithful.\nCanaries need points not plaudits\nDespite being in the bottom three since losing to Villa in October, it's not all been doom and gloom during the Canaries' return to the top flight.\nA 1-1 draw at Leicester 12 days ago saw them halt the Foxes' winning run and they created more than enough chances to win during Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Wolves.\nBut they are now seven points behind fourth-bottom West Ham and manager Daniel Farke must be getting concerned at their inability to take advantage in games when they are on top.\nThey had the only three shots on target in the first half, while Byram hit the woodwork from an Emiliano Buendia corner.\nJust after the interval, Norwich nearly scored from successive corners. Tettey had a shot cleared off the line by Douglas Luiz before Heaton did well to keep out Tom Trybull's back-post header.\nBut then Hourihane struck and the best chance City had to equalise was Hernandez's powerful half-volley from close range, which was too close to Heaton but the Villa keeper still did well to react and push the ball away.\nThe Canaries probably deserved a point but that will be of scant consolation to Farke as, with his side now past the halfway point this season, they need points not plaudits.\n'It was tough to accept' - what they said\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith: \"It's very precious. The fact that we'd lost four Premier League matches on the spin, you don't come into this game with an awful lot of confidence.\n\"The three things I asked the players for were enthusiasm, attitude and application, and we got them. It wasn't a classic performance by any means but we showed an awful lot of character out there as well.\n\"We've played better in games and lost. Today we took the chance that came our way and Norwich didn't.\n\"You've got to be a good team-mate and a good squad member. Sometimes they play, sometimes they don't, but what I want to see is a reaction when they come on the pitch and Conor did that with a really good finish.\n\"Sometimes a result like that can play you into form. We'll certainly get better; this is the first look at the Premier League for a lot of our players and everything you get in this league you have to earn.\"\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke: \"I can't ask my players for more. It was a top-class away performance, we dominated the game. We had more possession, more shots, we won many duels and were unbelievably solid in terms of defending.\n\"We're disappointed with the result but I think we can be proud of our performance. In the end we perhaps lacked a bit of individual quality to convert our dominance into a perfect result for us.\n\"When everything seems to be going against you, you have to keep going, and that's what we did in the second half. Goals are always important to change a game - and a bit of luck. Today was tough to accept.\n\"It doesn't matter so much if you lose a game against one of your direct opponents at the moment. In the end, you need 10 or 11 wins at this level to be able to stay in this league.\n\"We know we're an underdog and in the worst position but there's no giving up.\"\nMan of the match - Tom Heaton (Aston Villa)\nCanaries' Christmas hangover - the stats\nAston Villa have completed a Premier League double over Norwich for only the second time, also doing so in 2013-14 under Paul Lambert.\nJack Grealish has been directly involved in 10 goals (five goals, five assists) in 17 league appearances this season, only two short of his tally in the Championship last season when he registered 12 in 31 games (excluding play-offs).\nEmiliano Buendia has created 55 chances for Norwich in the Premier League this season, at least 34 more than any team-mate.\nNorwich have played more Premier League games on Boxing Day without a victory than any other side in the competition (seven - D1 L6).\nWhat's next?\nVilla face the other side in the bottom three as they visit Watford on Saturday, 28 December (15:00 GMT), before Norwich host Tottenham (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 4-1 Newcastle United: Anthony Martial stars in thumping win\nAnthony Martial scored twice as Manchester United came from behind to hammer Newcastle United and move four points off a Champions League place in the table.\nMartial cancelled out teenager Matty Longstaff's opener for Newcastle with a near post finish before a deflected shot from outside the penalty area by 18-year-old Mason Greenwood went in off the bar.\nMarcus Rashford extended Manchester United's lead further with a header - his 11th Premier League goal of the season - before Martial added the fourth.\nThe France forward went close to becoming the first Manchester United player to score a Premier League hat-trick since 2013 when his low shot hit a post.\nMan Utd's McTominay sustains knee injury\nReaction from Old Trafford and Thursday's other Premier League games\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Thursday?\nMartial's good day\nIf there is one player who symbolises the erratic nature of Manchester United just now, it is Martial.\nOccasional flashes of genuine brilliance and some decent overall performances are mixed with others so lacking in purpose it must make executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward wonder whether he was right to resist Jose Mourinho's willingness to sell the Frenchman at the beginning of last season.\nEven today, at half-time, one very knowledgeable and experienced United observer continued to state his belief the club would be better off without Martial, despite the fact he had scored.\nAfter the break, Martial's second, a fine finish over Martin Dubravka after a woeful Sean Longstaff back-pass had sent him clean though, represented only the fourth time he had scored more than once for United in the league since he was signed by Louis van Gaal in 2015.\nHe remains a crowd favourite and the ovation he received as he made his way to the dressing room after being replaced by Juan Mata midway through the second half was impressive.\nIt remains the case that until Martial's goal output improves, he will not be delivering what United require. His tally of nine goals for the season so far is only three short of his best return since his debut campaign, when he scored 17.\nMan Utd's Boxing Day glee\nIf Manchester United could extend their Boxing Day home record across the entire season, they wouldn't be experiencing the kind of drift that has affected them in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.\nTheir record since a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool on 26 December 1978 now reads an impressive 16 wins and three draws from 19 fixtures.\nUnited have not had a Boxing Day win as big as this one since they put five past Wigan on 26 December 2011 - which, ironically, was the last day Newcastle won a Boxing Day away fixture, at Burnley.\nThat Wigan game is the last time United scored five at home in a Premier League game.\nLongstaff loves playing Man Utd\nFew players can have had a start to their Premier League careers quite like Matty Longstaff.\nThe 19-year-old was making his debut when he scored the winner in the reverse fixture at St James' Park in October.\nLongstaff kept his place for two more games before he was dropped - and did not reappear until his team met United again. He duly scored again.\nLongstaff's shot into the bottom corner from Joelinton's lay-off meant Newcastle had taken the lead at Old Trafford for three seasons in a row - an effort that has brought them no points.\nManager Steve Bruce remains without a win at the stadium where he enjoyed so much success as a player.\nConsequently, Newcastle are yet to record a league double over United since 1931.\nMan of the match - Anthony Martial (Man Utd)\n'Greenwood two years off his best' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"We're not going to see the best of Mason [Greenwood] for a couple of years. He's learning, growing as a human being, he'll grow more and more.\n\"Marcus [Rashford] sprung on the scene the same age and you see more maturity in his game.\n\"You saw the intent straight away. Newcastle made mistakes but we made them make them by pressing and we made it hard for them.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce: \"We gifted it to them. That is the biggest disappointment we all feel. You can't make that many mistakes here. It is disappointing. The reason we have got a few results is the way we have defended. We made far too many individual errors today.\n\"You are never surprised about the character of Manchester United. That is the disappointment. No player wants to make the mistakes we did.\"\nTeenage kicks - the stats\nMan Utd forward Mason Greenwood has scored eight goals in all competitions this season - the only teenager with more in Europe's big five leagues is Borussia Dortmund's England forward Jadon Sancho (12).\nGreenwood is just the fourth teenager to score in consecutive home matches for the Red Devils in the Premier League, after Ryan Giggs (1993), Wayne Rooney (2005) and Federico Macheda (2010).\nNewcastle's Matty Longstaff is the third player to score both of his first two Premier League goals in two separate appearances against Manchester United, after Freddie Ljungberg in 1999 and Leighton Baines in 2006.\nScott McTominay's booking for Man Utd after just 24 seconds is the fastest yellow card given in a Premier League match since exact time data has been collected for bookings in the competition (2006-07).\nMan Utd's Anthony Martial has scored in each of his three Premier League appearances against Newcastle at Old Trafford (4 goals in total).\nMarcus Rashford has netted 15 goals this season in 25 appearances in all competitions, already his best haul for the Red Devils in a single campaign.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in action on Saturday. While Manchester United make the short trip to Burnley (19:45 GMT), Newcastle host Everton (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-4 Liverpool: League leaders crush nearest rivals\nLiverpool tightened their grip on the Premier League title race even further as they produced a masterclass to overpower nearest challengers Leicester City at The King Power Stadium to extend their lead to an imposing 13 points.\nJurgen Klopp's side started the match 10 points clear of the Foxes with a game in hand - then produced a performance of such stature and dominance it is almost impossible to see how they will not claim their first title in 30 years.\nLiverpool's slender half-time lead, courtesy of Roberto Firmino's header from a magnificent Trent Alexander-Arnold cross, did not reflect their superiority - but they turned this into a powerful statement victory after the break.\nLeicester were enjoying their best spell when Caglar Soyuncu handled in the 71st minute, and substitute James Milner scored from the spot with his first touch seconds after coming on.\nLiverpool added the flourishes their magnificent display deserved when Alexander-Arnold set up another for Firmino, who scored with a cool finish, before the England defender got his own reward with a thumping right-foot angled finish.\nThe leaders have now dropped only two points from their first 18 games and, having lost only one league game last season, it would take a collapse of unthinkable proportions from an outstanding team to cast this huge advantage aside.\n'Liverpool confirm 30-year wait is coming to an end'\nWe don't feel, think or mention title - Klopp\nReaction from the King Power Stadium\nWhat else happened in the Premier League on Thursday?\nFlawless Liverpool are champions elect\nLiverpool have had too many near misses since their last title win in 1990 to get ahead of themselves - but how can anyone see beyond them this time?\nThey put together a magnificent campaign last season, with their only defeat - by reigning champions Manchester City - proving decisive. But they are in no mood to be denied this time.\nFrom the first whistle here, despite the flashlights and pyrotechnics designed to whip up the home support and team, Liverpool were in control. They could have scored twice inside the first minute through Alexander-Arnold and Sadio Mane.\nLeicester, suffering a dip in form, were pressed out of their stride relentlessly in a performance without a flaw from Liverpool.\nVirgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez were imperious at the back, while full-backs Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson posed a huge attacking threat while being assured at the back.\nLiverpool controlled possession and were always a danger in attack. Leicester may have been in this game until the last 20 minutes, but Klopp's men always had extra gears and went through them to produce a victory of champions.\nLeicester's brutal reality check\nLeicester City have had their season put into perspective by successive defeats against reigning champions Manchester City and now Liverpool.\nIt will be a bitter disappointment after hopes were raised just a couple of weeks ago that Brendan Rodgers' team could yet mount a title challenge to rival their miraculous victory in 2015-16.\nThat will not be happening now. Liverpool emphasised the gulf between the two sides in brutal style here, barely giving the Foxes a chance and subduing the cacophonous pre-match atmosphere within seconds.\nWhile this was a painful night, Rodgers and his players should draw great encouragement from the manner in which they have muscled between the Premier League's two superpowers and put themselves in prime contention for a place in next season's Champions League.\nRodgers looks like he may have to rebuild some confidence, but there has still been much to admire from Leicester City this season - and still plenty to go for in the months ahead.\nMan of the match - Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool)\n'An important day for us' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: \"I am happy about that. I appreciate it because I do not take it for granted and the boys have to do it every three days. We had big chances at the start of the game, did not score with them but stayed in the game and controlled it.\n\"It is was difficult for Leicester to get into the game, both teams felt the intensity of the season but we controlled it more and maybe Leicester were not as aggressive, maybe because of us and our positioning. We scored a first goal, super, super, cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Roberto Firmino can score from that situation.\n\"We struggled a bit with their build-up in the second half and we won the balls immediately and then scored the second goal, then the boys were flying. It looked really nice.\n\"1-0 is not even a result, it was a moment and it could have been difficult when they had set-piece but that is OK, I don't expect a game like this to have a free run because they have so much quality and the season Leicester have had. We were very concentrated and the goals were absolutely nice and an important day for us.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers to Match of the Day: \"We played our last two games against two of arguably the best teams in the history of the Premier League.\n\"We didn't have enough patience in the first half. We never secured the ball which meant we had to defend for long periods really.\n\"The players gave everything. It's a great learning game for us. Credit to Liverpool they played well.\n\"We just didn't have long enough periods with the ball. When you don't against a top team - world champions - it becomes difficult for you.\n\"We are at the halfway point now. We are 19 games in. It is the bigger picture with these guys. We have come a long way in this period. The players have been brilliant and this is another learning game for them, they see the physicality you need to compete.\n\"People were trying to put us in a race with Liverpool but we know where we are.\"\nBiggest gap between first and second - the stats\nThis was the biggest margin of victory in a clash between teams starting the day in the top two of the Premier League since league leaders Manchester City beat Manchester United 6-1 in October 2011\nLiverpool have won five consecutive Boxing Day matches for the first time in their league history, winning those games by an aggregate scoreline of 15-0.\nLeicester have lost a home Premier League game by a four-goal margin for the first time since a 1-6 defeat to Tottenham in May 2017.\nLiverpool have won three consecutive away league matches against Leicester for the first time in their top-flight history.\nRoberto Firmino's second goal against Leicester was the 500th Liverpool have scored under Jurgen Klopp in all competitions.\nLeicester failed to muster a single shot in the first half of a Premier League game for only the second time this season, also failing to do so in their first meeting with Liverpool in October.\nEach of Roberto Firmino's last nine goals in all competitions for Liverpool have come away from Anfield.\nLeicester have won just two of the 11 Premier League games under Brendan Rodgers in which Jamie Vardy has failed to score.\nLiverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold has registered 20 assists in the Premier League since start of last season, more than any other player.\nJames Milner has scored 13 of his 14 penalties for Liverpool in the Premier League, with only Steven Gerrard (32) and Robbie Fowler netting more for the Reds (13).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to West Ham on Saturday, 28 December (17:30 GMT), while Liverpool host Wolves the following afternoon (16:30)."

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-2 Manchester City: Nuno's side seal late win against 10 men\nWolves fought back from two goals down to beat 10-man Manchester City in a memorable and controversial Premier League encounter at Molineux.\nCity looked as though they would make light of the 12th-minute red card shown to goalkeeper Ederson for a foul on Diogo Jota when Raheem Sterling scored twice.\nThe first came after two dramatic interventions by the video assistant referee, one to award City a penalty, then to rule a retake, both of which Rui Patricio saved before Sterling tapped the rebound from the second kick into an empty net.\nBut Wolves, roared on by a passionate crowd, levelled through Adama Traore and Raul Jimenez before Matt Doherty won it with a shot from the edge of the area in the final minute.\nThe result leaves City in third place, 14 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.\nThere were jubilant scenes among the home fans at the final whistle - but the match was overshadowed by an incident which saw objects thrown from the stands as City celebrated their opener.\nIt seems certain that will lead to further action, as a public announcement needed to be made warning supporters that charges would be brought against anyone caught on CCTV committing an offence.\nTitle race is over, says Guardiola\nFans warned after object thrown during match\nAnalysis and reaction from Wolves v Manchester City\nA famous Wolves comeback\nWhen Sterling scored the opener, Manchester City manager Guardiola did not look entirely satisfied that the winger had taken both spot-kicks.\nThere was no complaint about the England international's second goal of the night, though, as he raced on to Kevin de Bruyne's superb through ball and chipped brilliantly past an advancing Rui Patricio.\nIt was the first time Sterling had scored two in a league game since the opening day of the season - and City seemed certain to become only the sixth team in Premier League history to win after having a man sent off in the opening 12 minutes.\nInstead, it provided the backdrop to a Wolves comeback that will live long in the memory.\nGuardiola had brought on Eric Garcia and changed to a three-man defence at the break. It was supposed to repel the twin threat posed by Jimenez's power and Traore's pace. But that defence was breached five minutes after Sterling's second when Traore drove a shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the area.\nIt was the Spaniard's third goal of the season against City - only Eden Hazard and Jamie Vardy had previously scored that many against a Guardiola team in a Premier League season.\nMore was to come. A dreadful loss of possession inside his own area by Benjamin Mendy allowed Traore to cross low for Jimenez, who converted from close range.\nRoared on by a partisan crowd and with tensions on the touchline heightening, Wolves won it - with Doherty providing the climax by drilling home from the edge of the area. He raced away to be greeted by ecstatic team-mates as Nuno Espirito Santo and his coaching staff leapt for joy on the touchline.\nBoth sides must play again within 48 hours of the final whistle at Molineux - a result of the congested festive fixture programme that has brought complaints from both Nuno and Guardiola.\nAn early night for Ederson and Aguero\nIn his pre-match media conference, Guardiola said replacing Sergio Aguero would be one of his hardest tasks as manager.\nThe City boss was referring to the possibility of the striker's exit at the end of his contract in 2021. Little did he know then that he would be replacing Aguero against Wolves after just 12 minutes.\nJust back from a thigh injury, the Argentine was only playing at Molineux because Gabriel Jesus had been ruled out through illness.\nBut when Ederson raced out of his penalty area and clumsily brought Jota down, Aguero was the man substituted to allow second-choice keeper Claudio Bravo to come on.\nAguero looked less than impressed, although he got himself off the pitch far quicker than Ederson.\nThe Brazilian keeper pleaded his case to referee Martin Atkinson, waited for VAR confirmation that the decision was correct, and then hung around some more before eventually heading down the tunnel.\nVAR in the middle of more drama\nIf the VAR intervention for Ederson's dismissal was fairly straightforward, what happened around City's opening goal lit the fuse for furious reactions on the pitch and disgraceful scenes off it that led to the public address announcement warning supporters about their behaviour.\nThe trigger was a tackle on City winger Riyad Mahrez by Wolves defender Leander Dendoncker, which Atkinson ignored as he awarded a goal-kick. VAR had other ideas and decided contact between the pair merited a City penalty.\nSterling took it, Rui Patricio saved to his right and the ball was cleared behind for a corner.\nBut VAR wasn't done. Replays showed Wolves skipper Conor Coady had encroached into the penalty area before making the clearance, so a retake was awarded.\nOn the touchline, Guardiola appeared to be screaming for someone else to take it. The message did not get through. Again Sterling went to Patricio's right. Again the Wolves keeper saved. But this time the rebound rolled straight back to the City man, who tapped home.\nIn front of the home dug-out, Wolves assistant boss Rui Silva was furious, ripping off his gloves in a rage before shouting at fourth official Andre Marriner.\nThe City players celebrated in front of the Jack Hayward Stand. As they did so, missiles were thrown at them, one of which was handed to Atkinson, who in turn, brought it to the touchline for Marriner to pass to Wolves security staff.\nIt was after that the public announcement came, although this just fuelled anti-VAR sentiment among the Wolves fans, who made their feelings clear by chanting \"it's not football any more\".\nFans warned after objects thrown at Molineux\nMan of the match - Matt Doherty (Wolves)\nWhy Wolves can never be written off - the key stats\nWolves have won more points from losing positions than any other side in the Premier League this season (14).\nManchester City had just 37.8% possession versus Wolves - the lowest figure recorded by a side managed by Pep Guardiola in top-flight history.\nCity lost a Premier League game having led by two or more goals for the first time since April 2018, when they were beaten 3-2 at home by Manchester United. Only Tottenham (eight) and West Ham (six) have lost more games in Premier League history having led by two or more goals than Manchester City (five), with two of those defeats coming under Pep Guardiola.\nWolves have completed their first league double over Manchester City for the first time since 1999-2000 in the second tier, and for the first time in the top-flight since 1960-61.\nAdama Traore is only the third player to score three goals in a single Premier League season against Guardiola's Manchester City, following Eden Hazard and Jamie Vardy (both in 2016-17).\nOf all the players with more than one top-flight goal to their name, Traore is the only man ever to have scored more than half of his Premier League goals against the reigning champions. Three of his five top-flight strikes have come against the champions, a ratio of 60%.\nManchester City's Raheem Sterling has scored more goals in all competitions this season than any other Premier League player (20).\nWolves' Raul Jimenez has been directly involved in 26 goals in all competitions this season (17 goals, nine assists) - more than any other Premier League player.\nEderson became just the second Manchester City goalkeeper to be sent off in the Premier League, after Andy Dibble against QPR in October 1994.\nNo player has provided more assists in Europe's big five leagues this season than Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne (11).\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides have less than 48 hours to prepare for their next Premier League fixture in the busy Christmas period.\nWolves go to Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday (16:30 GMT), with Manchester City hosting Sheffield United on the same day (18:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Brighton 2-0 Bournemouth: Alireza Jahanbakhsh scores in Seagulls win\nAlireza Jahanbakhsh said it was \"an emotional moment\" to score his first goal for Brighton as they beat relegation rivals Bournemouth in the Premier League.\nThe Iran winger, making his 27th appearance for the club, blasted home from 16 yards after Neal Maupay's lay-off.\nHe appeared close to tears afterwards with even goalkeeper Mat Ryan running forward to join in the jubilant celebrations.\n\"I have been waiting for this time for a long time,\" he told BBC Sport after scoring in his first Premier League start of the season. \"Before the match I had a great feeling and I'm glad to help us win the game.\"\nDan Burn had a second goal ruled out by the video assistant referee for a marginal offside several phases of play before he smashed home.\nAnd Yves Bissouma struck the post as Brighton - not for the first time this season - struggled to get a second goal to kill the game off.\nBut the clinching strike came as Aaron Mooy controlled Leandro Trossard's cross before firing in his first Seagulls goal.\nBournemouth only had two shots on target, with one of those coming from Junior Stanislas on his return from eight months out with a knee injury.\nGraham Potter's Brighton move three points above Bournemouth, with both clubs on a similar run of form - one win in eight before this game - and only previously separated on goals scored.\nFollow reaction and all of Saturday's games here\nJahanbakhsh finally ends goal drought\nJahanbakhsh's time in England has not gone to plan. There were high hopes for him when he joined Brighton 18 months ago, having just won the Dutch golden boot with AZ Alkmaar with 21 goals before playing at the World Cup for Iran.\nBut he failed to score in 25 appearances last campaign and was making his first Premier League start of the season against Bournemouth in one of seven changes from their Boxing Day defeat by Tottenham.\nThe 26-year-old spoke recently about wanting to work hard to get into the team\n, external\ndespite rumours of a January departure - and started confidently with a good first-minute cross into the box.\nHis goal - a strike which could kickstart his English career - came soon after.\nHe made no mistake with his 38th shot for the club, rifling an effort into the bottom corner after good play by Maupay to net Brighton's quickest Premier League goal.\n\"I had ups and downs last year, trying to settle,\" Jahanbakhsh said. \"This season it felt good with the new manager. He wanted to use different players, but I've been doing well in training and was ready for my chance.\n\"It took longer than I expected.\"\nPotter said: \"It was a great moment for everyone in the stadium, especially Ali. He deserves it. He worked away every day, with exemplary behaviour. We all wanted him to contribute and he did that today.\"\nBrighton dominated possession like they usually do and created the better chances, with Maupay driving two shots over the bar before half-time.\nBurn thought he had scored his first goal for the club when he swivelled and fired home a shot on the bounce. But the VAR spotted Burn was offside by millimetres when Mooy had crossed in his free-kick - even though the ball had bobbled around the box with several players on both sides getting a touch before it reached Burn.\nMooy then went close from 25 yards before Bissouma ran from the centre circle before smashing a shot off the post.\nThe second goal that Potter's side deserved eventually came, a classy finish by Mooy, who took down Trossard's cross on his chest before stepping past Chris Mepham and stroking a shot home.\nBrighton's first home win and first clean sheet in the league since 2 November takes them up to 13th - albeit before the rest of the weekend's games.\nStruggles ahead for Bournemouth?\nBournemouth seem to do this every year and always escape, terrible runs of form in between excellent bursts with enough points to keep them safe. But what if the good run does not come?\nThey were seventh after beating Manchester United on 2 November but have won once in nine games since, and are two points above the relegation zone.\nLike Brighton they made plenty of changes - five from the 1-1 draw against Arsenal on 26 December. But they were slow out of the blocks and trailed to Jahanbakhsh's early strike.\nThey could have equalised after seven minutes, when King ran in on goal but fired straight at Ryan. That was their best chance of the game.\nStanislas looked rusty on his first appearance since April, giving away possession needlessly at one stage to start a Brighton attack, although he was the only other Bournemouth player to test Ryan.\nDominic Solanke is soon approaching the year anniversary of his \u00a319m move from Liverpool but has yet to score for the club. He had a good chance to get a shot away but took too much time and was well tackled by Lewis Dunk.\nBournemouth's injury problems also increased. King and Jack Stacey went off with suspected hamstring injuries, with the Cherries having to play the final 10 minutes a man down having used all their substitutes.\n\"With a small squad the Christmas period is the ultimate test and you need to rotate players,\" said boss Eddie Howe. \"It looks like we've lost Joshua King and Jack Stacey so it is not a good day.\n\"The games come thick and fast and this was one of the games we needed to get something and we didn't. We need to learn our lessons.\n\"The strength of the squad has been knocked and that allows a feeling of feeling sorry for yourself if you don't get the results you want. But we have to go again, find the inner strength and keep going.\"\nMan of the match - Aaron Mooy\nMatch stats - Brighton end long wait for win over Bournemouth\nThis was Brighton's first league win over Bournemouth since a 3-2 win at the old Withdean Stadium in League One on New Year's Day 2008.\nBrighton have won four of their last seven Premier League home games (D1 L2), as many as they had won in their previous 18 at the Amex Stadium.\nSince the start of the 2015-16 season, only Watford (50) have lost more Premier League away games than Bournemouth (47).\nOnly Liverpool (16) have had more different goalscorers in the Premier League this season than Brighton (11).\nBrighton's Alireza Jahanbakhsh became the third Iranian player to score in Premier League history (also Andranik Teymourian and Ashkan Dejagah).\nJahanbakhsh netted his first goal in 1552 minutes of action in all competitions since his debut for the Seagulls in August 2018.\nBrighton's Aaron Mooy ended a run of 17 Premier League appearances without a goal.\nNeal Maupay has been directly involved in more Premier League goals this season than any other Brighton player (seven goals, one assist).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton host Chelsea on New Year's Day (12:30 GMT), with Bournemouth going to West Ham five hours later."

        "article_text": "Newcastle 1-2 Everton: 'Dominic Calvert-Lewin can become a top striker'\nDominic Calvert-Lewin can become one of the best strikers in Europe, says manager Carlo Ancelotti after his double helped Everton to victory at Newcastle.\nThe 22-year-old scored the only goal against Burnley on Boxing Day to give the Italian the perfect start to his reign and again produced a brilliant display in attack.\n\"He is a fantastic striker, in my opinion - fantastic with the head, clever in the box and sharp,\" said Ancelotti of the English forward, who now has 10 goals for the Toffees this season.\n\"I think he is going to be at the top in England and in Europe. He has all the qualities to be a top striker.\"\nCalvert-Lewin's opener was a classic poacher's goal - poking home after Gylfi Sigurdsson's deflected strike fortuitously arrived in front of him.\nNewcastle improved and after Miguel Almiron struck the post, they equalised when Fabian Schar fired home a volley from Andy Carroll's nod-down.\nBut six minutes after setting up the equaliser, Carroll's mistake led to Everton's winner.\nTheo Walcott dispossessed the striker and played a pass out wide to Richarlison. The Brazilian sped down the right and delivered an excellent low cross for Calvert-Lewin, who slid in and scrambled home.\nThe Toffees move above the Magpies into 10th, with their opponents - level on 25 points - now down in 11th.\nFollow Saturday's Premier League reaction\nRelive how Everton won at Newcastle\nAncelotti brings the best out of young attack\nWhatever Italian Ancelotti has said to the Everton attack in the short time he has spent with them appears to have had a positive effect.\nMoise Kean, in particular, looks a player reborn. The 19-year-old striker joined from Juventus in a \u00a327.5m deal last summer, but has yet to prove his worth to Toffees fans. At St James' Park he provided a glimpse of what he could achieve.\nThe Italian had five efforts on goal and three on target, including one that tested the reflexes of keeper Martin Dubravka.\nHis link-up play was also exceptional - Walcott should have tested the Newcastle goal after he was found by Kean's ball from the right.\nHis partner in attack, Calvert-Lewin, has been scoring in clusters this season and under his new manager has hit form once more.\nIt is now five goals in his past five in the Premier League - as many as in previous 28. Perhaps more pertinently for Ancelotti and the Everton fans, is that the nine shots on target was the most in a league away game this season. The last time the Toffees managed more on the road was at Swansea in 2011.\nCarroll impresses for Magpies\nThis was a second successive defeat for Newcastle and their first at home since August, but Magpies fans need not worry too much.\nWhat the statistics do not show is Carroll's effectiveness in attack, Jetro Willems' consistency as an attacking full-back and Almiron's improvement.\nCarroll, who re-signed on a free transfer last summer, was brilliant as the main target man, alongside Joelinton.\nHe did not find the net on Saturday but gave Mason Holgate and Michael Keane a tough workout at the back - particularly from set-pieces.\nAnd it was Carroll's assist from a free-kick - his third in his past five Premier League games - that led to Schar's equaliser.\nThe Magpies produced 20 efforts but only five on target - Joelinton has not worked out so far for manager Steve Bruce so perhaps a new striker in January would improve those stats.\nMan of the match - Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\n'Let's get ready for the second half of the season' - reaction\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce: \"I don't think we deserved to get beaten today. It was important we didn't lose the match and unfortunately we have, which is the disappointing thing.\n\"We're halfway and it's the first time we've suffered back-to-back defeats since August. So let's dust ourselves down and get ready for Wednesday and the second half of the season.\"\nShot feast at St James' - the stats\nEverton have won five of their past seven Premier League away games against Newcastle. In total, they've only won away at West Ham (11) more than they have against the Magpies in the competition (eight)\nCalvert-Lewin is the first Everton player to score the winning goal in successive Premier League games - it was last achieved in the top flight by Tony Cottee in May 1991.\nAncelotti recorded his 50th win in his 78th Premier League match - making him the fifth fastest manager to reach this milestone in the competition.\nNewcastle suffered their first home league defeat since the opening weekend (1-0 v Arsenal), ending a run of eight games without a loss at St James' Park.\nEverton had nine shots on target in this match, their most in a Premier League away game since May (also nine v Spurs).\nThere were 42 shots in this match (20 for Newcastle, 22 for Everton), the third highest tally in a single Premier League game this season (Aston Villa v Brighton - 44, Norwich v Aston Villa - 43).\nTen of Newcastle's 20 Premier League goals this season have been scored by defenders (50%), both a competition-high total and ratio this term.\nCalvert-Lewin is Everton's top Premier League goalscorer this season with eight goals - it is also the most the Englishman has scored in a single top-flight campaign.\nSchar scored his sixth Premier League goal for Newcastle in 2019 - no current player at the Magpies netted more this calendar year.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle host Leicester on New Year's Day (15:00 GMT) and Everton are at Manchester City on the same day (17:30)."

England defender Tyrone Mings was missing for the fifth successive game with a hamstring injury and Villa have not kept a clean sheet away from home in the Premier League since January 2016.\nWith problems mounting up, fans will be hoping Smith can land some of his targets in the January transfer window.\nWatford improving under Pearson\nWatford have had a chaotic season, with managers coming and going, an 8-0 thrashing at Manchester City and a long relegation battle.\nYet their polished performance against troubled Villa provided further evidence things are changing for the better.\nThe Hornets look refreshed and reborn under Pearson.\nHaving secured just one top-flight win in 16 games before the arrival of the former Leicester City boss earlier this month, Watford have since taken seven points from four games.\nWhile Deeney will get the plaudits for his two goals, Sarr was outstanding, using his pace to torment Villa's defence and score his side's third goal.\nDespite Mariappa's dismissal - his first in 158 top-flight appearances - they played with confidence and belief against Villa, which suggests they have an appetite for the battle ahead.\nMan of the match - Ismaila Sarr (Watford)\n'To extend lead with 10 men is positive' - what they said\nWatford manager Nigel Pearson: \"We couldn't afford to lose. Must-win is something I'm not overly keen on putting into the players yet. The important thing is to get the performance right. We showed good intensity. We showed incredible unity on the pitch and bench. We have to make sure that remains high on our agenda - to keep the players together.\n\"I thought in the first half we were pretty dominant. We expected Villa to improve in the second half and to a certain extent they did. To extend the lead with 10 men is something positive.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"I read the players the riot act at half-time. We weren't good enough. We lost the game in the first half. We created the best chance before the break, Wesley should probably score.\n\"Their work-rate was better than ours, which is the biggest disappointment. In the second half, we started to get on the front foot but didn't create chances.\n\"When the other team go down to 10 men and the score is 1-0, you've got a chance but unfortunately other incidents happened and they scored a second and third.\"\nVilla's terrible away record - the stats\nAston Villa have won fewer points on the road than any other side in the Premier League this season - four points from a possible 30.\nWatford scored three goals or more in a Premier League game for the first time since April.\nSince the start of the 2015-16 season, Watford have been shown more red cards than any other Premier League team (18).\nWatford striker Troy Deeney has scored five goals in three league appearances against Aston Villa, with four of those coming at Vicarage Road.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in action on New Year's Day with Watford hosting in-form Wolves (15:00 GMT) and Aston Villa away at Burnley (12:30)."

We had the much bigger chances today and it was a good save from Moussa Djenepo.\n\"We knew it was a difficult game against this opponent when you're 1-0 down, because they sit deep.

But their equaliser was a technical mistake, it happens in football and it gave them a new lease of life.\"\nOn transfers: \"We talk about it, the chairman and Doug Freedman.

Joint owners David Gold and David Sullivan announced Pellegrini's departure shortly after the final whistle, clearly unwilling to risk a performance of similar ineptitude against relegation rivals Bournemouth on New Year's Day.\nWest Ham stand-in captain Declan Rice, speaking after the game, said the frustration of the squad was \"10 out of 10\", the England midfielder blaming a lack of confidence for his side's slide from fifth in the table at the end of September to the cusp of the bottom three.\n\"People were talking about us being top six contenders and now we're so far away,\" said the 20-year-old.\n\"Fans are coming to the game pretty much not wanting to come. We need to pick up fast.\"\nLeicester show their strength in depth\nAlthough bruising defeats by Manchester City and Liverpool have seemingly ended Leicester's title challenge, the Foxes are a strong bet to finish in the top four and earn a return to the Champions League next season.\nMost pleasing for manager Brendan Rodgers was how the decision to make sweeping changes paid off.\nRodgers had been clear that he would rest players in the middle of a hectic Christmas period of four league matches in 12 days, with the likes of striker Jamie Vardy - who stayed at home after his wife Rebekah gave birth - midfielder James Maddison and right-back Ricardo Pereira all left out.\nIn truth it mattered little as the Foxes swept aside the Hammers to end a run of three games without a win.\nThe visitors played with an air of confidence missing from their opponents as they shaded possession, creating a number of good opportunities as the pace and movement of Gray, Perez and Iheanacho constantly caused problems.\nThe only downside was their inability to make more of the chances they created.\n\"The players that came in were absolutely fantastic, we were very good in moments in the game,\" Rodgers said.\n\"The boys were fantastic in that mentality and spirit.\n\"At this level you have to be on the edge and that's how we play, we have to have that edge and in order to have that today, away from home, we needed energy.\n\"The players that came in have been training brilliantly and they got their rewards today.\"\nHammers honour Peters in emotional tribute\nBefore the game West Ham paid tribute to legendary midfielder Martin Peters, who died aged 76 last week.\nThe Hammers celebrated the life of one of their finest players, who also starred in England's 1966 World Cup victory, with a minute's applause and a video montage of his finest moments.\nFormer Hammers team-mate Sir Geoff Hurst was close to tears after celebrating Peters' life in a speech, before carrying a floral tribute replicating Peters' shirt out to the centre spot alongside Peters' daughter Leeann.\nBoth sets of players led the minute's applause at an emotional London Stadium where fans also sang Peters' name, but the home side could not go on to earn a fitting result in his honour.\nMan of the match - Demarai Gray (Leicester)\nLeicester love playing away - the stats\nOnly Liverpool (eight) have won more Premier League away games than Leicester this season (six)\nWest Ham have won fewer points at home than any other Premier League side this season (seven)\nThe Hammers have already lost as many home games this term as they did in both 2017-18 and 2018-19 (six)\nLeicester made nine changes to their starting XI from their last Premier League match, the most changes they've ever made between games in the competition\nLeicester have failed to convert 28.8% of their Premier League penalties (19/66) - of all sides to take at least 50 spot-kicks in the competition only Aston Villa (33.3%), Blackburn (30.1%) and Middlesbrough (29.3%) have failed to score a higher share, with Demerai Gray tonight the latest to miss for the Foxes.\nGray became the third different Leicester player to both score and miss a penalty in the same Premier League match, after Jamie Vardy and Graham Fenton\nLeicester's Kelechi Iheanacho has been directly involved in five goals in his last four Premier League games (three goals, two2 assists), more than he had been in his previous 30 for the Foxes (four)\nWhat's next?\nAnother short turnaround for both teams with more Premier League matches taking place on New Year's Day.\nThe Hammers have another huge home game when they host Bournemouth, who are one place and one point above them, at 17:30 GMT.\nLeicester again go on the road, travelling up to Newcastle for a 15:00 kick-off."

        "article_text": "Norwich City 2-2 Tottenham: Harry Kane penalty earns Spurs a point\nHarry Kane struck a late penalty to earn Tottenham a point at Carrow Road and deny Norwich a first Premier League victory in seven matches.\nMario Vrancic opened the scoring with his first Premier League goal for the Canaries before they were denied a second when Teemu Pukki's goal was ruled out for a marginal offside by the video assistant referee (VAR).\nSpurs improved after the interval and Christian Eriksen drew them level with a stunning free-kick but Norwich retook the lead when Serge Aurier put through his own net.\nThe visitors had their chances and Dele Alli's neat finish was ruled out for offside, before Kane drew Christoph Zimmermann into a lunging challenge inside the area.\nRelive the action as it happened\nThe England striker sent Tim Krul the wrong way from the spot to secure a point for the north London side.\nNorwich remain bottom of the table and six points from safety, while Spurs are up to fifth, two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea who have a game in hand.\nStylish Canaries fall short again\nNorwich last won in the Premier League on 23 November, but they started brilliantly against Jose Mourinho's Spurs.\nThey played with attacking intent from the opening exchanges as Vrancic rolled the exciting Onel Hernandez through on goal, only for Paulo Gazzaniga to sprint off his line to collect the loose ball.\nThat set the tone and Daniel Farke's side pressed their visitors high up the field. When Juan Foyth hesitated and lost possession deep in his own half, Vrancic carried the ball with urgency before firing past Gazzaniga with a smart finish.\nThen came a moment of controversy as Vrancic turned provider to fire a long ball onto the chest of Pukki, who held off Jan Vertonghen to slide the ball into the net, only for the goal to be ruled out.\nThe Finnish striker appeared to come back onside before the ball was played over the unconvincing Spurs defence, but VAR adjudged his right arm to be offside.\nSpurs hit back after the interval but Farke's men rode the storm and retook the lead as Pukki continued to cause confusion, his effort deflecting from Toby Alderweireld onto Aurier and into the Spurs' net.\nAs Spurs searched for the equaliser, the hosts demonstrated a steely mentality and dived into tackles - but ultimately did so once too often. Zimmermann lunged into a tired-looking tackle to concede the penalty and Kane punished Norwich.\nPoints against the so-called 'big six' must be built on if the Canaries are to become the first side bottom of the Premier League at the turn of the year to overcome a six-point deficit from safety and survive.\nKane and Erisken demonstrate their quality\nWhen Mourinho took the Spurs job he spoke about the \"quality\" he was inheriting from Mauricio Pochettino, and Kane is exactly the type of player the Portuguese was referring to.\nThe Spurs and England captain had an ineffective first half despite latching onto a long ball from Alderweireld and firing at Krul from close range.\nBut when Spurs found themselves a goal behind for the second time in the match, Kane came alive in the penalty area and dragged his team level.\nThe striker enticed the challenge from Zimmermann before checking back on his left and winning the spot-kick, which he subsequently converted with ease.\nAnother player Mourinho would have been keen to work with on his arrival at the club is Eriksen, and the midfielder's second-half performance proved exactly why.\nThere has been plenty of speculation over the Dane's future, with his contract due to expire at the end of the season. Making his first league start under Mourinho, he struck his free-kick with aplomb to draw the visitors level.\nEriksen had more touches of the ball (118) and more shots (four) than any other player and he was crucial to the visitors regaining a foothold in the game after going behind for a second time.\nIf Mourinho can persuade the midfielder his future is best served under him at Spurs, he may be the difference between securing Champions League football for next season or missing out altogether.\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen (Tottenham)\n'The same defensive mistakes' - what they said\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho told Sky Sports: \"I think the same defensive mistakes we made in the first half, we made in the second half. This is being a little bit of our history.\n\"We conceded two very bad goals. Our defensive mistakes are match after match.\n\"I have lots of work to do but it has been difficult because I always say you have to try and hide your fragilities. We have to improve defensively because there are too many individual mistakes. That's very frustrating because we play well and cannot be more offensive than we were in the second half.\n\"Norwich defended with their souls and their lives.\"\nOn Christian Eriksen's future: \"I don't want to speak about it. We are so open with one another. We keep it to ourselves. Obviously I share it with my boss. But it's just between us. The only thing I can say is he is trying to help the team and I am happy with his man of the match.\"\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke told Match of the Day: \"Over the course of the 90 minutes, a draw was a fair outcome and a good point for us.\"\nOn VAR: \"I don't want to complain too much about this topic. My understanding is that VAR should make the game more fair. My gut feeling [after Pukki's goal] was that we would find a situation where it was offside.\n\"Perhaps they found a part of his shoulder that was not onside. In my eyes, VAR doesn't make the game more fair in this situation. The striker should be given the advantage. Being 2-0 up at half-time would have changed the game. It was a crucial situation.\n\"It's a good start to the second half of the season and hopefully we can add many more points.\"\nSpurs struggle against Canaries again - the stats\nNorwich City have avoided defeat in three of their past four home games against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League (W1 D2 L1) after losing four of their first five against them in the competition (D1).\nTottenham Hotspur have scored four own goals in the league in 2019 - the most in a Premier League calendar year for the club.\nOnly Alan Shearer (145) and Sergio Aguero (138) have scored more Premier League goals in their first 200 appearances in the competition than Harry Kane (136).\nKane has scored 20 penalties for Tottenham in the Premier League - more than any other player for the club.\nChristian Eriksen has scored more goals from outside the box (23) and more direct free kicks (eight) than any other player since his Premier League debut for Tottenham.\nEmiliano Buendia has assisted six goals for Norwich City this season; double that of any other player for the Canaries - furthermore, only Kevin de Bruyne (70) has created more chances than Buendia (57).\nNorwich City's Mario Vrancic is the fourth Bosnian player to score in the Premier League after Edin Dzeko, Sead Kolasinac and Asmir Begovic.\nWhat's next?\nNorwich host Crystal Palace on New Year's Day (17:30 GMT), while Tottenham travel to Southampton slightly earlier on the same day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-2 Manchester United: Red Devils up to fifth with victory\nAnthony Martial and Marcus Rashford were on target as Manchester United defeated Burnley at Turf Moor to move within a point of the Premier League's top four.\nAfter his brace against Newcastle on Boxing Day, Martial tapped home his 10th of the season from close range a minute before the break after Andreas Pereira had robbed Charlie Taylor and crossed superbly from the right. Rashford then raced clear in stoppage time to seal a deserved win.\nRashford had earlier hit the post and Martial had a second-half effort ruled out.\nAlthough Burnley sparked briefly after the interval and David de Gea needed to make a good save to deny Phil Bardsley, Burnley never threatened to prevent United ending their 14-game run in the league without keeping a clean sheet.\nUnited have now taken 13 points from their last six games and are up to fifth in the table, although that could change on Sunday when Wolves play Sheffield United.\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nVAR: 'Armpit offsides' strike again\nDefence beats attack\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer remains confident United can finish in the top four despite their dismal form away from Old Trafford that brought them to Turf Moor with nine points from nine games on their travels.\nApart from August, they have suffered one defeat a month, at West Ham, Newcastle, Bournemouth and most recently Watford, who at that point were bottom of the table.\nTheir problem is clear. United had gone 14 Premier League games without keeping a clean sheet, having kept just two all season, and played 14 away games across two seasons without keeping the opposition out.\nYet Burnley had a monkey of their own to get off their back.\nApart from Robbie Blake's match-winner in 2009, they had not scored a goal against United at Turf Moor since 1969.\nIt meant something had to give in a second half which was, thankfully, far more entertaining than the first.\nMartial had a goal disallowed by referee Mike Dean rather than VAR after shoving James Tarkowski in the back. At the other end, Jeff Hendrick screwed a good shooting chance way wide to hoots of derision from the home support.\nDe Gea saved low to his right to deny Bardsley a goal against his former club but though they pressed, Burnley never truly looked like equalising and Rashford wrapped up the win with his 17th goal of the season and ninth in 11 games.\nInconsistent Martial\nIt is maybe no surprise a Martial goal usually means a Manchester United win.\nHe has now scored in nine games across all competitions, and his side have been victorious on eight occasions, the odd one out a 1-1 draw at Wolves in August.\nSolskjaer has been working on Martial's anticipation, believing it will net him an extra half a dozen 'simple' goals a season.\nThe United boss will have been delighted with this latest effort therefore, almost as much as he would with Pereira, who showed admirable awareness to produce a quick cross for his team-mate and resist the obvious temptation to run into the space he created by robbing Taylor.\nYet Martial remains an enigma. With victory still in the balance, he found himself running one-on-one with Burnley keeper Nick Pope. Jesse Lingard was lambasted against Everton this month when, in a very similar position, he chipped the opportunity way over the bar.\nMartial did not even manage that. Instead he ran wide, stopped, then turned away from goal to try and set up a team-mate, which met with total failure.\nHad Burnley found an equaliser in the final minutes, Martial's error would have been costly. As it was, United held on.\nSo near, yet so far for Hart\nUntil Martial's goal, the first half was not the greatest Premier League advert.\nFormer United defender Bardsley cleared a close range shot by Martial off the line after the Frenchman had reacted to a blocked Daniel James effort but there was almost as much interest in the Burnley bench as their performance.\nWhen goalkeeper Nick Pope turned his ankle six minutes before the break, the crowd were treated to the sight of Joe Hart warming up in anticipation of his first Premier League appearance since Boxing Day last year, a 5-1 home hammering by Everton.\nIt hardly seems believable Hart is only 32 and won the last of his 75 England caps in November 2017.\nHart returned to the bench alongside another forgotten man, Danny Drinkwater, but no sooner had the teams entered the tunnel than Hart reappeared for a warm-up.\nIt seemed his long wait for a top-flight return was at an end. But after a thorough 15-minute workout, Hart went back to the dugout as Pope unexpectedly returned.\nA rare clean sheet on the road - the best of the stats\nManchester United are unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League games against Burnley (W6, D4), their only loss coming in their first meeting in August 2009.\nBurnley have won just one of their last 29 Premier League games against 'big six' opponents (D6, L22). The Clarets are without a win in their last 10, losing their last eight.\nUnited have kept an away clean sheet in the Premier League for the first time since February 2019, ending a run of 14 games without a shutout on the road.\nBurnley are without a Premier League clean sheet against 'big six' opposition in each of their last 38 matches, last stopping their opponents from scoring in October 2016, a 0-0 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford.\nManchester United are one of just three sides that Sean Dyche has failed to win against in the top flight alongside Arsenal (9) and Sheffield United (1). The Burnley manager has drawn four and lost five against the Red Devils.\nMarcus Rashford has 16 goal involvements in 20 Premier League games this season (12 goals, 4 assists), as many as he had in 33 games in the competition last term (10 goals, 6 assists).\nAnthony Martial has scored more Premier League goals (41) and had more goal involvements (61) than any other Manchester United player since his debut in September 2015.\nMartial has been directly involved in 10 goals in his 13 Premier League starts this season.\nMan of the match - Andreas Pereira\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host relegation strugglers Aston Villa at Turf Moor on Wednesday, 1 January (12:30 GMT) in their next Premier League match, before welcoming Peterborough United in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 4 January (12:31).\nManchester United travel to Emirates Stadium to face old rivals Arsenal in the league on Wednesday (20:00) before a trip to Wolves in the FA Cup, also on Saturday (17:31)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-2 Chelsea: Mikel Arteta loses first home game as Gunners boss\nChelsea overcame an \"awful\" start, said boss Frank Lampard, as they staged a stunning late comeback to snatch victory and wreck Mikel Arteta's return to Emirates Stadium as Arsenal manager.\nArteta, taking charge of his first home game since succeeding the sacked Unai Emery, looked on course for three important points after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's early header put the Gunners in front.\nChelsea, with Lampard making a first-half tactical switch when he introduced Jorginho for the struggling Emerson, were gifted an equaliser seven minutes from time when goalkeeper Bernd Leno hopelessly misjudged Mason Mount's free-kick to leave the substitute with a simple finish.\nArsenal were doubly frustrated because Jorginho was fortunate to escape a second yellow card earlier for a cynical foul on Lucas Torreira - but Arteta's home bow was to get even more painful.\nChelsea struck again with three minutes of normal time left, Tammy Abraham turning Arsenal substitute Shkodran Mustafi far too easily in the area to beat Leno and complete the smash-and-grab raid.\n\"We were so awful for the first 30 minutes; slow, lethargic, nervous,\" Lampard told BBC Sport.\n\"We gave Arsenal everything they wanted. We made the change early, felt it had to be done, and second half we dominated.\n\"You can accept a miss-pass but you can't accept lethargy in a London derby. The players were told that and they delivered. The second half was nothing to do with tactics, it was all to do with spirit and desire.\"\nArsenal, who lost defender Calum Chambers to injury in the first half, will start 2020 11 points behind fourth-placed Chelsea and without a Premier League home win since 6 October.\nIt is the first time they have lost four consecutive home matches in all competitions since December 1959.\nPlenty of promise despite defeat for Arteta - Keown analysis\n'Arteta's Arsenal homecoming transformed into wake'\nReaction from Emirates Stadium and Sunday's Premier League games\nArteta learning the hard way\nArteta understandably looked downcast as he and his players took sympathetic applause from their fans after they were left stunned by Chelsea's late surge.\nFor the first half-hour Arsenal dominated a desperately poor Chelsea and there was much to encourage everyone inside a vibrant Emirates Stadium as the new era kicked into life.\nThe Gunners, however, ran out of steam towards the end of the first half as Chelsea, helped by Lampard removing Emerson and sending on Jorginho, started to dominate and continued to do so after the break.\nArsenal were resilient but were hanging on and ultimately it was a calamitous individual error and familiar defensive fragility that was to prove their undoing.\nLeno's rush of blood left Jorginho with the easiest of finishes, although Arsenal certainly had a case to complain about his continued presence on the pitch after escaping that second yellow card.\nAnd then Mustafi, on for the injured Chambers, was at fault when he allowed Abraham far too much time to control, turn and score the winner.\nArteta will have seen some good signs but ultimately old faults let Arsenal down. There is going to be no quick fix.\nLampard finds a way as Chelsea win\nChelsea boss Lampard clearly felt he got his team selection wrong, as he ditched his three-man central defence and introduced Jorginho after 34 minutes - and deserves great credit for seeing it was not working and putting it right.\nIt did improve Chelsea but in reality they could not get any worse in a feisty London derby which saw nine players booked.\nThey took complete control of possession and territory after the break, with Lampard's subsequent substitutions also having an impact.\nTeenager Tariq Lamptey was a lively presence down Chelsea's right flank on his Premier League debut after replacing Fikayo Tomori while Callum Hudson-Odoi did well when he came on for Matteo Kovacic.\nLampard looked like he was going to be frustrated by Chelsea's lack of end product once more but they were given that late lifeline by Leno's dreadful error as well as the generosity of referee Craig Pawson in allowing Jorginho to stay on.\nAbraham completed the comeback for a dramatic win.\nThere is a rollercoaster nature to this Chelsea side, as proved by their results, a home defeat by Southampton sandwiched in between wins at Tottenham and Arsenal, but they got the job done to cement their place in the Premier League's top four.\nMan of the match - Jorginho (Chelsea)\n'It was very cruel' - Arteta reaction\nArsenal head coach Mikel Arteta: \"It was very cruel the way we lost it, in the first half we saw a lot of positives and saw what we are trying to implement. But the way we conceded was disappointing.\n\"It was clear why it was disappointing, I don't need to say any more.\n\"Our reaction was right, we were doing the right things, it is hard to dominate all periods of the game against this team. We started to defend too deep and our energy levels are in a different place to Chelsea's.\n\"We need to sustain those periods for longer periods in the game and against top sides. Individual errors cost you games but I can't fault the effort, commitment and for putting in place what we practised.\"\nLeno's costly errors - the stats\nChelsea are the first team to win five away Premier League games against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium.\nSince his Premier League debut in February 2018, Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored 45 league goals - 22 more than any other Gunners player in that time.\nArsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno has made more errors leading to goals than any other Premier League player since August 2018 (seven).\nOnly Manchester City's Raheem Sterling and Leicester City's Jamie Vardy (nine each) have scored more away Premier League goals than Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham (eight) this season.\nChelsea became the first team to come from behind at half-time to win away at Arsenal in the league since Tottenham in November 2010.\nThere were nine yellow cards in this match, the most in a Premier League game this season and most since February, when there were nine in Bournemouth's game against Wolves.\nAfter taking the lead in the 13th minute, Arsenal had just three shots, and none on target.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal have another heavyweight home game on New Year's Day when Manchester United visit Emirates Stadium (20:00 GMT) while Chelsea are away at Brighton on the same day (12:30 GMT)."

It is disappointing that we are stood here talking about VAR rather than the game and the way Wolves played,\" former Reds trainee Coady said.\nThe difference a decade makes\nIt seems like it was only yesterday Liverpool appointed Roy Hodgson as manager. In fact it was 2010.\nHodgson would last just six months, having made eight signings - Milan Jovanovic, Joe Cole and Paul Konchesky among them - who all failed to impress at Liverpool.\nThe Reds went on to finish sixth - 22 points behind champions Manchester United. They also lost to League Two Northampton in the League Cup and did not make it past the last 16 of the Europa League.\nFast forward 10 years and Liverpool are sporting the Fifa Champions badge on their shirts for one game in the Premier League after winning the Club World Cup in Qatar earlier this month.\nFans welcomed their players on to the pitch against Wolves with a rendition of \"We are the champions... of the world\".\nReigning European champions, they already have the Premier League trophy well within their sights and it would take an almighty collapse for Liverpool to lose their position at the top of the table in the second half of the season.\nPositives for Wolves despite the manner of defeat\nWolves drop to eighth place following the defeat at Anfield but they will be very happy at the halfway mark.\nA comeback victory over Manchester City and the 4-0 thrashing over Besiktas in the Europa League were big highlights in December but they gave the league leaders a run for their money on Sunday despite playing their second fixture in 43 hours.\nJota had chances to equalise in the second half as Wolves piled the pressure on and he was not alone.\nRaul Jimenez and Adama Traore, both introduced as second-half substitutes, failed to hit the target from good positions, while Ruben Vinagre thumped a strike over from close range in stoppage time.\nThe positivity they showed throughout the game will have pleased boss Nuno Espirito Santo, who continues to work wonders with a small but talented squad.\nWolves' ultimate goal should be to secure European football for another season and they are on course to achieve that in the new year.\nMan of the match - Diogo Jota (Wolves)\n'Football is like life' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a tough test and rightly so. Wolves are used to a tough rhythm of games.\n\"First half we were good and controlled the game, but I can imagine Wolves were not happy with the VAR decisions. However, the momentum went with them after that moment. We had nothing to do with the decisions.\n\"The second half they changed a bit. We were not fresh enough in mind to react. Alisson wanted to make the game quick, and nobody else wants to it to be! Football is like life. Sometimes you are 100% ready and sometimes not. It was a big fight.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It was a tough game. First half Liverpool was strong. We stayed in the game, stayed organised and always the danger with the quality. In the second half we had good spells and created a lot of chances.\n\"We finished strongly.

We make mistakes and I believe he made one too,\" Wilder told BBC Sport.\n\"It happened that quick and I thought he could have been helped by his colleagues a little bit.\n\"We talk about the new rule where if the referee touches the ball then he has to blow his whistle and stop play, so surely if he is in the way and hinders us then he has to make a sensible decision.\n\"He should do the sensible and correct thing. I am not saying we would have won the game, or got a result, but it changes the game.\"\nCity get the job done\nCity will start 2020 14 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after returning to winning ways on a day when the result was more important than the performance after Friday's capitulation at Wolves where Pep Guardiola's side led 2-0 before losing 3-2.\nCity's subdued first-half performance bore all the hallmarks of a side nursing a hangover after the dramatic events at Molineux.\nPonderous and lacklustre, they failed to register an attempt on target in the opening 45 minutes before coming good after half-time to secure a 100th Premier League win since Guardiola took charge in 2016.\nHaving taken the lead in controversial circumstances, City sealed the points with De Bruyne's sweeping finish past Dean Henderson.\nWith Benjamin Mendy and Nicolas Otamendi dropping to the bench, there was a first Premier League start for Spanish defender Eric Garcia and the 18-year-old helped City to a first domestic home clean sheet since 26 October.\nYet City were far from their best in their final game of a year which saw them claim a historic domestic treble.\nPositives despite defeat for gutsy Blades\nA calendar year that started with a win at Wigan in the Championship ended with a gutsy performance at the home of the Premier League champions for the spirited Blades.\nThe last 12 months will live long in the memory of United fans who have seen their side quickly adapt to life in England's top tier after winning automatic promotion last season.\nWilder will not allow United to stand still and, despite a first away loss since 19 January, there were positives to take from only a fifth league defeat of the season.\nLys Mousset, who has been excellent since arriving from Bournemouth for \u00a310m, headed an early chance wide before having a goal disallowed after a video assistant referee check for offside - the fifth time this season United have had a goal ruled out by VAR in the Premier League, the most of any team.\nMousset also rippled the side netting when he should have done better while Muhamed Besic also went close before substitute Billy Sharp was denied by the woodwork at the end.\nThis was always going to be a testing time for the Blades. Their next game is at runaway leaders Liverpool on Thursday. As they proved against City, they will not be overawed by the occasion.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Man City)\n'No secret Sheff Utd are doing well' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"We had a short time to recover and faced a strong team. Not just mentally but physically against Sheffield United. They are good in the long balls, defending. It's not a secret where they are in the table.\"\nOn his 100th Premier League win: \"Of course we proud of everything in these seasons, the incredible effort. When you think about 100 wins in 134 games it is an incredible achievement. It is nice to be alongside these big teams. It means a lot.\"\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder: \"We believe that it could have been different. My team were excellent against fantastic players and a world-class manager.\n\"The way we played out of possession was good. As always when you play the big teams when the chances come around you have to taken them. And we haven't.\"\nAguero's goal-den year - the stats\nManchester City forward Sergio Aguero has scored 22 goals in the Premier League in 2019 - only in 2016 has he scored more in the competition within a calendar year (27).\nSheffield United suffered their first away defeat in any competition since January (1-0 v Swansea in the Championship), ending a run of 18 consecutive games without a loss on the road.\nCity are unbeaten in their past 38 Premier League home games against promoted sides (W34 D4) since a 2-0 loss against Reading in February 2007. Only Chelsea (43 games between 2001-2015) and Manchester United (40 games between 2002-2015) have had longer such runs in the competition.\nCity's Kevin de Bruyne has been directly involved in 19 goals in the Premier League this season (seven goals and 12 assists) - only Leicester's Jamie Vardy has had a hand in more (20).\nDe Bruyne has an assist in each of his past three Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nWhile Manchester City entertain Everton on New Year's Day (17:30 GMT), Sheffield United have an extra day to prepare for their visit to Liverpool on Thursday (20:00 GMT)."

Why wait for their next fancy meeting to sort it? Convene a meeting now and change it. It's clearly ruining game after game.\nMark Davies: VAR is a joke and it is ruining game after game. Goal line checks only. That's it! Ridiculous call at Burnley. It is not as if officials make loads of errors anyway.\nTom Sharpe: VAR is a fantastic piece of technology that should be a terrific addition to the game...but the use of it in football is so questionable and awful that every other game that uses it must look at football like its an idiot.\nAdam Heap: I'm a Burnley fan and whether it's 'scientifically offside' or not, that VAR can be used like that is just wrong. I'd be happier for Villa to have that goal.\nPoor defending from Burnley as Villa's formation change pays off\nDean Smith's side came into the match having picked up just four points away from home and off the back of a poor performance in a 3-0 defeat at 10-man Watford on Saturday.\nSmith said \"a reaction was needed\" prior to kick-off in Burnley and his players responded, creating goalscoring opportunities in both halves and deserving the three points.\nThe Villa boss mixed things up at Turf Moor, starting with a back three and playing Grealish in a more central role going forward and it paid off.\nGrealish was at the heart of everything positive for Villa, playing three key passes and being involved in both goals.\nBut while Smith received the reaction from his players he had hoped for, there was more head scratching from Sean Dyche as Burnley produced another poor defensive display in the first half.\nTwice, Burnley midfielder Ashley Westwood gave the ball away in his own half, leading to chances for Douglas Luiz and Wesley.\nAnd James Tarkowski was out-muscled far too easily as Wesley was allowed to turn and shoot in the box in the first half, before a poor clearance from the same centre-back led to Grealish's disallowed goal.\nBurnley did respond in the second half after fans had booed them off at the break - Jay Rodriguez and Johann Berg Gudmundsson coming on as substitutes - but they failed to create many clear-cut opportunities in front of goal.\nRodriguez should have scored when Tarkowski's low cross bounced off his shin and over the bar from a few yards out, while Wood thumped an effort miles wide from an unmarked position in the box.\nDyche stood on the touchline with his hands on his head and was an agitated figure throughout.\nWood's header gave Burnley some hope at the end - they put in 34 crosses from open play during the match and pressure built on Villa during the nine-minute spell of stoppage time - but the hosts could not conjure up another shot on target.\nEnding a 12-game drought - the best of the stats\nAston Villa recorded their first away victory at Burnley since March 1959 (2-0 in the FA Cup), having previously gone 14 trips there without a win across all competitions (D6 L8).\nBurnley suffered their first Premier League defeat against a team starting the day in the relegation zone since August 2018 (4-2 v Fulham), ending a run of eight such games without losing (W5 D3).\nBurnley have lost each of their last nine Premier League games when failing to keep a clean sheet - indeed, the Clarets are winless in 18 games in the competition when conceding (D4 L14).\nGrealish scored his sixth Premier League goal in his 19th appearance this season - as many as he netted in 31 matches in the Championship last season (excluding play-offs).\nWesley scored his first Premier League goal for Villa since October (two versus Norwich), ending a run of 12 games and 20 shots without finding the net.\nWood has scored more headed goals than any other player in the top five European leagues in 2019-20 (five).\n'VAR played its part as usual'\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche to BBC Match of the Day: \"We had a strong second half in the Manchester United game and I expected us to carry that on but we were miles off to start. There were not enough players brave enough to get the ball into good areas.\n\"The main thing was we got a big response and we dominated the rest of the game from half-time onwards. We've got to perform for 90 minutes, that was the key.\n\"I'm a big fan of VAR, it looks like handball to me. You need those margins when you're not playing well to go for you and that didn't come to us.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith to BBC Match of the Day: \"We changed the system and I thought that we wanted to get on the ball and play. The lads looked really accomplished at it. We've only had a couple of days to work on it. A lot of them have played it before at previous clubs. We've been conceding too many goals and playing the three helped us get an extra head in the box.\n\"Burnley is a tough place to come and they know how to stay in this league but we felt we could compete with them. VAR played its part as usual but we scored two great goals as well.\n\"Jack Grealish is unfortunate to not have two goals today. I'm still not sure why it was disallowed looking at the still image. I thought theirs should've been disallowed for a push on Tyrone Mings.\"\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host League One side Peterborough United in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 4 January (12:31 GMT kick-off) before travelling to Chelsea for their next Premier league match on Saturday, 11 January (15:00 GMT).\nAston Villa take on Fulham in the FA Cup (Saturday, 15:01 GMT) and travel to Leicester City on Wednesday, 8 January for the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final (20:00 GMT). They return to Premier League action on Sunday, 12 January against champions Manchester City at Villa Park (16:30 GMT)."

Aside from providing support for his centre-backs, the 20-year-old was exceptional as an attacking force down the right.\nBrighton's Dan Burn will not want to face him too soon having left the pitch with a fractured collarbone in the 22nd minute following a collision with the England Under-21 player.\nThe Blues, however, were as poor as Brighton in attack, and keeper Mat Ryan had less to do than his opposite number.

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 0-3 Leicester City: Foxes brush aside 10-man Newcastle\nLeicester's impressive season continued with a dominant win at Newcastle - and the Foxes' potential \"excites\" manager Brendan Rodgers.\nVictory keeps the East Midlands club second and inflicts a third straight defeat on Steve Bruce's side, who played almost the whole second half with 10 men following a string of injuries.\nLeicester, without the division's leading goalscorer Jamie Vardy for the second successive game, took the lead through Ayoze Perez, who kept his cool to finish well against his former side after being gifted possession by a horror pass from Florian Lejeune.\nThe Newcastle defender was culpable again just a few minutes later as his weak clearance was claimed by the away side and fed to James Maddison, who rifled in a thunderbolt of a second from the edge of the box.\nThe home side, whose best effort fell to a woefully ill-equipped and confidence-shorn Joelinton to waste, were unable to respond and would have lost by much more but for an inspired display from goalkeeper Martin Dubravka.\nFixtures schedule to blame for Newcastle injuries - Bruce\nDubravka was powerless to prevent substitute Hamza Choudhury scoring a superb third, curling in his first goal in senior football from the edge of the box.\nIt was the final blow for the home side, whose afternoon started badly and only got worse. Both Jetro Willems and Javier Manquillo were forced off through injury at the end of the first half, before Fabian Schar followed them at the start of the second, leaving them with 10 men following the half-time substitution of the also injured captain Jonjo Shelvey.\n\"I remember coming here before with Liverpool and we won 6-0 and played very well,\" said Rodgers.\n\"We've come here today with equally as good a performance, not scored the goals, but certainly with the control in the game and the quality in our game, played very, very well.\n\"But we can play better. We will improve the longer we work together - because it's only been 10 months or so.\n\"The potential in the group really excites me, but we have to keep that consistency and that hunger to want to be better.\"\nNewcastle remain in mid-table but their points cushion above the relegation zone is down to five.\nThere are no such concerns for Leicester, though, with this win keeping them in second, ahead of Manchester City.\nIt was also Leicester's seventh away Premier League win of the season - only unbeaten leaders Liverpool have managed more.\nFoxes begin big seven days in style\nBack-to-back defeats by reigning champions Manchester City and runaway leaders Liverpool either side of Christmas dealt an almost certainly fatal blow to Leicester's title aspirations. The Foxes are actually two points better off now than at this stage of their remarkable 2015-16 title win, but the imperious form of Jurgen Klopp's side makes a repeat triumph even more improbable.\nHowever, this victory, four days after the win at West Ham, keeps the Foxes at least notionally in the hunt, restores the sense of supreme confidence that existed prior to the trip to the Etihad and sets them up for what is a crucial seven days in their season.\nOn Saturday they face Wigan in the FA Cup third round, followed four days later by the home first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final with Aston Villa.\nBrendan Rodgers took the opportunity to rest a host of players for the game at London Stadium, correctly trusting in a talented second string to get the job done against a woefully poor Hammers side in the death rattle of Manuel Pellegrini's managerial reign.\nHe was further rewarded for this decision - and the one to switch to a back three, with Ben Chilwell and Ricardo Pereira as wing-backs - at St James' Park with a display full of energy and, once they had a cast-iron grip on the encounter, sensible game management.\nSuch was the efficiency of their display they did not miss Vardy, who recently welcomed the birth of a daughter. Perez was full of clever running and ruthless against his former side, while Maddison and his replacement Choudhury brought their shooting boots and then some.\nChoudhury's strike, in particular, added insult to injury as it was his tackle in a meeting between the sides in August that resulted in the serious injury that keeps Matt Ritchie out to this day.\nA very bad day at the office\nWhere to even start with Newcastle?\nIn defiance of some of the doom-mongering that greeted Steve Bruce's appointment as Rafael Benitez's successor in the summer, the Magpies have enjoyed a solid season so far - unspectacular but resilient.\nThis all came undone, though, during a 90 minutes strewn with errors and misfortune.\nJoelinton has failed miserably to endear himself to the Toon Army during the first half of the season and only further blotted his copybook with two awful misses - the first the more crucial, coming with the score 0-0 and seeing him head a follow-up to his own blocked shot away from rather than towards the goal.\nThe second, later in the game, saw him slice a clear shot on goal following a pull-back from the byeline.\nIt was in defence that the wheels really came off, however, with Lejeune playing a key and calamitous role in both of Leicester's first two goals.\nThe injuries to his fellow defenders Willems and Manquillo gave Bruce one final role of the dice with his replacements, which he used at the break to usher Sean Longstaff into the game in place of Shelvey, who was also injured.\nWhen Schar then pulled a thigh muscle, he limped out the game and took any hope Newcastle had of getting back into the game with him.\nThe ramifications will stretch beyond Wednesday, with Newcastle now having to cope with 10 injuries in a squad of 22 senior outfield players.\n'All three goals were wonderful'\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers to BBC Sport: \"We played very well in the first half with a new system. The players had great fluency. We pressed really hard.\n\"We worked them in the second half, stretched the game and it led to the third goal. All three of our goals were wonderful. James Maddison is a magical player who has so much talent and confidence.\n\"We are so happy for Hamza Choudhury to get his first goal - he's a local boy who loves Leicester City.\n\"There is no way on this earth that you can ask players to play at the intensity we want without making a lot of changes. We made changes at West Ham and again today.\n\"Jamie Vardy has a tight calf, he is being treated and I didn't want to take any risks.\"\nLeicester on the ball - match stats\nLeicester averaged 77.1% possession against Newcastle - their highest figure in a Premier League away game since the start of 2003-04.\nLeicester have won six of their past seven league games on New Year's Day (D1).\nThe Foxes have lost only two of their past 13 Premier League games, winning 10 of those matches. In fact, they have won six of their past seven away league games (L1).\nAfter going eight consecutive home Premier League games without defeat, Newcastle have now lost back-to-back matches at St James' Park.\nSince the start of last season, Leicester's James Maddison has scored eight Premier League goals from outside the box - more than any other player.\nOnly Liverpool (16) have had more different goalscorers (excluding own-goals) in the Premier League this season than Leicester City (13).\nLeicester's Ayoze Perez has been directly involved in eight goals in his past five league appearances at St James' Park (six goals, two assists).\nWhat's next?\nAfter home cup games against Wigan and Aston Villa, Leicester's next league game is at home against Southampton on 11 January (15:00 GMT kick-off).\nNewcastle travel to Rochdale in the FA Cup third round before going to Wolves for a Premier League game on the same day the Foxes host the Saints (15:00 GMT)."

Not a lot of people believe in us but we will fight to stay in the Premier League, and we will do it.\"\nWolves, who had only lost twice in their previous 15 league games, pressed for an equaliser as Ben Foster saved Matt Doherty's header and Ruben Neves fired over in stoppage time.\nHowever, Pearson's team showed grit and determination to move one point behind 18th-placed Bournemouth and stay two from safety.\nRelive how Watford beat Wolves\nFollow New Year's Day's Premier League action\nPearson leading Watford in right direction\nWhen Pearson took over at Watford, his team looked doomed with nine points from 16 games and a six-point gap to safety.\nNow with three wins and a draw from their past five matches, it looks as though the Watford boss might be able to recreate a second great escape after he led Leicester City to survival at the end of the 2014-15 season.\nThe Hornets are now far more positive in their play, helped by returning striker Troy Deeney, who has scored three goals in his past four games.\nAnd they look more solid in defence, shown in the latter stages of this game where they had to deal with Kabasele's dismissal for hauling down substitute Diogo Jota, which was deemed a yellow-card offence by referee Andrew Madley before it was upgraded to a red by the video assistant referee.\nAgainst Wolves, who remain seventh in the table, Deulofeu and Ismaila Sarr were outstanding as they continually caused the visitors problems.\nDeulofeu did not score his first goal this season until 2 November against Chelsea, but he is now Watford's joint top scorer, finding the bottom corner with a composed finish for his fourth of the campaign.\nThe Spanish winger also set up Doucoure, whose shot took a deflection off Conor Coady and sailed into the top corner.\nThere was a collective desire and will to earn the win after the second half began to unravel, which will give Watford hope that they can remain in the top flight for a sixth season.\nTired Wolves struggle to take advantage\nNo Premier League team has played more than the 35 games Wolves have competed in this season, and at times during this encounter it showed.\nEven though Nuno Espirito Santo brought in four players who were rested from Sunday's trip to Anfield, including Adama Traore and top scorer Raul Jimenez, they did not overly trouble the hosts until the hour mark.\nPerhaps they were not worried by going behind given that they had previously conceded the first goal in 13 league games this season but had only lost four of those.\nHowever, they paid for missing a good early chance with Doherty thwarted by the impressive Ben Foster after he latched onto Coady's astute pass.\nOnce Doucoure made it 2-0, their task seemed insurmountable, yet the deflected strike by Neto, who was a continuous outlet for them down the left, and the red card gave the visitors an unexpected fillip.\nGiven Wolves' success this season, an equaliser looked likely as they piled on the pressure.\nBut this is a new Watford side whose only defeat since Pearson took over was at Anfield.\nAnd the Hornets showed their jubilant fans the type of resilience that had become lost under previous managers Gracia and Sanchez Flores.\nMan of the match - Gerard Deulofeu\nManager reaction - 'We put our bodies on the line'\nWatford boss Nigel Pearson told BBC Match of the Day: \"We displayed a different kind of win today. We had to show a lot of commitment to dig in. It was a tough second half, going down to 10 men, Wolves are a decent side and had a lot of possession. But we were prepared to put our bodies on the line.\n\"What I've seen today is a group of players with incredible unity, they have an appetite to work hard to get out of the situation we are in.\"\nOn Christian Kabasele's red card: \"The players feel it was harsh, based on the type of contact and the position of team-mates, so we will have to look at it. I've not seen it yet. The important thing was to try and keep calm, we had to make changes and I felt the players dealt with it exceptionally well.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"The performance was not the best. We started slow and allowed Watford into the game. They had a couple of chances but no more than that. But we only reacted after the second goal.\n\"We didn't create enough to really get the draw and get what we wanted. We have a team with character but we didn't have that today. Let's work on it and try and improve for the next one.\n\"We should improve, it makes a lot of difference when you take your chances as you can manage the game, especially when you have such a tight schedule.\"\nPearson's home run - the best stats\nWatford have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since February 2019.\nGerard Deulofeu has scored three goals in all competitions against Wolves for Watford - he's only scored more against Cardiff City for the Hornets (four).\nWatford manager Nigel Pearson has won his past six home Premier League games, winning three with Leicester in May 2015 and his first three with Watford.\nWolves have lost three of their past five Premier League games (W2), as many as they'd lost in their previous 21 games combined.\nWolves winger Adama Traore completed 15 dribbles in this match, the most by a player in a league match in the top five European leagues since Karim Bellarabi completed 17 in a Bundesliga fixture for Bayer Leverkusen against Werder Bremen in February 2015.\nWolves' Pedro Neto became the first teenager to score for the club in the Premier League (19y 298d).\nJoao Moutinho registered his 14th Premier League assist for Wolves, overtaking Matt Jarvis as the record assist holder for the club in the competition.\nWhat next?\nWatford host League One Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup third round on Saturday (kick-off 15:01 GMT), Wolves host Manchester United in the same competition (kick-off 17:31 GMT), having beaten them in the quarter-finals last season."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur: Brilliant Ings gives Saints narrow win\nA brilliant goal from Danny Ings gave Southampton a narrow but deserved win over Jose Mourinho's Tottenham.\nThe Saints striker flicked the ball superbly over Toby Alderweireld before shooting past Paulo Gazzaniga for his ninth goal in his past 10 games.\nSpurs were unimpressive, with Jan Vertonghen missing their best chance from close range in the first half.\nMourinho, who was booked late on, sees his team stay sixth in the table, while Southampton rise to 11th.\nSpurs striker Harry Kane was forced off with a leg injury just seconds after having a goal disallowed for offside in the second half.\nRelive Southampton v Spurs as it happened\nAll the New Year's Day Premier League action and reaction\nShane Long went close with a header with five minutes left, but Southampton are now unbeaten in their last four outings.\nSouthampton claimed a penalty against Alderweireld for handball early in the second half, but the referee did not give it and VAR upheld the decision, then also upheld the official's decision against Kane when he netted later on.\nMourinho was shown a yellow card by referee Mike Dean after appearing to go over to speak to members of the Southampton coaching team.\nResilient Saints on the rise\nA 2-2 draw with Arsenal on 23 November left Southampton one place off the foot of the table on just nine points, but since then Ralph Hasenhuttl's side have hit a run of form to move away from the relegation zone.\nThe win over Spurs means they have collected 16 out of a possible 24 points since that meeting with Arsenal, and they worked tirelessly to both give themselves chances and to frustrate the visitors.\nAnd Ings' goal brought back memories of Paul Gascoigne's famous strike against Scotland in Euro 96, with the striker touching a long pass from Jack Stephens over Alderweireld before allowing the ball to bounce up invitingly for the 27-year-old to score his 13th league goal of the season.\nSouthampton's energy levels dipped in the second half, but they held on to restrict Spurs to just one shot on target after the break.\nIt was their fourth clean sheet of a campaign that has veered away from the depths of the 9-0 humiliation at St Mary's by Leicester on 25 October towards signs that Southampton can stay in the Premier League with some comfort.\nBad day for Spurs and Mourinho\nAs brilliant as Ings' goal was, it underlined a defensive frailty that continues to hang around Spurs despite an upturn in results under Mourinho.\nThe 5-0 win over Burnley on 7 December is the only clean sheet they have kept in 11 games since Mourinho's appointment.\nBut in addition to their problems at the back, Spurs appeared disjointed going forward and they will be looking forward to the return of Son Heung-min from his three-match suspension to give them some impetus in attack.\nThe sight of Kane limping off the field, clutching the back of his thigh seconds after seeing his goal disallowed, was another bad moment for Spurs but it was compounded by their manager soon after.\nAnd the manager got in on the action too. Mourinho strode out of his technical zone to say something to a member of the home side's coaching staff, and was immediately shown the yellow card to cap an unhappy day on the south coast.\nMan of the match - Danny Ings (Southampton)\nManager reaction\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl speaking to Match of the Day: \"I must praise the team for this unbelievable character, mentality and passion. The whole stadium was flowing today. When it is like this, it makes it really fun to play in.\"\nOn Danny Ings' goal: \"It was fantastic. Such a goal you make when you have lots of self-confidence. This time of the season is unbelievable.\"\nOn keeping a clean sheet: \"It is a fantastic job. This is only possible if you defend with the discipline that we did today. Until the last line we were very committed. Everybody was brave and on the front foot. Even when we won the ball we tried to play football. If you are brave then you deserve to get something and today we got a lot. It was important for us that we start winning at home especially against a strong side. It was not undeserved.\"\nPurple patch for Ings - the stats you may have missed\nSouthampton have won three of their past five Premier League home games (D1 L1), as many victories on home soil as they managed in their previous 14.\nTottenham lost their first league game of a calendar year for the first time since 2009, winning eight and drawing two before this defeat.\nSouthampton have won two of their past three Premier League games with Tottenham (L1), after winning just one of the 13 before that (D2 L10).\nTottenham have kept only one clean sheet in 11 games under Jose Mourinho in all competitions.\nOnly Jamie Vardy (17) has scored more Premier League goals this season than Southampton's Danny Ings (13).\nIngs has nine goals in his past nine Premier League starts.\nSince the start of last season, only Sergio Aguero (9) has scored more Premier League goals against the division's 'big six' clubs than Ings (8).\nWhat's next?\nSaints host Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup on Saturday 4 January, kicking off at 15:00 GMT, and return to Premier League action a week later at Leicester City.\nSpurs travel to Middlesbrough for their FA Cup third-round match on Sunday, 5 January at 14:00. They take on Liverpool at home in the Premier League on 11 January at 17:30."

They played really well.\n\"We've only had a couple of days with them and I tried to make it as simple as I could. In truth, I don't know most of the players but I tried to use every bit of time, I had a conversation with them all and spoke to one or two individuals.\n\"It's the first game and [it] felt I didn't have enough time to work with the players - that's why it's difficult to take any credit.\n\"It was about being brave on the ball, trying to regain confidence, trying to regain the trust from the crowd.\"\nNoble opened the scoring inside 20 minutes with the help of a deflection before Haller's bicycle kick doubled the Hammers' lead.\nNoble scored his second 10 minutes later from the penalty spot after being brought down by Harry Wilson, before Anderson rounded off the win.\nWest Ham were lucky not to end the match with 10 men after Aaron Cresswell was sent off for a reckless challenge on Ryan Fraser, only for the video assistant referee (VAR) to downgrade the dismissal to a yellow card.\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe said his side have experienced \"a really difficult run\".\n\"We've been knocked quite a lot this season with the injuries and the run that we've had. We had players playing who were not 100% fit,\" he added.\n\"It's not an excuse. The players gave everything but they were not in the best physical condition to play. At this level you get found out.\n\"It's our first time in the relegation zone for a long time, but that might be a good thing for us. It will change the mindset.\"\nMoyes magic returns to East London\nIn his first spell at the Hammers' helm, Moyes lost his opening match in charge - away to Watford - and had to wait four games before finally getting a win on the board.\nBut it was the polar opposite second time around, a classy performance from the Hammers securing a statement win on home soil.\nMoyes stamped his return by making four changes to the side which had lost to Leicester on 28 December under Pellegrini, and those changes proved pivotal with Noble and Robert Snodgrass the stars of the show from the off.\nNoble had called for West Ham fans to get behind Moyes after his reappointment and the captain led from the front with his opening goal, wrong-footing Aaron Ramsdale with his deflected strike after brilliant play from Snodgrass.\nThe scorer geed up the crowd as the match got back under way, signalling to them to ramp up the volume, and they did exactly that when Haller found the back of the net seven minutes later, through an exquisite mid-air finish from Ryan Fredericks' cross.\nIt marked the first time the Hammers had scored twice in a first half this season and Bournemouth had no answer as their hosts repeatedly thundered forwards, with Noble soon scoring his second after being tripped in the box by Wilson, sending Ramsdale the wrong way with his spot-kick.\nWest Ham did not quite have the same control of the second half as they did the first as the Cherries looked to claw something back, but if the three points had not already been sealed by now, Anderson's second-half strike proved the final nail in the coffin.\nThe Brazilian effortlessly brought down Declan Rice's weighted pass before a simple finish condemned Bournemouth to their 11th defeat of the season.\nCresswell looked to have produced the only blot on an otherwise blemish-free day for West Ham when referee Graham Scott showed him a straight red for a needless tackle on Fraser, but it was Scott who was left red-faced when VAR overturned his decision.\nBournemouth's woes continue\nFour changes were also the order of the day for Eddie Howe's Cherries as they looked to start 2020 in better fashion than 2019 had ended - but it did not go to plan.\nOn a day in which the injury-hit club had recalled Sam Surridge from Swansea, Bournemouth lacked any sort of get-up-and-go against West Ham and are now staring down the barrel of relegation after winning just one of their past 10 matches in the top flight.\nThey had started brightly, however, controlling the opening passages of play with Diego Rico carving out opportunities for his side.\nBut Howe's men were dealt a sucker punch when West Ham took the lead, and suffered another blow soon after when they had a penalty appeal reviewed, and then denied, by VAR following an Angelo Ogbonna tackle.\nThe wind was truly taken out of their sails when they went 2-0 behind, unable to do anything to deny Haller's acrobatics, and then 3-0 down, although Rico did force Lukasz Fabianski into a decent save in the closing stages of the first half.\nHowe's half-time team talk looked to have made some difference as Bournemouth came out after the break in a higher gear, substitute Junior Stanislas looking to single-handedly drive his side on as they strung passes together and finally enjoyed more possession.\nBut they had very little to offer after West Ham's fourth goal, despite Dominic Solanke hitting the post in the final minutes.\nMan of the match - Mark Noble (West Ham)\nThe stats\nWest Ham earned their biggest Premier League win since November 2007, when they beat Derby 5-0 at Pride Park. It's the Hammers' biggest home win in the competition since September 2005 (4-0 v Aston Villa).\nBournemouth have won fewer points over the past 10 Premier League games than any other side in the competition (4 - W1 D1 L8).\nWest Ham were 3-0 ahead after just 35 minutes in this match, the earliest they've established such a lead in a Premier League game since May 2007 against Bolton (29 minutes).\nBournemouth mustered just three shots in this match - it's the third time this season they've had three or fewer shots in a Premier League match, more often than any other side.\nThis is the first time West Ham have won consecutive Premier League games under manager David Moyes, with his last victory at the club coming back in May 2018.\nMark Noble's opener was his eighth goal from outside the box in the Premier League, more than any other West Ham player in the competition's history (overtaking Frank Lampard on seven).\nMark Noble has been directly involved in 78 Premier League goals for West Ham (45 goals, 33 assists) - no player has had a hand in more for the club in the competition (level with Paolo Di Canio).\nAll 75 of Sebastien Haller's top-flight goals in England, Germany and Netherlands combined have been scored from inside the box.\nWest Ham's Mark Noble has scored 26 penalty goals in the Premier League - only Alan Shearer (56), Frank Lampard (43) and Steven Gerrard (32) have netted more from the spot in the competition.\nWest Ham's Felipe Anderson scored his first Premier League goal since April, ending a run of 20 games and 28 shots without netting in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to Gillingham in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday (18:16 GMT) before a league trip to Sheffield United next Friday (20:00 GMT). Bournemouth face Luton in the cup on Saturday (17:31 GMT) and welcome Watford in the league on Sunday 12 January (14:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 Everton: Gabriel Jesus double sees off Toffees\nPep Guardiola says Manchester City will \"never give up\" after the champions narrowed the gap on leaders Liverpool to 11 points with a 2-1 win over Everton.\nGabriel Jesus scored twice as City survived a nervy finish to end Carlo Ancelotti's unbeaten start as Toffees manager.\nThey remain third in the Premier League and one point behind second-placed Leicester, who won 3-0 at Newcastle. Liverpool meanwhile can restore their 13-point lead at the top with victory against Sheffield United on Thursday, one of two games in hand they have on their title rivals.\n\"When you are far away from the first position sometimes people give up, but we never give up,\" Guardiola said. \"We played great so I'm delighted for the guys. This period is so tough. We did really well. Three more points and closer to Leicester.\"\nCity had to wait until the second half to break down a well-drilled Everton side who defended with discipline and in numbers, but Jesus provided the spark of genius they needed.\nHe collected an Ilkay Gundogan pass on the edge of the area to put Guardiola's side ahead with a brilliant curling right-footed shot into the top corner that Jordan Pickford got a hand to, but could not keep out.\nSeven minutes later, the Brazilian made it 2-0, this time with his left foot, when he darted on to a Riyad Mahrez pass and buried a low shot past Pickford.\nThe City fans - who had earlier seen a close-range Phil Foden strike ruled out for offside by the video assistant referee - did not celebrate either goal fully until the game had restarted.\nRelive the action from the Etihad Stadium\nGuardiola's side also had to wait before securing the three points, with a couple of Ancelotti tactical tweaks seeing Everton go on the attack, and soon pull a goal back.\nIt came courtesy of a City mistake when stand-in goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, playing because Ederson was ill, tried to play out from the back but under-hit his pass.\nSeconds later the ball was in the back of his net when Theo Walcott's deflected cross found Richarlison unmarked to tap in at the back post.\nAlarm bells were suddenly ringing for City, who had capitulated from 2-0 up to lose against Wolves last week - albeit with 10 men for most of the match - but this time they saw the game out.\nWhile Everton looked dangerous when they came forward, the only real scare for the home side came when substitute Moise Kean found space in their area to acrobatically fire wide.\nCity will now turn their attentions to the domestic cup competitions as they begin their defence of the FA Cup against League Two Port Vale in the third round on Saturday before travelling to Manchester United in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday.\n\"We have to keep going,\" added Guardiola. \"We have FA Cup then the EFL Cup. Other teams dropped points for the top four so it was an important win.\"\nGuardiola makes changes to try to make up ground\nThe last decade saw City record the highest number of Premier League titles (four), points (818), wins (251) and goals (845).\nBut they began the 2020s playing catch-up, not just to runaway leaders Liverpool, but also to Leicester, who remain a point clear of them in second place.\nGuardiola's attempts to make up ground, and perhaps improve a porous defence before their Champions League campaign resumes next month, saw him change his formation as well as his personnel at the end of a frenetic festive period.\nIn a shape first seen against Sheffield United on Sunday evening, Rodri, usually a holding midfielder, dropped into a three-man central defence, with Gundogan and Kevin de Bruyne operating as a dual midfield pivot in front of them.\nThat gave City's wing-backs, Benjamin Mendy and Joao Cancelo, licence to roam forward and they both impressed on the ball in the opposition half.\nRumours persist about Cancelo's future at the club but he provided a perfect cross for Foden to find the net in the first half, only for VAR to show that Mahrez was offside earlier in the move.\nThere remain doubts about City at the back, however, particularly from set-pieces - Yerry Mina and Dominic Calvert-Lewin both could have punished the hosts for poor marking at corners - and there was relief in the stands and on the pitch at the final whistle.\nAncelotti acumen clear, even in defeat\nThis was by far the toughest assignment of Ancelotti's early days as Everton boss and yet, even in defeat, his acumen was evident.\nThe Italian, forced into a late reshuffle after losing Bernard to injury in the warm-up, packed the middle of the pitch early on and made it difficult for City to play through his side in a first half where his priority was clearly to keep the hosts quiet.\nYet Everton still managed to fashion two decent chances for themselves before the break, with Seamus Coleman forcing Bravo into a fine reflex save and Mina wastefully heading over.\nAnd Ancelotti's ability to turn his side's mindset from defence to attack was clear after they fell 2-0 down, when he sent Walcott and then Kean on, and began to take the game to City.\nThey eventually fell short of a comeback but that was not down to a lack of effort or ideas.\nAncelotti now has a first defeat to go with his opening two wins as Everton boss, but this was another encouraging display to take into his first Merseyside derby at the weekend.\nMan of the match - Gabriel Jesus (Man City)\nBrazilian magic - the stats\nManchester City have won five consecutive league meetings with Everton for the first time.\nEverton have lost seven of their past 10 away games in the Premier League (W2 D1).\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti has lost twice as many Premier League games against Manchester City (four) as he has against any other opponent (Everton and Liverpool, two).\nCity have scored 14 of their past 18 home league goals in the second half of those matches (78%).\nThis match was only the fourth Premier League game to see a Brazilian score for both sides (excluding own goals), after Liverpool v Spurs in March 2019, Chelsea v Liverpool in October 2015 and Middlesbrough v Manchester City in May 2008.\nOnly Kevin de Bruyne (23) has more assists in all competitions for City since the start of last season than Riyad Mahrez (22).\nRicharlison scored his 20th league goal for Everton in his 56th Premier League appearance for the club; only Kevin Campbell (31), Romelu Lukaku (43), Tony Cottee (44) and Yakubu (53) reached 20 goals in fewer appearances for the Toffees in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nFA Cup holders Manchester City start their defence of the famous old trophy on Saturday when they host League Two side Port Vale (17:31 GMT).\nEverton, who have not won a trophy since the FA Cup in 1995, go to neighbours and Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday (16:01) in their third-round tie."

It feels tough.\n\"It's difficult to score against Crystal Palace, they are so well-structured and balanced, we got the first goal but missed chances - the second goal would have decided the game.\n\"Conceding a equaliser so late, it feels like a loss. It will be a long road and a sensation for us to stay in this league but we won't give up.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson to BBC Sport: \"It was very close [for the goal].

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-0 Man Utd: Gunners secure first win under Mikel Arteta\nMikel Arteta earned his first win as Arsenal boss as the Gunners produced a powerful first-half performance to beat a lacklustre Manchester United.\nThe visitors, who were without the injured Paul Pogba, actually began brightly, but the game took a different turn on eight minutes when Nicolas Pepe steered in his fifth goal of the season after Sead Kolasinac's cross was deflected to him.\nThat led to a first half in which the hosts were in control and Pepe hit the post before they doubled their lead when his corner was smashed in from close range by Sokratis Papastathopoulos.\nOle Gunnar Solskajer's side came into the game with one loss in their previous nine games, and although they improved after the break, they rarely tested Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\nIt was characteristic of a stop-start season in which they are yet to win three Premier League games in a row.\nThe defeat leaves them fifth in the table, five points behind Chelsea, who drew with Brighton earlier in the day.\nVictory for Arsenal ended a run of seven home games without a win in all competitions and lifted them to 10th place, four points behind United.\nBut they remain closer to the relegation zone than the top four.\nArsenal can do big things - Luiz\nFootball Daily podcast: Arteta and Moyes off the mark, but is Howe unsackable?\nPepe peps up Arsenal\nThere has been evidence of a lift in Arsenal's three performances since Arteta was appointed, but without a win, questions remained as to whether he was the right man to take over from former boss Unai Emery, given his lack of experience as a manager.\nArteta was just an onlooker in the stands for the lifeless draw at Everton, but that was followed by a 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day and a crushing late defeat by Chelsea at home last Sunday.\nThis was a different game altogether, though, as Arsenal put the pieces together. With Granit Xhaka, who has been linked with a move to Hertha Berlin, restored to the midfield, the Swiss and Lucas Torreira were quicker to the tackle than their opponents.\nMesut Ozil covered 11.54km, more distance than any other Arsenal player.\nWhile record \u00a372m signing Pepe was at the heart of Arsenal's attacking endeavour as they were roared on by their fans.\nAfter scoring early on, he sent United left-back Luke Shaw halfway down the Holloway Road with a sharp turn before setting up Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who sliced a volley over.\nThe Ivorian then fed Alexandre Lacazette, who somehow hit his shot out for a throw-in from about six yards out, before Torreira went close from another Pepe pass.\nThe hosts had to withstand greater pressure from Solskjaer's side in the second period but in contrast to the Chelsea defeat, when they conceded twice in the last seven minutes, Arteta's side managed the game well.\nTheir only concerns were injuries to Kolasinac and Lacazette, who were both taken off in the second half.\nPogba-less United show further cause for concern\nManchester United improved after the break, but it would have been hard not to do so after a poor first half.\nMarcus Rashford had tested Bernd Leno in the first minute, but once they went behind to Pepe's opener, they struggled to match Arsenal's superior energy in midfield.\nJesse Lingard, who returned to the starting line-up, was hardly involved while Nemanja Matic could not get to grips with Ozil, Torreira or Xhaka, who were often one step ahead.\nIt was another game where Solskjaer's team missed the influence of Pogba, who has not started a game in three months. After the game, the United boss said the French midfielder had picked up an ankle injury which would need an operation, keeping him out for \"three or four weeks\".\nPrior to the game, it had been hinted that Pogba would be fit to play.\nUnited did lift their game once Lingard was substituted, with his replacement Andreas Pereira almost making an instant impact as he hit the side netting.\nThere were also chances for Fred and substitute Mason Greenwood, but without the injured Scott McTominay, and the ongoing problems with Pogba, United looked short on creativity in midfield and need to find solutions quickly should they want to maintain a top-four challenge.\nMan of the Match - Nicolas Pepe\nArsenal finally beat top half team - the best stats\nThis was Arsenal's first Premier League win this season against a team currently in the top half of the Premier League (P10 W1 D4 L5).\nNicolas Pepe has scored all his five goals for Arsenal in all competitions in London - four at the Emirates and one at London Stadium.\nArsenal have scored eight goals via corners in the Premier League this season, two more than any other team.\nManchester United have now lost four of their past five away Premier League visits to Arsenal (W1).\nWhat next?\nArsenal host Leeds on Monday, 6 January in the FA Cup third round (kick-off 19:56 GMT), while Manchester United travel to Wolves on Saturday, 4 January (kick-off 17:31) in a repeat of their quarter-final defeat last season."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-0 Sheffield United: Reds go unbeaten in the Premier League for a full year\nUnbeaten Premier League leaders Liverpool made it a full year without losing in the top flight as Sheffield United were brushed aside at Anfield.\nA slice of good fortune enabled the Reds to take an early lead - George Baldock's slip allowing Andy Robertson to set up Mohamed Salah for a simple close-range finish in just the fourth minute.\nBut there was nothing fortuitous about their win, which Sadio Mane sealed, finishing at the second attempt after being played in by Salah.\nIt maintains the Reds' 13-point advantage at the top of the division after nearest rivals Leicester and Manchester City both won on New Year's Day.\nJurgen Klopp's side have dropped just two points from a possible 60 this season.\nFor Chris Wilder's side, this was a second successive defeat, but they remain firmly in credit from the first half of their league campaign and sit eighth in the table, just two points off fifth.\nKlopp 'really proud' of players' commitment\n37 games, 89 goals, 101 points - how Liverpool went a year unbeaten in the Premier League\nAnalysis and reaction from Liverpool's win over Sheffield United\nQuiz: Can you name those to play for both Liverpool and Sheff Utd?\nA magnificent year\nLiverpool's 18th consecutive league win and 51st top-flight encounter without defeat in a row at Anfield was another showcase for a side working to near maximum capacity.\nDespite Klopp labelling as \"criminal\" a festive fixture schedule that has seen his side play six games in 17 days, the German kept his team changes to a minimum.\nHe did have to make a late alteration, bringing James Milner in for the man he originally drafted in to the side, Naby Keita, who injured himself in the warm-up, but it made little discernable difference.\nIn fact, Milner was superb as one third of a brilliant midfield unit, along with Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum.\nTheir work-rate, movement and accuracy of passing provided the platform, with Virgil van Dijk alert and efficient on the rare occasions Sheffield United were allowed a kick in the Liverpool half.\nSalah scored one, but he would have had more but for the combination of some excellent reflex saves from Dean Henderson and the woodwork - the Egyptian's chipped second-half cross floating past everyone and hitting the inside of the post.\nRoberto Firmino went close to his first Anfield goal since March with a curling effort just past the post and should have got it later in the second half, but failed to connect with Trent Alexander-Arnold's low cross from point-blank range.\nIn the end, though, two was more than enough to seal another win and move another step closer to their ultimate goal.\nHaving achieved an 'Invincibles' year, Liverpool still have a long way to go to match the 'Invincibles' season achieved by Arsenal in 2003-04.\nHowever, it would now take an implosion of unprecedented proportions to deny the Reds a first top-flight title in 30 years.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n'No airs and graces, just hard work'\nSheffield United enjoyed a stellar 2019 of their own, in which they achieved promotion back to England's top division for the first time since 2007 before exceeding expectation to end the year firmly embedded in the top half of the table.\nSuch has been their form under Chris Wilder only three sides in the country had a superior points-per-game record across 2019 - the current Premier League leaders, the top-flight's reigning champions Manchester City and West Brom, who presently have the joint most points in the Championship.\nThis is the first time they have suffered back-to-back defeats under Wilder since the start of last season and they have come at the two toughest grounds to visit in the country - Manchester City's Etihad Stadium and Anfield.\nWilder prepared his team for Thursday night's daunting match with a final practice session on Stanley Park, the public park next to Anfield, which included one moment when a dog joined them and urinated on one of their cones.\nAs the club's official Twitter account put it:\n, external\n\"No airs and graces, just hard work.\"\nThere is a lot more to this Sheffield United side than graft, although they were given only fleeting opportunities to demonstrate this at Anfield.\nUnited asked more questions of the Reds than most sides this season when they met at Bramall Lane in September, an error from goalkeeper Henderson leading to the game's only goal from Wijnaldum.\nThey gave a solid account of themselves here, where there is no shame in defeat - 17 sides have directly preceded them with the same fate, some wilting a lot more readily than the Blades.\nDavid McGoldrick has yet to score this season, but he went close soon after Liverpool's opener with an effort that Alisson had to tip over.\nAnd John Lundstram had the ball in the net, but long after an offside flag had already ruled any potential goal out.\nThey should also have had at least a consolation goal near the end, but somehow substitute Oliver McBurnie failed to poke the ball in from close range at the back post from a low cross.\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson (Liverpool)\nRare back-to-back defeats for the Blades - the stats\nLiverpool have accumulated 58 points from their 20 Premier League games this season; in English top-flight history, only Manchester City in 2017-18 (also 58) have had as many points at this stage of a campaign (assuming three points for a win all-time).\nSheffield United have lost all six of their Premier League matches against sides starting the day top of the table, including both meetings with Liverpool this campaign.\nLiverpool scored in their 29th consecutive game in the Premier League; only two teams have ever recorded a longer scoring streak in the competition - Arsenal between 2001 and 2002 (55) and Manchester United between 2007 and 2008 (36).\nSheffield United have lost back-to-back league matches for the first time since they lost both of their opening two games in last season's Championship.\nMohamed Salah's opener (03:25) was the earliest goal scored by Liverpool and conceded by Sheffield United in this season's Premier League. It is the earliest the Blades have conceded in a top-flight match since Andriy Shevchenko for Chelsea in March 2007 (03:02).\nSalah became only the fourth player to score 50+ left-footed goals for a single side in the Premier League, after Robbie Fowler (85 for Liverpool), Ryan Giggs (83 for Manchester United) and Robin van Persie (63 for Arsenal).\nSadio Mane's goal was his 100th goal involvement for Liverpool in his 151 appearances in all competitions for the club (74 goals, 26 assists).\nSince the start of last season, only his Liverpool team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold (20) has more Premier League assists than Andy Robertson (17).\nAlisson made his 50th Premier League appearance for Liverpool and kept his 26th clean sheet; among goalkeepers in the competition's history, only Petr Cech (33) and Pepe Reina (28) kept more shutouts in their opening 50 starts than the Brazilian.\n'The goals were exceptional' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to Match of the Day: \"It's obviously good [to go unbeaten for a year] but the target was not to extend this [run], but to win the game. The best thing you can say when you play against Sheffield United is to keep the game not spectacular. We controlled the game.\n\"We played around their formation, played behind, in-between, broke the lines and had counter-attacks. All the things we want to have. The boys played sensational.\n\"You saw these glimpses in the game where we were a bit sloppy. They wanted two or three situations in which they could score in. We needed that concentration and that was incredibly tough but the boys did so well. Nothing ends. We have to make sure we are ready again.\n\"I am really happy and really proud of the boys. We should not take things like this for granted. The way we controlled Sheffield United was exceptional. In possession we were incredible, we were calm but lively as well. The goals we scored were exceptional.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder speaking to Match of the Day: \"Little bit drained - disappointed in our performance tonight, we never laid a glove on them. If there's ever an example of a team doing well and with the desire, that's Liverpool.\n\"The first balls, second balls, running forward, tackling, defending, being aggressive; they [Liverpool] showed all those qualities. It's a great example for our team. We were off the pace. Maybe the Manchester City game took more out of them than I expected - our goalkeeper kept us in the game. For us to get anything, we would have had to perform really well and we didn't.\n\"Every time we tried to press they played around us with the quality they have got. All the stuff that gets talked about in academies, with young coaches - just look at what they did in terms of the basic stuff that gives you an opportunity to play and dominate. That's what they did to us. Not only technically, but tactically, they are a fantastic side. We have been well beaten.\n\"People talk about us having afternoons and nights like this when we came to the Premier League. We have not had that done to us all season until now so that's a small comfort. But it still hurts, we are still professionals. I believe if we played near our best we could have got something but we weren't anywhere near it.\"\nWhat next?\nLiverpool have a testing January, starting with a Merseyside derby against Everton in the FA Cup on Sunday, before they travel to Tottenham in the league the following Saturday.\nSheffield United host National League side AFC Fylde in the Cup, before hosting West Ham in the Premier League on Friday, 10 January."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 1-0 West Ham United: Oli McBurnie's winner sends Blades fifth\nSheffield United climbed to fifth in the Premier League table on Friday with a win against West Ham, who had an injury-time equaliser ruled out by Video Assistant Referee.\nJohn Fleck took advantage of a big mistake by substitute goalkeeper David Martin, latching on to his wayward pass to tee up Oli McBurnie to finish from close range after 53 minutes.\nSubstitute Robert Snodgrass thought he had levelled for the visitors, but the goal was disallowed after the ball was judged to have hit Declan Rice's arm in the build-up.\n\"VAR, VAR\", the home fans chanted as the final whistle sounded, with West Ham condemned to their eighth defeat in 11 Premier League games and their first under new manager David Moyes.\nThe result means the Hammers remain two points above the relegation zone and could drop into the bottom three if results go against them this weekend.\nNo Premier League players want VAR used - West Ham's Rice\nThe methods behind 'ruthless' Wilder\nWilder celebrates new deal with win\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder signed a new four-and-a-half-year deal before the game and one media colleague said the photograph released by the club to announce the contract was the first time he had ever seen the lifelong Blades fan wear a tie.\nWilder is clearly at ease in a tracksuit on the touchline.\nHe may have spent most of the night with his hands in his pockets but he was a constant presence on the edge of his technical area and when there was a point to be made - to a player, one of his coaching staff or fourth official Simon Hooper - he was firm in making it.\nMoyes has over 500 more Premier League games behind him than Wilder but he was 24 games without a win away at a top eight club prior to kick-off and until Felipe Anderson strode through just before the break, there was little to indicate his side were capable of breaking that run.\nAs it turned out, the Brazilian's finish lacked composure. Manuel Lanzini did better with a couple of second-half efforts and Fabien Balbuena's downward header bounced off the pitch and over the bar.\nBut even Wilder must have thought Dean Henderson's goal had been breached when Snodgrass' late effort crept in. The men in front of the screens at Stockley Park had other ideas.\nSheff Utd boss Wilder extends contract until 2024\nReaction to Sheffield United v West Ham\nWest Ham's goalkeeping nightmare\nFabianski injury may force Moyes into market\nIt was on the 13-minute mark when visiting keeper Lukasz Fabianski took a goal-kick and immediately signalled to the bench he had a problem.\nThe Poland international was only into his fourth game back after surgery to fix a torn hip muscle that had kept him out for three months.\nThat injury effectively cost Manuel Pellegrini his job given Fabianski's deputy, Roberto, failed to keep a clean sheet in seven Premier League games, none of which the Hammers won.\nFabianski's frustration was obvious as he beat the ground, then sat sadly in his penalty area, waiting for West Ham's medical team to arrive.\nThe pushes and prods visible from the media seats suggested a repeat of his past problem. Either way, his game was over.\nMartin was only meant to be a training keeper after his arrival from Millwall but the son of former Hammers legend Alvin was called off the bench. It really did not work out well.\nHe played a routine goal-kick straight to Fleck, who ran into the box to square to McBurnie for the only goal.\nWest Ham are aiming to sign another keeper, with Middlesbrough's Darren Randolph lined up for a return to his former club. But the deal is on hold as he is also injured at present.\nMcBurnie's decisive interventions\nMcBurnie has only scored four Premier League goals since his club record \u00a320m move from Swansea last summer but he has managed some important ones within that total.\nThe Scotland striker's injury-time equaliser against Manchester United in November will go down in Blades folklore.\nHis first-half effort at Brighton proved to be the match-winner and his latest effort broke the deadlock in one of those scruffy games the hosts need to win if they are to continue their present trajectory.\nIn truth, McBurnie, brought up in Leeds, did not have much to do and rolling the ball under Martin was too close to failure for comfort.\nIt was reward for an honest night's work though. With his socks rolled down and slightly lumbering running style, McBurnie is old-school in the way he plays the game - which is why Sheffield United's fans love having him around and gave him a standing ovation when he was substituted six minutes from time.\nMan of the match - John Fleck (Sheffield United)\n'We'd have been devastated if we'd drawn'\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder speaking to BBC Sport: \"I feel for David [Moyes] and the players. The same thing has happened to us a few times. But we would've been devastated if we'd have drawn that game.\n\"Soon as they scored, no one was looking at it but I felt for the opposition - it's the same moans and groans as we've had in the past.\n\"We had to improve the performance because tonight wasn't at our best. We've had to grind one out. We gave the ball away cheaply. We had two or three really good chances but didn't take them.\n\"We made a poor decision late in the game but that's what happens when you go backwards and they came on to us.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes speaking to BBC Sport: \"First of all I thought my players were terrific. We didn't deserve to lose.\n\"It was a good goal. Anybody who has played football or been around the game knows it was a good goal. Declan Rice did really good to break through the middle.\n\"I'm just telling you it's a really good goal. From my point of view and the people who watch football, the decision is not right.\n\"I wouldn't say I'm a great fan [of VAR] but we have to come to terms with it. People who have played football know when it's not right and tonight is one of those situations.\"\nThe stats - Zabaleta reaches 300 mark\nWest Ham's defeat means London clubs have now lost their past eight Premier League games at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United, since Chelsea won 2-0 in October 2006.\nSheffield United have won 14 points from the last 21 available at home in the Premier League (W4 D2 L1), with their only defeat in this run coming against Newcastle at the beginning of December (2-0).\nWest Ham are the first team since Southampton in March 2016 to fail to score in four consecutive visits to newly-promoted clubs in the Premier League.\nHammers boss David Moyes suffered his first defeat by Sheffield United in any competition in seven games (W4 D2), since a 3-2 loss as Preston manager in December 2000 in the second tier.\nDavid Martin and Roberto have made a combined three errors leading to a goal in 13 appearances for West Ham in the Premier League this season, whereas Lukasz Fabianski is yet to do so in 10 games this campaign.\nSheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson has kept eight clean sheets in the Premier League this season - the joint-most in the competition in 2019-20 alongside Leicester's Kasper Schmeichel.\nWest Ham full-back Pablo Zabaleta made his 300th Premier League appearance (230 for Man City, 70 for West Ham), becoming just the third South American to reach this total after Nolberto Solano (302) and Antonio Valencia (325).\nWhat next?\nWest Ham are next in action against Everton at the London Stadium on Saturday, 18 January (15:00 GMT).

Arsenal have now failed to win five league matches this season after leading at half-time.\nPalace fight back\nInjury-hit Palace came into this match above Arsenal in the Premier League table, having lost only one of their previous eight league matches, but looked far from settled as they struggled to cope with their revitalised opponents in the first half.\nTheir frustration was evident but they started to show signs of getting back into the game later in the half, having a penalty appeal waved away after claiming Cheikhou Kouyate's attempted cross struck Luiz on the arm. Kouyate then went close to an equaliser as half-time approached, his powerful effort parried away by Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno.\nHodgson's side started the second half just as they had finished the first, and deserved Ayew's equaliser.\nPlayed in by Kouyate, Ayew's effort took a huge deflection of Luiz's boot as he became the first Palace player to score home and away against Arsenal in a single season since John Craven during the 1971-72 campaign.\nPrior to the match, anti-VAR t-shirts had been sold outside Selhurst Park and Palace fans displayed a banner stating it was \"killing the game\", yet it was the hosts who benefitted from the technology when Aubameyang was dismissed, handing them a man advantage.\nThey tried to make it count too, with Tomkins - captain in the absence of the suspended Luka Milivojevic - having a header cleared off the line.\nTomkins was booked after a poor challenge on Arsenal substitute Gabriel Martinelli, while Wilfried Zaha had a penalty shout waved away as the clocked ticked over into injury time.\nThe draw means the Eagles have now lost only one of their 14 league fixtures this season against teams below them in the table.\nMan of the match - Jairo Riedewald (Crystal Palace)\n'I thought we were good value' - what they said\nMatch stats\nCrystal Palace have gone four consecutive league games without defeat against Arsenal for the first time (W1 D3).\nArsenal have failed to win any of their last 15 Premier League away games against sides starting the day above them in the table (D4 L11), since a 5-2 victory at Leicester back in September 2015.\n95% of Crystal Palace forward Jordan Ayew's Premier League goals have been scored in the second half (21/22) - the highest percentage of any player in the competition to have scored at least 10 goals.\nArsenal pair Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette have combined for 10 Premier League goals since the Gabonese striker's debut in the competition - only Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson (13) have combined for more in that time (since Feb 2018).\nArsenal named the same starting XI (against Man Utd and Crystal Palace) in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since January 2019 (against Fulham and West Ham).\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Manchester City and Arsenal host Sheffield United on Saturday, 18 January (both 15:00 GMT)."

He was ruthless in front of goal too, taking his tally to 63 goals for United.\nHe now has 19 goals this season, the most in any campaign since his debut in 2015, and at 22 years and two months he became the fourth youngest United player to 200 games for the club behind legends Norman Whiteside, George Best and Ryan Giggs.\nBut Rashford's withdrawal for Daniel James on 59 minutes meant United remain without a player scoring a Premier League hat-trick since Robin van Persie against Aston Villa in April 2013 - a victory that clinched their 20th and most recent league title.\nFellow academy products Williams and Greenwood both enhanced their reputations, the left-back making marauding runs up and down pitch and winning the penalty, contributing five interceptions, while striker Greenwood came off the bench to take his tally to nine for the campaign.\n\"Beyond proud to become the third youngest player to hit 200 Man Utd games,\" Rashford wrote on his official Twitter account.\n, external\n\"Can't put into words what it means to follow Giggsy and George Best. Giggsy was massive in getting my first opportunity so extra special for me. Grateful to everyone who's helped me get to where I am.\"\nUnited fans protest\nWith the game won despite more than half an hour remaining, United fans in the Stretford End turned to protest at how the club is being run.\nThere were loud chants of \"we want Glazers out\" and also aiming their frustration at executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who was sitting in his seat up behind the dugout and the man who deals with transfer negotiations.\nThe chants spread to other parts of the ground and the singing continued for around 20 minutes in the second half.\nAshley Young has agreed a deal to join Inter Milan but that could be brought forward to this transfer window, while it's not certain any players are coming in.\nThe agent of Sporting Lisbon midfielder Bruno Fernandes was reportedly in London on Friday and it remains to be seen whether a deal is forthcoming for a player who was heavily linked with United in the summer.\nNorwich still in deep trouble\nTime is running out for beleaguered Norwich, anchored to the bottom and now with just one victory from their last 17 league games.\nTeenage striker Adam Idah, 18, scored a hat-trick in the FA Cup against Preston last weekend and came in to replace injured top scorer Teemu Pukki, but could not assert himself against Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof as United kept only their fourth clean sheet this term.\nCantwell has impressed for Norwich this season and it could have been a different result had he taken his chance just before the interval, opening up his body and curling a shot that was pushed out by De Gea.\nThey shocked champions Manchester City earlier in the season at Carrow Road but could not repeat the result this time as they were thoroughly outplayed and have now conceded 45 league goals, more than any other team.\nMan of the match - Juan Mata (Manchester United)\n'We are taking more steps forward'\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Very happy. We started on the front foot. When you can walk off, and I am sure the opposition are talking about Manchester United as a very hard working team, that is what I want from my team.\n\"In any Premier League game you have to take advantage of the pressure and domination you get. Second half was very good.\n\"We reacted today, we can bounce back and we are taking more than two or three steps forward before one back, because behind the scenes we know we are doing good work.\"\nOn Marcus Rashford: \"Fantastic effort by Marcus getting to 200 games so quickly. He got through most of the game, he is struggling a little bit so we took him off. He kept his cool. Very pleased with Marcus.\"\nNorwich boss Daniel Farke: \"When you are 3-0 down against probably the best counter-attacking side in the league, it is then difficult to win the game so today we have to accept the better side won.\n\"We gave the first goal away, sloppy in our defending, but you are still in the game. We had a good spell before half-time with Todd Cantwell and a great save by the goalkeeper.\n\"I was pleased with the reaction at 4-0. We had to stick together in the last 20 minutes. We are disappointed but we also know a game at Old Trafford is not a season-defining game for us.\n\"We are definitely in the worst position (in the league) but we are competitive. This is what can happen at this level. We are realistic.\"\nThe stats - United hit scoring form at home\nManchester United have scored 4+ goals in consecutive home league games for the first time since September 2017.\nNorwich are winless in nine Premier League matches (D4 L5) - their worst run since between January-March 2016 (10 games).\nManchester United have kept two clean sheets in their last three Premier League games, as many as in their previous 30 in the competition.\nDespite having conceded the most goals in the Premier League this season (45), this is the first time Norwich have conceded more than twice in an away game since the opening day of the season (1-4 at Liverpool).\nMarcus Rashford has scored 19 goals in all competitions this season - only Raheem Sterling (20) has more among Premier League players.\nJuan Mata provided two assists in a Premier League game for the first time since October 2012, also against Norwich.\nAnthony Martial has been involved in 14 goals in 22 games in all competitions for United this season (11 goals, 3 assists), as many as in 38 appearances last term (12 goals, 2 assists).\nMason Greenwood has scored four Premier League goals this season, the most by any teenager in the competition.\nWhat next?\nManchester United host Wolves in the FA Cup third-round replay on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) before travelling to Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday (16:30).\nNorwich are at home to Bournemouth in the league on Saturday (15:00)."

I don't think there's a club out there which has 12 or 13 players missing,\" Bruce said.\n\"They ran a million miles and their resilience was there for everyone to see. We lacked a bit of quality in the top end of the pitch but I couldn't fault their effort and endeavour. I thought it was going to be a repeat of when we lost four players in 12 minutes against Leicester.\n\"Joe [Joelinton] had the courage to carry on [with a groin problem] when we were down to the bare bones. It's ridiculous, I've never known anything like it in 40 years.\"\nWhile Wolves move up to seventh in the table, they produced an unusually flat performance at Molineux in their 37th game of the campaign.\nLeander Dendoncker's equaliser from Joao Moutinho's corner should have laid the platform for them to take advantage of Newcastle's problems.\nBut instead they struggled to convert possession into meaningful scoring chances.\n\"I'm not frustrated. I think we didn't play well enough to win,\" said head coach Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\"We didn't move the ball fast enough. Fast circulation of the ball allows you to open spaces, but that was one of the issues today.\"\nFollow live reaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nWolves lack cutting edge\nWhile Wolves largely had control of the ball, this was the fourth consecutive game in all competitions in which Nuno's side have struggled to find a cutting edge.\nSince their victory over Manchester City on 27 December, they have failed to muster more than four shots on target in any game.\nWolves have also now conceded first in an unrivalled 15 league games this season, including the past six in a row.\nAnd while they huffed and puffed, particularly in the closing stages, a victory against Newcastle would have flattered the hosts, despite their recovery from another sluggish start.\nAdama Traore was the sole bright spark, supplying all of Wolves' best moments in open play.\nAccording to media reports,\n, external\nTraore was sounded out over pursuing a career in the NFL while at Barcelona.\nAnd at times he appeared like an American Football running back, barging through, evading and accelerating clear of Newcastle defenders.\nHis right-wing cross provided Mexican forward Raul Jimenez with a first-half opportunity to equal Steven Fletcher's club record of 22 Premier League goals and he supplied Pedro Neto with a similar headed chance 14 minutes from the end, but Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka saved superbly from both players.\nNewcastle's walking wounded show their spirit\nAt his press briefing on Friday, Bruce provided updates on the fitness of 14 players.\nAnd while six of those he namechecked were fit to play in the Midlands, early injuries to Dummett and Gayle undermined Newcastle's bright start to the game.\nDummett, returning after missing four matches, went off injured in the 13th minute and although Newcastle reorganised, Wolves equalised with a goal that will surely perplex Bruce. Moutinho's corner cleared several players before dropping into Dendoncker's path.\nAfter that, however, the Magpies manager could have no such complaints and was clearly satisfied with his team's endeavour, fight and football intelligence at the final whistle.\nWhile Dubravka twice rescued Newcastle, there were also solid performances from the likes of Ciaran Clark and Sean and Matty Longstaff.\nMatty Longatsff, at 19 the younger of the two brothers, epitomised his team's approach in the closing stages, allowing Raul Jimenez to clatter into him to relieve pressure that had been building on the visitors.\nMan of the match - Martin Dubravka (Newcastle)\nWorldwide Wolves - the stats\nWolves have recovered 15 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season - more than any other side in the competition.\nSeven of the 10 Premier League meetings between Wolves and Newcastle have finished level (one Wolves win, two Newcastle) - the joint-highest percentage of meetings ending in a draw (70%) of any Premier League fixture to be played on 10 or more occasions (level with Stoke City v Wigan Athletic).\nWolves have conceded the first goal in 15 of their 22 Premier League matches this season, at least two more than any other side in the division in 2019-20.\nEach of Wolves' last 50 Premier League goals have been scored by non-English players (excluding own goals), only the sixth occasion of a side having 50+ consecutive non-English scorers in the competition, and the first since Stoke in December 2016 (59).\nNewcastle forward Almiron has scored in back-to-back games in all competitions for Newcastle; he had only scored in one of his first 30 appearances for the club before this.\nAlmiron has scored with both of his past two shots on target in the Premier League; he hadn't scored with any of his first 15 attempts on target in the competition prior to this.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle host Rochdale in their FA Cup third-round replay on Tuesday, 14 January (19:45 GMT).

        "article_text": "Everton 1-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: Richarlison scores winner for Carlo Ancelotti's side\nEverton produced a dominant display to beat Brighton in the Premier League as they responded well to their humiliating FA Cup defeat by Liverpool last Sunday.\nThe Toffees deservedly took the lead after 38 minutes thanks to the superb skill of Brazilian forward Richarlison, who controlled Lucas Digne's pass, swivelled and curled an effort low into the far corner past Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan.\nEverton thought they had doubled their lead in the second half when Dominic Calvert-Lewin bundled the ball over the line but a video assistant referee (VAR) check disallowed the goal for handball.\nVAR had earlier been called into action when Theo Walcott broke through on goal four minutes in, before appearing to be pulled back by Seagulls captain Lewis Dunk inside the box.\nBut the penalty appeal was waved away, much to the dismay of a packed Goodison Park.\nThe win for Carlo Ancelotti's side means they are 11th, level on 28 points with Arsenal.\nBrighton, who remain without a victory at Goodison Park, are four points above the relegation zone in 14th place.\nFollow live reaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nEverton respond the right way for Ancelotti\nIt had been a turbulent week for Everton and Ancelotti following the embarrassment of losing to a hugely inexperienced Liverpool side in the FA Cup third round.\nDirector of football Marcel Brands addressed a small group of angry supporters at the club's training headquarters, while Ancelotti spoke to Fabian Delph after he made a \"mistake\" getting involved in a social media confrontation with a supporter.\nThe Italian boss said in his pre-match notes: \"Today marks the start of a fresh period for Everton... It will take time to wash away the disappointment.\"\nAnd while there were some boos from sections of the crowd when Delph came on for the impressive Bernard on 71 minutes, that was the only real sour note for the home side.\nThe Toffess were quick out of the blocks and, after Walcott's penalty appeal was rejected, continued to apply pressure. Digne and the excellent Bernard, in particular, caused problems for Brighton down the left-hand side.\nEverton were finally rewarded for their 60% possession in the opening 45 minutes when Richarlison, who has signed a new deal that will keep him at Goodison Park until summer 2024, controlled Digne's pass before curling an inch-perfect shot into the far corner of the Brighton goal.\nJordan Pickford was called into action in the closing stages to deny Glenn Murray from rescuing a point for the visitors. The England keeper dived to his right to stop a strong downward header and secure the win.\nThis was Ancelotti's third in the Premier League with Everton since taking over from Marco Silva in December and was also the Toffees' 10th clean sheet in the past 16 home league games.\nAre Brighton really moving forward?\nBrighton were also looking for some form of redemption from this game after they suffered their own third-round defeat in the FA Cup - at home to Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.\nBut the Seagulls have won only twice on the road in the Premier League this season and they were restricted to few chances.\nTheir best opportunity of the first half came when Martin Montoya's knockdown was volleyed over by Alireza Jahanbakhsh.\nGraham Potter's side found themselves with more opportunities in the second half as they pushed forward looking for an equaliser and substitute Murray, who had recovered from a knock to boost Brighton's attacking options, almost snatched a point on 89 minutes as Neal Maupay poked the ball through the Everton defence but the striker's chip over Pickford fell agonisingly wide.\nThe defeat means Brighton are two points worse off than they were at the same stage of last season under Potter's predecessor Chris Hughton. Like 12 months ago, they are four points above the bottom three with 16 games remaining.\nHughton was sacked after a slump in the second half of the campaign meant they only just avoided relegation. Potter, who has been praised for the way he has developed Brighton's playing style, will hope he does not find himself in a similar fight to avoid the drop.\nMan of the match - Bernard (Everton)\n'We were determined to have three points'\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I'm quite happy. For 60 minutes the performance was good, at the end it was normal to suffer a little bit at 1-0 up.\n\"We were determined to have three points at the end and this is the most important thing.\n\"The response of the players was good. The support of the stadium is really important for us. When we play here we want to feel at home and I hope the next game will be the same because it is really important.\"\nOn Theo Walcott's penalty appeal: \"I think it was a penalty, I'm surprised, I think he tried to score and didn't fall down. Usually if he falls it is a penalty. The work of the referee is not easy but maybe with VAR it could be more simple.\"\nBrighton manager Graham Potter, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We tried, we put a lot into the game, the effort was there and we hit the bar but we didn't do enough to get that goal. The difference was a great finish and we were not able to execute that today.\n\"We stepped up in the second half and I thought we were a bit better. You want to come away with something but we haven't and we have to dust ourselves off. At 1-0 they're happy to hang on with that.\n\"You have to take the positives, it wasn't all bad but if you don't get points you have to do better. We have to be at our maximum - effort wise today we were there but we lacked the quality.\"\nHome clean sheets a bonus for Toffees - match stats\nSince the start of last season, only Liverpool (15) have kept more home clean sheets in the Premier League than Everton (14).\nEverton manager Ancelotti has now registered a victory against 22 of the 23 teams that he has faced in the Premier League, only failing to beat his current side Everton in the competition.\nAncelotti is the fifth Everton manager to win three of his first four Premier League games in charge and the first since Sam Allardyce (also David Moyes, Joe Royle and Ronald Koeman).\nThe home side has never lost in the six Premier League meetings between Everton and Brighton (won five, drawn one), with the Toffees winning all three games at Goodison Park.\nBrighton have never won away against Everton in any competition in their history, drawing two and losing six of their eight visits to Goodison Park.\nEverton's Richarlison has been directly involved in 11 Premier League goals this season (eight goals, three assists), more than any other player at the club.\nSince his Premier League debut for Everton in August 2018, Richarlison has scored 21 goals for the Toffees in the competition, seven more than any other player.\nSince the start of last season, defender Lucas Digne (eight) has provided more assists than any other Everton player in the Premier League (four in 2019-20 and four in 2018-19).\nWhat next?\nBoth sides are in 15:00 GMT action on Saturday, 18 January, with Everton travelling to the London Stadium to face West Ham and Brighton at home to Aston Villa."

        "article_text": "Leicester 1-2 Southampton: Danny Ings scores late winner\nSouthampton were not motivated by revenge for their 9-0 thrashing by Leicester City in October as they claimed a surprise win at King Power Stadium, says Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl.\nHasenhuttl's men claimed a deserved victory at the home of the Premier League's second-placed team courtesy of in-form striker Danny Ings' late winner.\nThe Foxes, who were searching for a third successive league win, took an early lead when Dennis Praet tapped in his first goal for the club.\nBut any thoughts of another easy victory for Brendan Rodgers' side were quickly dispelled when Stuart Armstrong equalised with a deflected shot.\nIngs, who has now scored 10 goals in his last 10 league starts, was a thorn in Leicester's side all afternoon and having already struck the crossbar twice, he slotted through Kasper Schmeichel's legs late on.\nLeicester thought they had salvaged a draw with a 90th-minute equaliser from Jonny Evans but the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled it out for offside.\n\"We deserved to win it because we had so many chances. It was a fantastic team performance again,\" said Hassenhuttl.\n\"If you concede the first goal against a team who has previously scored nine against you, you have to be very mentally strong to respond.\n\"But we left everything on the pitch and we were a little bit unlucky in the first half, so you could feel we had the potential to win the game at half-time.\n\"We didn't want to have revenge, we wanted to show ourselves how far we've gone in our development.\"\nThe victory sees Southampton remain 12th, but move level on points with Everton and Arsenal, while Leicester stay second but 16 points behind Liverpool, who beat Tottenham.\nThe victory represents a remarkable turnaround from the previous result between the sides but it was nothing more than the visitors deserved having dominated in the first half and matched Leicester in the second.\nBut while the Saints shaded the chances, Leicester did have the ball in the net on another two occasions - through Jamie Vardy then Kelechi Iheanacho - but both efforts were disallowed for offside by the on-field officials.\nSaints were also awarded a penalty in the second half when Caglar Soyuncu bundled Shane Long over in the box but VAR also overturned that decision.\nRelive Leicester 1-2 Southampton\nFollow the rest of this afternoon's Premier League action\nGutsy Saints earn deserved victory\nFew could forget the last Premier League match between these two sides - when Leicester ran riot at St Mary's to claim a record-breaking win.\nBut since that harrowing night, Hasenhuttl's side have turned a corner - collecting 20 points from a possible 36.\nThat total is especially impressive when you take into account it includes wins over Chelsea, Tottenham and now Leicester.\nThe south coast side are now five games unbeaten in the league and on the evidence of this performance it is easy to see why; they were excellent from the first whistle, with Praet's opener coming against the run of play.\nSo when they equalised when Armstrong's strike found the net, albeit with a heavy deflection off James Maddison, it was not too much of a surprise.\nThey could have easily gone into the break ahead too, with Ings twice denied by the crossbar as half-time approached.\nLeicester were a sterner test in the second half but Saints more than matched them and they would have had a penalty but for the intervention of VAR.\nIngs and Long both worked tirelessly in attack, with the former deservedly getting on the scoresheet late on, but it was the defensive display which will have pleased Hasenhuttl most.\nThey limited the usually creative Foxes to just a few chances and when Saints did come under pressure, Alex McCarthy and Jack Stephens stood firm.\nLacklustre Foxes suffer with heavy schedule\nFoxes boss Rodgers made just two changes to the side held by Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday and his side looked a little heavy-legged.\nThey were off the pace from the start and Praet's tap-in from Vardy's cross came from their first real chance.\nAnd while they did improve in the second half, with Maddison dictating play with more composure, they were still unable to play with their usual flow.\nThey were also more open at the back than usual, too, with holding midfielder Hamza Choudhury unable to give his back four the same protection usually provided by the injured Wilfred Ndidi.\nHowever, it's perhaps unsurprising Leicester's players looked a little lacklustre, given they played nine matches between 14 December and the match with Saints.\nThat is a hectic schedule even by the Premier League's standards and means Rodgers is likely to be thankful for the eight-day break before they travel to Burnley on 19 January for their next match.\nMan of the match - Danny Ings (Southampton)\n'It couldn't have gone any better' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"You could feel in every second of the game that we could win today. So to come back from behind one down with the history of the first game - it was so intense.\n\"It was a very important game for us this season to see how we play now - we have changed our mindset and worked to hard to play in a successful way. Watching this team is enjoyable at the moment.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"The performance probably didn't merit anything from the game. The players kept going right to the end and kept fighting.\n\"We didn't press the game strong enough, or well enough, and then when we had the ball, we made too many mistakes when we had the ball.\n\"So, it looked like up until the end, it was going to be a draw, which we would have taken because we didn't play well. \"However, they played through our midfield too easily and then they get in and get the goal, so a disappointing result for us.\"\nSouthampton striker Danny Ings on BBC Match of the Day: \"I am just happy to be scoring goals for the team. You saw today, the team do their best to provide the chances, they work so hard behind me I feel there is a little bit more pressure to put them away.\n\"After hitting the bar twice I thought maybe it wasn't my day but we all stuck in there and I thought we deserved to win. How we have been over Christmas and since then has been massive for us and the club moving forward and long may it continue.\n\"It speaks for itself, the work we do on the pitch, we did everything we could at that time to turn it round [after the 9-0 defeat to Leicester], it couldn't have gone any better than that. I'm so proud of us as a team and how far we have come.\"\nIngs' hot streak continues - the stats\nSouthampton have claimed three away Premier League victories in a row.\nLeicester have lost consecutive home Premier League games for the first time under Brendan Rodgers, having been defeated in just one of their first 14 matches at the King Power under him in the competition (W10 D3 L1).\nSouthampton are the first side to concede 10+ goals against a specific opponent (Leicester City) in a single Premier League season since Everton did so against Arsenal in 2017-18 (10).\nLeicester City have scored the opening goal in 13 of their 22 Premier League games this season (W11 D0 L2) - only Manchester City (14), Chelsea (15) and Liverpool (16) have done so on more occasions in 2019-20.\n40% of Danny Ings' Premier League goals have been scored this season (14/35) - indeed, he is the highest-scoring player for the Saints in a single Premier League season since Jay Rodriguez in 2013-14 (15).\nDennis Praet is the 14th different player to score a Premier League goal for Leicester this season, only Liverpool have had more (excluding own goals). Indeed, only in 2016-17 (16) have the Foxes had more different scorers in a season.\nLeicester's Jamie Vardy has had a hand in 21 Premier League goals this season (17 goals, four assists) - two more than any other player.\nStuart Armstrong's equaliser was his fourth Premier League goal for Southampton and his first since December 2018 (against Manchester United), ending a run of 34 appearances in the competition without finding the net.\nWhat's next?\nNext up for Southampton is a home Premier League game with Wolves on Saturday, 18 January (15:00 GMT), while Leicester travel to Burnley the following day (14:00)."

We should have scored more but I can't complain because we scored in the first half. We've got nervous before when we've had a measure of possession but not scored,\" Lampard said.\n\"We were so positive from minute one. It's a big win and one we must pick up on and replicate. It's a nice example of the standard we have set.\n\"It feels nice to smile in a game and enjoy what you are watching.\"\nAs the saying goes, goals change games, and the two Chelsea scored here in the first half are firm evidence as to the truth of this.\nFor 25 minutes, the Blues looked like a side who have suffered at home at the hands of defensive-minded opponents.\nWest Ham, Bournemouth and Southampton - sides then with form and league position not dissimilar to Burnley - have all been to west London and left with a clean sheet and three unexpected points.\nDespite adding the inventive Ross Barkley to a midfield three already containing Mason Mount they lacked the incisiveness and crispness of passing required to open up a well-drilled Clarets.\nBut they were given a foothold in the game - one from which their victory was built - through Lowton's ill-advised sliding challenge on Willian in the box.\nThe Brazilian showed an element of canniness, ensuring contact to maximise the ugliness of the challenge, but such recklessness is rarely tolerated.\nPope's offence was greater. He is a talented keeper, but flapped at Abraham's downward header, failing to make contact with the ball as it sped past him and in.\nThat left 50 minutes for the Clarets to play with defeat almost inevitable.\nHudson-Odoi made sure of that with his neat finish almost immediately after the break, allowing Chelsea to cruise.\nBurnley in free fall\nBurnley's season has been a repeated case of one step forward, two steps back. Three times they have put together encouraging back-to-back results, only to then lose successive games.\nThe result at Stamford Bridge - their fourth defeat on the spin - represents a new low for the campaign, maybe not in terms of performance but certainly as regards form and league position.\nThere are mitigating circumstances, with manager Sean Dyche largely reliant on one consistent attacking threat in Chris Wood, because of injuries to Ashley Barnes and Jay Rodriguez.\nHe almost lost Wood too during this game, with damage to his nose in the first half requiring him to twice leave the field for treatment.\nDyche's attempted solution to his side's current dire run and a return of just five goals from nine games was to play Jeff Hendrick behind Wood as part of a five-man midfield.\nIt worked in the first quarter, but had too little dynamism and attacking instinct to turn the tide once the second goal went in.\nAaron Lennon offered little, Dwight McNeil was shackled and Wood was left an isolated figure.\n\"We've got no complaints about the result,\" said Dyche. \"I know Chelsea have been a bit up and down here but I didn't think that was relevant. They are still a strong side.\n\"This is the Premier League. You come out of two wins and suddenly you lose four on the spin. It creeps up on you. We have to fight for everything. We have always had to do that.\n\"The confidence gets sucked out of players if they are not winning. We are trying to revive that.\"\nTo add to the Clarets' woes, some of their rivals at the bottom have shown a dramatic upturn in fortune. Watford's new manager bounce and Southampton's rejuvenation have blown the battle at the bottom wide open.\nEven West Ham and Aston Villa have shown signs of life, the latter most significantly in their 2-1 win at Turf Moor on New Year's Day.\nConsidering that all seven of Burnley's wins this season have come against sides currently occupying a spot in the bottom half of the table, their next games against Leicester, Manchester United and Arsenal are an extremely daunting prospect.\nPick up some points from these fixtures and optimism will return. Lose all three and the pressure to get anything from subsequent encounters against Southampton, Bournemouth and Newcastle will be monumental.\nMan of the match - Reece James (Chelsea)\nBurnley continue to struggle against big sides - match stats\nChelsea registered their first league double against Burnley since the 2009-10 campaign under Carlo Ancelotti.\nBurnley are winless away from home in the Premier League against opposing teams starting the day in the top four (D4 L12).\nChelsea have only lost one of their 12 Premier League games against Burnley (W8 D3), finding the back of the net in each match. Only versus Wigan (16), Derby (14) and Portsmouth (14) have they registered a better 100% scoring record vs an opponent in the competition.\nBurnley have collected just one point in 11 Premier League games this season against teams currently in the top-half of the division (W0 D1 L10), drawing 1-1 with Wolves back in August.\nTammy Abraham has scored 13 Premier League goals for Chelsea this season - Frank Lampard is the only Englishman to score more in a single campaign in the competition for the club (3 occasions).\nChelsea's Jorginho has scored nine of his 10 penalties taken in the top five European leagues, including all three for the Blues in the Premier League.\nNo Chelsea defender has had a hand in more goals in all competitions this season than Cesar Azpilicueta (3 goals, 3 assists).\nAt 19 years and 65 days, Callum Hudson-Odoi became the youngest player to score their first Premier League goal for Chelsea since Carlton Cole against Middlesbrough in April 2002 (18y 197d).\nWhat next?\nChelsea travel to Newcastle for the Premier League's evening game on Saturday, 18 January. Burnley host Leicester the following day."

It is only the start. We need to continue because our contenders are so strong.\n\"Pep (Guardiola, Manchester City boss) will not give up. I will do the same. So far, so really good.\"\nKlopp's men have now amassed 104 points across their last 38 Premier League matches, scoring in all 21 of their matches this term.\nThat record was maintained in London by Brazil forward Firmino, who turned Spurs' young debutant Japhet Tanganga and beat Paulo Gazzaniga with a sweet left-foot strike to give the visitors a deserved lead.\nHowever Liverpool were then grateful for poor finishing from Jose Mourinho's side - who were without the injured Harry Kane - in order to record another victory on their seemingly relentless march to a first title in three decades.\nSon Heung-Min and substitute Giovani lo Celso missed excellent second-half chances to give Spurs some reward for a performance that improved as the game went on.\n'Liverpool now operate on a different level to Spurs'\nWhy Liverpool's run from start of season tops Bayern, Barca and Juve\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nThe various ways Minamino will help Liverpool\nBut Liverpool, their position at the top strengthened further by Leicester City's shock home loss to Southampton, held on to increase the sense of formality about the destination of this season's Premier League trophy.\nLiverpool not at most fluent - but win again\nLiverpool may not have been at their best - there were even spells in the second half when they looked jaded - but this is a team on a seemingly unstoppable run to the Premier League title.\nThis was their 12th successive league win and it is a remarkable feat to have dropped only two league points from their first 21 games.\nIt is true they were let off by Spurs' missed chances but there is perhaps a sense that Liverpool's dominance is having a psychological impact on their opponents so that when rare opportunities come along, they are being snatched at.\nAnd even when not in prime form, Liverpool's forward line is so potent that there is always a goal in them - as Firmino proved with his neat 37th-minute sidestep and thumping finish.\nSpurs will claim, with justification, they should have had a throw-in before the goal but Liverpool are now being propelled with growing momentum to end that long wait to reclaim their perch at the summit of the English game.\nSpurs lack killer instinct\nThe root of Spurs' downfall came in two distinct aspects of their performance - albeit one did get better as the game wore on.\nIn the first half, Spurs were far too passive and negative as they sat back, presumably waiting for an opportunity to strike on the counter attack.\nThe tactic was undone by Firmino's goal, leaving Spurs with no option but to be more positive in the second period.\nIt was then, without the marksmanship of long-term injury victim Kane, that they were so wasteful in front of goal - with both Son and Lo Celso missing when it seemed easier to score.\nLo Celso's miss, in particular, left Mourinho openly lamenting his side's absence of a clinical edge as he collapsed dramatically to his knees after the Argentina midfielder failed to hit the target from close range.\nSpurs' wasteful moments against Liverpool may well further convince their manager he has to strengthen his attacking options in this transfer window as the fight for a top-four place intensifies.\nMan of the match - Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\n'This is the best team in the world' - what they said\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport: \"This is football. Sometimes you get more than you deserve. Sometimes you get less. This was an occasion when we got nothing when we deserved something. This is the best team in the world against a team in a difficult moment, with injuries, in a difficult part of the season. The boys were fantastic when we tried to change and create problems.\"\nOn a potential handball in the build-up to the goal: \"I didn't watch it. What I watch is 200% that the throw in for the start of the goal was our throw. I am confused with VAR because of that.\"\nOn finishing in the top four: \"It is possible to talk about top four when you start the season on zero points. But it is hard to talk about it when you start at minus 12 (the number of points off the top four Spurs were when he took over).\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was very hard-fought because we didn't close the game down early. We should have been one or 2-0 up already when we scored. If you have a quality opponent like Tottenham and you don't close the game they will come back. Allison makes things look easy. It is not what we would have wanted. It is intense, you lose the ball and you are facing one of the best counter-attacking sides. We had Robbo (Andy Robertson) free two or three times and he didn't find a team-mate, so we didn't help ourselves.\"\nOn his side's defensive record: \"We needed Allison for that today. We had a few dips defensively. Some games he has not had a lot to do with us winning the ball high early.

It's not a season-changing result - but it was an important one.\n\"We talked very early on about how we'd have to have a substantial run at some point. We're on a good run, but we probably need to win another six games, maybe more.\n\"We've put ourselves in a better position than we were in a few weeks ago, and that's all I'm prepared to say at the moment.\"\nBournemouth boss Howe 'will have to reflect on position'\nFootball Daily podcast: Desperate times for Villa and Bournemouth\nPearson's winning run continues\nOnly Liverpool and Manchester City have collected more points than Watford since Pearson's appointment in December, a run of form that has seen the club go from six points adrift at the bottom of the table to out of the relegation zone.\nAlso in the impressive run:\nWatford have now picked up 13 points from the last 15 available, as many as they won across their previous 22 Premier League matches;\nThe Hornets have scored the opening goal in their past five league games, having done so in just four of their previous 17. Only leaders Liverpool (past 10) are on a longer such run;\nPearson (P15 W11 D2 L2) is the first English manager to win at least 11 matches across a 15-game spell in the Premier League since former Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp in January 2012 (also 11).\nWatford raise hopes of great escape\nPearson's side pressed high up the pitch early on as Bournemouth attempted to play out from the back, forcing mistakes that created two early opportunities for Ismaila Sarr and Gerard Deulofeu that were well saved by Cherries goalkeeper Mark Travers.\nTravers was making his first Premier League start of the season in the absence of the injured Aaron Ramsdale and it was his error shortly before the break that led to the opener.\nThe 20-year-old, under pressure from Deulofeu, gave the ball straight to Sarr on the edge of the area. The Senegal winger then crossed into the six-yard box for Doucoure, who took a touch before blasting the ball into the roof of the net for his second goal in as many matches.\nAs Bournemouth committed more men forward in the second half Watford looked to hit on the counter, with Sarr and Doucoure combining for Deulofeu to slice wide shortly after the restart.\nThey deservedly grabbed their second on 65 minutes when Sarr's cross was deflected into the path of Deeney, who drove powerfully into the corner beyond an unmoved Travers.\nDeeney and Deulofeu both went close as Bournemouth became increasingly ragged, with Pereyra wrapping up a fine win with virtually the last kick of the game after Andre Gray's shot had been cleared off the line by Ryan Fraser.\nBournemouth's slide continues\nBournemouth started a game in relegation zone for the first time in more than two years after being as high as seventh when they beat Manchester United at the start of November.\nSince then the south-coast club have taken just four points from their last 11 matches, losing nine, to leave manager Eddie Howe under increasing pressure.\nHowe said in his programme notes that this game marked a \"season-defining period\" for the Cherries, with their next three league games after today against sides currently in the bottom seven.\nBut any hopes of a bright start to settle early nerves proved unfounded, with the home side sloppy in possession as they struggled to break free of Watford's high press.\nTheir best chance of the first half came from a set-piece, with Harry Wilson's curling free-kick well pushed away by Ben Foster.\nThey failed to muster a single shot on target in the second period, with the game virtually over as a contest once Watford had scored their second goal.\nPlenty of Bournemouth fans had already left by the final whistle, with a number of those remaining booing a third successive Premier League defeat without scoring a goal.\nMan of the match - Troy Deeney (Watford)\n'We are in a difficult moment' - what they said\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe speaking to Match of the Day: \"Tough game, we battled and stuck to the game in the first half. It wasn't a great performance from either team before half-time but the goal sucked the life out of us and gave them a boost.\n\"We needed to do better. We weren't creative enough, similar to recent weeks, and the first goal is a hammer blow for us. It is a team thing and we didn't execute what we wanted, put ourselves under pressure and conceded a poor goal.\n\"We all learn from those moments and the team has to take responsibility. It was difficult for us today, we had a strong team, good balance, so it's disappointing. We are always concerned when we don't win. We were desperate to do well. The first goal damaged us mentally and we didn't recover. We are in a difficult moment and need to lift ourselves.\"\nWatford manager Nigel Pearson, also to Match of the Day: \"It is a very big result, a great win and one the players worked very hard to secure. It is a very positive step in the right direction for us.\n\"We had to work exceptionally hard for it because there were times we didn't play as well with the ball as we'd have liked. We have run away comfortable winners in the end, but it was a game we had to fight and protect our goal with a lot of resilience.\n\"We got the balance right today in doing what the game needed. It was a tougher game than the scoreline suggests but we thoroughly deserved the win.\n\"There is no magic formula, the players will drive it. We create the framework for the players to go and play - it is just about trying to maximise what we've got. I want to enjoy myself, even though there are times you probably think I don't, I want to enjoy the challenge and it's still going to be a tough call. There is an awful long way to go.\"\nMore misery for Bournemouth - the stats\nBournemouth have now lost 81 Premier League games since promotion for the 2015-16 season - only Sunday's opponents Watford (82) have been beaten more time in that time. The Cherries have also conceded the most goals (300) in the top flight since their first game back in August 2015.\nBournemouth had their only shot on target against Watford in the ninth minute - the third time in their past seven Premier League games the Cherries have failed to have more than one effort on target.\nWatford's Troy Deeney has scored eight league goals against Bournemouth in 14 appearances - more than he has against any other opponent.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure has now scored 16 Premier League goals for the Hornets - only Deeney (41) has more for the club.\nIsmaila Sarr has been directly involved in four goals in six Premier League games for Watford under Nigel Pearson (two goals, two assists). The Senegal forward scored once and got no assists in nine matches under previous bosses Quique Sanchez Flores, Hayden Mullins and Javi Gracia.\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to League One Tranmere Rovers for their FA Cup third-round replay on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before hosting Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Saturday (12:30).\nBournemouth are also in Premier League action on Saturday, away at Norwich (15:00)."

Aguero's number of hat-tricks is a Premier League record.\nIt was part of a merciless City performance as they took apart a Villa side who were suffering their worst defeat since Liverpool beat them at 6-0 at Villa Park in February 2016 and have dropped into the relegation zone.\nRiyad Mahrez scored the first two, with Gabriel Jesus splitting Aguero's double just before half-time.\nThe result leaves City second, the highest position they have occupied following a full round of matches since the beginning of November, although they remain 14 points behind leaders Liverpool, having played a game more.\nVilla's season not defined by City defeat - Smith\nFootball Daily: Desperate times for Villa and Bournemouth\nRelentless Aguero\nIt is scarcely believable now but there were some people who thought City had wasted their money when they spent \u00a340m to buy Aguero from Atletico Madrid in 2011.\nHe scored twice against Swansea on his debut and it feels like he has not stopped finding the net since.\nAguero's most famous goal came at the end of that first season, against QPR to win the title, but for City fans his impact goes way beyond that single strike.\nThe 31-year-old is the club's record scorer and now needs only one more to reach 250 for the Blues in all competitions.\nHis first was a ferocious effort, the third a clinical strike after he had been given a clean sight of goal.\nBut maybe the best indication of the relentlessness with which Aguero goes about his job came from the long conversation he had with Mahrez after the half-time whistle had gone, when he demanded to know why his team-mate had not set him up about five minutes earlier.\nCity were 4-0 up at the time.\nCan you name the highest-scoring foreign players in the Premier League?\n'Aguero is a legend and will die scoring goals' - Guardiola\nSobering return for Drinkwater\nIt was a sobering return to action for Danny Drinkwater, who joined Villa on loan from Chelsea in midweek after a similar stint with Burnley came to an end.\nThis was Drinkwater's fourth appearance since March 2018 and remarkably meant four of the last five games he had played were against City - for three different clubs - all of which have ended in defeat.\nDrinkwater started quite well, with a couple of simple touches.\nBut it wasn't long before he was showing clear signs of rustiness after being deprived of match action for such an extended period of time.\nDrinkwater would have known Mahrez's strengths - he shared a dressing room with him as Leicester won the title. But he was powerless to stop the Algerian stepping around him, before darting into the area to put the visitors in front.\nSix minutes later, Drinkwater unwisely decided to control and assess his options as the ball broke to him off Aguero deep inside his own box.\nDavid Silva afforded no time, biting into the challenge and providing Mahrez with the opportunity to crash home his second.\nAfter that it was an exercise in chasing shadows for the former England man, who needs to find his form quickly if he is to help Villa out of the problems they find themselves in.\nProblems mounting for Villa\nWatching from the stands, goalkeeping duo Tom Heaton and Pepe Reina were powerless to stop the first-half carnage.\nWith Heaton on crutches as a legacy of the season-ending knee injury he suffered at Burnley on 1 January, and Reina not registered in time to feature as he is about to complete a loan move from AC Milan, Orjan Nyland was handed his Premier League debut.\nIt proved to be a torrid afternoon for the 29-year-old Norwegian, who became the first goalkeeper in Premier League history to concede six goals on his first start in the competition.\nNyland was beaten at his near-post for the opener and Aguero's historic effort seemed to go straight through his hands.\nReina will surely start at Brighton next Saturday, knowing Villa must improve on their record of two top flight clean sheets since 16 September.\nVilla now have a worse goal difference than Southampton, and they suffered that 9-0 home defeat by Leicester on 25 October.\nA few fans headed for the stairs with their side 3-0 down after half an hour but the majority stayed with their team to the end and cheered loudly when Anwar el Ghazi scored their injury-time consolation from the penalty stop.\nBut, with a Financial Fair Play issue hanging over them if they return to the Championship after a single season in the top flight, it looks like being a busy couple of weeks for Villa as they try to bolster Dean Smith's squad.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\n'We gave City too much respect' - what they said\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"It's tough when you come up against world-class teams.\n\"There's a professional pride as a coach and a team, and the third goal summed it up - they had about 20 passes without us laying a glove on them.\n\"We gave them too much respect.\n\"Our season is not going to be defined by defeats by Man City and Liverpool. You have to learn from this.\n\"We have to ask why weren't we competitive and why we gave them too much respect.\"\nGoals, goals, goals - the stats\nSince the start of the 2016-17 season, Manchester City have scored 343 Premier League goals - 42 more than any other team.\nThis was Pep Guardiola's 300th top-flight league win as a manager - he has reached that tally in just 390 games with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City.\nCity's David Silva has assisted 21 Premier League goals for team-mate Sergio Aguero - the only player to assist another more in the competition is Frank Lampard for Didier Drogba (24 goals).\nCity's Riyad Mahrez is the only Premier League player to both score and assist 20 goals since the start of last season in all competitions (21 goals, 23 assists).\nIn all competitions, City's Kevin de Bruyne has assisted 15 goals this season - five more than any other Premier League player.\nGabriel Jesus has started 76 matches for City in all competitions - he has been directly involved in 71 goals in those matches (54 goals, 17 assists).\nWhat's next?\nVilla need to regroup quickly before their game at Brighton next Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Manchester City host Crystal Palace at the same time."

To lose would have been too harsh on the boys.\"\nWatford goalkeeper Ben Foster saved from Lucas Moura before half-time to thwart Spurs, who have now gone four league games without a win.\n\"The result is unfair. I think it would have been more unfair if we lost,\" added Mourinho.\n\"We had the control of the game, especially in the first half. We arrived in dangerous positions. We created chances but we did not manage to score.\"\nDeeney had headed a good chance straight at Gazzaniga just before the break, while Abdoulaye Doucoure shot into the side-netting early in the second half.\nWatford substitute Ignacio Pussetto, making his debut for the club, cleared an Erik Lamela effort off the line in stoppage time at the end of the match.\nWinger Pussetto, a \u00a37m signing from Udinese, had only been on the pitch for just over a minute when he slid in to hook away with almost the whole ball over the goalline.\nThe Hornets, who were bottom of the table when manager Nigel Pearson took over in December, are now 17th, while Spurs are seventh.\nReaction to Watford v Tottenham live, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nWatford's revival continues\nThe turnaround in Watford's form since Pearson's arrival has been put down to several factors, from the manager's attention to detail around the club off the pitch to a simple, hard-working ethic on it.\nThe latter was in evidence again throughout an encounter that lacked out-and-out excitement but still bristled with tension, with both sides keen to avoid defeat at the very least.\nThat matters now seem to be going Watford's way under Pearson was indicated when the ball appeared to strike Craig Cathcart on the hand inside the hosts' area in only the second minute, but referee Michael Oliver ignored Spurs' claims for a penalty.\nAnd Pussetto's dramatic clearance off the line late on, with just a centimetre of the ball still on the goalline, was another hint that the home side have turned a corner.\nBut Pearson and his players are certain to be frustrated that they could not make more of the few chances that came their way - Ismaila Sarr scooping an early chance comfortably over the bar and Deeney nodding the ball at Gazzaniga before the break.\nWatford's talismanic skipper also failed to put the ball beyond the Spurs keeper's reach when given the chance from the spot but, despite that disappointment, his side still maintained their excellent run and can move further away from danger when they face struggling Aston Villa on Tuesday.\nHairdryers & hugs - how Pearson is engineering Watford's great escape\nSpurs lack spark again\nSpurs were flat for large parts of the match, most of which they played without Christian Eriksen.\nThe Denmark playmaker was a 73rd-minute replacement for Dele Alli, but he could not spark his side into a decisive moment at the end of a week where his link with Inter Milan had reignited a feud between Mourinho and the Serie A side's boss Antonio Conte.\nAlli also cut a frustrated figure when he was replaced, the England midfielder having headed one of Spurs' few decent chances over the Watford crossbar early in the second half.\nMourinho's side lacked a focal point in the absence of striker Harry Kane, and this third consecutive game without a goal is now the sixth time in a row where they have failed to win in the Premier League when the England captain has not been involved.\nWith Kane ruled out until at least April with a hamstring injury, these are trends Spurs must address if they are climb back into contention for the Champions League places.\nPremier League predictions: King Gary star Tom Davis takes on Lawro\nMan of the match - Etienne Capoue (Watford)\n'We did enough to win' - manager reaction\nWatford manager Nigel Pearson: \"It was a game we felt we created enough to win. They have had their situations and chances as well. In the first half we did not quite get our pressing as well as we have at late. We grew into the game and started to take more control. We had a good chance to win.\"\nOn the penalty miss: \"It's football. I said to the players I am looking for a performance and we had a good performance today. If we go out with every intention to win the game then we will play well. I am pleased with how we played football today.\"\nSpurs manager Jose Mourinho: \"We played very well. We started the game without a striker but with lots of offensive players.\n\"I am happy with how we played, our commitment.\n\"We are not good at adapting to this style of football.

However, the Hornets have also failed to score in a league-high 11 matches.\nTottenham kept their first away clean sheet in the league for 382 days, since winning 3-0 at Cardiff on New Year's Day 2019.\nThere were 32 shots without a goal in this match, the most in the competition since Crystal Palace v Cardiff in December 2018 (40).\nWatford's Deeney has failed to score three of his past six Premier League penalties.\nAs well as being winless in their past six league games without Kane, Tottenham have failed to score in four of those matches.\nWhat's next?\nWatford are away to Aston Villa in the Premier League at 19:30 GMT on Tuesday - and are back in action two days later when their delayed FA Cup third-round replay at Tranmere Rovers takes place at 19:45 on Thursday.\nSpurs are at home to Norwich City in the league at 19:30 Wednesday."

        "article_text": "Southampton 2-3 Wolves: Raul Jimenez scores twice to seal remarkable win\nMexican striker Raul Jimenez scored twice as Wolves magnificently came from 2-0 down to win at in-form Southampton.\nThe Saints looked set for their sixth victory in seven games when Jan Bednarek hooked in and Shane Long headed home for his first of the season.\nHowever, the momentum shifted after the break. Portuguese teenager Pedro Neto, exceptional for Wolves so far this season, reduced the deficit after controlling Adama Traore's delivery from the right.\nJimenez slotted home from the spot to bring the scores level after Jonny had been sandwiched by Jack Stephens and Cedric Soares. Referee Darren England, making his Premier League debut, pointed for a corner before his decision was overturned by VAR.\nAnd with 14 minutes left the fightback was complete when Jimenez stroked in after more good work from Traore.\nRelive Southampton v Wolves\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League action\nPremier League predictions: King Gary star Tom Davis takes on Lawro\nJimenez leads remarkable turnaround\nA popular post-match question to Nuno Espirito Santo might be, \"what did you say to them at half-time?\"\nWolves were relatively abject in that opening period. Neither Jimenez, Neto nor Traore made many in-roads into the Southampton area.\nSome might have thought that this long season for Wolves, which started back at the end of July, was beginning to take its toll on the players - after all, they had experienced three defeats and two draws in the previous five games.\nBut in Nuno they have one of the best motivators in this league. The team also has a precocious talent in Neto.\nThe 19-year-old, who appears destined for greater achievements, set Wolves on their way when he brought down Traore's ball brilliantly before striking past Alex McCarthy.\nThe home crowd at St Mary's then fell almost silent as VAR overturned England's initial 'no penalty' decision before Jimenez slotted home.\nThe forward, at the forefront of all that has been good for the Midlands side, then capped off a great day for the visitors when he converted Traore's cross.\nSaints brought back to earth\nAll good things come to an end, and this ended with a thump to the face for Ralph Hasenhuttl.\nBut if he erases the woeful second-half capitulation from his mind and focuses on the first half then there are positives.\nThe first being Long. The Austrian boss was recently glowing about the 32-year-old, highlighting how his workrate and effervescent attitude in attack have aided both strike-partner Danny Ings and the side in recent weeks.\nHe would have had a smile as wide as anybody's when Long finally ended a drought going back to April with a stopping header from Cedric Soares' cross.\nAs for Bednarek, he scored his first since April 2018. James Ward-Prowse delivered a free-kick from the right and the Polish centre-back hooked home from 12 yards.\nThat run of wins prior to Saturday moved the Saints into mid-table - it is important they rediscover the form that took them there.\nMan of the match - Adama Traore\n'I said a lot of things at half-time' - reaction\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl:\n\"As everybody sees, we had a good first half and a not-so-good second half.\n\"The opponent showed how you can turn the table with a few lucky moments, and I think we had a chance to score the third goal, when we were a little bit unlucky with the Long header on to the post.\n\"Congratulations to Wolves - they showed what a strong mentality they have, to turn such a game, and we must learn from this lesson.\n\"We did a good job in the last weeks, but if we don't carry on defending as we did, we can immediately concede goals. That was not the way we wanted to do it in the second half.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo, when asked what he said to his side at half-time:\n\"I said a lot of things. They did the job. We realised the first half was not good. I'm very proud of the players - even proud of the first half.\n\"In the tempo theirs was better than ours.\n\"In the second half, making the goal then anything can change.\"\nWolves' 'bouncebackability' - stats\nSince the start of last season, Southampton have dropped 42 points from leading positions in the Premier League, 13 more than any other side.\nWolves have picked up 18 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, seven more than any other side.\nSince the start of last season, Wolves have seen 68% of their Premier League goals scored in the second-half (55/81), the highest proportion of any current top-flight side.\nWolves have conceded the first goal in a league-high 16 different Premier League games this season, including each of the last seven in a row.\nBednarek netted just his second goal for Southampton in 61 appearances in all competitions and his first for the club since April 2018 (v Chelsea).\nLong netted his 54th Premier League goal, becoming the joint-third-highest scoring Republic of Ireland player in the Premier League (Robbie Keane 126, Niall Quinn 59, Damien Duff 54).\nNeto has scored two goals in his last three Premier League appearances for Wolves after failing to find the back of the net in any of his 13 before that.\nWhat's next?\nWolves are at home to Liverpool on Thursday (20:00 GMT) and Southampton are at Crystal Palace on Tuesday (19:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-1 Sheff Utd: John Fleck cancels out Gabriel Martinelli goal for draw\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder urged his players to \"turn a really good story into a fantastic one\" after his side's outstanding first season back in the Premier League continued with a draw at Arsenal.\nThe Blades were in League One when Wilder took charge three-and-a-half years ago but are now in contention for European football after a fine start to the campaign.\nThe Blades were typically organised and threatening throughout but looked set for defeat when 18-year-old Gabriel Martinelli steered in an opener for the hosts.\nWilder's attacking substitutions were rewarded when John Fleck hit a deflected shot into the far corner to keep the Blades four points clear of the Gunners.\n\"We have a group who challenge each other and wants to attack every game in every division,\" Wilder said.\n\"They have shown that attitude for a long time. We haven't been unbelievably backed financially. It's a really good story, ours, the players and where they have come from.\n\"We have to turn that really good story into a fantastic one by keeping the hammer down.\"\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League reaction\nPlenty to do for Arteta\nWhile Wilder said his side turned in \"one of our poorest performances\" at the Emirates they were still good value for a draw.\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta was facing a stacked in-tray for his first job in management and the Spaniard has now overseen one win in his first five league games in charge.\nWithout suspended captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang the Gunners were always likely to be lacking a goal threat. After all, the Gabon forward had scored 48% of their league goals this season.\nBut Alexandre Lacazette - his replacement as skipper - is hardly a novice, and with Mesut Ozil and Pepe in support the Gunners could still boast a \u00a3160m strikeforce.\nBut it was Martinelli, just 18 and making his fourth league start, who was the pick.\nHe volleyed wide from a smart Pepe cross, shot into the side-netting after more quick feet from the winger, and then gambled to convert the opener after makeshift left-back Bukayo Saka saw his cross loop up into the goalmouth.\nThe watching Aubameyang was moved to declare him a \"superstar\" in waiting in a post on social media.\n, external\nArteta could point to his side having over 60% of the possession, but Blades keeper Dean Henderson was largely untroubled - making just three saves.\n\"I'm very disappointed, the performance deserved three points,\" he said.\n\"It is two points lost but if you don't put games to bed in the last 10 minutes that can happen. There is a history of that, 1-0 up is never enough, be careful as anything can happen.\n\"They tried to do their best before, I inherited a team in a difficult situation. In the second half they didn't create much apart from the goal, a long ball and someone from an incredible angle puts it in the top corner.\"\nBlades bouncing again\nIf Arsenal's expensively assembled attack failed to add much spark, it was the other end of the pitch which showed where work is needed in this and future transfer windows.\nAlarm bells were ringing for some Gunners fans with the arrival of the teamsheets. Two wingers, a perennial scapegoat and David Luiz made up a back four of Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Saka, Shkodran Mustafi and the Brazil centre-back.\nArteta brought on Eddie Nketiah to a hero's reception, but the hosts' only shot on target in the second half was a tame header in stoppage time.\nNot even the video assistant referee could come to the rescue as the cameras backed Mike Dean's decision to not award a penalty when Pepe went down after a driving run down the right. Arteta called it a \"very clear\" spot-kick, but the frustration felt by the forward summed up the Gunners' second-half showing.\nThe Blades had not won at Arsenal since August 1971, but they have hardly done anything but win since Wilder took charge in the summer of 2016, and they arrived at Emirates Stadium in confident mood.\nIn contrast to Arteta's side - who at times looked as makeshift and thrown together as they are at the moment - this United side are absolute in their positional play. Every player knows where they need to be at all times and they grew in stature as the game wore on.\nLys Mousset wasted a good early headed chance, Oli McBurnie should have done better when his miscued header was cleared off the line, and the club record signing then had another good chance well charged down.\nWilder introduced forwards Billy Sharp and Callum Robinson and was rewarded for his positive intent when Robinson's cross was nodded on by Sharp for the arriving Fleck. The midfielder had plenty to do but controlled his strike nicely, hitting down into the deck and seeing the bounce carry the ball past the dive of Bernd Leno.\n\"We don't do targets, we don't look at blocks of games, you can't in this division,\" Wilder added.\n\"Everyone has upped their standards, we talked in pre season about reacting to losing games of football because as a group we have been used to winning. It's one point to add to the 32 we had already and it's a valuable one. We keep on rolling on.\n\"I didn't think we were anywhere near our best and the result is better than the performance. If you can get a result when you're not playing well that's a good sign.\"\nMan of the match - Enda Stevens (Sheffield United)\nArsenal the draw specialists - the stats\nArsenal have dropped 13 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, as many as they did in the whole of 2018-19.\nSheffield United have won 16 away points this season, their joint highest tally on the road in a Premier League campaign (also 1992-93).\nArsenal have drawn more games than any other side in this term's top flight (11), with the Gunners last drawing more in a single season in 2008-09 (12).\nThe Gunners managed just one shot on target following their goal, with that effort coming from defender Mustafi in the 90th minute.\nAt 18 years and 214 days, Martinelli became the second-youngest player to score a Premier League goal for Arsenal at the Emirates, after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain against Blackburn in February 2012 (18 years 173 days).\nFleck's goal was his seventh goal involvement for Sheffield United in the league this season (five goals, two assists), but his first away from home.\nWhat's next?\nTough Premier League games for both.\nIt is a short trip across the capital to Chelsea for Arsenal on Tuesday, 21 January (20:15 GMT), while Sheffield United host champions Manchester City on the same evening (19:30)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-2 Crystal Palace: Fernandinho scores late own goal\nPep Guardiola said Manchester City's aim is to \"secure a place\" in the Champions League next season after their faint title hopes were dealt another blow by a resolute Crystal Palace side.\nFernandinho's 90th-minute own goal ensured the Eagles claimed a draw at Etihad Stadium on Saturday in a remarkable conclusion to the game.\nThe result leaves champions City 13 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who have two games in hand and play Manchester United on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nTwo Sergio Aguero goals in the last 10 minutes had turned a thrilling contest on its head - and looked set to earn City victory - after Cenk Tosun had given the Eagles a first-half lead.\nPalace had the final word, however, when Wilfried Zaha stole down the left and put in a low cross that Fernandinho reached before Connor Wickham, only to divert the ball into his own net.\nFor long stages it appeared City would end up empty-handed, as they struggled to break down a brilliantly organised Palace side.\nKevin de Bruyne fired a first-half free-kick against the underside of the bar with the score at 0-0 but, for all the home side's possession, they found clear-cut chances hard to come by.\nPalace, meanwhile, hardly ventured forward until they scored and their defensive outlook was so entrenched, the City fans booed James McArthur for time-wasting as he walked over to take the corner that led to their first goal.\nWhen the ball did come over, Gary Cahill out jumped John Stones at the back post and Tosun was unmarked to steer his knockdown into the corner.\nThat silenced an already subdued stadium, with the home fans frustrated further after the break when referee Graham Scott pointed to the spot for a Jairo Riedewald handball, only for the video assistant referee to overrule the decision. Replays showed the ball came off the defender's foot first as he blocked Joao Cancelo's cross.\nIt took Aguero to lead the rescue mission, with his first goal - his 250th for the club - coming when he turned home a Gabriel Jesus cross, before his second saw him expertly nod home a Benjamin Mendy delivery.\nThat should have settled the outcome but Zaha had other ideas, sending in a dangerous delivery that Fernandinho could only help home to preserve their five-game unbeaten run.\n\"We did everything to win the game and unfortunately in the end we lost two points because we could not stop the counter-attack,\" said Guardiola.\n\"But we have to continue. There are still a lot of games to play. We have to try to secure the place for the Champions League next season.\"\nHow the drama unfolded at Etihad Stadium\nAll of Saturday's Premier League action\nPremier League predictions: King Gary star Tom Davis takes on Lawro\nNo birthday joy for Guardiola\nManager Pep Guardiola was hoping to celebrate his 49th birthday with three points rather than by taking his City squad to a local cinema to watch La La Land, which he did when he turned 46.\nBut his jubilant reaction to Aguero's second goal turned to despair after Palace punished his side for dreaming at the back in all too familiar fashion.\nThe hard work had been done - they had found a way to break down a resilient Eagles side that offered City few chances after the break.\nThere was no way through the middle of the pitch so, time after time, City fired balls into the box. They had 46 crosses from open play alone.\nThat tactic repeatedly ended in frustration until two deliveries, both from the left, found Aguero in space, and he made no mistake.\nGuardiola celebrated City's second goal wildly but he was soon back on the touchline to bark instructions at his players - unfortunately for him, they did not follow them.\nA lapse in concentration saw Cancelo stray too far forward, allowing Zaha to make the most of the space behind him, with Stones unable to catch him.\n\"I told them to keep going, put more balls into the box and try to control Zaha on the counter-attack,\" Guardiola added.\n\"It's difficult to analyse when they shoot one corner have no more chances and we did many times and unfortunately could not win. We take it one game at a time.\"\nPalace get reward for effort and organisation\nPalace were the only team to win here in the Premier League last season, and came close to a famous double - Guardiola has never lost consecutive home games against the same opponent during his time at City.\nWhile that triumph came largely thanks to two brilliant strikes from distance - first from Jeffrey Schlupp and then notably from Andros Townsend - the point they earned here came from teamwork, effort and discipline.\nRoy Hodgson's side needed a cutting edge too, of course, and they got it from Tosun, who has joined on loan from Everton.\nThe Turkey striker marked his first start for the club with a fine finish to give Palace the lead with their first effort at goal, and he tested Ederson again after the break.\n\"We have only had him for a week so we are still learning about him, but his performance was not only very professional but also technically very good,\" Hodgson said.\n\"He's going to be delighted with his debut and I hope he continues along those lines for the next 15 games, because there is a lot of football to be played.\"\nThe Eagles have been short of goals this season - they came into this match with the joint-lowest tally in the top flight - but if Tosun continues in the same vein then he could fire them even further up the table.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\nAguero and Silva reach landmark figures - the stats\nManchester City have conceded 12 goals in their 12 league games at the Etihad this season, as many as their 19 home league matches last term.\nThis was City's third Premier League draw of the campaign, more than they had in their 38 matches in last season's competition.\nCrystal Palace have drawn four consecutive Premier League games for only the second time.\nManchester City have conceded the first goal in six of their past nine home league games, as many as they had in their first 60 under Guardiola.\nGuardiola became the fifth manager to take charge of Manchester City in the Premier League on his birthday, with all five failing to win (also Brian Horton in 1995, Joe Royle in 2001, Mark Hughes in 2009 and Roberto Mancini in 2010 and 2011).\nCrystal Palace's Cenk Tosun - on loan from Everton - became only the fourth Turkish player to reach 10 or more Premier League goals, after Muzzy Izzet (34), Tuncay Sanli (20) and Tugay (10).\nDavid Silva made his 300th Premier League appearance for Manchester City - becoming the first player to reach that total for the club in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nCity head to Bramall Lane on Tuesday to play Sheffield United in the Premier League (19:30 GMT), while Palace host Southampton at the same time."

Brighton stay 14th but are now three points clear of the bottom three.\nGrealish and Reina shine for Villa\nVilla boss Smith wanted a reaction from his players after their humbling 6-1 defeat by Manchester City last weekend, their worst result since 2016.\nHe made five changes to his side, including a debut in goal Reina, who could do little to stop Trossard's fine opener.\nBut with a \u00a310m deal for Genk striker Mbwana Samatta yet to be completed, Villa started the match without a recognised centre-forward for the third game in a row.\nAnwar El Ghazi was pushed furthest forward, but struggled to get much from Adam Webster and Lewis Dunk.\nThat placed most of the creative burden on Grealish, who once again looked the player most likely to change the game for the visitors.\nThe 24-year-old had a great chance to open the scoring in the first half but he drove the ball wide from the edge of the area after a breakaway from the halfway line.\nBut with the game drifting away from Villa in the second half, he showed a moment of genuine quality to control Douglas Luiz's pass, shimmy away from the defender before firing beyond Mat Ryan for his ninth goal of the season.\n\"It's a super ball and a super strike from Jack,\" said Smith. \"He's in great goalscoring form; he's in great form full stop and it just shows the sort of player he is.\n\"At the moment everyone knows we are playing without a recognised striker and it is down to Grealish, Trezeguet and Anwar El Ghazi to come up trumps with goals and they are managing to do that.\"\nBrighton struggle in front of goal\nBrighton enjoyed the better of possession and made most of the running in the first half, but they showed a lack of composure in the final third, highlighted by the fact they could only manage two shots on target all game.\nThey scored with their first attempt, with the lively Maupay central in the build-up.\nThe former Brentford striker went on a mazy run from just inside the Aston Villa half before teeing up Trossard, who fired an unstoppable drive across Reina into the bottom corner for his third goal of the season.\nMaupay and Aaron Connolly formed a hard-working strike partnership and they hassled and harried the Villa defence all afternoon, but without really testing Reina until the closing stages.\nThat lack of cutting edge cost them, with Grealish's late equaliser meaning Brighton have now dropped 14 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season.\nThis game marked the start of a run of matches against sides around Brighton in the table, with Bournemouth, West Ham and Watford lying in wait in the next few weeks.\nGraham Potter has been praised for the way he has developed Brighton's playing style, but he needs a greater attacking threat from his side in those matches if they are to pull themselves away from danger.\nMan of the match - Neal Maupay (Brighton)\n'A tale of two halves' - what they said\nBrighton head coach Graham Potter speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was an important game for us and we're disappointed not to win.\n\"I thought first half we were really good. Deservedly 1-0 up and maybe with a bit more luck it could be more. But we weren't and you expect the response from Aston Villa.\n\"If we could have seen that period out maybe we could have hung onto the game. We responded really well to their goal and had chances at the end but it wasn't to be, in the end it's a point and we move forward.\nOn Grealish's equaliser: \"We had the ball and positionally made a mistake, but it's a fantastic finish and probably the only player on the pitch who can do that. That's the Premier League for you. You can do a lot right in the game but the opposition always have a player of high quality and that's a great strike.\"\nAston Villa head coach Dean Smith, also speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I thought the game was a tale of two halves. We were a little bit too passive in our pressing and not good enough on the ball in the first half. But we played well second half and deserved that goal.\nOn responding to Manchester City defeat: \"Man City are another level to a lot of the other teams in this league. These are the teams, Brighton, Watford on Tuesday, we've got Bournemouth coming up as well, that will define our season.\"\nGrealish haunts Brighton again - the stats\nBrighton have dropped 14 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season - only West Ham (17) have dropped more.\nAston Villa are the only side without an away clean sheet in the Premier League this season.\nAston Villa have earned four points from their last two Premier League away games (W1 D1), as many as they had in their previous 17 on the road in the competition (W1 D1 L15).\nAll three of Leandro Trossard's Premier League goals for Brighton have been scored at home.\nAston Villa's Jack Grealish has scored more goals against Brighton in all competitions than he has versus any other side in his professional career (4).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to south coast rivals Bournemouth on Tuesday (19:30 GMT), while Aston Villa host Watford at the same time."

        "article_text": "Norwich City 1-0 Bournemouth: Pukki penalty enough for Canaries\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe described Steve Cook's first-half dismissal for deliberate handball as \"instinct\" as bottom-of-the-table Norwich deepened the Cherries' relegation fears with their first Premier League win since November.\nOndrej Duda's goal-bound effort looked to be going into an empty net before Cook's fingertip save pushed the ball on to the post and saw him dismissed by referee Paul Tierney.\nTeemu Pukki scored the game's only goal from the resulting penalty, leaving Howe's side three points adrift of safety and just three points above the Canaries.\n\"He hasn't planned it,\" Howe told BBC Match of the Day. \"He has just stuck his arm out. He is very down and we need to support him.\n\"When you are in the moment we are in, these things tend to happen. You find a way to hurt yourself and that is exactly what we did.\"\nNorwich also ended the match with 10 men following Ben Godfrey's late challenge on Callum Wilson, with Tierney consulting his pitch-side monitor before brandishing the red card.\nBoth teams went close in a nail-biting finale, Aaron Ramsdale thwarting Pukki and Emi Buendia before Tim Krul tipped Nathan Ake's header over the crossbar.\n\"The frustrating thing is that we created chances [to get a result],\" added Howe, who also saw Wilson squander a golden opportunity in the second half. \"We are not scoring enough and that is damaging our belief that we can win games.\n\"It puts pressure on the defensive side, which I don't think we have been bad at.\"\nNorwich survive Godfrey's late dismissal\nWhile Norwich's football this season has been pleasing on the eye, a lack of clinical edge in front of goal and frailties in defence have been their undoing.\nFarke's side have also tended to save their best for the big occasion, taking points off Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal while losing to fellow strugglers Aston Villa, West Ham, Watford, Burnley and Brighton.\nThere was little to separate the two teams in a cagey opening to proceedings, but the game sprang to life just after the half-hour mark when Pukki was played through on goal by Todd Cantwell.\nPukki's effort was blocked by Ramsdale before Cook - diving at full stretch in a save Ramsdale would have been proud of - tipped Duda's looping shot on to the outside of the post, earning the Cherries defender a straight red card.\nThe Finnish international drilled home his 10th goal of the campaign from the spot, but the hosts should have put the result beyond doubt in the second half.\nRamsdale produced fine saves to deny Pukki and Buendia, before referee Tierney showed Godfrey a straight red card - after consulting his pitch-side monitor - following the Norwich defender's late tackle on Wilson.\nNorwich had led in six of their previous nine league games without registering a single victory, but the Canaries held on to claim a priceless three points and a first clean sheet at Carrow Road this season.\nBournemouth's slump continues\nBournemouth have now picked up only four points from a possible 36 in the Premier League - fewer than any other top-flight team in that period.\nTheir visit to Carrow Road was described before the game as \"massive\" by Howe, who was forced to deny reports during the week that he had been asked to step down as Cherries boss.\nAside from an early Wilson header that flew straight at Krul, there was little in Bournemouth's start to encourage Howe and the travelling fans as Norwich forced the visitors back.\nCook's dismissal 12 minutes before the break left the Cherries with a mountain to climb but, as the hosts grew increasingly nervous, Howe's charges gradually began to apply pressure on the Norwich goal.\nTheir best opportunity fell to Wilson, who lost his footing as he attempted to direct Ryan Fraser's cut-back past Krul from seven yards out.\nThe Norwich goalkeeper also had to be at full stretch to tip Ake's powerful header over the bar.\nThe result does little to ease the pressure on Howe, whose side welcome fellow strugglers Brighton and Aston Villa to the Vitality Stadium in their next two league games.\nMan of the match - Teemu Pukki (Norwich)\nFirst home Premier League clean sheet since 2016 - the stats\nBournemouth have lost 10 of their last 12 top-flight games (W1 D1), after losing just one of the seven before that (W3 D3).\nNorwich kept a clean sheet for the first time in 16 Premier League home games, since a goalless draw with Manchester City in March 2016.\nBournemouth have failed to score in four consecutive top-flight games for the first time ever.\nBournemouth have registered just one clean sheet in their last 12 Premier League games.\nSteve Cook's red card for Bournemouth was his first in 304 appearances across the Premier League and EFL.\nSince the start of last season, no player has scored more goals in English league football (excluding play-offs) than Norwich striker Teemu Pukki (39, level with James Norwood).\n'If I could work harder, I would' - what the managers said\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It is an important win for us. Three points, clean sheet, good for mood and confidence and the table. A good evening for us.\n\"We can be naive. We missed a lot of chances. We were the better side but missed chances. There were some spicy moments in the last 10 minutes and anything can happen. It doesn't take anything away, though. We are happy with the win.\n\"I watched back the red cards and they were deserved. Ben is a good lad but he was too excited to win the ball back. He will learn.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was a very tight game. We started quite brightly but then the key moment went against us. A bizarre one. With 10 we battled well and stayed in the game. It would have been a huge result if we had taken one of our chances.\n\"I was happy with the way we battled and showed heart to try and get a result.\n\"If I knew there was one thing I could do, I would do it. Can I work harder? I don't think I can, otherwise I would. It is not happening at the moment. We are here to get wins and achieve our objectives.\"\nWhat's next?\nNorwich travel to Tottenham Hotspur in their next league game on Wednesday, 22 January (kick-off 19:30 GMT), while Bournemouth host Brighton the day before (19:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Newcastle 1-0 Chelsea: Isaac Hayden's injury-time winner stuns Blues\nNewcastle showed they have the appetite for a scrap in the bottom half of the table as Isaac Hayden's dramatic injury-time header earned a vital win against a dominant Chelsea.\nFrank Lampard's side were on top for most of the game but had little to show for it as Tammy Abraham skewed wide from an acute angle and N'Golo Kante's shot was well saved by Martin Dubravka.\nPrior to the winner, it was the hosts who came closest to scoring as Joelinton headed against the bar after Federico Fernandez's cross after 22 minutes.\nBut Steve Bruce's side showed their steel by keeping Chelsea at arm's length with a resolute defensive display.\nAnd when Hayden headed in Allan Saint-Maximin's cross past Kepa Arrizabalaga, it sent St James' Park into raptures as they moved seven points clear of the relegation zone.\nTheir only worry was an injury to Jetro Willems, who was carried off in the first half.\nBruce said after the game that the problem looked \"horrendous\" with him fearing a cruciate knee ligament injury.\nFor Chelsea, it was another frustrating day during a mixed season under Lampard, who took over in the summer.\nIt was a first defeat since Boxing Day but they will rue another missed chance to improve their top-four claims after also drawing at Brighton earlier this month.\nThe Blues remain five points ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United, who face Liverpool on Sunday.\nBut the lack of firepower up front may sharpen Lampard's intentions to recruit a striker during the transfer window after being linked with the likes of RB Leipzig's Timo Werner.\nRelive Newcastle v Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nNewcastle fortunate after string of bad luck\nBruce said prior to the game that he was happy with his squad and would only bring players in during the transfer window if they would improve on his current crop.\nAnd they showed their defensive quality by holding out against a Chelsea side who had 70% possession during the game and created the vast majority of the chances in freezing conditions on Tyneside.\nIf there was a touch of fortune to the result, Bruce will not care.\nHis side has been struck by a succession of injuries this season, and he will be delighted that the returning Saint-Maximin created the goal which lifts his side to 12th place in the table.\nThe result also earned a fourth game unbeaten for the first time this season, albeit with two of those games coming against Rochdale in the FA Cup.\nDespite all of Chelsea's endeavour, it was Newcastle that created the game's other best chance when Joelinton crashed a header against the crossbar.\nWith the \u00a340m summer signing breaking a 20-game goal drought by scoring against Rochdale, Saint-Maximin offering trickery on the wing after a hamstring injury and Miguel Almiron scoring in three of the last four games, Bruce may feel his luck is turning.\nThe cheer that greeted the final whistle underlined how elated and surprised the home crowd were as the hosts earned their first Premier League win since December 21.\nFrustrated Lampard rues poor finishing\nChelsea came into the match unbeaten since Boxing Day but it was another game where Lampard's young side showed their inexperience in front of goal.\nAbraham, who has excelled in his first season at Chelsea with 15 goals, was wasteful at times, but there were also missed chances for Mason Mount, who headed over, plus Willian and Emerson, who could not find the target.\nDespite their links with a striker during the transfer window and the potential departure of Olivier Giroud to Inter Milan, Lampard has said nothing is \"imminent\".\nBut he showed his frustration on the touchlines as his side failed to take advantage, much as they did in a 1-1 draw at Brighton earlier this month.\nLampard's faith in youth has drawn praise this season, and while home losses to Bournemouth and Southampton have been countered by away wins against Tottenham and Arsenal, this result will offer the new Chelsea boss plenty of food for thought.\nHis strict adherence to playing one lone striker may also be something he will consider in games where teams sit behind the ball and try to break as Newcastle did so successfully.\nAnd there may be further questions about Arrizabalaga, who has had a mixed season, and looked like he could have done more to prevent the winner going in.\nMan of the match - Jamaal Lascelles (Newcastle)\nUnhappy hunting ground for Blues - the stats\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce has picked up just his second Premier League victory against Chelsea on what was his 23rd managerial game in the competition against the Blues (D5 L16).\nChelsea have lost five of their last seven trips to St James' Park in the Premier League (W1 D1).\nIsaac Hayden's goal was Newcastle's first 90th-minute winner in the Premier League since December 2015 (Ayoze Perez against Tottenham).\nChelsea have now lost as many games after 23 Premier League games this season (8) as they did in the entirety of 2018-19.\nSince the start of 2019, only Liverpool (19), Man City (17) and Spurs (12) have more home Premier League wins than Newcastle (11).\nAt 93 minutes and 26 second's, Isaac Hayden's winner was Newcastle's latest Premier League goal since Yohan Cabaye netted against West Ham back in January 2014 (94 minutes and 9 seconds).\nIsaac Hayden's goal for Newcastle was just his third in the Premier League on his 70th appearance in the competition and first since February 2019 against Wolves.\n'The brutal reality of football' - what the managers said\nNewcastle head coach Steve Bruce, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I can't fault my players for the way we defended. The big thing we need to do better is look after the ball and cause more of a threat. Today we didn't seem to carry a threat. But one great ball or delivery - you may call it smash and grab, but it is good to see.\n\"We can't press from the front like Chelsea do. If we did that we would come a cropper. We have to do it our way, a way that suits the squad we have got.\n\"We can get better but we have had results against the top teams. They find it difficult to play against us and that's what we try to do.\"\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We dominated every aspect of the game. They hit the bar in the first half but the rest of the game was ours, except scoring.\n\"Newcastle defend their box, you won't make too many clear-cut chances against them. We controlled the game, we were at the end of their box. If we want to go to the next level we have to take chances and score in these kind of games.\n\"The lads have got their heads down in there. But the brutal reality of football is if you don't score, teams stay in the game and something like that happens at the end.\"\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Everton in their next game on Tuesday, 21 January (kick-off 19:30 GMT), while Chelsea host Arsenal in the evening's late kick-off (20:15 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 2-1 Leicester: Ashley Westwood scores stunner as Clarets end losing run\nSean Dyche said Burnley reacted positively to questions about their form with victory against Leicester which earned them their first points in five games.\nAshley Westwood's stunning strike in the 79th minute and goalkeeper Nick Pope's penalty save from Jamie Vardy marked a brilliant recovery by the home side who went behind to Harvey Barnes' 33rd-minute goal.\nThe Clarets boss told BBC Sport: \"We're really pleased. It was a deserved win in different ways. We had some question marks around us recently, which is kind of a backhanded compliment. There was a big sign of moving forward with that performance.\n\"We know what we are about and we reminded the group of that this week. But there was good play today. We asked different questions. The performance was important to me as a manager, not just the win.\"\nBurnley-born Barnes gave the Foxes the lead with a superb individual effort after Jack Cork had been dispossessed just inside his own half.\nThe home side improved after the break and equalised when Chris Wood poked in his ninth league goal of the season after Ben Mee nodded into his path from a corner.\nHowever, Mee then fouled Barnes in the box to give away a penalty, which was verified by VAR. Vardy, without a goal in his previous three games, saw his firm strike palmed away by Pope.\nWith their tails up, Burnley surged forward and were rewarded 11 minutes from time when Westwood thundered home a low drive.\nThe win lifts Burnley to 14th - five points above the relegation zone. Leicester have now lost four times in their last six league games.\nLive: Burnley v Leicester reaction, plus Liverpool v Man Utd live\nPremier League predictions: King Gary star Tom Davis takes on Lawro\nResilient Burnley bounce back\nAt the start of the 2018-19 season, Dyche feared his team could be priced out of the Premier League\n, external\n.\nSince their return to the top flight in the 2016-17 season the Clarets have been frugal with their spending. Their most expensive signings remain the \u00a315m they spent on both defender Ben Gibson and striker Wood. The primary thought for a club the size of Burnley is to use their Premier League income to secure their future.\nDyche has, as a consequence, been rightly lauded for keeping the Clarets in the division, but the question is for how much longer can the 48-year-old perform miracles?\nHis motivational abilities were tested at Turf Moor as he faced five successive league losses as Burnley boss for the first time. Every small decision could have a big impact for his side from here on in, and Dyche looked aggrieved on the sidelines when Dennis Praet's challenge on Jack Cork in midfield went unpunished in the build-up to Barnes' goal.\nBut rather than let their heads sink, Burnley came out bouncing after the break. Wood went close with a header before he was in the right place at the right time to poke in.\nLeicester's penalty came against the run of play, but Pope ensured the momentum stayed with his side as he made a terrific save.\nThen came the goal that resulted in the biggest cheer of the afternoon. Charlie Taylor broke down the wing and fired a cross into the area which Jonny Evans could only clear into the direction of Westwood. The former Villa player ran on to the ball and lashed it past Kasper Schmeichel.\nVardy and Leicester misfire again\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers kept stating his ambitions were largely in check when his side were on an eight-match winning run and looking the team most likely to challenge Liverpool.\nHowever, he must have thought his side were guaranteed a top-four finish - perhaps this run of results makes it less certain.\nVardy had scored 11 goals in eight matches before Christmas, but he has only managed one in the past seven in all competitions and missed a golden chance to end that run at Turf Moor.\nJames Maddison, touted to make England's Euro 2020 squad, was poor by his standards and wasted a couple of opportunities to shoot.\nBarnes was the Foxes' best performer. He did brilliantly to keep his composure, after running 50 yards, to fire past Pope for his goal and also went close with an effort earlier in the game.\nRodgers needs Vardy and Maddison to be back on song for his side to finish in the top four for the first time since they won the title in 2016.\nMan of the match - Nick Pope (Burnley)\nRodgers' run comes to an end - stats\nFor only the second time as a Premier League manager, Brendan Rodgers has lost a match in the competition when leading at half-time, also doing so as Swansea boss against Norwich in February 2012 (P72 W59 D11 L2).\nFor only the third time in 77 such occasions in the Premier League, Burnley have emerged victorious despite losing at half-time, with all three of those wins coming at Turf Moor - also beating Spurs 4-2 in May 2010 and Everton 2-1 in March 2018.\nStarting with their defeat by Manchester City on 21 December 2019, Leicester have now lost four of their last six Premier League games (W2), double the amount suffered from their opening 17 matches this season (W12 D3 L2).\nBurnley have now failed to score a first-half goal in 11 successive Premier League games, the longest run by any team in the competition since the Clarets themselves went 12 matches without doing so between February and May 2015 (12).\nHarvey Barnes opened the scoring for Leicester with just his second league goal of the season, and his first since August against Sheffield United. Indeed, his three Premier League goals for the Foxes have come away from home, netting at London Stadium, Bramall Lane and Turf Moor.\nOnly against West Ham (six) has Wood scored more Premier League goals than he has versus Leicester (three), netting home and away against the Foxes this season.\nWestwood's winner was his first Premier League goal since April 2019 (v Bournemouth), which was also the last time Burnley won a league game without keeping a clean sheet.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley are at Manchester United in the Premier League on Wednesday (20:15 GMT) while Leicester host West Ham on the same day (19:30)."

Andreas Pereira turned wide of an open goal in the first half and Anthony Martial shot over the top from an inviting position after the break.\nIt came as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side rallied in the second half, but it was to no avail and Liverpool march relentlessly on, with 21 wins from their first 22 games.\n'Liverpool celebrations symbolic & a moment of release'\nGoodison? The Etihad? When & where can Reds win the league?\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League action\nLiverpool simply unstoppable\nIt is simply a case of when the coronation comes as Liverpool reeled off yet another win en route to the Premier League title. They are not only doing their own job but watching in satisfaction as the chasing pack - chasing from afar it must be said - fall further behind, with dropped points for Manchester City and Leicester City on Saturday and Sunday respectively.\nThere was rare anxiety around Anfield in the closing minutes before the sweet release of Salah's goal - Alisson rightly running the length of the pitch to join in the celebrations after his long clearance sent the Egyptian clear to score.\nLiverpool could have wrapped up victory more comfortably, but with the imperious Van Dijk at the back and menace up front, it is hard to see how they can be stopped in one game - and they certainly will not be in this title race.\nAnd, of course, victory was made even sweeter as it was at the expense of Manchester United, the old foe who famously fulfilled Sir Alex Ferguson's promise to knock Liverpool off their perch.\nUnited now trail Liverpool by 30 points and this is not a gap that flatters Klopp's men.\nThe gulf is not only huge between Liverpool and United.

United were counting on him even more in Rashford's absence but he simply failed to deliver. He was laboured and lack-lustre.\nUnited did close down Liverpool's potent full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson for large parts of the game but there is a glaring lack of quality that has been exposed so often this season.\nLiverpool found it was a very long way back to title glory once momentum had been lost and too many poor decisions made.\nOn this evidence, it does not look like it will be any easier for Manchester United.\nNo Rashford, no fear factor for Man Utd - Jenas analysis\nMan of the match - Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\n'The energy was incredible' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It's a big relief, I was really happy with 85-90% of the game, we were brilliant.

The energy they put on the pitch was incredible.\n\"On a normal day we would have scored three times in the first half and in the second half until 65 minutes we should have been more clear.\n\"But then United have obvious quality, played a bit more football and we had to defend. There were little mistakes here and there, we didn't use possession well enough and so the game stays open.\n\"Then we scored a wonderful, wonderful goal at the end, a really good feeling.\"\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"The players gave us everything. Today we hung on a bit at the start of second half, but the last 25-30 minutes we pressed them and pushed them back. I'm disappointed with conceding from a corner and with the last kick - but very many positives.\n\"I felt in the second half we performed really well against a good team and at a difficult place.\n\"We didn't have quality with our finishing or last pass.

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 3-1 Brighton & Hove Albion: Cherries end six-game winless run\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe says his side's dominant victory over Brighton proves they are good enough to survive in the Premier League.\nWhile the Cherries remain in the bottom three, victory lifts them up a place to 18th and eases some of the pressure on the 42-year-old, while Brighton are two points ahead in 15th.\nA Harry Wilson strike, Pascal Gross' own-goal and Callum Wilson's first goal for 16 league games ended Bournemouth's six-game winless run, with Aaron Mooy scoring late on for the Seagulls.\n\"It feels big at the moment, but time will tell,\" Howe said. \"We knew how big tonight was in so many different ways.\n\"There's a lot of clubs up and down the country that maybe wouldn't have been given the time and support that we have, and we have to recognise that and show our appreciation.\n\"It's not that the team's not good enough - we are good enough, we just need that feeling that we can play the football that we want to, freely, and with total belief and no doubts.\n\"We're desperate to retain our Premier League status and stay here - I love the division, I love everything about it, and I know how important it is for the club.\"\nFollow all of Tuesday's Premier League action here\nRamsdale save sparks Bournemouth\nThis was a welcome return to winning ways for Bournemouth who arrived at this fixture having taken just four points from the previous 36 available to them.\nThe Cherries also possessed the worst home record in the top flight prior to kick-off, something that seemed unimaginable back on 2 November, when they last won at home by beating Manchester United to move up to seventh in the table.\nAnd, as Brighton took charge in the first half hour, it looked like another game was passing them by until a superb save from home keeper Aaron Ramsdale to deny Neal Maupay, and an equally important Nathan Ake block on Maupay's follow up, seemed to turn the contest around.\nThe hosts, who had not had an effort on goal of any description until then, suddenly sparked into life as Callum Wilson's influence grew.\nHowe's side created three chances in quick succession before Harry Wilson kept his cool to dispatch a low drive past Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan from 12 yards.\nCallum Wilson's jostling presence contributed to their second, with the ball flicking off his marker Gross from a Diego Rico corner.\nThe forward then rounded Ryan for the third - calmly rolling the ball in from close range - to show that he has not lost his composure in front of goal during a period in which Bournemouth have averaged less than three shots on target per game.\nBrighton undermined by lack of firepower\nIn many ways this performance typified Brighton's campaign so far.\nGraham Potter's side looked fluent in possession in both halves but were missing the thrust in attack to make the most of their dominance.\nWhile they had 21 shots on goal Mooy's superb left-foot strike into the top right corner was scant consolation.\n\"We played really well for the first 30 minutes,\" said Brighton boss Graham Potter.\n\"They were struggling to get out of their half. We pushed and pushed but in the end it's a disappointing evening. The result is the most important thing.\"\nAlireza Jahanbakhsh and Bernardo had speculative efforts early on, but Maupay will feel he could have scored from either of his two close-range efforts in quick succession.\nThe 23-year-old Frenchman carried a weight of great expectation early in his career after becoming the second-youngest scorer in Ligue 1 history at 16, but this proved another difficult Premier League occasion for him.\nMaupay, who has not scored since the 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace on 16 December, had just 34 touches of the ball and at times appeared isolated.\nHe does, though, remain the Seagulls' top scorer with seven goals, and with Aaron Connolly, introduced as part of a triple substitution on the hour mark, next on the list with three alongside Leandro Trossard and defender Adam Webster, it suggests Brighton may need to add to their forward line.\nMan of the match - Aaron Ramsdale (Bournemouth)\nCallum Wilson's barren run - the stats\nBournemouth have won five of their last six home league meetings with Brighton (D1), winning all three of their Premier League games against the Seagulls at the Vitality Stadium.\nBournemouth have won their first Premier League home game since November 2019 (1-0 against Man Utd), ending a run of five such games without a victory (D1 L4) and scoring more goals today (3) than in those previous five games combined (2).\nBrighton have lost eight of their last 11 Premier League away games (W1 D2), conceding two or more goals in seven of those games\nBournemouth ended a run of 450 minutes without a goal in the Premier League, since scoring in their 1-1 draw with Arsenal in December 2019.\nBournemouth's Harry Wilson is the club's top goalscorer this season in the Premier League with seven goals, averaging a goal every 173 minutes - the best such ratio among Premier League midfielders this season (min 2 goals scored).\nCallum Wilson has ended a run of 1,319 minutes without a Premier League goal for Bournemouth, since netting against West Ham in September 2019.\nBrighton's Aaron Mooy has scored twice in his last four Premier League appearances, with both goals coming against Bournemouth. He had managed just one goal in his previous 30 such games.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth host Arsenal in the FA Cup fourth round on Monday 27 January (20:00 GMT). The Cherries' next Premier League game is at home to Aston Villa on Saturday, 1 February (15:00 GMT).\nBrighton are next in action when they travel to London Stadium to face West Ham in the Premier League on Saturday, 1 February (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-2 Newcastle United: Magpies rescue late point at Goodison Park\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce said his side's comeback at Everton was \"remarkable\" as two injury-time goals from substitute Florian Lejeune earned a dramatic point.\nBruce's injury-hit side were slipping towards defeat after Moise Kean scored his first Toffees goal before Dominic Calvert-Lewin made it 2-0 to the hosts with his 12th of the season.\nBut as the clocked ticked into injury time, Lejeune took advantage of some slack defending at a corner to crash an overhead kick past Jordan Pickford in the 94th minute.\nAnd a minute later, Carlo Ancelotti's side threw away what was an otherwise good performance by failing to clear a free-kick with French defender Lejeune taking advantage of another scramble to fire in.\nIt was a sensational end to a game which Everton had dominated, as Bruce's side added to the injury-time win they earned against Chelsea on Saturday, sending their travelling supporters into delirium.\nBruce, whose side are seven points clear of the relegation zone, said: \"It's quite remarkable. I can't fault the players for their endeavour or effort.\n\"We probably didn't deserve to get anything but we didn't give up. It just shows you what can happen.\n\"It's a wacky game that's for sure - but it's great. It just shows you shouldn't leave a game early.\"\nReaction from Tuesday's Premier League games\nEverton will be dismayed by how they let the game slip from their grasp after Kean produced his best performance of the season before being substituted to a standing ovation on 70 minutes.\nThe Toffees could have narrowed the gap to fifth-placed Manchester United to two points but are now 12th, one place above Newcastle who also have 30 points.\nAncelotti said: \"I'm really pleased for the way we played. The players are really sad at this moment, but I told them I have more experience than them.\n\"I've lost a Champions League final after leading 3-0 [with AC Milan against Liverpool] so it can happen sometimes.\"\nEverton throw away positive performance\nFor 93 minutes, Everton looked like they were in control and had answered calls from Ancelotti to be braver, while Kean emphatically answered his manager's hopes for a quick improvement.\nHaving failed to score in his previous 21 appearances, the 19-year-old was a menace alongside Calvert-Lewin, who also repaid Ancelotti's faith in him after the Italian tipped the 22-year-old for an England place.\nKean has been through a difficult spell since he arrived on Merseyside for \u00a325m, having been disciplined for lateness and suffering the humiliation of being a substituted substitute during Duncan Ferguson's brief reign.\nAnd it looked like his lean spell might continue when he somehow failed to connect with Theo Walcott's low cross before his moment of huge relief arrived.\nGathering Bernard's through ball, he took a poor touch, but after steadying himself, he fired under Martin Dubravka before running away to the corner flag in delight where he was greeted by Everton's thankful supporters.\nThere were further chances to follow for the Italian international, but Calvert-Lewin showed his budding promise once again by making it 2-0 after collecting Lucas Digne's pass and clipping in left-footed.\nWhen Kean left the field, he was cheered by all four stands at Goodison Park and probably felt he had done enough to earn a third successive home win for Everton.\nNewcastle had other ideas, but Ancelotti said of Kean: \"The goal was good for his confidence, of course, and after that he played really well.\n\"He worked hard, he pressed forward, what I asked, he did. He has to improve, because he's young, he has to improve technically and tactically, but he's on the right way.\"\nNewcastle profit from Everton's panic\nIn keeping with their injury-time win over Chelsea on Saturday, Newcastle spent most of the match defending, but their lack of possession had little effect on the result.\nWhereas Chelsea paid for their poor finishing, Everton were far more clinical and in truth could have had several other goals as Bernard and Kean wasted good chances.\nBut perhaps the injury crisis which has engulfed Newcastle is galvanising Bruce's side.\nWith nine players on the treatment table, which was added to by a season-ending injury to Jetro Willems on Saturday, Bruce had to play two midfielders in wing-back positions and for much of the game they were disjointed.\nThey had trouble containing Kean and the impressive Bernard down Everton's left.\nHowever, once the pair were withdrawn, Everton began to retreat.\nBut having failed to register a shot on target until Lejeune's late double there was little sign of what was to come in injury time.\nNewcastle merrily profited from two moments of panic in the Everton box after a performance from the hosts which means Ancelotti has lost only one of six league games in charge.\nMan of the match - Moise Kean (Everton)\n'We keep showing determination' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce speaking to Match of the Day: \"It's quite remarkable. I can't fault the players for their endeavour. Joelinton was struggling after 50 minutes; I nearly put a centre-half up front.\n\"We keep showing determination. We were a tired team tonight but we found a bit of energy from somewhere. When we scored Mike Dean said there are 40 seconds left - and you're thinking 'can we score in 40 seconds?' We rode our luck certainly but they never gave up.\n\"There is a good spirit and attitude in this team - we looked tired but we played people out of position. We didn't have much coming off the bench in terms of forward players but the attitude was fantastic.\n\"It's a wacky game that's for sure - but it's great. It just shows you shouldn't leave a game early.\"\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti speaking to Match of the Day: \"There are things in football you cannot control. We conceded without any reason but the performance was good.\n\"We played a fantastic game and we were unlucky but nothing changes - our Premier League continues, we have to stay focused. We were two-nil up, had opportunities to score and we played attacking football. I'm really pleased with the performance. These results are not frequent but they can happen.\n\"We have to stay on the game for 90 minutes but I'm not saying anything to my players. They played well and it can happen. It's just unlucky for this game.\"\nMagpies celebrate late goals - the stats\nThere were just 102 seconds between Newcastle's two goals against Everton. It is also the first time in Premier League history that the Magpies have scored two goals in the 90th minute onwards in a single game.\nEverton have conceded seven goals in the 90th minute onwards in the Premier League this season, four more than any other side in the division.\nNewcastle defenders have scored 12 goals in the Premier League this season, four more than any other side in the competition.\nSeven of Lucas Digne's nine Premier League assists have come at Goodison Park, including each of his five this season.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin is the first Englishman to score 10 or more goals in a Premier League season for Everton since Wayne Rooney in 2017-18.\nAt 22 years and 311 days old, Calvert-Lewin is the third-youngest Everton player to reach 100 Premier League appearances for the club after Michael Ball (21y 68d) and Ross Barkley (22y 60d).\nEverton's Bernard has been directly involved in four goals in his 15 Premier League appearances this season (2 goals, 2 assists), as many as he recorded in 34 games in his debut campaign last season (1 goal, 3 assists).\nMoise Kean has scored his first goal for Everton with what was his 26th shot in all competitions. He's the first Italian to score a Premier League goal for the Toffees since Alessandro Pistone in April 2002. Furthermore, he is the first Italian to score under Carlo Ancelotti in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle host Oxford United on Saturday in the FA Cup fourth round (15:00 GMT), while Everton are next in action on Saturday, 1 February in the Premier League against Watford at Vicarage Road (15:00)."

It feels tough.\n\"It's difficult to score against Crystal Palace, they are so well-structured and balanced, we got the first goal but missed chances - the second goal would have decided the game.\n\"Conceding a equaliser so late, it feels like a loss. It will be a long road and a sensation for us to stay in this league but we won't give up.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson to BBC Sport: \"It was very close [for the goal]. You think it might be offside and with the technology you see someone has stuck a foot out, leaned forward and the margins are fine.\n\"We took chances in the end with 4-2-4 and got our reward, the boldness of the move paid off.\n\"Connor Wickham has been unlucky with injuries - injury after injury, and he has not been available in my time at the club. It was nice he could play again and I am looking forward to seeing him playing on Sunday.\"\nCanaries keep dropping points from winning positions - match stats\nNorwich have dropped 14 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season (all since the start of December), only West Ham have dropped more (15).\nConnor Wickham's equaliser for Crystal Palace was his first Premier League goal since netting against Manchester City back in November 2016.\nNo English midfielder has scored more Premier League goals than Norwich's Todd Cantwell this season (6 - level with Dele Alli, James Maddison and Jack Grealish).\nNorwich's Emiliano Buend\u00eda has provided seven Premier League assists this season - only Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold (8) and Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne (12) have registered more in the competition in 2019-20.\nAt 18 years and 22 days old, substitute Brandon Pierrick became the second youngest player to feature for Crystal Palace in a Premier League game after George Ndah vs Liverpool in November 1992 (17 years and 341 days)."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 0-1 Manchester City: Sergio Aguero comes off bench to score winner\nSergio Aguero scored his sixth goal in his last three games as Manchester City edged a gutsy Sheffield United at Bramall Lane.\nThe Blades had looked on course to claim a hugely credible draw against the reigning Premier League champions, with Dean Henderson saving a Gabriel Jesus penalty in the first half as well as making a string of excellent saves.\nBut Aguero came off the bench to score the decisive goal, tapping in a cross from Kevin de Bruyne towards the end of the second half.\nThat strike came just moments after Sheffield United came close to taking the lead themselves - Oli McBurnie stretching to meet a cross but just failing to turn the ball into an empty net.\nVictory for Manchester City means they strengthen their place in second. They have 51 points - 13 behind leaders Liverpool but six ahead of Leicester, who play West Ham on Wednesday.\nSheffield United, meanwhile, remain seventh on 33 points.\nReturning Laporte is 'best in the world' - Guardiola\nCould Henderson be England's Euros keeper?\nAguero helps City come through tough test\nIt is hard to imagine that a manager who has won trophies wherever he has worked is claiming he can still learn from others, but that's exactly what Pep Guardiola said prior to this game.\nThe former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss spoke highly of Sheffield United under Chris Wilder, saying they are a team he can learn from.\nFor large periods of this game the Blades certainly gave Guardiola plenty to think about, with their disciplined and organised defence frustrating City for well over an hour.\nIn the end, Guardiola had to turn to the ever-reliable Aguero to get the job done.\nAt 31, the Argentina international is in the twilight years of his football career but is arguably enjoying some of his best form.\nIt took him just six minutes to get on the scoresheet after coming on for Jesus, who had struggled to get the better of the Blades' defence.\nAguero has now scored 21 goals in just 23 appearances in all competitions this season, including eight in his last five appearances.\nThe league title may be increasingly out of reach for City but Aguero's form could be vital for their aspirations in other competitions.\nJust as crucial, though, could be the return of Aymeric Laporte. Injuries have meant Guardiola has often had to field a makeshift defence this season but Laporte made a surprise return at Bramall Lane after five months out with injury.\nThe result was a first clean sheet since City hosted Sheffield United at the Etihad at the end of December and Guardiola was delighted with the French player's return.\n\"We miss him the lot,\" he said. \"Imagine if the best teams in the world lose their best central defenders.\n\"We knew he could not play 90 minutes. He is an incredible guy. He was exceptional. It is good news for us.\"\nBlades beaten but impress once again\nIt is difficult to find different superlatives to describe Sheffield United in the Premier League this season.\nMatch after match they produce impressive performances, frustrating supposed bigger sides and, rather than being sussed out in the second half of the season, they are seemingly finding new ways to keep their opponents on the toes.\nThat was the case once again on Tuesday night. At the start of the season, Sheffield United fans could have been forgiven for spotting this game on the fixture list and fearing a cricket score, but instead their side showed no fear and went toe to toe with their opponents from the outset.\nThey were strong in the tackle and organised in defence. On the few occasions Manchester City did get through they found Henderson in inspired form.\nThe goalkeeper made a superb stop to deny Raheem Sterling from close range in the first half before then guessing the right way to keep out Jesus' spot kick.\nThat save prompted chants of \"England's number one\" from the home fans and this performance will have only increased his chances of being included in Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2020 this summer.\nMan of the match - Dean Henderson (Sheffield United)\n'An incredibly good victory' - what the managers said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We knew it would be a difficult place to come. We concede one or two clear chances, nothing more than that.\n\"In the first half, the keeper was excellent with the penalty and two incredible saves, it was an incredibly good victory for us to take a step towards securing Champions League football next season.\n\"In the first half we were a little bit shy to play, but in the second half we were a little bit more like we are. But we controlled it really well, the chance to score goals.\n\"What Sheffield United do, they do it perfectly. They've been together for five years so their spirit is so good. They are so good at the second balls and arrive with a lot of people in the final third.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Kevin de Bruyne has found an amazing pass and the movement of Sergio Aguero, he's done that to everyone in Europe and the world, it's a great finish.\n\"I've got nothing but an enormous amount of pride for my team, we went toe-to-toe with them.\n\"When opportunities arise you have to show a little bit of quality and we didn't do that sadly. Games like this are what we're here for, we've worked really hard to get here, we want no regrets and I don't think there were any tonight.\n\"When teams come here, we want to make sure they go through the mixer to get a result and I do believe Pep, his staff, the players and the fans will believe it's been a difficult night for them.\"\nDe Bruyne, the assist king - the stats\nManchester City have scored more away league goals than any other team in Europe's big five divisions this season (34).\nOnly at Selhurst Park (22) have there been fewer Premier League goals scored at a single stadium this season than at Bramall Lane (24), with the Blades netting just 13 and conceding 11.\nManchester City have won three consecutive away league games against Sheffield United for the first time since a run of four between 1905 and 1908.\nSheffield United have won just one of their last 16 league games against reigning top-flight champions (D3 L12), losing their last six in a row without scoring.\nKevin De Bruyne is the first player in Premier League history to provide 15+ assists in three different campaigns (15 in 2019-20, 16 in 2017-18 and 18 in 2016-17).\nSergio Aguero has been directly involved in 43 goals in 43 Premier League appearances against newly-promoted teams (35 goals, 8 assists).\nManchester City's Gabriel Jesus has failed to score three of his five Premier League penalties (60%) - of all players to have taken at least five in the competition, no-one has a worse success rate than the Brazilian (level with Stewart Downing and El Hadji Diouf).\nWhat next?\nSheffield United travel to Championship side Millwall on Saturday, 25 January (15:00 GMT), while Manchester City host Fulham on Sunday, 26 January (13:00 GMT)."

It's a big win, we know there are big games to come and every game is tough.\n\"It does give the players a lot of belief. Teams of mine finish the season better and I'm expecting a better points haul in the second half.\"\nMings admits he feared red card\nKonsa, who thought he had scored the winner having been originally credited with the goal, joked he was \"absolutely devastated\" when told after the match it had been given to England international Mings.\nHowever, Watford will feel the centre-half was lucky to still be on the pitch at the end.\nMings had been booked just before half-time for a late challenge on Abdoulaye Doucoure and was then penalised for a deliberate handball in the second half, although the ball had hit him at close range with his arms by his side.\nReferee Martin Atkinson awarded a free-kick but did not show Mings a second yellow card with the matter not going to the video assistant referee.\n\"Everyone has an opinion on whether Mings should have been sent off - it doesn't matter what I think,\" said Watford boss Nigel Pearson.\n\"You could see how incensed our players were but we're in the hands of the officials to get these decisions right on the field. It's happened and we can't change it.\"\nMings also admitted he was worried he was going to be shown a red card.\nHe said: \"I was concerned, I'm not going to lie. The decision went our way. If they had sent me off I couldn't have had too many arguments.\"\nWatford's 'reality check'\nFor Watford, this was only the second defeat since Pearson took over in December following the sacking of Quique Sanchez Flores, and Pearson described the result as a \"reality check\".\nAfter a quiet opening, Watford provided the first bit of quality in the match in the 38th minute as Deulofeu got free down the right and his chipped ball into the middle was met by Deeney's powerful close-range header, which gave Reina no chance.\nThey should have doubled their lead before the break as Deulofeu found himself one-on-one but, from a tight angle, could only shoot into the side netting, before Reina made an excellent save to deny Deeney.\nVilla were playing without a recognised striker for the fourth successive match as the signing of Mbwana Samatta, who joined on Monday in a \u00a310m deal from Belgian side Genk, was not completed in time.\nTheir lack of cutting edge was shown in the opening 45 minutes as Anwar El Ghazi, playing as a makeshift centre-forward, curled an effort well over the bar from the edge of the penalty area with their only effort of note.\nThey at least created opportunities at the beginning of the second half, although Kortney Hause, Ezri Konsa and Trezeguet all missed chances when well placed and Targett could only head straight at Foster.\nHowever, Luiz, who had only been on the pitch for 12 minutes, equalised when Jack Grealish released Targett and his effort was pushed into Luiz's path.\nVilla had the majority of possession from then on as they pinned Watford back and pushed for a winner, which they got with practically the last kick of the game.\nRare Villa Premier League fightback - the stats\nAston Villa ended their three-game losing streak against Watford in the Premier League, with this win their first victory against the Hornets in the competition since January 2007 (2-0).\nVilla have won a Premier League game having been behind at half-time for the first time since September 2013 (3-2 versus Manchester City), ending a run of 51 games without a victory in the competition when trailing at the break.\nVilla have scored two 90th-minute winners in a single Premier League season (Matt Targett v Brighton in October and Tyrone Mings here) for the first time since 1994-95.\nVilla have scored in nine consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since May 2007-March 2008 (a run of 16).\nWatford's Troy Deeney has scored more Premier League goals against Aston Villa (six in four games) than he has against any other side in the competition.\nDouglas Luiz's equaliser for Aston Villa was his third Premier League goal of the season and first since October 2019 against Norwich.\nAston Villa goalkeeper Pepe Reina has conceded as many goals in his last two Premier League appearances at Villa Park (2) as he did in his first seven with Liverpool (also two).\nMan of the match - Marvelous Nakamba (Aston Villa)\n'To lose with the last kick is really disappointing' - what they said\nWatford manager Nigel Pearson, speaking to Match of the Day: \"This is the first setback we've had, with a few talking points as well. In all honesty we struggled to find the energy levels we have had of late.\n\"We dug in to score a goal in the first half and we had a really good chance to go 2-0 up. It's a disappointing situation and one we will have to come to terms with very quickly.\n\"We've done really well to get back in contact and maybe this is a reality check if people thought the hard work had been done and it shows how quickly things can change. To lose with the last kick of the game is really disappointing but we will bounce back.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford play again in only two days' time as they are at League One Tranmere in an FA Cup third-round replay after a 3-3 draw at Vicarage Road earlier this month. That game takes place on Thursday, 23 January (19:45 GMT), with the Hornets then at home against Everton in the Premier League on Saturday, 1 February (15:00 GMT).\nVilla's next match is the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at home against Leicester on Tuesday, 28 January (19:45 GMT), with the first leg ending 1-1. Villa then face a big game against fellow Premier League strugglers Bournemouth on 1 February (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-2 Arsenal: Hector Bellerin earns Arsenal point in London derby\nArsenal showed the \"togetherness and leadership\" that Mikel Arteta is demanding as they overcame David Luiz's red card to twice fight back and share the spoils in an eventful London derby.\nLuiz was sent off against his former club for shoving Tammy Abraham in the penalty area as the Chelsea striker looked set to score following a terrible backpass by Shkodran Mustafi when the game was goalless.\nJorginho scored from the resulting spot-kick before 18-year-old Gabriel Martinelli scored a brilliant equaliser after a slip by N'Golo Kante only for Cesar Azpilicueta to restore Chelsea's lead late on.\nYet 10-man Arsenal capped a spirited display when Hector Bellerin marked his return from injury with a dramatic equaliser from the edge of the penalty area.\n\"To do that against this kind of opponent in this stadium, I really value,\" Gunners boss Arteta told BBC Sport. \"The way they have done it, with the spirit they have done it, that's great.\n\"I wasn't here a few weeks ago but what I am demanding every day they are trying their best to do it. The togetherness and leadership they showed today, this is what I wanted to see.\n\"We are going in the right direction but I think tonight is a special night for everybody.\"\nAbraham injured in draw against Arsenal\nArteta 'not expecting' big transfers\nReaction from Tuesday's Premier League games\nResolute Gunners show fight\nArsenal remain 10 points off a Champions League spot and, despite this battling performance, they have won just one of their last eight Premier League games. They also face the prospect of finishing outside the top six for the first time since 1994-95.\nIn addition, Arteta remains without an away win since taking charge in December yet he witnessed a gutsy response from his side, who played better with 10 men than they did with 11.\nLuiz, who has given away three penalties in the Premier League this season - more than any other player - was left with little choice after Mustafi's under-hit pass let in Abraham.\nMustafi made up for his error with a clearance from a Chelsea corner which allowed Martinelli to burst forward and, after Kante's slip in the centre circle, produce a sublime finish under Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nChelsea looked like they had secured a first top-flight double over their London neighbours in four years when Azpilicueta restored their lead in the closing minutes but Arteta's side were not done.\nHaving dropped 13 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, they showed a determination that has been missing and, with just their second shot of the game, Bellerin rifled in an equaliser to seal a fourth successive away league draw.\n\"We showed big character,\" Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka, who moved to defence after Luiz's red card, said.\n\"A lot of people say we have no character in the team. We showed in this game we have.\"\nWasteful Chelsea pay the price\nThis result will feel like a defeat for Frank Lampard and his Chelsea players.\nEven before Luiz's dismissal and Jorginho's goal from the spot, the Blues dominated and should have been ahead after a hesitant start by the Gunners.\nHaving lost to a 93rd-minute goal at Newcastle on Saturday, Chelsea came flying out of the blocks.\nAndreas Christensen headed wide from a corner when the Denmark defender should have done better while Abraham was six yards out when he nodded another early chance straight at Leno.\nCallum Hudson-Odoi hit the top of the bar with a looping cross before Chelsea - who forced 17 corners and peppered Arsenal's goal with 19 shots - eventually took the lead.\nYet Chelsea have managed just three clean sheets in the last 15 league and cup games and their failure to take their chances came back to haunt them.\nOn a disappointing night for the hosts, Abraham had to be helped off the pitch at full-time after colliding with an advertising board in the closing moments of the game.\nMan of the match - Hector Bellerin (Arsenal)\nRed mist - the stats\nArsenal have been shown more Premier League red cards against Chelsea than they have against any other side in the competition (8).\nThe Gunners have scored four Premier League goals from outside the box against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge - three of these have been netted by full-backs (Nigel Winterburn in 1997, Sylvinho in 2000 and Hector Bellerin in this match).\nBellerin's goal for Arsenal was his first in the Premier League in 737 days, since netting at Bournemouth in January 2018.\nChelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta has scored four goals in 29 appearances in all competitions this season - his best return in a single season for the Blues. Indeed, he'd scored just four goals in 109 appearances across the last two campaigns combined.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in FA Cup fourth-round action next with Chelsea travelling to Championship Hull City on Saturday (17:30 GMT), while Arsenal are at Bournemouth on Monday (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Leicester 4-1 West Ham: Routine win for Foxes despite Jamie Vardy blow\nLeicester returned to winning ways against West Ham at King Power Stadium but lost the league's top scorer Jamie Vardy to injury in the first half.\nHarvey Barnes scored the opener, poking in from a yard out, before turning provider for Ricardo Pereira on the stroke of half-time.\nWest Ham captain Mark Noble made it 2-1 from the spot before Leicester's Ayoze Perez did the same.\nAnd Perez drilled in a fourth for Leicester with minutes to go.\nThere had been a lengthy stoppage time at the end of the first half as Vardy received treatment for what looked like a hamstring injury.\nLess than 10 minutes before, Leicester midfielder Nampalys Mendy was substituted for an apparent knee injury and West Ham's Robert Snodgrass came off at half-time after a knock.\nOne in, two out as Foxes' injuries mount\nLeicester were boosted by the return of key midfielder Wilfred Ndidi, who was on the bench just 13 days after having minor knee surgery.\nManager Brendan Rodgers had said before kick-off that Ndidi was \"there if we need him\".\nAnd in the end, Leicester did need him when Mendy went down with an apparent knee injury after 32 minutes.\nMendy had filled in for Ndidi in the 2-1 defeat by Burnley on Sunday, as well as playing 70 minutes in the same defensive role in December's victory over West Ham.\nBut Leicester's injury concerns got even worse when Premier League top scorer Vardy immediately clutched the back of his left leg after clearing the ball in his own defensive area.\nSilence spread through the King Power as Vardy - who has scored 17 goals and picked up four assists this season - received treatment on the pitch before attempting to run it off.\nHe lasted barely two minutes when he returned and was eventually substituted for striker Kelechi Iheanacho.\nRodgers said after the game Vardy's injury was \"not his hamstring, which is good\".\nThe striker has contributed to 34% of Leicester's Premier League goals this season and Rodgers added he hoped it would \"ease off over the next couple of days\".\nJob done for Foxes as Hammers struggle\nLeicester were cruising in the first half and came out the blocks firing.\nThey enjoyed 72% of possession and West Ham only managed 17 passes in the opening 10 minutes.\nVardy drew a save from Darren Randolph within minutes - finishing off a slick passing move from Leicester - and there were further chances for Pereira and Mendy before Barnes eventually got the opener on 24 minutes.\nPereira slotted the ball across the face of the goal and Barnes could not miss from a yard out, before the two combined again in stoppage time - giving the home fans something to cheer about despite the mood dampening when Vardy trudged off injured.\nWest Ham looked well beaten at the break but they may have sensed the anxiety among the Leicester players and fans because they looked a more threatening side at the start the second half.\nNoble stepped up confidently to put away the penalty - which was given after minimal contact from Ndidi on Sebastien Haller in the box - and Manuel Lanzini came close to an equaliser when he almost poked in a loose ball from Michail Antonio's rebounded flick.\nLeicester rode the simmering pressure and began to settle again - Iheanacho and James Maddison being denied before Perez eventually thumped in the third goal from the spot after Angelo Ogbonna's clumsy tackle on Iheanacho.\nThe job was done for Leicester, who continued to pepper Randolph's goal, but Perez doubled his tally with a slick finish from inside the box.\nThe victory leaves Leicester 14 points ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United, while West Ham remain level on points with second-bottom Watford and without a win in three successive league games.\nMan of the match - Harvey Barnes (Leicester)\nNoble's coolness from the spot - best of the stats\nLeicester picked up their eighth home victory in the Premier League this season - this is their most ever during the first 12 home games of a league campaign.\nThis was West Ham manager David Moyes' 50th Premier League away game against a side starting the day in the top four - the Scotsman has won just one of these 50 games (D15, L34), with that lone victory coming in December 2010 (Manchester City 1-2 Everton).\nLeicester have now scored 52 goals in the Premier League this season, their most after 24 games of a top-flight campaign since 1930-31 (52).\nSince the start of October 2019, no team have gained fewer points (11) or lost more games (11) in the Premier League than West Ham.\nHarvey Barnes has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time as a Leicester player, while he's already netted as many goals in the competition in 2020 (two in three games) as he managed in the whole of 2019 (two in 35 games).\nMark Noble has now been directly involved in 79 goals for West Ham in the Premier League (46 goals and 33 assists), the most of any player for the club in the competition's history, overtaking Paolo Di Canio.\nRicardo Pereira has had a direct hand in 13 goals in the Premier League since the start of last season (five goals and eight assists) - the only two defenders with more in this period are Liverpool pair Trent Alexander-Arnold (24) and Andrew Robertson (18).\nNoble has now scored 27 penalties in the Premier League (out of 31 taken), the fourth-most of any player in the competition's history, behind Alan Shearer (56), Frank Lampard (43) and Steven Gerrard (32).\n'Success is about the team' - what they said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I thought we were very good. We played with that authority in the game and personality that the team has played with all season. Tempo was good, pressed well.\"\nOn Jamie Vardy's injury: \"It is not his hamstring which is good. Hopefully over the next couple of days it will ease off and he will be fit. Jamie is a real talisman for the team but if we are going to have success it is about the team.\n\"He hasn't played for us in a number of games and the team has still played well but of course we want him fit and well. He is such a good player and we hope it is not too serious.\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a positive that we got something for 10 to 15 minutes but for most of the game Leicester were by far the better team. That hasn't been the case in all the games, we have been in them or close.\n\"I thought in the second half we at least got the ball forward more. It was good to get Michail Antonio back because he has been good for us. We didn't have enough players who could make something happen in the final third. We are missing that type of player.\n\"They looked faster to the ball than us. It is never easy but we won't make excuses. We've been good but tonight was probably the worst I have seen us defensively at times.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Brentford for their FA Cup fourth-round tie on Saturday, 25 January (12:45 GMT) before the crucial Carabao Cup semi-final second leg at Aston Villa on Tuesday, 28 January (19:45). Their next Premier League game is at home to Chelsea on Saturday, 1 February (12:30).\nWest Ham host West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup on Saturday, 25 January (15:00) and return to Premier League action against leaders Liverpool at London Stadium on Wednesday, 29 January (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham 2-1 Norwich: Spurs are unlucky with injuries, says Jose Mourinho\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho lamented his side's bad luck with injuries after they edged past bottom-of-the-table Norwich to claim their first Premier League win of 2020.\nSpurs have struggled for goals since losing Harry Kane to injury but ended a run of three league games without scoring when Dele Alli struck just before half-time.\nThe home side then lost Harry Winks to injury 10 minutes after the break and Norwich equalised with 20 minutes to go when Teemu Pukki fired a second-half penalty past Hugo Lloris, who was making his return after three months out with a dislocated shoulder.\nSon Heung-min nodded in a deflected cross with 11 minutes to go to give Tottenham their first win since Boxing Day.\n\"We are in a situation when I have to think, think, think,\" said Mourinho.\n\"I look to bench and we don't have attacking players. I had to take off Erik Lamela because of fatigue but we showed an incredible reaction to score a second goal.\n\"When Chelsea want to win they bring on Michy Batshuayi. When Manchester City want to change Gabriel Jesus they bring in Sergio Aguero.\n\"We are so, so unlucky with injuries. We get back Hugo Lloris and we lose Harry Winks. It's incredible.\"\nMourinho was able to provide some positive news on Winks' injury after the game, saying he would be out for \"weeks not months\" with an ankle problem.\n'Happiness to see one of world's best goalkeepers back'\nThe former Manchester United boss was also delighted with Lloris' return.\nThe France international had been out since dislocating his elbow against Brighton on 5 October and was a surprise inclusion in the starting XI for this game.\nLloris was largely untested and perhaps should have done better for Pukki's penalty having guessed the right way, but it was pleasing for Mourinho to see him come through the 90 minutes unscathed.\n\"It's happiness to see one of the best goalkeepers in the world to be back,\" he said.\n\"It's a very good feeling for us but at the same time it is one of these decisions that sometimes we must have it, but it hurts. To leave Paulo Gazzaniga out hurts.\n\"The good thing is that he is such a good member of the family and he is such a special friend of Hugo that I think he also shared our happiness to have Hugo back as a friend.\n\"For me he gave me a lot of thinking and I had to try to be cold to make a decision without emotions because to leave Paulo out is not easy.\"\nVictory - Tottenham's first in the Premier League since beating Brighton on Boxing Day - means Jose Mourinho's side move up to sixth.\nNorwich, meanwhile, remain bottom and six points adrift of safety.\nAlli ends Spurs' long wait\nThe absence of the injured Harry Kane as the focal point of Tottenham's attacks has been telling, with Spurs having failed to score in the Premier League this year going into the game.\nAnd, for more than 30 minutes, the home side once again looked destined to draw a blank.\nTottenham's build-up play was ponderous and on the few occasions they did manage to find gaps in the Norwich defence the chances were wasted, as Erik Lamela fired straight at Tim Krul and Son Heung-min drove into the sidenetting.\nBut, seven minutes before half-time, Alli provided the one moment of quality to break the deadlock. After 398 minutes and 48 shots, Spurs had finally scored their first goal of 2020.\nThe home side have the joint worst record for clean sheets in the Premier League - level on three with opponents Norwich - so a one-goal lead was always likely to leave Spurs fans nervous.\nAnd their worries would prove founded as Norwich equalised with 20 minutes remaining, Pukki's penalty - his 11th goal of the season - looking to have done enough to earn the battling Canaries a hard-fought draw.\nBut Son, aided by a touch of fortune with the wicked deflection from Alli's cross, got the winner with 11 minutes to go and ensured Tottenham took three points that just about keeps them in the hunt for the top four.\nDefeat increases Norwich worries\nNorwich came into this game on the back of a morale-boosting win against relegation rivals Bournemouth and, while usually a trip to Tottenham would be a daunting prospect, Spurs' poor recent form - particularly at home - should have given the Canaries some belief they could get a positive result.\nThe away side perhaps gave their opponents too much respect and a first-half Pukki chance - when he got in behind the defence only for his shot to be pushed behind by Lloris - highlighted that opportunities were there against the Spurs defence.\nThey finally became more adventurous after Pukki's goal, pushing for a winner themselves, and can count themselves unfortunate not to have come away with a result.\nBut the Canaries are at the stage where they need positive results not performances. Daniel Farke's side have managed just one away win all season - a record that needs to improve if they are to claw back the six-point deficit to safety.\nMan of the match - Giovani Lo Celso (Tottenham)\n'We are so unlucky with injuries' - what they said\nNorwich City boss Daniel Farke, speaking to BBC MOTD: \"I can't ask my lads for more. We played a side able to bring on Eric Dier, Christian Eriksen and Gedson Fernandes.\n\"The lads left their hearts out on the pitch. It's disappointing to drive away with a loss. We have a special group of players. It was a fantastic away performance even though it was a defeat.\n\"It's difficult when you don't win games because it's not good for the mood or confidence. We deserved at least one point. To lose this game because of a deflected cross is tough - no doubt. But you have to keep going.\"\nWednesday win day for Spurs - the stats\nTottenham Hotspur have beaten Norwich in three consecutive home league games for the first time since a run of five between 1989 and 1993.\nNorwich are now winless in their last 21 Premier League visits to London (D6 L15), losing each of the last seven.\nSpurs have now won each of their last 10 home Premier League games on a Wednesday since defeat against Leicester in January 2016.\nSpurs' Son Heung-min has been directly involved in 11 goals (six goals and five assists) in his last 10 Premier League matches against newly-promoted sides.\nNorwich striker Teemu Pukki has now scored against each of last season's top five Premier League teams (Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Spurs and Arsenal) - he is the only player to have done so in 2019-20.\nSpurs defender Serge Aurier has assisted seven goals in all competitions this season - the only Premier League defender to set up more is Trent Alexander-Arnold (11).\nDele Alli's opener for Spurs was their first Premier League goal from open play since Alli himself netted against Brighton on Boxing Day; six hours and 55 minutes of game-time separated the two goals.\nWhat next?\nAttention switches to the FA Cup for both these clubs. Tottenham travel to Southampton on Saturday, 25 January (15:00 GMT), while Norwich are at Burnley at the same time."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 0-2 Burnley: Clarets shock United at Old Trafford\nManchester United were jeered by their own supporters as Burnley registered their first ever Premier League win at Old Trafford.\nBurnley took the lead just before half-time when Chris Wood spun off Harry Maguire to meet Ben Mee's knockdown and smash into the top corner from the edge of the six-yard box.\nJay Rodriguez doubled the Clarets' advantage when he played a one-two with Wood before firing into the top corner of David de Gea's near post with a venomous strike from the left-hand corner of the penalty area.\nIt was the third season in a row Burnley had gone 2-0 up at Old Trafford, but for the first time they hung on for all three points.\nUnited, who were without the injured Marcus Rashford, were lacklustre for large periods and barely threatened Nick Pope in the Burnley goal.\nThey were booed off at half-time and full-time and large parts of the ground emptied with five minutes left.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side remain six points behind Chelsea and off the top four, while Burnley climb to 13th, seven points clear of the relegation zone.\n'Toxic, embarrassing, worst squad in 30 years' - pundits and fans on Man Utd defeat\nMan Utd 'not good enough' - Solskjaer\nFootball Daily podcast: Old Trafford turns 'toxic'\nMartial spurns opportunity\nA lot of pre-match conversation was focused on how United would cope without Rashford, who is sidelined for at least six weeks with a stress fracture of the back.\nThat gave an opportunity to Anthony Martial to stake his claim to be United's long-term number nine, but the Frenchman looked off the pace throughout and wasted two good first-half opportunities from Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross and Nemanja Matic's throughball.\nSolskjaer turned to 18-year-old Mason Greenwood at half-time, and the teenager at least showed glimpses of his potential with a brilliant turn past Charlie Taylor followed by a driving run and shot which went just wide.\nHowever, the fact Solskjaer is regularly turning to a teenager in a desperate attempt to turn around games is a damning indictment of the quality of his squad, and could prompt United to act in the final nine days of the transfer window.\nBurnley back to vintage selves\nBurnley's second-half display in their 2-1 win over Champions League-chasing Leicester on Sunday signalled a return to the grit and character that has been the Clarets' blueprint since they returned to the top flight in 2016.\nThere was more of the same in Manchester on Wednesday as Wood and Rodriguez showed the ruthlessness up front the east Lancashire side have sorely missed at times this season.\nBehind the front two it was a disciplined and well-organised display, with Mee and James Tarkowski superb at the heart of defence, married with a tenacious midfield display from Jack Cork and Ashley Westwood.\nBack-to-back wins mean Burnley move level on points with 10th-placed Arsenal, Crystal Palace, Everton and Newcastle - all five teams locked on 30 points.\nMan of the match - Ben Mee (Burnley)\n'It is not good enough' - what the managers said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, talking to BBC Match of the Day: \"There are loads of thoughts going through my mind. At one point it felt like we were creating openings and didn't take them. Now, it's one of disappointment. We hold our hands up, it is not good enough.\n\"The players are giving everything, they have done absolutely fantastic so far this season but they know it wasn't good enough tonight.\n\"The boys they looked mentally tired towards the end, we didn't find that creativity. We can't feel sorry for ourselves. When you are at Man Utd you are privileged because you are playing for the best club in the world. Sometimes you go through periods like this and it is a test I am sure they are going to come through.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, talking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I am very pleased with that. We know it's a tough place to come and it was a good performance from us. We scored two very good goals.\n\"They didn't find any killer moments, which was very pleasing. Strong, fit and organised will never go out of fashion.\"\nGrim reading for Solskjaer - the stats\nBurnley ended a run of 15 away league matches without a win against Manchester United, tasting victory for the first time since a 5-2 win in September 1962.\nSince Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was made permanent manager in March, United have lost more Premier League games (12) than they have won (11).\nManchester United suffered consecutive Premier League defeats for only the second time under Solskjaer, losing back-to-back games for the first time since April 2019.\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche has now beaten 27 of the 29 teams he has faced in the Premier League, failing only against Arsenal (9 games) and Sheffield United (1).\nSince the start of the 2017-18 season, Burnley striker Chris Wood is one of only 12 players to have scored 30+ Premier League goals (30 in total).\nThree of the last seven occasions Manchester United have trailed by at least two goals in a home Premier League game have been against Burnley (also December 2017 and January 2019).\nChris Wood's goal in the 39th minute was Burnley's first goal in the first half of a Premier League game since November, when they scored twice against West Ham.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United will travel to the winner of Thursday's FA Cup third-round replay between Tranmere and Watford on Sunday, 26 January (15:00 GMT) while Burnley host Norwich on Saturday, 25 January (15:00 GMT)."

He was constantly available and always urging his team-mates to greater efforts.\nHe has grown in stature, along with Liverpool, in these last two seasons and is now the heartbeat of this outstanding team.\nHis influence is increasingly recognised and he was the driving force as Liverpool ground out a win in such a difficult environment.\nWolves are here to stay\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo and his players understandably cut dejected figures at the final whistle, denied so late on as they pushed to become only the second team after Manchester United to take points off Liverpool this season.\nWhen that disappointment subsides, they can look back with pride on a performance that produced further evidence of what has been rebuilt at this famous old club.\nWolves were organised, played without fear, and in Jimenez and Traore possess a huge threat to back up their many qualities elsewhere.\nTraore's power and pace gave Andrew Robertson a very uncomfortable night while Jimenez has developed into a striker of the highest class.\nIt is all played out in Molineux's atmospheric arena, where the Wolves fans are revelling in what is being produced - and so they should.\nWolves can now regard themselves rightfully as a force in the Premier League. They are entertaining and superbly coached. This is a team that is here to stay in the upper reaches.\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson\n'The boys are human' - manager reaction\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: \"We changed the system two or three times, we calmed it down. We had incredible chances in the first half and then at the end it was a magic moment from Bobby.\n\"The boys are human. It was a little bit up and down. We had discussion on the pitch, there was stuff to improve but set-pieces can bring us back in the game, a good bit of skill can bring us back in the game. Wolves were really strong but it's clear we could settle again.\n\"You just have to find a way to win and have someone who makes the perfect decision and that was Bobby again.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to BBC Sport: \"It was a good game. We played well. There is nothing to be disappointed about. Getting the momentum was important.\n\"We defended well, we were well organised. This is what we want. We want to compete and keep on growing.\n\"We had in the last moment of the game [the chance to equalise]. It's about creating. Things will come naturally.\n\"I'm happy when we perform well. We faced a fantastic team. This is the standards we want.\"\nMost points after 23 games ever - match stats\nLiverpool have amassed 67 points from a possible 69 this season - five more than any side in English top-flight history have after 23 games.\nRaul Jimenez's goal for Wolves ended a run of 725 minutes without conceding a Premier League goal for Liverpool since Richarlison scored for Everton at Anfield exactly 50 days ago.\nJimenez is the third Premier League player to net 20 or more goals in all competitions this season, after Sergio Aguero (21) and Raheem Sterling (20).\nWolves duo Adama Traore and Jimenez have combined for eight Premier League goals this season, more than any other partnership in the competition.\nWolves have lost four consecutive home league games against Liverpool for the very first time.\nLiverpool are the first club to win three top-flight games on a Thursday in the same season since Leicester City in 1933-34.\nWolves have conceded the first goal in 17 of their 24 Premier League games this season, including each of their last eight in a row.\nJordan Henderson has scored more than once in the same season for Liverpool for the first time since 2015-16. Five of his last six goals for the Reds have come away from home.\nSince the start of last season, Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold has assisted 22 Premier League goals, at least five more than any other player, with 10 of those coming from dead balls, also a league-high.\nRoberto Firmino has scored six goals in his last eight games for Liverpool, as many as he had in his previous 32. All 10 of his goals this season have come away from Anfield.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool play three times before Wolves' next game. The Reds visit Shrewsbury in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday (17:00 GMT), and go to West Ham next Wednesday (19:45) in their Premier League game in hand.\nKlopp's side then host Southampton on Saturday, 1 February (15:00), with Wolves visiting European rivals Manchester United at 17:30."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 0-2 Liverpool: Routine win sends Reds 19 points clear at the top of the Premier League\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp doesn't feel as \"though anything is done\" despite his side reaching 70 points before the end of January and moving 19 points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nMohamed Salah's first-half penalty and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's second-half effort delivered a 23rd victory in 24 matches for the Reds at West Ham.\nAnd their 15th consecutive win also maintained the relentless march towards a first top-flight title since 1990.\nHowever, while Liverpool, who are now unbeaten in 41 league games and could go on to reach several top-flight milestones, Klopp played down their significance.\n\"I'm only happy about the three points,\" he said. \"Tonight was a normal performance. I have no idea [if anyone will catch us]. The first target is to get the maximum points - there are still a lot of games.\n\"Yes we have 70 points, an incredible number, but so many things can happen. I'm not too much concerned about records.\n\"We had a record at [Borussia] Dortmund and Bayern [Munich] beat it the next season. We don't feel as though anything is done, I promise you. We take a deep breath and then Saturday it's Southampton.\"\nWhile the result appears to have tightened Liverpool's hold on this season's title, it intensifies the pressure on the Hammers at the bottom.\nDavid Moyes' side now sit 17th in the table, just above Bournemouth and Watford on goal difference.\nBacked by vociferous crowd inside London Stadium, the hosts started in a determined fashion and limited Liverpool to few chances until Issa Diop's foul on Divock Origi allowed Salah to put the visitors ahead from a penalty and their first shot on target.\nAnd while Manuel Lanzini's scuffed close-range shot and Robert Snodgrass' hurried effort represented good opportunities for the hosts, Oxlade-Chamberlain's goal ensured a comfortable conclusion to the evening for Klopp's side, who could have scored again when Salah hit the post from 18 yards.\n\"They're as good as there's been around,\" Moyes said. \"It's very difficult when you've been manager of Everton and Manchester United to say that but Liverpool are an excellent side.\"\nWest Ham sign Soucek from Slavia Prague\nListen to the Football Daily Podcast\nMoyes' miserable run continues\nFor just over 30 minutes at least, West Ham gave manager Moyes hope that he could improve on his miserable record against Liverpool.\nWhile his side fulfilled its first brief, to largely stifle their seemingly unstoppable opponents by remaining compact and deep, they offered little beyond that and looked vulnerable whenever they attacked.\nAnd they were eventually punished when Diop was caught slightly out of position to bring down Origi.\nFrom that moment it seemed unlikely that 56-year-old Moyes would avoid a 17th top-flight defeat to the Reds - with the Scot having now won just three times in 28 attempts.\nDespite Moyes' generally concerned demeanour, there were bright spots for West Ham, who recently posted financial losses of \u00a327.3m and stressed that retaining their Premier League status is \"an absolute necessity\".\nNineteen-year-old Jeremy Ngakia caught the eye on his debut for the club and showed that their is life beyond veteran full-back Pablo Zabaleta.\nThe academy product settled after displaying early nerves and played a superb pass for Lanzini to run on to during the first half as he grew into the occasion.\nEfficient Liverpool win again\nIt is now almost impossible to ignore the huge gap at the top of the Premier League between Liverpool and their rivals that this victory only served to enhance.\nBut if you were, it would be the manner of this Liverpool victory that suggests they appear certainties to win the Premier League.\nLike in recent victories against Tottenham, Manchester United and Wolves, Klopp's side were far from their best.\nWhile they dominated possession they showed little end product until Salah's penalty but it was still good enough to deliver a 23rd victory from 24 matches - taking them to 70 points before January is out.\nVirgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez were barely troubled in defence while Jordan Henderson provided a controlling presence in midfield.\nAt times it appeared as though they were playing within themselves, until the moment arose for an incisive break forward, where their greater quality really showed.\nOxlade-Chamberlain's right-foot strike into the bottom left corner was the perfect demonstration, with Henderson initiating the move from a West Ham corner before Salah's superb outside of the boot pass bisected a couple of home defenders to send the England midfielder through on goal.\nKlopp's side have now beaten every team in the Premier League this season at least once and were serenaded from the field by the club's jubilant and expectant fans at the final whistle.\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson (Liverpool)\nKlopp's milestone - the stats\nLiverpool have gone 41 Premier League games without defeat (W36 D5) - the third longest such run in English top-flight history behind Arsenal (49 in Oct 2004) and Nottingham Forest (42 in Nov 1978).\nLiverpool have won their last 15 Premier League games - only the fourth occasion of a team winning 15+ consecutive English top-flight games (Manchester City 18 in December 2017, Liverpool 17 in October 2019 and City 15 in August 2019).\nLiverpool have won 70 points from just 24 games in the Premier League this season - the quickest any English top-flight side has ever reached this total.\nJurgen Klopp registered his 150th victory as Liverpool manager in all competitions (W150 D58 L39).\nAgainst no side has West Ham manager David Moyes lost more Premier League games than versus Liverpool (17 - level with Arsenal).\nWest Ham have lost six of their last nine Premier League games at London Stadium (W1 D2).\nLiverpool's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has scored more Premier League goals versus West Ham United than against any other side (3).\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah has been directly involved in seven goals in five Premier League games against West Ham (5 goals, 2 assists).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool welcome Southampton to Anfield in the Premier League on Saturday 1 February (15:00 GMT). West Ham host Brighton in their next Premier League game, also on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-2 Chelsea: Antonio Rudiger goals help Blues take point at King Power\nLeicester and Chelsea played out an entertaining Premier League draw in a see-saw encounter at King Power Stadium.\nThe result means the Foxes stay third in the table, eight points above Chelsea in fourth.\nAfter a largely uneventful first half, the game came to life just after the break when Antonio Rudiger headed Chelsea in front from Mason Mount's corner.\nBrendan Rodgers' team levelled eight minutes later, Harvey Barnes' effort deflecting off Blues defender Reece James into the top-right corner.\nAnd Rodgers looked to be heading towards a first win over Chelsea at the 14th attempt as a manager when Ben Chilwell swept a Youri Tielemans cross into the bottom left corner.\nBut Rudiger's second headed goal of the day - from another Mount delivery - ensured Frank Lampard's side claimed a point.\nFollow Leicester City v Chelsea and all the Premier League action\nChelsea underline top-four credentials\nChelsea started this match a place higher but eight points worse off than at the corresponding stage last season.\nAnd although Lampard has recently talked of his side being \"underdogs\" in the race for Champions League qualification, it is difficult to see which teams below them are capable of bridging the gap.\nLampard will have been delighted by the way his side took charge at the start of each half and then, when they fell behind to a transformed Leicester team, had the resolve to fight back to earn a merited point.\nThe outcome in part also vindicated Lampard's decision to drop the world's most expensive goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, in favour of Willy Caballero.\nAt 38, the Argentine is heading towards the twilight of his career but he made a superb save early on to deny Jamie Vardy his 18th goal of the season and, although his decision to charge away from goal in pursuit of a cross in the build-up to Chilwell's goal was an aberration, he was otherwise solid.\nCaballero brilliantly saved Chilwell's deflected cross, moments after Barnes' equaliser, and appeared a calming influence on Rudiger and Andreas Christensen when his side came under pressure.\nLeicester's dip?\nThis was another Leicester performance in which they struggled to maintain the high standards they set earlier in the campaign.\nSince winning comfortably at Newcastle on 1 January, the Foxes have collected only four points from a possible 12.\nAnd although they took charge after Barnes had equalised and went on to lead, their authority was fleeting.\nBarnes steered a glorious chance wide when through on Caballero, and Jonny Evans headed wide from a corner, but they never appeared fully in control.\nRodgers' side appeared to be suffering a hangover from their Carabao Cup defeat by Aston Villa on Tuesday - making sluggish starts in each half.\nBut for the excellence of Evans - particularly in the first period - they could have be punished on at least five occasions.\nThe former Manchester United and West Brom defender made a series of excellent tackles and interceptions, with his only blot misdirecting a late chance to win the game.\nHowever, the Foxes still have a considerable cushion to Chelsea, with the teams below that even further away from threatening their place in next season's Champions League.\nMan of the match - Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea)\n'Not many people gave us the top-four slot' - what they said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers talking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We're disappointed not to have won the game. I thought we started both halves slow.\n\"We should have won having gone 2-1 up. We gifted them two goals really, which we're disappointed with. Our concentration and organisation wasn't quick enough in one or two players. But what we did was show a fantastic mentality to come from behind against a really good side with top-level players.\n\"Against a top team it might be deemed a good result but we should win that game. But they've come from a tough game in midweek and battled to get a point.\n\"These players are still learning and still young and there's elements we will be better in going forward. It was a great fight today - we worked our way into the game with some real moments of quality and eventually played very well.\n\"It's been a long period form December. We'll go away, come back and get back to being consistent.\"\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard talking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We were the better team in the first half, in terms of how we moved the ball, and we created some gilt-edged chances. In the second half we weren't so fluid and they created some good chances themselves.\n\"Toni Rudiger and Andreas Christensen were really good. Toni was aggressive - the second goal is a really great header - so I'm really pleased with him.\"\nOn Willy Caballero: \"His performance was pretty good - he makes a good save, he's comfortable with his feet, there was not much you could do with either goal.\"\nChelsea still underdogs for the top four: \"We were underdogs at the start of the season. Not many people gave us the top-four slot and I understand why, and it's probably the same now. We've come to Leicester, who everyone's raving about, quite rightly, and we've got a point. We move on.\"\nBarnes' hot streak - the stats\nLeicester have now dropped eight points from winning positions in their past four Premier League games - more than they had in their previous 59 matches from the start of the 2018-19 campaign (6).\nChelsea's 13 Premier League away games this season have seen 49 goals scored (F27 A22) - no other sides have seen more on the road (level with Manchester City).\nThis was the sixth Premier League game this season that Chelsea failed to win despite scoring the first goal (D5 L1) - only West Ham (7) have failed to win more games in which they've opened the scoring this season (pending results of 15:00 kick-offs).\nLeicester's Harvey Barnes has scored in three consecutive league games for the first time in his senior career - he'd found the net in just two of his first 39 games in the competition.\nAntionio Rudiger became the first defender to score twice in a Premier League match for Chelsea since John Terry did so against Fulham in April 2013.\nAt 38 years 126 days, Chelsea keeper Willy Caballero became the oldest player to appear in the Premier League so far this season.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their next Premier League game on Friday, 14 February (20:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "Newcastle 0-0 Norwich: Canaries further adrift of Premier League safety\nNorwich earned a point at Newcastle but were left frustrated by a number of wasted chances which saw them slip further away from safety.\nDaniel Farke's side showed greater endeavour in a tight contest but leading scorer Teemu Pukki failed to take several chances.\nThe Finn, who has 11 Premier League goals this season, blazed over from a counter attack and was also thwarted on separate occasions by Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and defender Federico Fernandez.\nSam Byram also went close but found Dubravka in fine form to deny the Norwich full-back from a corner.\nNorwich started the day bottom of the table and six points from safety. This result, combined with others elsewhere, increased that margin to seven.\nThey might at least be able to take solace from their performance, but for Steve Bruce's Newcastle there were boos at full-time.\nThe home side's best efforts came from Allan Saint-Maximin, who forced Tim Krul into two good stops while Miguel Almiron should have headed in with the goal gaping.\nIt was another disjointed display from the hosts, although they are now four league games unbeaten for the first time this season.\nNewcastle poor in attack once more\nNewcastle introduced loan signings Danny Rose and Valentino Lazaro in the second half and Bruce's side were also hoping for a boost from Nabil Bentaleb, another new arrival, who made a first Premier League start in midfield.\nThe loan signing from Schalke showed some nice touches, but Newcastle showed once again that they tend to cause teams most danger when they are direct.\nThe game also demonstrated their need for an in-form striker as Joelinton, who has only scored twice this season, again struggled.\nNewcastle relied heavily on the unpredictability of Saint-Maximin from the left wing.\nHis early shot was saved by Krul in an open start to the game, while his second-half cross almost led to an own goal by Grant Hanley, who was thankful to Krul's low stop.\nBut the hosts struggled to match the kind of intricate play which has become Norwich's trademark.\nInstead they relied on power at both ends of the pitch, with their defence holding firm and Joelinton providing some aerial threat, shown when his header was stopped by Krul with Almiron somehow heading wide from the rebound.\nThere was plenty of effort and Newcastle raised their game in the second half when their debutants came on.\nHowever a lack of goal threat proved costly. They had scored three injury-time goals in their past two Premier League games but there were to be no late heroics this time.\nNorwich's class proves fruitless\nWhat Newcastle would do for a striker of Pukki's class, although this was a day when the forward found himself up against one of the league's leading goalkeepers in Dubravka.\nThe visitors showed that despite their lowly position in the table, they are capable of carving teams open by playing between the lines, and combining that with speedy breakaways.\nAll that was missing was the finishing touch from their leading marksman.\nHaving earlier seen a rising drive tipped over, Pukki was then set through one-on-one against Dubravka only for Fernandez to clear his goal-bound effort.\nWorse was to come. A speedy counterattack led to another chance blazed over the top, and he couldn't beat Dubravka either from another breakaway with Ondrej Duda firing the rebound into the side netting.\nNorwich's threat was reduced once the excellent Todd Cantwell was withdrawn because of injury late on and in his absence Farke's side decided to play for a point.\nBut this was a game when they could and should have boosted their hopes of survival and improved on a run of just one win in their past 12 Premier League games.\nMan of the match - Allan Saint-Maximin\n'We're totally disappointed'\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce told Match of the Day: \"The most important thing is we haven't played well again, but we haven't been beaten. That's not a bad trait to have in the Premier League but we all know we have to play better. We haven't done enough and we are disappointed.\n\"We set ourselves up to be difficult to beat. If you look at the record we've got, we've done fantastically well. Now we have to get a little bit of quality in forward areas. We have to improve in the midfield too because the strikers need something to feed off.\n\"We gave the ball away so cheaply today, which is is disappointing.\"\nNorwich boss Daniel Farke to Match of the Day: \"We're totally disappointed because we totally dominated. The level of the chances should be enough to win, especially an away game. It's not a bad result, but we are more disappointed than happy.\n\"I always respect the players. They put themselves in tough positions. We were dangerous. They did everything we asked for. We want them to be more brutal with their finishing, but these things happen sometimes. I'm happy with the performance, not the result.\n\"Newcastle have so much quality up front. I was happy with how we controlled the game, but not the outcome. A nearly perfect performance deserves three points.\"\nToothless Canaries - the stats\nNewcastle are unbeaten in their last four Premier League games (W1 D3), their longest such run in the competition since November 2018.\nOnly Manchester United (24 vs Burnley last month) have had more shots without scoring in a Premier League match than the 19 Norwich attempted.\nNorwich had 19 shots in this match - since 2003-04, only in one Premier League away game have the Canaries had more attempts (27 v Cardiff in February 2014).\nNorwich have now failed to score in eight different Premier League away games this season, two more than any other side.\nNorwich are winless in their last 13 Premier League games played on the first day of the month (D7 L6), drawing on 1st December, 1st January and now 1st February this season.\nIn his first Premier League appearance for Newcastle today, Nabil Bentaleb created four chances for his team-mates - no player has created more in a single match for the Magpies this season.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle have an FA Cup fourth-round replay at Oxford on Tuesday, then have their Premier League winter break. They travel to Arsenal on Sunday, 16 February (16:30 GMT).\nNorwich also take a break next weekend, returning to action by hosting runaway league leaders Liverpool on 15 February (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-1 Aston Villa: Cherries move out of relegation zone with win over Villa\nBournemouth lifted themselves out of the Premier League relegation zone with a 2-1 victory over fellow strugglers Aston Villa at the Vitality Stadium.\nTwo first-half goals in six minutes from Philip Billing and Nathan Ake proved enough to secure all three points - even though the Cherries found themselves down to 10 men in the early stages of the second half, midfielder Jefferson Lerma shown a second yellow card for a foul on Jack Grealish.\nWith a man advantage, Villa found a way back into the game courtesy of \u00a38.5m signing Mbwana Samatta, who became the first Tanzanian to score in the Premier League with a debut goal on 70 minutes.\nBut Eddie Howe's side managed to withstand Villa's pressure and can celebrate back-to-back league wins for the first time since September.\nBournemouth are now up to 16th place in the table - the position Villa were in before kick-off - and out of the relegation zone on 26 points.\nVilla win 'a big moment' in relegation fight - Howe\nBournemouth's bright start\nThree weeks ago, on a run of six winless league games, it did not look like Bournemouth had the strength for a relegation fight.\nVictory over Brighton lifted the gloom and against Villa there was an intensity from the first whistle that suggests a returning appetite for the struggle.\nFull-back Adam Smith hit the side-netting before being flagged offside while a long-range effort from Billing tested Villa keeper Pepe Reina.\nDenmark midfielder Billing did find the back of the net after a wayward free-kick was kept in play by skipper Simon Francis, his cross being met by Dan Gosling, who nodded it down for Billing to sweep in a left-footed finish from eight yards out.\nThe Cherries doubled their lead deservedly six minutes later. Ryan Fraser's low drive from a Harry Wilson set-piece was spilled by former Liverpool keeper Reina in the direction of Ake, who stretched a leg out to send a low finish into the bottom corner.\nThe one sour note for Howe and the home crowd was the sending off of Lerma on 51 minutes. The Colombia midfielder received both yellow cards - his 22nd and 23rd in 52 games for the club - for tussles with Villa's star man Grealish and will miss the Cherries' next game away to Sheffield United.\nIt clearly was not the immediate concern though as Howe and his team embraced in a huddle on the final whistle, the relief of a much-needed boost to their top-flight survival prospects felt around the whole ground.\nOne eye on Wembley for Villa?\nAston Villa have had a week to remember with their Carabao Cup semi-final success over high-flying Midlands rivals Leicester in midweek following a late 2-1 win over Watford in the league last weekend.\nManager Dean Smith said he would be \"a very proud man\" to lead his boyhood club out at Wembley against holders Manchester City - but could the prospect of a first trophy since their League Cup win in 1996 be a distraction in the relegation battle the club has found itself in?\nVilla were 16th in the table before heading to the south coast and on a high after those twin successes but only a very late Brighton equaliser at West Ham prevented them finishing the day back in the drop zone.\nLoan signing Reina was the busier of the goalkeepers and the 37-year-old's steady hands kept Bournemouth from scoring sooner then they did.\nVilla only registered one shot on target in the first half when Grealish, a constant threat and creative spark, saw his low drive from the angle brilliantly diverted away from goal by Adam Ramsdale's sharp reflexes.\nSmith's attacking options have been limited by a knee injury to record signing Wesley, but the Villa boss can at least take solace in the fact his January transfer window recruitment has bear immediate fruit.\nSamatta, who scored 43 league goals in 98 appearances for Genk in Belgium's top flight before switching to Villa Park, got Villa's first headed goal in the league this season, the Tanzania international quick to react ahead of Bournemouth keeper Ramsdale.\nMan of the Match - Ryan Fraser (Bournemouth)\nStill no away clean sheet for Villa - match stats\nBournemouth have won their last two Premier League games, as many victories as they managed in their previous 17 in the competition (D4 L11).\nVilla remain the only side in the Premier League this season yet to register an away clean sheet in the competition.\nVilla have seen their opponents pick up six red cards in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nCourtesy of Mbwana Samatta, Aston Villa scored their first headed goal in the Premier League since Ciaran Clark netted against Watford in April 2016.\nSamatta became the first Tanzanian to feature in the Premier League, with Tanzania the 117th different nation to be represented in the competition.\nPhillip Billing netted his first Premier League goal for Bournemouth (23 games) and his first for any side in the competition in 33 appearances, since scoring for Huddersfield v Southampton in December 2018.\nSamatta is the first player to score on his league debut for Aston Villa since Rudy Gestede netted in August 2015, also against Bournemouth.\nAston Villa captain Jack Grealish has been fouled 111 times in the Premier League this season, the only player to hit triple-figures in the competition in 2019-20.\n'The sending off changed the game' - what they said\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"The red card changed everything, we felt a little bit bit hard done by on that decision - Jeff [Jefferson Lerma] was incredibly unlucky as there were other challenges in the game that didn't get punished with a yellow card which were worse than that.\n\"At a time when we were in a good place in the game, looking to go 3-0 up, suddenly the game swings on that moment and I didn't think it was justified. With that feeling, with the way the game had gone and the run of form we'd been on, it was hugely important we got over the line and won that game. We don't know whether it will define our season, but it feels like a big moment now.\"\nOn Ryan Fraser (the winger apologised to team-mates this week for letting his performances be affected by links with Arsenal last summer): \"I asked pre-game that they [the supporters] support him and back him, as he's an incredible talent, and he's a great lad.\n\"He wants to play well for the team and the club - they were brilliant with him today and he was very good in return, in terms of his defensive performance - especially with 10 men he was excellent and he showed how important he is for us. \"\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith speaking to Match of the Day: \"We didn't start particularly well, they picked up too many second balls and ended up with territorial advantage in the first half.\n\"I wasn't happy with the first half and how we played but the second half, after they had a man set off, was better, although we did not do enough with possession.\n\"They have had a man sent off and after that we have dominated possession but have not done enough to create clear-cut chances to get ourselves back and deserved to lose in the end.\"\nOn Lerma's sending-off: \"The red card was soft, there were a few decisions out there that left a lot of people scratching their heads.\"\nOn their reaction after winning through to the Carabao Cup final: \"They weren't thinking about the cup semi-final today, the focus was on Bournemouth. It is a tough place to come - a small stadium, fans can be on top of you and we didn't work as hard as we should.\"\nWhat's next?\nThe start of the inaugural winter break in the Premier League means that while Bournemouth travel to Bramall Lane to face Sheffield United on Sunday 9 February (14:00 GMT), Aston Villa do not play until the following week at home to Tottenham on Sunday 16 February (14:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Watford 2-3 Everton: Theo Walcott scores injury-time winner for visitors\nTheo Walcott struck an injury-time winner as 10-man Everton came back from two goals down to stun Watford in a topsy-turvy encounter at Vicarage Road.\nCarlo Ancelotti's players raced to their jubilant supporters after Walcott applied the finishing touch to a counter-attack as Watford pressed for the winner.\nAfter Adam Masina drove the home side ahead and Roberto Pereyra coolly added a second, Everton looked fully out of sorts, before two goals arrived in first-half added time from central defender Yerry Mina.\nFabian Delph's dismissal for two yellow cards in 13 second-half minutes looked set to temper the away side's comeback, only for Walcott to nudge home in the 90th minute and move the Toffees to ninth in the table, their highest position since September.\nA win would have lifted the hosts out of the Premier League relegation zone but instead they are 19th with 23 points.\n\"It hurts. Disappointing is an understatement\", reflected Watford boss Nigel Pearson.\nRelive Everton's comeback win\nEverton joy from vulnerable positions\nWalcott declared himself \"shattered\" in the immediate aftermath but stressed his side have \"ambitions to go up higher\" in the table.\nThe striker's first goal of the season helped Everton break their run of being winless in 35 outings when they have conceded the opening goal.\nThe Merseyside club had lost their last 25 away games in a row when two or more goals behind.\nSo the fact they found a way to win this fixture points to a steeliness that seems to have arrived since Ancelotti took charge.\nThe Toffees have now lost just once in seven league games - against champions Manchester City - under the Italian.\n\"This is football, it's unpredictable,\" said Ancelotti, who had seen his side throw away a 2-0 lead in injury time to draw 2-2 with Newcastle in their previous league outing.\nEverton were abject for 45 minutes as Watford eased ahead - Delph squandering possession for Pereyra to double the advantage.\nBut Mina's goals in the 46th and 49th minutes of the opening period transformed the contest. The Colombian finished from six inches out before heading in the leveller.\nThe visitors carried momentum into the second period without creating anything clear cut, but when Delph saw red for missed tackles on Pereyra and Etienne Capoue, Everton again looked hugely vulnerable.\nBut they limited the Hornets and when former Watford player Richarlison raced away to slip in Moise Kean, his miss-hit finish fell fortunately for Walcott to seal a win that had looked so unlikely earlier in the afternoon.\nWatford tune out at key moments (again)\nAncelotti said his side \"didn't deserve to equalise\" before half-time and the stunned faces of some Watford fans at the final whistle pointed to an outcome few had seen coming.\nPearson was quick to highlight the way his side failed to \"manage\" the closing minutes of the first half and the result may sting a little more given they surrendered the lead and conceded an injury-time winner in their previous league outing at Aston Villa.\nHad they held on to a point in each of the fixtures they would now sit above the bottom three on goal difference.\nBut while this will hurt, there is plenty to offer encouragement in their fight against the drop. For 45 minutes they appeared well organised and forced Everton's attacking players to feed off scraps or attempt crosses from deep positions.\nAt the other end, Gerard Deulofeu showed class and craft in teeing up Masina for the opener, while Pereyra's lofted finish over Pickford was of the kind of quality needed if they are to move up the table.\nCapoue was destructive in the middle of the pitch - winning more tackles than anyone in a Watford shirt - and also offers obvious grit for the challenges to come.\nHowever, Watford failed to protect their lead before half-time and also struggled for ideas when trying to press home their one-man advantage for the closing 19 minutes.\nThey failed to force any opening and, when they did risk throwing numbers forward, paid a painful price as Walcott delivered the first home defeat of the Pearson era.\nMan of the Match - Yerry Mina\n'We have to recover' - manager reaction\nWatford boss Nigel Pearson: \"This is certainly a lesson for us. It hurts for sure but we will continue to work through it. It's not the end of the world but it's certainly frustrating and annoying.\n\"We have to recover. Confidence is something that you can build when you get some momentum. Likewise when it goes the other way you have to show some resolve and manage the game better. Game management has let us down today.\"\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti: \"We were looking to go home with a draw because we had 10 men but we did a fantastic counter-attack.\n\"Honestly, we didn't deserve to equalise in the first half but I think with what happened last week and this week we deserved to win.\n\"I think it was the wrong decision by the referee with the red card. I think we were lucky to score at the end. We have to stay focused, improve and be confident because this squad has good quality.\"\nEverton need a clean sheet - key stats\nWatford have failed to win a Premier League game at Vicarage Road after being two goals ahead for the first time, previously winning 23 and drawing twice.\nEverton are without a clean sheet in their past 12 Premier League away games, their longest run without a shutout on the road since October 2003 (13 games).\nFabian Delph is the 25th player to receive a red card for more than three different sides in the Premier League (Aston Villa, Manchester City and Everton).\nYerry Mina is the first defender to score two goals in a Premier League game for Everton since Leighton Baines v West Ham in September 2013.\nWatford's Gerard Deulofeu has been directly involved in five goals in his past seven Premier League appearances (two goals, three assists), as many as his previous 22 in the competition.\nUp next?\nEverton host Crystal Palace in the lunchtime kick-off next Saturday, 8 February while Watford travel to Brighton in the evening kick-off on the same day."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 4-0 Southampton: Reds equal winning record at Anfield\nLiverpool opened up the biggest lead by any team at the end of a day in English top-flight history with an emphatic victory over Southampton - but manager Jurgen Klopp says his side are \"not even close to being perfect\".\nThe Reds extended their advantage in the Premier League to 22 points over second-placed Manchester City, who face Tottenham on Sunday, with a 4-0 win against Southampton at Anfield.\nThey have also equalled City's record of 20 consecutive Premier League wins at home and only Bill Shankly's Liverpool team in 1972 had a longer winning streak on home soil in English top-flight history.\n\"We're not even close to being perfect. We just look to use our skills in the best possible way. The boys have done that for a while pretty good and that's why we have these numbers,\" said Klopp.\n\"We didn't want a 22-point lead. We wanted 73 points at the end of today.\"\nFour second-half goals gave Liverpool a victory that extends their unbeaten run in the league to 42 games and means they have picked up 100 points from the last 102 available.\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the opener against Southampton just after half time - his second goal in as many league matches - when he drilled the ball low into the bottom corner.\nReds' skipper Jordan Henderson made it 2-0 on the hour mark with a calm finish after being set up by Roberto Firmino.\nHenderson then played in Mohamed Salah for Liverpool's third and the Egypt forward added a fourth from close range in the last minute.\nThe scoreline was harsh on the visitors, who matched Liverpool for much of the first hour with Danny Ings going close in the first half and Shane Long also denied by home keeper Alisson.\nIt was Southampton's first away defeat in five games and they fall to 11th place.\nTitle gets closer, unbeaten run rolls on\nLiverpool's wait for a first league title in 30 years will surely end this season. They have one hand on the trophy and seven wins from their remaining 13 games will guarantee success.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in 42 games across two seasons, have conceded just one league goal in their last 10 matches and have 73 points from 25 games - a top-flight record.\nBefore Saturday, only City had won more consecutive games at home in the Premier League, between March 2011 and March 2012.\nWith only 13 matches left, it is increasingly surely only a question of whether Liverpool can remain unbeaten for the whole season rather than if they end their drought.\nNevertheless, their performance in the first half against Southampton was nervous and suggested the visitors could have a chance to inflict a first defeat on Klopp's side.\nSloppy passes, mistakes at the back and a lack of intensity going forward meant the Saints had opportunities to score and were barely stretched at the back.\nSouthampton, spearheaded by top-scorer Ings in attack, finished the half as the better team, going close through the former Reds striker as well as Long and Moussa Djenepo.\nBut Liverpool, no doubt invigorated by a half-time talk from Klopp, were quick out of the blocks in the second half and as soon as they scored the victory that most will have expected before the match felt inevitable.\nThe scorer of that opener, Oxlade-Chamberlain, is starting to regain the form he demonstrated prior to picking up a serious knee injury while Henderson was magnificent again in controlling the midfield. They were solid at the back, with Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk's centre-back partnership continuing to flourish.\nThe Reds were without the injured Sadio Mane, but Firmino and Salah delivered the goods; the Brazil striker produced a hat-trick of assists to take his total to 51 in all competitions for the club, while Salah scored twice.\nSaints deliver on Hasenhuttl's wish\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said before the game he wanted his side to \"show how far we have come, how competitive we are\".\nThey certainly did that, especially in the first half.\nIngs, who left Liverpool to join the Saints for \u00a320m in July, had scored 14 goals in 19 starts heading into the match and he was a threat throughout.\nHis close-range effort in the first half looked like it was heading in before it clipped the heel of team-mate Long and bounced away from goal.\nThe striker, who was praised for his tireless work ethic by Klopp, threatened early in the second half when he bundled into the box before being stopped by a challenge from Fabinho.\nThere were appeals for a penalty but it was reviewed by VAR, who must have decided it was the eager Ings' effort to evade Fabinho that sent him to the ground rather contact from Liverpool's midfielder - although Hasenhuttl believed it was a foul.\nTo rub salt into Saints' wound, immediately after the incident Liverpool went up the other end and scored the opener.\nIngs continued to cause problems though, earning a corner off a deflected shot after taking on Andy Robertson and Van Dijk as well as linking up with James Ward-Prowse, who fired just wide of the right post.\nHe was substituted in the 70th minute, alongside strike partner Long, and was given a standing ovation by the fans of his former club.\nIngs' form has been one of the reasons for Southampton's surge away from the relegation zone and if he continues to be such a threat, Saints look good for a top-half finish in the table.\nThey had 10 shots in the first half against Liverpool, the most the Reds have faced in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League match at Anfield since Chelsea in November 2014.\nKlopp mirrors Shankly - best of the stats\nOnly once in English top-flight history has a team had a longer winning streak on home soil - Liverpool themselves between January and December 1972 under Bill Shankly.\nLiverpool have earned 100 points from the last 102 available to them in the Premier League, winning 33 of their last 34 matches in the competition while only failing to win away at Manchester United in October 2019.\nSouthampton have lost each of their last six Premier League meetings with Liverpool, losing their last three visits to Anfield in the competition by a 10-0 aggregate score.\nThis result was Southampton's heaviest margin of defeat in an away league game since November 2018 when they lost 1-6 at Manchester City.\nSalah has scored more home goals in this season's Premier League (12) than any other player; indeed, since he joined Liverpool in 2017, only Lionel Messi (51) has more home goals in Europe's big-five leagues than the Egyptian (44).\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson (Liverpool)\n'When we are rolling, it's difficult to stop' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"The readiness to improve in the game and learn from the game [is what we had to do to win]. The set-up of Southampton I could not give more credit to. What a strange result in the end. It's deserved because we score the goals, but what a team.\n\"They had too many shots on target and we had to change in the second half. That helped massively and when we are rolling it's difficult to stop.\n\"Even when it was 4-0 Southampton did not stop and I have so much respect for that.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"Maybe the result is a little high but I would like to watch this game if we had gone a goal up. The best team in the world, for 50 minutes had no real chances and we had a massive one.\n\"It must be brave at that moment to say goal, so it's no penalty here at Anfield. The way we played was unbelievably good and I am proud and stand by our plan. It is a clear penalty but in such moments the game can turn in our direction. But in the end it was a deserved win for Liverpool. We played the best we can so I am very proud.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool's first-team players will be given the night off on Tuesday for the FA Cup fourth-round replay against Shrewsbury, while their next Premier League match is against Norwich City on Saturday, 15 February (17:30 GMT).\nSouthampton travel to Tottenham on Wednesday for their FA Cup replay, before hosting Burnley in the Premier League on 15 February (12:30 GMT)."

We offered a threat, as did they. The performance was good but it's tarnished by a couple of mistakes.\n\"We gave them a leg-up for 3-1 with the own goal, and we gave them a massive leg-up with 20 minutes to go.\"\n\"Their effort was huge.

We had to suffer a bit.\n\"Mistakes don't just happen on their own. Something has to force them to happen.

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-1 Sheffield United: Vicente Guaita own goal gifts Blades three points\nSheffield United moved up to fifth in the Premier League as Vicente Guaita's remarkable own goal gifted the Blades all three points at Crystal Palace.\nSpanish goalkeeper Guaita mishandled Oliver Norwood's corner and dropped the ball into his own net just before the hour mark.\nChris Wilder's visitors had created little up to that stage, but held on to their advantage for a hard-fought victory.\nThe hosts dominated possession but rarely tested United goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who did well to palm James McArthur's powerful effort to safety not long after the opener.\nJames Tomkins was inches away from connecting with McArthur's in-swinging delivery as Palace pushed for an equaliser, but John Fleck and Enda Stevens could have doubled United's lead on the counter-attack.\nReferee Andy Madley showed Palace right-back Joel Ward a red card late on for a foul on Stevens, but downgraded the punishment to a yellow card after consulting his pitchside monitor.\nThe result lifts Sheffield United above Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers, who played out a goalless draw in Saturday's late game.\nBlades grind out win\nWhen Wilder's team edged Palace at Bramall Lane in August for their first Premier League win in 12 years, few would have expected the Blades to be nestled comfortably in the top half of the table more than five months later.\nUnited have been notoriously difficult to beat on their travels this season and frustrated Palace throughout, producing a performance full of grit and determination to limit the hosts to just three efforts on target.\nThere was an element of fortune about the winner as Guaita inexplicably misjudged Norwood's cross, but Wilder's team refused to rest on their one-goal lead and could have won by a more comfortable margin.\nGuaita had to intervene to stop Norwood's free-kick nestling in the back of the net before saving substitute Lys Mousset's goal-bound effort.\nDefender John Egan fired wide from a good position following a goal-mouth scramble, while Stevens shot into the side-netting from a tight angle as the Blades threatened to catch Palace out on the counter.\nWilder's side have lost just two of their 13 league games away from Bramall Lane this season, winning four and drawing seven.\nNo way through for toothless Palace\nPalace, by manager Roy Hodgson's own admission, were \"a long way\" below their usual standards in defeat to Southampton in their last league match, failing to register a shot on target throughout the 90 minutes.\nThe Eagles boss was boosted by the return from injury of first-team regulars Christian Benteke and Patrick van Aanholt, while captain Luka Milivojevic was available again following suspension. For all Palace's possession, though, Henderson's only save of the first half was a straightforward one from McArthur's tame effort.\nThe hosts felt United should have been reduced to 10 men shortly after the half-hour mark when George Baldock, already on a yellow card, appeared to catch Wilfried Zaha with a late challenge, but the Blades defender escaped further punishment.\nPalace carried more of a goal threat in the second half, Benteke testing Henderson with a low shot before McArthur's powerful effort was punched clear by the Manchester United loanee.\nTomkins failed to get an all-important touch on McArthur's teasing delivery but the visitors held on comfortably in the end - despite Ward's red card being reduced to a yellow on the advice of the video assistant referee.\nThe result extends Palace's winless league run to six matches and leaves them in 13th place, six points above the relegation zone.\nMan of the Match - John Egan (Sheffield United)\nBlades unbeaten in the capital this term - the stats\nSheffield United enjoyed their first win in their last 20 Premier League games in London (D8 L11), although the Blades remain unbeaten in the capital in top-flight games this season (W1 D4).\nCrystal Palace fielded their oldest-ever starting XI in the Premier League (average age 30 years 94 days) and the second oldest by any side in the top-flight this season after Watford (30y 210d v Sheffield United in October 2019).\nOnly league leaders Liverpool (15) have conceded fewer goals in the Premier League this season than Sheffield United (23).\nCrystal Palace have failed to score a first-half goal in a divisional-high 20 of their 25 Premier League games this season. Fifteen of those games have been goalless at the break, more than any other side's fixtures in 2019-20.\nVicente Guaita is the 13th different player to score an own goal for Crystal Palace in the Premier League and the third goalkeeper to do so (Rhys Wilmot in 1995 and Wayne Hennessey in 2016).\nCrystal Palace winger Andros Townsend made his 200th Premier League appearance, with 125 of them coming for the Eagles (50 for Tottenham, 13 for Newcastle, 12 for QPR).\n'The referee hasn't done us any favours' - what the managers said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to Sky Sports: \"The goal was unfortunate because Guaita's done so well for us this season. He's made fantastic saves to keep us in games and get us three points at times.\n\"It's disappointing that he's going to bear the brunt of the criticism. Everyone who watches the game tonight will say it was the goalkeeper's fault. I'm sad for him because he doesn't deserve that.\"\nOn referee Andy Madley: \"We thought George Baldock should have been red carded, but I don't want to pick the referee's decisions here and there. If we'd been given a red card and they'd been able to play on with 11 men after Baldock's challenge, I'd be perfectly entitled to stand here and say the referee hasn't done us any favours.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder: \"It's a huge result today. We were up against some really good players but the team kept their discipline and shape.\n\"We were lucky with the goal, but I thought we were good value for the win. We're delighted to add another three points to the number we have already.\n\"Palace have a habit of feeling their way into the game and coming on strongly in the second half, but they started very well. I felt we stuck in the game and managed to get a very valuable three points.\"\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Everton in the Premier League on Saturday 8 February (kick-off 12:30 GMT), while Sheffield United host Bournemouth the following day (14:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 0-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers\nBruno Fernandes was unable to inspire Manchester United to victory on his debut as the \u00a347m new arrival had to settle for a goalless draw against Wolves at Old Trafford.\nIn a game of few chances, Fernandes did force a couple of routine saves from fellow countryman Rui Patricio, who also almost dropped another into his own net as he inexplicably fumbled his fellow Portuguese's tame shot round the post.\nThe nearest United came to scoring was in the final minute of stoppage time when substitute Diogo Dalot headed Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross narrowly wide, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men have now taken just four points from five games.\nWolves worked hard but, despite introducing their debutant, Daniel Podence, near the end, also lacked a killer touch in front of goal.\nNuno Espirito Santo's men have now won once in six games since their memorable comeback triumph against Manchester City on 27 December and, with 13 games of the campaign remaining, are, like United, six points off a Champions League place and behind Sheffield United.\nThe issues facing Man Utd in winter break\nA solid debut for Fernandes\nWhile it could not be described as an explosive debut, Fernandes did enough to indicate he will improve United as an offensive threat.\nThe former Sporting Lisbon man was eager to get on the ball, took the initiative at set-pieces and was not afraid to shoot.\nHis first effort drifted wide as he shot from the angle. His second, from a central position, turned out to be the hosts' only first-half shot on target, which went straight at Patricio.\nAlmost more noticeable was the ugly stuff. A hoofed clearance from the edge of United's six-yard box brought chants of 'Bruno, Bruno' from the Stretford End behind him.\nThen a thunderous challenge on fellow countryman Joao Moutinho eventually brought a cursory check to see if the Wolves midfielder was OK as he lay on the ground receiving treatment.\nAnother free-kick and the routine shot Patricio almost made a mess of were Fernandes' second-half highlights, although he will not be able to raise the whole underperforming team on his own.\nFamiliar foes\nThis was the third meeting between these sides in the space of 29 days and their sixth encounter in less than a year.\nAs the previous five had resulted in a couple of 2-1 victories for Wolves, a 1-0 triumph for United and two draws, it was perhaps no surprise the latest encounter should be equally tight.\nThe visitors did have chances, with Raul Jimenez forcing an excellent second-half save from United keeper David de Gea and Romain Saiss heading over when he was well placed to do much better 11 minutes from time.\nPodence had a shot on the turn blocked near the end, although Wolves' marathon season appears to have caught up with them and they, more than most, will be thankful for the two-week break that lies ahead.\nMunich remembered\nSixty-two years ago on Thursday, United suffered the biggest tragedy in their history when eight players were among the 23 passengers who died when the team plane crashed in Munich following a refuelling stop on the way back from a European Cup tie in Belgrade.\nTwo hours before kick-off on Saturday, fans from both sides gathered for the annual ceremony under the Munich memorial outside the stadium.\nJust before the teams emerged from the tunnel, United's Munich anthem, Flowers of Manchester, was played and as the teams emerged a massive banner proclaiming \"We'll Never Die\" was dragged across the Stretford End. After 58 minutes, applause rang round the ground in honour of the victims.\nSir Bobby Charlton was the only survivor of the crash present at the game, although Jimmy Murphy, son of manager Sir Matt Busby's assistant Jimmy, was also at Old Trafford.\nNo protest\nThere had been calls for a walkout by United fans after 68 minutes.\nAs it turned out, a handful of supporters left at the allotted time but it was hardly noticeable amid a capacity crowd.\nFar more conspicuous was the absence of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.\nWolves fans sang \"There's only one Ed Woodward\" at one point, although there was no repeat of the singing from United fans which has attracted such controversy in recent games.\n'I am happy'\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"I think it was a good game, an intense game. I think first half was good. There was a second-half spell United dominated and created a lot of problems.\n\"We had our moments. I am happy. The boys worked very hard and it was tough.\n\"I think in the first half our idea was clear to control the middle of the pitch and we had a lot of counter attacks. It was good but it was a balanced game.\"\nMan of the match - Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Man Utd)\nWhat next?\nWolves' next game is against Leicester at Molineux on Friday, 14 February (20:00 GMT). United travel to Chelsea on Monday, 17 February (20:00).\nGoal-shy United - the stats\nManchester United have failed to score in three consecutive league games for the first time since October 2016.\nUnited failed to score in back-to-back home league games for the first time since March 2014.\nWolves are without a win in their past 12 away games against United in all competitions (D3 L9), and have not led for a single minute in any of those games since a 1-0 win in February 1980.\nWolves are the first team to keep a Premier League clean sheet away against both Manchester clubs in a season since Chelsea in 2013-14.\nThis was Wolves' first 0-0 draw in the Premier League since the opening weekend against Leicester, while it was just their third in total in 63 Premier League games under Nuno Espirito Santo.\nBruno Fernandes had more shots (5), more shots on target (3) and made more passes (88) than any other United player .\nEight Portuguese players featured, making Portugal only the third nation outside the UK to have at least eight players appear in a Premier League match, after France and Spain."

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-0 Arsenal: Clarets miss chance to punish Gunners\nBurnley wasted the chance to punish Arsenal, who escaped from Turf Moor with a point from a goalless draw.\nThe Clarets at least ended a run that had seen them beaten in their previous 11 games against the Gunners, but the home side should have had more.\nAfter riding some early pressure from the visitors, Burnley gradually asserted themselves to bombard the Arsenal goal with headed efforts.\nJeff Hendrick and James Tarkowski were most culpable of missing with headers, both failing to hit the target from close range, while Jay Rodriguez volleyed against the underside of the bar when he should have scored.\nArsenal extend their unbeaten run to seven games in all competitions, as well as being unbeaten in seven successive Premier League away games.\nIn truth, though, they were uninspired for long periods of this game, failing to gain a boost from the return of captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after a three-match ban.\nIt was Aubameyang who had their best chances, miscuing when put through by David Luiz and later heading wide.\nThe draw sees both teams make marginal gains up the table, Arsenal to 10th and Burnley 11th, both on 31 points.\nReaction and analysis from Turf Moor\nBurnley rue missed chances\nBurnley entered this game on the back of league victories over Leicester and Manchester United, and will wonder how they did not make it three in a row.\nIn the opening stages, they looked in danger of being overwhelmed, but gradually outfought a Gunners side who were rarely without a player complaining, limping, or rolling around on the floor.\nBurnley's initial efforts were from reasonable range - Hendrick, Rodriguez and Dwight McNeil all firing shots away - but it was from balls into the box either side of half-time where the hosts really should have taken the lead.\nThe Clarets swarmed all over the yellow shirts in the period after the break and it seemed unlikely they would get a better chance than when Hendrick missed the target with a header from six yards.\nThey did. From similar range, Rodriguez's side-foot volley came down from the underside of the bar and bounced away off the goalline, replays clearly showing the ball had not crossed.\nAubameyang return fails to inspire Gunners\nAubameyang served a three-game ban after being sent off against Crystal Palace, returning to meet a Clarets side against whom he had scored seven in his past four matches.\nHe was involved in the Gunners' bright start, crossing for Alexandre Lacazette, who failed to hit the target with a header, then shooting horribly wide when set free by Luiz's long ball.\nBut as Aubameyang was controlled by Burnley right-back Matt Lowton, Arsenal's attacking threat diminished to almost nothing, their front four dithering over the few scraps they were fed in the period of Burnley dominance.\nAubameyang's header wide of the near post was their only chance of any note in a second half where it was all they could do to hang on.\nIn 25 league games this season, the Gunners have won only six and this was their 13th draw. Few of the other 12 will have come in such fortunate circumstances.\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski\n'We did enough to edge it'\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche told Match of the Day 2: \"You don't want to get too greedy, it's a good run of performances and results. I thought we did enough to edge it, we had a couple of golden chances and kept them to meagre ones.\n\"We're not a side that's going to create so many, it's about the quality of chances. We asked enough to score a goal.\n\"We were on a tough run and the last three games have shown we can be at least competitive.\"\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta, also to MOTD2: \"In periods of the game, I liked it, but in other periods I did not. We started to give free-kicks, throw-ins, corners away and in that they are better than us.\n\"I learned a lot about the resilience we showed in defence and also that we need to improve the quality of our play, be calmer and improve the end product.\n\"In the offensive part of our game, we have to do better for longer periods.\"\nArteta later added: \"The conditions were difficult - the grass was this long and they didn't put any water on it, and that's not a very helpful thing to play football.\n\"I didn't water the pitch yesterday at the training ground because I expected it, but that doesn't make it any easier to play.\n\"They do what they do really well, and you are allowed to do it so we have to react to that. In some moments it wasn't the grass - it was their quality and what they do really well, and we could not do it in the right way.\"\nBurnley's Gunners hoodoo ends - the stats\nBurnley remain winless in 12 Premier League matches against Arsenal (D2 L10), though they avoided defeat against the Gunners for the first time since December 2009.\nArsenal are unbeaten in all competitions during 2020 (P7 W3 D4 L0) since losing 2-1 to Chelsea in their final game of 2019.\nBurnley's last two Premier League draws at Turf Moor have come on 2 February, drawing 1-1 with Southampton in 2019 and goalless today against Arsenal.\nArsenal have won just six of their 25 Premier League games this season (D13 L6), their lowest tally after 25 league games in a season since 1912/13 (one win).\nNo Premier League goalkeeper has more clean sheets than Burnley's Nick Pope this season (9, level with Alisson and Dean Henderson).\nArsenal are the first team in Premier League history to draw as many as 13 of their first 25 league matches in a season, and the first in the top flight since Manchester United in the 1980/81 campaign.\nArsenal have drawn four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since February 2009 (five in a row).\nThis was only Arsenal's second goalless draw in their last 84 Premier League games, also drawing 0-0 in December 2019 against Everton.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides embark on their winter breaks, after which Burnley travel to Southampton on Saturday, 15 February (12:30 GMT), with Arsenal hosting Newcastle a day later (16:30)."

We still have an eye on fourth. It was a match where you know the quality of the opponent. You want to win, but you can lose. I'm delighted with the boys.\n\"Only [VAR] Kevin Friend can explain why it was not a red card [for Raheem Sterling]. He has the chance to watch again. That decision would change the game. It would probably not be such an enjoyable game, one team with one player more for an hour is a big advantage. I think it's a clear red card.\"\nOn Steven Bergwijn's goal: \"It's the best way to come to a club. We were not putting pressure on him. We signed him early in the week, so we had time for him to train and speak. He's very intelligent, humble. At home against the champions, to score a goal, not a normal goal, couldn't be better for him.\"\nOn beating Pep Guardiola: \"It's a pleasure to get three points in a match where we knew it would be very difficult. I have better feelings for Pep than you can imagine. We worked together for three years.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports: \"We played well but lost the game. It happened again. They had two shots and scored two goals.\n\"I don't have too many things to say about the performance. We have to accept it and analyse it. It is not easy. We did really well, honestly.\n\"With this performance, how should I be critical? This performance would be an incredible mistake to say how bad they are. We created chances and conceded few.\n\"A few times this season it has happened. The sending off was a key point. We said at half-time be careful, yellow cards are a fast and quick action.\"\nAnother City player sees red - the stats\nSpurs picked up their first Premier League win against Manchester City since October 2016, which was also a 2-0 victory on home soil (at White Hart Lane).\nManchester City have now lost six games in the Premier League this season, their joint-most in a single campaign under manager Pep Guardiola (six in 2016-17).\nSpurs boss Jose Mourinho picked up his sixth win against Guardiola across all competitions - only Jurgen Klopp has defeated him on more occasions (8). However, Mourinho has now won against Guardiola with four different teams (Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Spurs), the most of any manager.\nManchester City have gone consecutive games without scoring for the first time under Guardiola, having last done so back in March 2016 under Manuel Pellegrini (three games without a goal).\nSteven Bergwijn's opener for Spurs saw him become the 250th player to score on his debut in the Premier League, and the 13th Dutchman to do so.\nSince the start of 2016-17, only Jamie Vardy (6) has scored more goals against Guardiola's Manchester City than Spurs' Son Heung-min (5) across all competitions.\nManchester City have failed to score four of the last six penalties they have taken across all competitions, with three different players accounting for these failed spot-kicks (Gabriel Jesus x2, Raheem Sterling and Ilkay Gundogan).\nSpurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has saved three of the last four penalties he has faced in the Premier League - indeed, the Frenchman has now made the joint-most penalty saves for the club in the competition (five - along with Heurelho Gomes).\nOleksandr Zinchenko became the third Manchester City player to be sent off in the Premier League this season - no team have been awarded more red cards than Guardiola's side in 2019-20.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host Southampton in an FA Cup fourth-round replay on Wednesday, 5 February (19:45 GMT), before returning to Premier League action at Aston Villa on Sunday, 16 February (14:00).\nManchester City host West Ham in their next Premier League game on Sunday, 9 February (16:30)."

When Bernard struck with a superb volley it was a lead the hosts fully deserved.\nThe creator of that goal was Walcott, who had been a constant menace down the flank leading up to his assist - but when the forward pulled up with an ankle injury shortly afterwards and had to be substituted, Everton lost their way.\nHowever, with Richarlison in their ranks Everton always have that bit of quality to muster something from nothing, and so it proved as he took on the Palace defence by himself to restore his side's lead.\nIt was an open game from then on but it was the hosts who got the crucial next goal to kill off Palace's hopes of a point.\nEverton's next four matches include trips to Arsenal and Chelsea and home games against Manchester United and Liverpool - so this could prove to be a vital three points for Ancelotti's team.\nShot-shy Palace pay the price again\nScoring goals has been a significant problem for Crystal Palace this season and a disappointing January transfer window saw just the one attacking arrival - Cenk Tosun on loan from Everton.\nHowever, the Turkey forward is sidelined with a hamstring injury, leaving the Eagles short of options up front as they look to stay clear of a relegation battle.\nIn the first half, they were again severely lacking in the final third and reached half-time without having a shot on target - although Patrick van Aanholt was unfortunate when his deflected strike hit the base of the post.\nThere were plenty of signs of encouragement from their second half display, though. They attacked with confidence and pace, with Benteke and Wilfried Zaha combining to regularly open the Everton defence.\nBenteke's goal was his first since April last year and he was unlucky not to score a second when his header was saved.\nPalace fans will hope the Belgian now has renewed confidence to help provide the firepower his side need to pull away from the bottom of the table.\nMan of the match - Richarlison (Everton)\n'The result was all that was good' - manager reaction\nEverton manager Ancelotti said: \"The best thing today is the result as the performance was not good. It was a difficult game with a lot of interruptions, so we were not able to keep the intensity.\n\"The target since I arrived was to get into Europe - now we have a possibility to think about the Europa League.\"\nEverton keeper Pickford on his error that led to Benteke's goal: \"It was disgusting and I hold my hands up for that. I reset and I never let anything affect me.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Hodgson: \"We didn't start as well as we would have liked, but when we equalised it was the result of quite a lot of pressure.\n\"We have a bit less than the team's performance deserved and it's another defeat that we're unhappy about.\"\nPalace striker Benteke on his first goal of the season: \"This was the hardest moment of my career so far in England, so I was happy to score. But we didn't win and we are in a really bad mood.\"\nMerseysiders on top - the stats\nOnly leaders Liverpool (24) have won more Premier League points than Everton's 17 since Ancelotti's first game in charge in December.\nCalvert-Lewin has 11 league goals this season, the most by an English player for Everton in a single campaign since Andrew Johnson in 2006-07 (also 11).\nCalvert-Lewin provided his first Premier League assist of the season, making this the first time he both scored and assisted in the same league game since December 2017 against Huddersfield.\nSeven of Richarlison's nine league goals this season have put Everton ahead in a match. Only Manchester United's Marcus Rashford and Tammy Abraham of Chelsea (eight each) have put their side ahead more often.\nEverton winger Walcott has as many goal involvements in his past two Premier League games (one goal and one assist) as he managed in his previous 20.\nCrystal Palace are without a clean sheet in 10 league matches - the longest current run in the competition.\nWith an average age of 30 years 101 days, this was Palace's oldest starting XI in the Premier League.\nPalace striker Benteke scored his first league goal since April 2019, ending a run of 17 games and 765 minutes without netting in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nEverton are not in action again until Sunday, 23 February when they travel to Arsenal (16:30 GMT kick-off), while Crystal Palace host Newcastle United the previous day (15:00)."

We tried to defend what we had and thought we could weather the storm.\n\"Brighton threw it all at us but if it wasn't for the own goal we would have won.\"\nFor Watford it means they have now not won in five matches in all competitions after they had won four of their previous five Premier League matches before that.\nBrighton are also on a poor run and have not gained a victory in seven attempts in 2020.\nBrighton fight back again but there will still be concerns\nThe Seagulls came back from 2-0 and 3-1 down to gain a 3-3 draw at West Ham a week ago and again rescued a point from a losing position.\nHowever, manager Graham Potter will be furious at the nature of the goal they conceded inside the opening 20 minutes as a sloppy Mooy pass was picked up by Doucoure, who, with the Seagulls players backing off, was able to move at pace to the edge of the box before firing past Mat Ryan.\nIn a game of few chances, the hosts thought they may have had a first-half penalty when Ezequiel Schelotto went to ground under a challenge by Gerard Deulofeu, but, following a check from the video assistant referee, nothing was given.\nBrighton's defence was again guilty of letting a man run at them in the second half but Deulofeu did not make them pay as he dragged a shot wide, before the own goal earned them a point.\nAlthough the Seagulls improved in the second half, these are still worrying times for Brighton, in their third successive season in the top-flight.\nThey were eighth on 2 November, with Potter, who had only become the club's manager last summer, rewarded with a new contract that keeps him at the club until 2025.\nHowever, they have only picked up 12 points in 13 Premier League matches since Potter signed that deal and are only three points clear of the bottom three, having played a game more than the three sides directly below them.\nMan of the match - Etienne Capoue (Watford)\nWatford lose more points from a winning position - the stats\nBrighton have lost just one of their last seven top-flight meetings with Watford (won two, drew four), a 2-0 defeat in the Premier League in August 2018.\nWatford have lost just one of their last eight away league games against Brighton (won three, drew four), a 1-0 defeat in the Premier League in December 2017.\nWatford have dropped 17 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season including eight across their last three games - only West Ham (19) have dropped more points from winning positions in the competition in 2019-20.\nBrighton have failed to win any of their 24 home Premier League games when conceding the first goal (drew 10, lost 14).\nBrighton have won just one of their last 11 Premier League games (drew six, lost four) and remain winless since a 2-0 victory against Bournemouth in December 2019 (played six, drew four, lost two since).\nWatford have picked up five points from their last four Premier League away games (won one, drew two, lost one), as many points as they won in their first nine away league games this season (won one, drew two, lost six).\nSince the start of last season, Watford have conceded six own goals in the Premier League, more than any other side.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure has scored three goals in his last six Premier League games for Watford, as many as in his previous 34 appearances in the competition.\n'I'm proud of the players' - what they said\nBrighton boss Graham Potter speaking to Match of the Day: \"We gave a lot in the game. It was difficult to go behind when we had started quite well and were in the ascendancy.\n\"The crowd got a little nervous and the atmosphere is difficult. I'm proud of the players because we took responsibility of the game. The character they showed, they accepted the challenge because you could go under at that point - it's not easy to be the one that has to find the answers.\n\"Aaron Mooy had a good chance before we scored, it's an own goal but it's a good attack.\n\"We were down on the scoreline, the lads desperately want to get points, get the win. We showed maturity. It's not easy in the Premier League when you are down.\n\"Every point is what it is and we have to take it. We will look to move forward, take a break now and move forward for Sheffield United.\"\nWatford manager Nigel Pearson speaking to Match of the Day: \"We scored a really good goal in the first half but we didn't really play well enough at times. We played a side that is possession-based and Ben Foster has only made one save. They've not really caused us a lot of problems.\n\"We've got belief and I expect us to push on when we come back from the winter break.\n\"Two months in, we're in contact. Teams know they'll have a tough game against us and it's very much in our own hands.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides will now have their mid-season break and a two-week gap before their next matches. Brighton play at Sheffield United on Saturday, 22 February (15:00 GMT), while Watford's next match comes a day later (14:00) when they face Manchester United at Old Trafford."

We're running out of moments, we need points.\"\nHarry Wilson should have hit the target with a diving header early on and Callum Wilson hooked an effort wide, before the latter grabbed his second goal in four matches and eighth of the season.\nWithin a minute, Philip Billing had a chance to double the lead but missed the ball with an attempted volley.\nBut from then on chances were limited, although Nathan Ake hooked an effort just wide in the second half, before Fraser was denied by Henderson with the hosts getting their winner soon after.\nA wild Wilder moment\nThere was a bizarre moment in the second half with the score at 1-1 as Bournemouth midfielder Andrew Surman and Sheffield United boss Wilder started pushing each other, before a number of players from both sides got involved and referee Jon Moss showed yellow cards to Surman and Wilder.\n\"Their player thought I had the ball behind my back [to stop a quick throw-in], but I didn't,\" said Wilder.\n\"I'm still coming to terms with this division, it's a passionate game, I'm a passionate manager and I have no issue with Eddie [Howe].\n\"It calmed down after that but I want to win, Andrew Surman wants to win, they want the result for their team and I do for mine.\n\"I would be disappointed if players did not show their emotions in a game.\"\nMan of the match - Billy Sharp (Sheffield United)\nStarting a Premier League match for only the fourth time this season, Sharp was a constant handful for the Bournemouth defence.\nHis valuable goal just before half-time changed the course of the game and he nearly had another early in the second half. When he was substituted he received a deserved standing ovation from the home fans.\n'All our players have something to prove' - what they said\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a tight game, a tough game. You wouldn't believe we were at the wrong end of the table early in the game. I was disappointed that we weren't able to recover after they equalised.\n\"We had a couple of moments but the second goal was a killer blow.\n\"You are used to these conditions. The pitch played well but we lost momentum as the game went on.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder: \"We were hanging on at times. We grew into the game and I felt a goal was coming. I was delighted to go into the break on level terms.\n\"We try to build momentum and create pressure. They controlled the game early on but our reaction was great. We really went for it in the second half and the belief the boys have is amazing.\n\"I'm sure when we were coming off our fans were singing that we're safe. We're not there yet but there's no let-up from us. There are no comfortable footballers in our changing room - they all have something to prove.\n\"I'm a bit controversial in that I'd want to carry on - I'd like it if we had a game next week. But we'll come back refreshed for the next part of the season.\"\nSuper subs - the stats\nSheffield United have won six of their last seven Premier League games against teams starting the day in the bottom half of the league (D1).\nBournemouth have lost seven of their last eight Premier League away games (W1), losing each of the last four in a row.\nSheffield United have scored six Premier League goals via substitutes this season - more than any other club; two of those have come against Bournemouth (Billy Sharp in August, John Lundstram today).\nBournemouth striker Callum Wilson has now scored in two of his last three Premier League appearances (two goals), having failed to find the net in 15 consecutive appearances prior to this.\nBournemouth's Wilson is one of only seven English players to have scored 40 Premier League goals since August 2015, the month he made his debut in the competition.\nThere were 16 British players in the starting XI for this match, the most in a Premier League game since February 2019 (Burnley vs Southampton, also 16).\nSince August 2016 when Chris Wilder took charge of the club, Sharp has scored 68 league goals for Sheffield United - 39 more than any other player in this time.\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United are scheduled to only play one more match this month and that comes on Saturday, 22 February, again at Bramall Lane, with Brighton the visitors (15:00 GMT). The Blades are then due to have a week off as their scheduled game at Aston Villa will have to be rearranged because Villa face Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final.\nFor Bournemouth, Howe takes on his former side Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, 22 February (15:00) and seven days later the Cherries entertain Chelsea, who they beat 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in December (15:00)."

After the hour mark the Premier League's leading marksman had touched the ball just seven times on his 200th Premier League appearance for the Foxes.\nAnd the 33-year-old's evening did not get any better as he failed to register a single shot, meaning he has now gone six Premier League games without a goal - his longest run without a top-flight goal since he went seven games between December 2016 and February 2017.\nWinter break woes?\nWhile Brendan Rodgers gave his squad seven days off after their 2-2 draw with Chelsea on 1 February and Wolves took their players on a warm-weather training trip to Spain, at times the purpose of those breaks - to recharge - did not look to have worked.\nBoth sets of players appeared to run out of ideas and legs at times on a spongy Molineux surface.\nNine of the 11 Foxes players to start the game had made over 20 Premier League starts this term but, while Brendan Rodger's consistency of selection has helped them to third in the table, they struggled to find their previous spark.\nWolves, who playing their 42nd game of the season, started with eight players who have started 20 Premier League games or more.\nThe Foxes have now taken five points from the last available 15, while Wolves have managed six in the same period.\nMan of the match - Jonny (Wolves)\n'I thought we deserved a point' - what they said\nWolves manager Nuno Espirto Santo to BBC Match of the Day: \"It is not about frustration but realising what we did in the game and now analyse to say 'we could (have won)'.\n\"Leicester had possession in the first half but did not create, we scored in the first half and dominated a very good team. The boys created many chances but it requires more work from us to complete the actions.\n\"Raul Jimenez was there, (it will happen for him) in the next game. The work rate he did was amazing. He did not put it inside the net but his it is amazing how he works and creates for the team. We go again on Thursday and hope things will happen.\n\"I saw a lot of energy from the players and this is what I am happy about, we are ready for the tough cycle.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I thought we deserved a point. They are always a threat on the counter. It was impressive for us to keep a clean sheet with 10 men.\n\"We probably could've been quicker around the attack - the build-up play was good - but away from home you expect to come under pressure and it ends up being a very good point and keeping the gap to 14 points between us.\"\nOn the VAR decisions: \"I think his big toe was offside! It's unfortunate. We're disappointed to give the corner away. We've had a number that have gone for and against and you just have to keep the team calm.\n\"I didn't think it was a red card for us, so it's unfortunate.\"\nFiring blanks - the stats\nWolves have drawn consecutive league games without scoring for the first time since April 2010, when they drew 0-0 against Stoke and Fulham.\nTwo of Leicester's three goalless draws in the Premier League under Brendan Rodgers have come against Wolves.\nSince returning to the Premier League in 2014-15, Leicester have received 19 red cards - the joint-most of any team in that time (level with Everton and Watford).\nOnly Aston Villa (6) have seen their opponents receive more red cards in Premier League games this season than Wolves (5).\nSince joining Leicester, Jamie Vardy has played more league games against Wolves without scoring than any other side (6).\nVardy became only the second Leicester player to make 200 Premier League appearances for the club, after Muzzy Izzet (222). Aged 33 years and 34 days, Vardy is the oldest Englishman to reach 200 appearances in the competition since Alan Stubbs (35y 323d) in August 2007.\nWhat next?\nWolves travel to Norwich next Sunday, 23 February (14:00 GMT), while Leicester host Manchester City on Saturday, 22 February (17:30 GMT) knowing a win will send them above Pep Guardiola's side into second."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-2 Burnley: Matej Vydra goal boosts Clarets' European hopes\nMatej Vydra's superb goal boosted Burnley's hopes of playing in Europe for the second time in three years as they won a weather-affected Premier League game at Southampton.\nThe result lifts the Clarets up to 10th, five points behind Sheffield United in fifth.\nThe visitors had made the perfect start, Ashley Westwood scoring direct from a corner after 93 seconds.\nDanny Ings, who was deceived by the flight of the ball for Westwood's goal, made amends by equalising with a rasping drive into the bottom right corner from 18 yards.\nWith Saints mastering the wet and windy conditions brought on by Storm Dennis better than their opponents, Jack Stephens then headed Sofiane Boufal's delivery against the Burnley crossbar as the hosts pressed for a winner.\nBut Vydra's stunning left-foot effort, into the top-left corner from 18 yards, ensured Burnley claimed their first league double over Southampton since 1947.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nSouthampton v Burnley as it happened\nClarets aim for Europe\nBurnley arrived on the south coast after winning at Old Trafford in their last away game.\nAnd a typically gritty performance, illuminated by Vydra's goal, helped them equal their longest unbeaten run of the run of the season, four matches.\nIt was not always pretty from Burnley, who already had the worst pass-completion rate in the Premier League and who slipped to 61% here, but crucially it was effective.\nFull-backs Charlie Taylor and Phil Bardsley routinely hit the channels while the likes of Jack Cork, Dwight McNeil and Jeff Hendrick remained on the periphery of the action.\nDyche's side last qualified for European competition in 2017-18, with a seventh-place Premier League finish, and may well fancy their chances of emulating that achievement.\nGames against Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham aside, the Clarets have a reasonably promising run-in.\nAnd if Manchester City's ban from European club competitions is upheld, it opens up the possibility of the team finishing fifth playing in the Champions League, with Europa League qualification extending further down the table.\nSaints cause own problems\nIf Burnley were rewarded for their no-nonsense approach to defending, the opposite was true for Southampton.\nWhile Saints went into this contest with seven wins from 12 matches they once again displayed their vulnerability at home.\nRalph Hasenhuttl's side have now lost eight times at St Mary's this season and many of those defeats appear to have been self-inflicted - with orders to play out from the back in challenging conditions continually causing them problems here.\nHasenhuttl had also suggested his team could use the elements in their favour against Burnley but instead saw his side immediately caught out by conditions as the visitors scored their quickest ever away goal in the Premier League.\nUp against the club where he made his name, Ings curiously moved out of the way of Westwood's corner, which - with nobody on the near post and goalkeeper Alex McCarthy out of position - crept over the line.\nIngs did at least redeem himself with his 15th goal of the season, his best return since scoring 21 for the Clarets in the Championship six years ago.\nBut it was not enough to add to the 11 points they have taken at home, which is the worst record in the division.\nMan of the match - Ben Mee (Burnley)\n'We scored a sublime goal' - what they said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was incredibly poor conditions for travelling let alone football. A tough game, really tough. We had to dig in again like we do.\n\"We didn't take a grip of the game [after we scored], they did. We waited for the game to come to us and you can't do that. They were better than us first half. Second half, we calmed the game down. We scored a sublime goal.\n\"Chris Wood has got a hamstring [problem]. We're happy he got off quick and could feel it early. We don't spend massive amounts of money and so that involves a whole squad of players. Matej Vydra keeps himself right and he's delivered.\"\nSouthampton boss Ralph Haseenhuttl speaking to Match of the Day: \"First half was OK. We come back from a stupid goal in the second minute. We played better football than the opponent but it's always difficult to make chances against this team. The second half it is very difficult to keep them in their half.\n\"It was the worst start you can imagine. The reaction was OK. In the end we are not good enough second half. We are not aggressive enough and didn't find the solutions for putting them under pressure.\nOn a penalty not awarded against Ben Mee for possible handball: \"It's boring to discuss this to be honest, there is no clear line. As you want... continue. We could have this discussion every week.\"\nSouthampton's leaky defence - the stats\nBurnley are unbeaten in their past seven Premier League meetings with Southampton (W4 D3).\nSouthampton have won just 11 points at home in the Premier League this season (P13 W3 D2 L8), fewer than any other side.\nBurnley have won back-to-back away Premier League games for the first time since April 2018 (a run of three).\nSouthampton have conceded 30 goals in their 13 home league games this season, the first English top-flight side to concede so many after just 13 home matches from the start of a campaign since Ipswich Town in 1963-64 (31).\nAshley Westwood's opener after 93 seconds was the earliest away goal Burnley have ever scored in the Premier League.\nDanny Ings has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season - the last Southampton player to score more in a season with Saints as a top-flight club was James Beattie in 2002-03 (24).\nAmong English Premier League players, only Marcus Rashford (19) and Raheem Sterling (20) have scored more goals in all club competitions this season than Ings.\nMatej Vydra's winner for Burnley was just his fifth Premier League goal, his first away from home, and first overall since September 2018.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Aston Villa in their next Premier League game on Saturday, 22 February (15:00 GMT). Burnley are next in action in the Premier League on the same day when they welcome Bournemouth to Turf Moor (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Norwich City 0-1 Liverpool: Unstoppable charge towards title continues\nLiverpool's unstoppable charge towards their first top-flight title in 30 years is \"outstanding\", said Jurgen Klopp after his side edged a narrow victory over bottom-of-the-table Norwich.\nSadio Mane came off the bench to score the winner with 12 minutes remaining, expertly taking down skipper Jordan Henderson's raking pass and smashing in at the near post.\nIt means Klopp's men need just five more wins from their remaining 12 games to guarantee their first Premier League title, having dropped just two points all campaign, and lie a mammoth 25 points clear of champions Manchester City.\n\"The gap is so insane, I don't really understand it,\" Klopp told Sky Sports. \"I am not smart enough. I have not had that before. It is outstanding, so difficult.\n\"I go back into the changing room and we chat about the things and then I am like 'Oh, but congratulations. We won the game, another three points.'\"\nChances were at a premium in a blustery first half, but Liverpool ramped up the pressure in the second period - Canaries goalkeeper Tim Krul making a stunning double save to deny Mohamed Salah's low shot and Naby Keita's close-range follow-up.\nHaving been pegged back for a long period, Norwich could have scored on the counter-attack as Alex Tettey's strike from an angle caught Alisson by surprise at his near post but the effort rattled the foot of the upright.\nBut Senegal international Mane - who missed the last two games through a hamstring injury - proved to be the difference having entered the action on the hour mark.\nRelive Liverpool's victory over Norwich\nWhen can Liverpool win the Premier League title?\nNorwich fans remember Justin Fashanu's wonder goal\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nReds just keep on winning\nIt looked for a while that it may be a frustrating day for Liverpool at Carrow Road, misplacing a number of passes in the final third and being restricted to long-range efforts.\nKeita's drive was tipped over the crossbar by Krul, while efforts from Virgil van Dijk and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were comfortable for the Dutch goalkeeper to deal with.\nWhen the marauding Trent Alexander-Arnold dragged a shot wide from the edge of the box after just 13 seconds, a routine win looked to be on the cards, but the Reds had to battle hard once more.\nKlopp added: \"I could tell in all the players' faces that they weren't nervous, they were enjoying it, and if one team was going to score it was going to be us.\n\"We protected against the counter-attack well too. It's really all about these wonderful football players.\"\nTo say Liverpool have dominated the division is an understatement - they have annihilated all in front of them and the numbers make staggering reading:\nLiverpool are now unbeaten in 43 league games, closing in on Arsenal's all-time record of 49.\nThey have collected a remarkable 103 points from the past 105 available.\nThe Reds have picked up 35 wins from their past 36 games - a 1-1 draw at Manchester United in October the only blemish.\nThey have won 17 games in a row - one shy of Manchester City's record - and kept 10 clean sheets in their past 11 games.\nThe result also means 76 points after 26 games is the best record at this juncture in the history of Europe's top five leagues - something even the continent's great sides including La Liga's Barcelona, Juventus of Serie A, Bundesliga's Bayern Munich and Ligue 1's Paris St-Germain were unable to achieve.\nThe defending European champions go into Tuesday's last-16 first-leg tie at Atletico Madrid in flawless form and Klopp's side will take some stopping from reaching their third consecutive final, as they aim for a Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup treble.\nSo near yet so far for Norwich\nDaniel Farke's side remain anchored to the foot of the table, seven points from safety and are staring at an immediate return to the Championship.\nThey display some attractive football at times, playing out from the back which almost proved costly on a couple of occasions, but failing to hold out means they have conceded a joint league-high 48 goals.\nHad they taken their chances, they would have claimed a spectacular victory against all the odds, with Lukas Rupp left ruing what might have been.\nThe German midfielder broke the offside trap in the first half and when faced one-on-one with Alisson, inexplicably decided to square the ball towards Teemu Pukki instead of shooting and the Brazilian goalkeeper managed to claw the pass away.\nThe lively Todd Cantwell struck the side-netting, while Tettey's low, drilled strike hit the upright.\nFarke told BBC Sport: \"Performance-wise we were pretty good in many topics, sadly one topic was missing, to be clinical in our finishing. We had our chance in the first half.\"\nOn Mane's goal, Farke added: \"I just watched it back shortly. When the referee doesn't give a foul it won't be overturned. It was also due to the quality of Mane - his control and then his second touch. It was smart movement from Mane and if the referee doesn't give a foul you can't see it [being] overturned. We have already learned that VAR is not on our side.\n\"Performance-wise we can take a lot of confidence but sadly no points.\"\nTon up for Mane - the stats\nLiverpool have opened the scoring in each of their past 14 Premier League meetings with Norwich City - no side has ever scored the opening goal in more consecutive games versus another in the competition's history (Chelsea also 14 v Portsmouth).\nNorwich have only won one of their past 13 Premier League games (D5 L7) and have failed to score in back-to-back league matches for the first time since November 2019.\nLiverpool have kept a clean sheet in 10 of their past 11 Premier League matches, this after having only kept one shutout in the previous 11 such games before this.\nSadio Mane scored the 100th goal of his English club career in all competitions, scoring 25 for Southampton and 75 for Liverpool.\nMane's goal was his 57th in the Premier League for Liverpool, but the first coming as a substitute.\nJordan Henderson has assisted five Premier League goals this season; only in 2014-15 (nine) and 2013-14 (seven) has he provided more in a single league season in his professional career.\nBoth of Liverpool's past two Premier League games have been goalless at half-time; only two of their first 24 such matches of the season had been 0-0 at the break before this.\nNorwich failed to attempt a single shot in the first half of a league game for the first time under Daniel Farke, and the first time in any league match overall since April 2014 v Manchester United.\nWhat next?\nNorwich travel to Wolves next Sunday in the Premier League (kick-off 14:00 GMT), while Liverpool are in European action on Tuesday, followed by a Premier League game at Anfield against West Ham next Monday (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Dean Smith bemoans 'farcical' VAR\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith says a \"farcical VAR decision\" contributed to Tottenham's last-gasp Premier League win at Villa Park on Sunday.\nSpurs were awarded a penalty by VAR when the score was 1-1, with Son Heung-min scoring the rebound.\nThe South Korean forward later scored a stoppage-time winner, taking Jose Mourinho's side up to fifth in the table, a point behind fourth-placed Chelsea.\nSmith was heavily critical of VAR's intervention. \"I don't get it,\" he said.\n\"There's 42,000 people in the stadium, he [referee Martin Atkinson] gives a goal-kick and everyone believes it's a goal-kick.\n\"It was a farcical VAR decision. The criteria is clear and obvious. It's not clear and obvious. Martin Atkinson stood up but his authority has been taken away.\n\"I told Martin at half-time I didn't blame him, but if he was brave enough to walk over to that monitor it takes 30 seconds, you go, 'No, I'm happy with my decision' and we play on.\n\"Instead we go into an environment where there's no feel for the game or what's happened and we make a decision. It was a sore result for us, it's a tough one to take.\"\nThe result means Villa remain a point above the bottom three in 17th.\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League action\nThey made the stronger start and took the lead via Toby Alderweireld's own goal - with the Spurs defender prodding Anwar El Ghazi's cross past goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.\nThe Belgian atoned by equalising with a superb angled effort that flew into the top right corner of the Villa goal from 10 yards.\nSpurs went in front when Steven Bergwijn won the penalty after being judged to have been fouled by home defender Bjorn Engels.\nWhile Engels headed in from a Jack Grealish corner to again draw the sides level, his late mistake allowed Son to race clear to place the ball past Reina as Villa's miserable run against sides in the top half of the table continued.\nVilla errors cost them again\nWhile Dean Smith's side have earned just one point against sides currently in the top half, a wider concern for the Villa boss is that eight of their 15 defeats this term have been by a solitary goal.\nThis was another occasion on which they could have taken at least a point from a hard-fought contest but for individual errors - with Engels having an afternoon to forget.\nThe 25-year-old Belgian, who started because of Tyrone Mings' absence through illness, had a difficult time dealing with the movement and pace of Bergwijn, Son and Lucas Moura.\nIt was his rash challenge on Bergwijn that allowed the visitors to go in at the interval with the lead in a game Villa had enjoyed the better of until then.\nIn his late lapse, Engels allowed the ball to run under his studs, enabling Son to score the decisive goal. Engels' first goal for the Midlands club will have provided little consolation.\nVilla had enjoyed a bright start as Grealish imposed himself on the game.\nThe Villa captain, who is the last survivor from the club's top-flight relegation in 2016, delivered a wonderful display, which is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by the clubs that are reportedly keen to sign him this summer.\nHe spent the early stages of this encounter tormenting Serge Aurier, flashing a shot wide and laying on a glorious chance from which Douglas Luiz should have converted.\nNow 24, Grealish is maturing into a player capable of controlling games, and is exhibiting the sort of form that may bring him into England manager Gareth Southgate's planning for Euro 2020.\nSpurs, Son and Alli keep plugging away\nWhile Grealish is yet to make a senior England appearance, Spurs midfielder Dele Alli is someone Southgate knows all about - although his last cap came in June 2019.\nSince then, Alli has suffered form and injury problems, but has appeared rejuvenated since Jose Mourinho took charge of Tottenham in November.\nAlthough he did not add to the eight goals he has scored this season, his intelligent running caused Villa problems throughout.\nSon had seven of Tottenham's 23 efforts on goal, with Alli next on five - including some of their best chances.\nKortney Hause's superb block prevented him from equalising at 1-0 down, and Alli stretched as he headed Bergwijn's cross back across goal but wide of the right far post.\nThe 23-year-old then badly miscued a right-foot shot before half-time, slicing it wide, but he continued to pop up in dangerous areas after the break, teeing up Son for an effort that was brilliantly saved by Reina.\nVilla's Spanish keeper made two further outstanding stops to prevent the South Korean from adding to his goal tally.\nLike Alli, Son kept plugging away, and his reaction to Engels' late mistake was the reward for a high-energy performance that included 26 sprints, more than any other player on the pitch.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min (Tottenham)\n'A window opens for many teams' - what they said\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho to BBC Sport: \"I thought we deserved to win but I think they did not deserve to lose. Villa played to win.\"\nOn the Spurs penalty: \"Steven Bergwijn, I don't know if I call him naive or too honest - the referees tell us pre-match, 'Don't ask for anything, don't surround me, don't do the motion of the screen'. The action was there and it was a question of to be or not to be, and clearly it was.\"\nOn Alderweireld's contribution: \"In a funny way I'd say he's scored three goals: the own goal, his goal and then when he loses the duel with Engels. But he scored with a shot of his life.\"\nOn the opportunity to get into the Champions League by finishing fifth after Manchester City's ban: \"Not just for us. A window opens for many teams. What seemed far, now the fifth place is not far. Arsenal, Everton, Sheffield United, Wolves, everyone will feel they have the chance.\"\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith to Sky Sports: \"We have to try and take the positives. The last two games we've scored late winners here, so now we know how it feels on the other foot. We had chances to win the game but we weren't clinical enough.\n\"They have a front four that can hurt anyone, that's why we had to get forward and defend on the front foot. On the whole, I thought we dealt with them really well but we're disappointed with the goals we conceded.\n\"We probably gave away too many chances from counter attacks, which they're good at, but we didn't deserve to lose that. It was a good performance against a team that are fifth in the league but we deserved more than that.\"\nGrealish enjoying stellar season - the stats\nAston Villa are without victory in their last 10 Premier League matches against sides from London (D1 L9), since a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace in January 2016.\nTottenham have lost just one of their last 19 matches against Aston Villa in all competitions (W15 D3), losing in the Premier League in April 2015 (0-1).\nTottenham are unbeaten in their last 23 Premier League away games against promoted sides (W19 D4), since a 0-1 loss at QPR in April 2012.\nSon Heung-min's goal after 93 minutes 34 seconds is Spurs' latest winning goal in the Premier League since August 2009, when Aaron Lennon netted after 94 minutes 24 seconds against Birmingham.\nJack Grealish has had a direct hand in 13 goals in the Premier League this season (7 goals & 6 assists), five more than the next Villa player and more than any other English midfielder.\nThe Aston Villa midfielder has provided more assists in all competitions in 2019-20 than he has in any other season in his career (8).\nSon became the first Asian player in Premier League history to reach 50 goals in the competition (51 in total after his brace). Indeed, he's the sixth Spurs player to reach this milestone after Teddy Sheringham, Robbie Keane, Jermain Defoe, Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen.\nToby Alderweireld became the third Tottenham Hotspur player to score for and against his own side in the same Premier League game, after Gareth Bale vs Liverpool in November 2012 and Chris Armstrong vs Arsenal in March 2000.\nWhat's next?\nAston Villa travel to Southampton in their next Premier League outing on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nTottenham host RB Leipzig in the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday (20:00 GMT) before their next Premier League game at Chelsea on Saturday (12:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 4-0 Newcastle: Gunners beat Magpies to end run of draws\nArsenal picked up just their seventh Premier League victory of the season with a confidence-boosting thrashing of Newcastle at Emirates Stadium.\nThe Gunners have been the division's draw specialists this campaign having been held 13 times and it looked to be going the same way after a goalless first half.\nBut the hosts sprung into action immediately after the restart with Eddie Nketiah's no-look strike from Nicolas Pepe's cutback clipping the top of the crossbar.\nMikel Arteta's side broke the deadlock on 54 minutes through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's well-placed header and Pepe doubled the lead just three minutes later with a neat, first-time finish.\nMesut Ozil poked in a third late on from substitute Alexandre Lacazette's pass and the Frenchman converted a fourth in injury-time.\nNewcastle attempted to play further forward after conceding but were restricted to few opportunities - the dangerous Allan Saint-Maximin coming closest with a curling strike that rattled the post.\nArsenal's win moves them up into the top half of the table in 10th place - six points behind north London rivals Tottenham, who claimed a last-gasp winner over Aston Villa to go fifth.\nArsenal show improvement in style\nArsenal have suffered a wretched season in the top-flight, 16 points and six places worse off than at this stage under Unai Emery last season.\nA poor start this term led to the Spaniard's dismissal and although they had lost just once under replacement Arteta, they had drawn seven games since his appointment in December.\nBefore the game, only the bottom two sides Watford (5) and Norwich (4) had won fewer games than Arsenal and even this victory was not plain sailing. There were plenty of groans from the home supporters when it looked like their side were still shaking off the comforts of their winter break in Dubai as they demonstrated a lack of cohesion in the final third.\nBukayo Saka curled narrowly wide, Pepe had a free-kick tipped over by Martin Dubravka and Shkodran Mustafi saw his hooked shot headed off the line by Joelinton.\nBut Arsenal came out with renewed focus in the second half and scored twice before the hour mark to put the game to bed - Aubameyang powering in a header for his 15th league goal of the campaign from Pepe's hanging cross.\nAnd it was Pepe, the club's \u00a372m record signing, who turned from provider to goalscorer following sublime work by Saka, who nutmegged Valentino Lazaro and provided the perfect cross for him to tuck home.\nAubameyang could have further extended his tally for the season but his cross-come-shot landed on top of the crossbar.\nJust when it looked like the game was coming to a subdued close Arsenal scored twice more for a thumping win - Ozil's effort squirming through Dubravka's hands - following a move that involved 35 passes and all 11 players touching the ball - and Lacazette added gloss to the scoreline.\nSheffield United in sixth-place will now be in their sights, as they aim to avoid finishing outside the top-six for the first time in 25 years, while they also remain in both the FA Cup and Europa League competitions.\nBlunt Magpies\nThe appointment of Steve Bruce as Newcastle boss to replace the popular Rafael Benitez was not universally well-received by supporters but the ex-Manchester United defender has responded to critics with a decent debut campaign.\nThe Tynesiders lie 12th in the table, seven points clear of the drop zone having been just one point outside the relegation place at this stage last term, but this heavy loss was a big setback for the visitors.\nBruce's defensive plan with five-at-the-back did not work on this occasion as they were picked off by Arsenal's front-foot pressure and finishing in key moments.\nBut it is at the other end of the pitch where they really struggle, they have scored just 24 times, with only Crystal Palace less prolific.\nIn Joelinton - the club's record \u00a340m signing from Hoffenheim - they have a striker who has netted just once in the league and is on a run of 22 games and 1,856 minutes without a goal.\nThe Brazilian works hard for the team but he lacks goals and also touches inside the opposition penalty area - just three of his 47 came in the 18-yard box.\nOne chance did fall to him in the first-half when he was unmarked eight yards out, but his flicked effort at the near post drifted off target.\nFull-back Lazaro, a recent loan signing from Inter Milan, impressed, winning the ball back three times and providing an outlet on the flank, while on the other side of the pitch Danny Rose made more passes (42) than any team-mate despite the constant jeers from the home fans for his Tottenham links.\nThe lively Saint-Maximin was unlucky with his effort that struck the woodwork, while Sean Longstaff's deflected volley was pushed away by Bernd Leno.\nMan of the match - Nicolas Pepe (Arsenal)\n'We have to turn draws into wins' - what they said\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta to BBC Sport: \"After the break we started saying we had to start closing the gap on the top teams and turn draws into wins. Today was the first opportunity and we've done it. All good.\n\"I'm so pleased for Laca [Alexandra Lacazette] - the reaction of the players and staff towards him. He fights hard for everyone. He's been unlucky. He will gain confidence from this and knows how everyone appreciates him.\"\nArsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang speaking to Sky Sports: \"We started not at our best but in the second half we put some more energy in and we scored the goals.\n\"We spoke at half-time and the coach told me to stay as a second striker and take my position off Eddie [Nketiah]. They were playing very deep and compact so it was good for us to have me in the middle to give more space out wide.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce speaking to Sky Sports: \"The disappointing thing is the goals we gave away are not like us. They were too easy. For an hour we were where we have been all season. We switched off from that and gave away sloppy goals.\n\"I was delighted with the way we played in the first half. We made the wrong pass or selection when we [attacked]. Second half, we knew they would come with more intensity and we didn't start well.\n\"We've played well enough in the first half - we have to try and keep to those levels but we didn't get anyway near it in the second half. When you get a beating like you have, you have to lick your wounds and get on with it.\"\nMagpies struggles in the capital continue - the stats\nOnly versus Leicester (12) and Stoke (10) are Arsenal on longer current home winning runs in the Premier League than they are against Newcastle, with the Gunners winning each of their last eight against the Magpies.\nNewcastle have now lost 78 Premier League games as an away side in London, the most defeats of all sides in the competition's history in the capital.\nArsenal have kept back-to-back Premier League clean sheets for the first time since April last year, the second of which also came in a victory over Newcastle at the Emirates.\nGunners striker Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang has scored the opening goal of the game on six different occasions in the Premier League this season, the joint-most in the competition alongside Tammy Abraham, Danny Ings, Marcus Rashford and Jamie Vardy.\nOnly 156 seconds separated Arsenal's first two goals against Newcastle, with Nicolas Pepe having a hand in both (one goal, one assist) - one more goal involvement than he managed in his previous seven top-flight appearances (one goal, zero assists).\nBukayo Saka has assisted eight goals in all competitions this season for Arsenal - more than any team-mate in 2019-20. Indeed, he has more assists than any other Premier League teenager this season.\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce has lost more matches in all competitions against Arsenal than he has versus any other side during his managerial career (21).\n26 of Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette's 33 Premier League goals have been scored in home games, including each of his last nine. Of all Arsenal players to have scored at least 15 goals in the competition, Lacazette has scored the highest ratio in home games (79%).\nThere were 35 passes in the build up to Mesut Ozil's goal, with every single player touching the ball for the Gunners - the most number of passes for any goal in the Premier League this season.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal's attentions now turn to the Europa League and Olympiakos, who they face on Thursday (20:00 GMT), before they return to Premier League action next Sunday against Everton (16:30).\nMeanwhile, Newcastle are next in action next Saturday, when they travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League (15:00)."

The goal was ruled out for a push by Cesar Azpilicueta on Brandon Williams, although replays showed United's Fred put a hand on the back of Chelsea's captain.\nChelsea's frustration was complete when Olivier Giroud's 76th-minute header was ruled out because his foot was in an offside position as he moved to meet Mason Mount's free-kick.\nBeing on the right side of the decisions helped Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's organised and diligent United side to complete their first league double over Chelsea since 1987-88.\n'Man Utd right in race for top four - somehow'\nVAR decisions 'soul destroying' for fans - Chelsea boss Lampard\nRelive Manchester United win over Chelsea\nHow you rated the players at Stamford Bridge\nSolskjaer's men grind it out\nThis was not a glittering performance by any means from Manchester United but it can be satisfactorily filed under 'job done'.\nVAR was United's friend in two pivotal moments, with Maguire's goal adding insult to injury as Chelsea felt - with understandable conviction - he should have been given a red card for kicking out at Batshuayi.\nWhere United had the decisive advantage over Chelsea was in front of goal, where they made the most of their rare opportunities with a clinical edge that was notably lacking in their opponents.\nMartial was on the margins for most of the first half but showed his quality with an angled header beyond the grasp of Chelsea keeper Willy Caballero.\nUnited sealed an important win that gives them hope of a top-four finish when Maguire escaped the attentions of Antonio Rudiger to head home.\nNew boy Fernandes will have added to Solskjaer's pleasure with some nice touches, including a free-kick against the post as well as creating Maguire's goal before he was substituted to a loud ovation from the away end in the closing moments.\nIt puts them firmly back in contention for the top four, with only five points separating Everton in ninth place from Chelsea in fourth.\nFootball Daily podcast: A Bridge too VAR for Chelsea and Lampard\nPogba not Solskjaer's property, says Raiola\nSir Bobby Charlton leads tributes to Harry Gregg\nOld failings haunt Chelsea\nChelsea manager Lampard's constant gripe this season has been a lack of cutting edge to accompany some neat approach play and plentiful possession - and so it proved again here.\nAs they continued a slump that has brought only one win in six league games, Chelsea again paid a heavy price for once more failing to make the most of the opportunities that presented themselves.\nWith Tammy Abraham sidelined through injury, responsibility fell on Batshuayi - but the Belgium striker looked short of confidence and drew Stamford Bridge's wrath when he missed two first-half chances.\nThe experienced Giroud looked more threatening when he came on but it was too late for Chelsea, who came up short again.\nThese are difficult times for Lampard as he must find a way to drag Chelsea out of their current form, get his strikers scoring and deal with a dilemma over his goalkeeper - with \u00a371m keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga clearly behind 38-year-old Caballero.\nIt means the stakes are high in the battle for top-four places when Jose Mourinho's Spurs visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday lunchtime.\nMan of the match - Eric Bailly (Manchester United)\nWhat next?\nChelsea host Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday (kick-off 12:30 GMT) while Manchester United travel to Club Bruges in the Europa League on Thursday, followed by a Premier League game against Watford on Sunday (14:00 GMT).\nSolskjaer's away joy against top sides - the stats\nThis is the first time Manchester United have completed a league double over Chelsea without conceding a goal since 1964-65.\nChelsea have lost seven home games in all competitions this season, their most in a single campaign since 1994-95 (also seven).\nChelsea have lost all five of their home league games when conceding the first goal this season; only two other sides have failed to recover a single point at home when conceding first in the Premier League this season (Norwich and West Ham).\nManchester United scored with both of their first two attempts on target in this match and scored two headed goals in a Premier League game for the first time since November 2017 against Newcastle.\nChelsea became the second side to have two goals awarded and then overturned by VAR in a Premier League match this season, following Sheffield United against Brighton in December.\nAnthony Martial has scored four Premier League goals against Chelsea; he hasn't scored more goals against any other side. Those four strikes have come in his last three appearances against the Blues.\nMartial became the first Manchester United player to score in three consecutive Premier League appearances against Chelsea, and the third to score home and away Premier League goals against the Blues in the same season (Wayne Rooney 2011-12 and Eric Cantona 1992-93).\nHarry Maguire scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester United; each of his last four strikes in the competition have been away from home, with his first since January 2019 at Liverpool.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has won all five of his away games as Man Utd manager against Chelsea and Man City in all competitions - more than the Red Devils had won in their previous 19 such games under Alex Ferguson, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho combined.\nOdion Ighalo became the 200th player to make an appearance for Man Utd in the Premier League, and the first Nigerian to do so."

        "article_text": "Man City 2-0 West Ham United: De Bruyne scores as City beat Hammers in first game since Uefa ban\nKevin de Bruyne made one goal and scored another as Manchester City easily saw off West Ham in their first game since being banned from European competition for two years by Uefa.\nFriday's punishment - which City say they will appeal against at the Court of Arbitration for Sport - has cast a shadow over the club's future but brought a defiant reaction from their fans inside the ground.\nThere were frequent anti-Uefa chants in the first half, with the loudest coming just after Rodri had met Kevin de Bruyne's corner at the near post to break the deadlock with a flicked header that Aymeric Laporte may have helped over the line.\nCity's supporters had brought banners too, with some reading 'Uefa cartel' and 'Uefa mafia', and there were also plenty of songs in support of manager Pep Guardiola and the club's owner Sheikh Mansour.\nMan City boss Guardiola will stay '100%' and says 'truth will prevail'\nOn the pitch, the City players certainly did not seem to be lacking any focus and only some poor finishing, notably by Gabriel Jesus, stopped this from being a much more comfortable Premier League victory.\nWest Ham offered little in response, managing only six touches in the opposition area, and failing to register a single shot at goal until Michail Antonio blasted over with 15 minutes left.\nThe Hammers remain in the relegation zone, a point adrift of safety after a run of six league games without a win and with a trip to Anfield looming on Monday as their next test.\nAt the other end of the table, Guardiola's side are now four points clear of third-placed Leicester but even this win leaves them a distant second to leaders Liverpool, who are 22 points clear with 12 games remaining,\nOff the pitch, City are clearly up for the fight but they will have to be the same on it, with three competitions still up for grabs even though the defence of their Premier League title is all but over.\n'Business as usual for City'\nThe message from the club since Friday's bombshell has been that it is 'business as usual' while they fight their ban, a mantra that chief executive Ferran Soriano repeated when he broke his silence about the allegations earlier on Wednesday.\nCity's desire for internal stability to calm the external hysteria surrounding Uefa's decision and the possible ramifications of any additional punishment by the Premier League, was helped by Pep Guardiola's suggestion over the weekend, relayed to the media via friends, that he will stay.\nBut it would be understandable if Uefa's sanction, plus the widespread criticism of the club that has followed and the continued speculation of what it all means for the future of Guardiola and his squad, had affected the focus and feelings of City's players.\nIf it has distracted them, then they did not show it here. Aided by the industrious David Silva and the steady presence of Rodri - whose 178 completed passes was a Premier League record since detailed data collection began in 2003-04, De Bruyne pulled the strings in midfield, and also made his 17th league assist and scored his eighth league goal of what has been a stellar individual season with a rasping shot from a tight angle.\nCity are still in the Champions League this season, of course, and this was a welcome chance to find some rhythm before they face Real Madrid at the Bernabeu next Wednesday.\nFrom that perspective, it was a big boost for Guardiola that Laporte, his best defender, came through his 65 minutes on the pitch unscathed, as any plan to shut Real out will surely rely heavily on him.\nHammers go down in meek surrender\nCity's issues are well documented but West Ham have their own problems and their own apocalypse scenario - otherwise known as relegation - remains a realistic fate.\nWhile the Hammers did not collapse at the back in the manner they did when they threw away victory against Brighton in their last outing, there were few positives here to cheer their band of travelling fans.\nFar fewer made the trip north than would have done for the original fixture on 9 February, which was postponed because of Storm Ciara.\nThose that did saw David Moyes' side deliver a performance that ended as meek surrender, having appeared from the start to be merely an exercise in damage limitation.\nThere were few moments when the visitors posed any sort of threat, and their lack of attacking intent was summed up by their meagre total of three efforts at goal, none of which were on target.\nThe longer West Ham remain in the bottom three, the more pressure will build on Moyes and his men, so it must be a real worry that they head to Anfield next.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City)\n'If they don't sack me I will be here' - what they said\nMan City boss Pep Guardiola on Match of the Day: \"We are professionals on the pitch, what happens off it we cannot do much.\n\"We talked about what we have to do until the end of the season, especially for the people who love this club. We will play our game the best as possible. We have a lot of interesting things to play for.\"\nWill he stay regardless of the outcome of the appeal? \"If they don't sack me I will be here. I love this club. I like to be here. This is my club and I will be here, no matter.\n\"We appeal. When someone believes they are right they have to fight. The club has to fight and I trust the club 100% what they have done and they have explained to me.\n\"This situation is not finished and we will wait. But until it is resolved you have to play and play, and that is what is going to happen.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes on Match of the Day: \"Probably not as close as we'd like but I felt the players did a great job in trying to be organised and disciplined. We did it well for long periods but they move the ball so well.\n\"Overall I would have liked to have seen us play much better with the ball and especially on the counter attack.

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-1 Tottenham: Giroud and Alonso score as Blues tighten grip on fourth\nChelsea struck a significant blow in the fight for the top four places in the Premier League with a fully deserved victory over Tottenham at Stamford Bridge.\nIn a confrontation billed as a battle between Frank Lampard and his old mentor Jose Mourinho, Spurs could have leapfrogged Chelsea with victory but were outplayed and are now adrift by four points.\nLampard made four changes from the team that lost 2-0 at home to Manchester United on Monday and they paid rich dividends as they all made a contribution to only their second win in seven league games.\nOlivier Giroud, in for Michy Batshuayi with Tammy Abraham on the bench after injury, fired low past Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris for Chelsea's opener in the 15th minute after the recalled Ross Barkley hit the post.\nAnd all four of those brought into the team linked up for Chelsea's second three minutes after the break as Giroud's flick found Mason Mount, who played in Barkley. He produced a perfectly weighted pass to Marcos Alonso, who did not even break stride before a sweet finish past Lloris.\nSpurs' day could have been even worse as Giovani lo Celso should have been sent off for a dreadful second-half challenge on Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta. The video assistant referee decided against punishment, although officials in Stockley Park later admitted a mistake had been made and he should have been sent off.\nMourinho's side gave themselves late hope when Erik Lamela's shot deflected in off Antonio Rudiger but in reality Spurs deserved nothing and Chelsea were worthy winners.\n'Exuberant Lampard lifts the pressure with bold win'\nLo Celso 'leg breaker' a red card - Lampard\nLampard rolls the dice and wins\nLampard knew he had to act after the loss at home to Manchester United continued an indifferent run of form, and he responded with a changed team.\nIt was a brave move to make four changes in a game with the stakes so high but Giroud fully deserved his place ahead of the struggling Batshuayi. The 33-year-old France striker is still a wily operator and deserved the standing ovation he received when he was substituted late on.\nAlonso also got on the scoresheet, and the key for Chelsea was they actually scored while dominating the game and possession, a knack that has eluded them on so many occasions this season.\nLampard celebrated jubilantly at the final whistle, completing a double over Spurs and Mourinho this season, and he can now plot the future with Chelsea remaining in control of their own destiny in pursuit of a place in next season's Champions League.\nSpurs look so flat\nWhat a difference six days have made to Spurs and Mourinho.\nSpirits were soaring last Sunday after Son Heung-min's last-minute winner gave them a 3-2 win at Aston Villa that left them only a point behind Chelsea.\nSince then, Son has been ruled out - possibly for the rest of the season - with a broken arm and Spurs are now struggling to survive in the Champions League last 16 after losing at home to RB Leipzig in the first leg.\nAnd here, for the most part, they were flat and uninspired, looking like a team struggling to come to terms with Son's absence having already lost captain Harry Kane with a long-term hamstring injury.\nMourinho must somehow galvanise a Spurs team that looks a bit sorry for itself. A defeatist attitude and body language is a very bad sign with still so much to play for.\nIt was a joyless, lifeless display, with the additional shambles of VAR clearing Lo Celso for a challenge on Azpilicueta that looked the clearest of red-card offences - only for those examining the incident to later admit a mistake had been made.\nSpurs have been dealt serious injury blows - but they must do much better than this.\nMan of the match - Olivier Giroud (Chelsea)\n'It is another huge question mark over VAR' - what they said\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard on Lo Celso's challenge: \"Everybody knew they had made a mistake. We have the monitor and can view it and we were just waiting for the red card, not with any pleasure because it was a tackle that endangered the player.\n\"It is just not good enough. No more to say. To see it afterwards and saying they made a mistake is not good enough. They had a couple of minutes to look at it and got it wrong.\n\"It is another huge question mark over VAR. Referees have such a difficult job and VAR was brought in to help them, make the game better and that is just so wrong today. It's another huge question mark.\n\"This one didn't need a monitor. It is a clear human decision - straight to Stockley Park, red card, game goes on but that one was wrong.\"\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho to MOTD: \"I think you are going to be very bored with me, because I think I'm going to be very repetitive. I'm going to say exactly the same words I said against Leipzig.\n\"I'm very proud of the players - they gave absolutely everything. We don't have a striker. Our attacking players are not strikers and are in huge levels of fatigue, so very, very difficult for us. No tactical problems, [we were] completely in control of the space, punished by a couple of individual mistakes.\n\"A defeat is a defeat, but the good thing is, in the last seconds the players were still fighting for a result and that for me is a very important thing.\n\"In the last part of the game when Chelsea was scared of the 2-1 we didn't have that presence, that power, we didn't have that to do more than what we did.\"\nAlonso top scoring defender - the stats\nFrank Lampard's Chelsea are the first team to defeat a side managed by Jose Mourinho both home and away in a single league season.\nChelsea have won three consecutive home games against Spurs in all competitions for the first time since a run of seven between October 1996 and March 2002.\nTottenham have won just one of their past 34 away games against Chelsea in all competitions (D11 L22), a 3-1 win in April 2018.\nChelsea have won more points in Premier League London derby matches than any other team, with the Blues taking 461 points.\nTottenham have conceded two or more goals in 10 Premier League away games this season - their highest such tally in a single campaign since 2008-09 (11).\nSince he joined Chelsea in 2016, Marcos Alonso has more goals (17) and goal involvements (28 - 17 goals, 11 assists) than any other defender in the Premier League, with three of these goals coming against Spurs.\nNo Premier League side has scored more own goals this season than Chelsea (3 - level with Watford).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Bayern Munich at Stamford Bridge in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT), before facing Bournemouth away in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nTottenham are back in Premier League action against Wolves at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next Sunday (14:00 GMT)."

We got beaten and deservedly so.\n\"Our quality just wasn't there. Some of them have played their way out of a cup final.\"\nSouthampton 2-0 Aston Villa - as it happened\nSaints enjoy some home comforts\nSouthampton won 3-1 in the reverse fixture just before Christmas, a victory that sparked a run of 13 points from a possible 15 to steer them clear of the bottom three.\nBut they have continued to lose at home, with last week's 2-1 defeat by Burnley their eighth home reverse of the season.\nManager Ralph Hasenhuttl has spoken about the pressure of playing at St Mary's, challenging his players to turn it back into a fortress, and they started like a side with the Austrian's words still ringing in their ears.\nRecalled winger Moussa Djenepo was a constant threat on the left, despite having his head bandaged midway through the first half, and Will Smallbone also impressed after coming in for his Premier League debut - a day after turning 20.\nThe midfielder almost had a goal inside eight minutes, his deflected strike hitting the outside of the post as the hosts pinned Villa into their own half in the opening stages.\nDjenepo then got to the byeline down the left wing and his awkward-looking centre with the outside of his right foot found Long, who bundled in his third goal in six games at the near post.\nDanny Ings and Djenepo were denied by Villa goalkeeper Pepe Reina but Saints remained on top after the break, with captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg forcing a low save from the veteran Spaniard and substitute Che Adams denied by a goal-line block.\nAnd with Reina having come up for a late corner, Armstrong raced on to Adams' long ball to sidefoot into an empty net and make the scoreline a better reflection of Saints' dominance.\nVilla fear worst for cup final\nThe two sides were level on points when they last met in December, with Villa outside the relegation zone on goal difference and Southampton inside it. How manager Dean Smith must wish his side could string together a run like the south coast side went on subsequently.\nSince losing to Saints, Villa have won three league games and each was followed by defeat in their next league game.\nThey were perhaps unlucky to concede a last-gasp winner at home to Tottenham last week and on Saturday would have hoped to see players fighting for EFL Cup final places.\nThey also had Tyrone Mings return after missing the Spurs defeat with tonsillitis - but the England defender had to repel Southampton almost single-handedly early on.\nCaptain Jack Grealish was well shackled by Southampton's James Ward-Prowse, playing at right-back, and new signing Mbwana Samatta received precious little service throughout.\nTrezeguet, a first-half substitute for the injured Anwar El Ghazi, was their biggest threat, providing some energy down the right wing and their only shot on target midway through the second half.\nBut they failed to build on the momentum he provided and needed a goal-line block by Kortney Hause to prevent Southampton sealing victory sooner than they did.\nSo instead of gaining a morale boost before next week's final, Villa fans are fearing a repeat of last month's 6-1 drubbing by City - followed by the growing prospect of an immediate return to the Championship.\nMan of the match - Moussa Djenepo (Southampton)\n'It was the lowest of the low' - what they said\nVilla boss Dean Smith: \"I try to defend the players but today was not good enough. We got what we deserved.\n\"We spoke about having a good start but in the first 20 minutes we never laid a glove on them. They were miles off it in the first half.\n\"Last week against Tottenham gave me a lot of heart then today, dreadful. We can't play that bad again.\n\"It has to be the lowest of the low. The defeat at Watford (3-0 in December) was bad but this was on a par.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"It was very important to show a reaction after the last home game and the way we started was what we wanted to do today.\n\"We had 28 shots and that shows how dominant we have been. It was a fantastic atmosphere and the guys enjoyed it. It's important to have a fortress here again.\"\nVilla's travel sickness - the stats\nAston Villa are winless in eight matches against Southampton in all competitions (D3 L5) since winning 3-2 at St Mary's in December 2013.\nVilla have won just two of their past 32 Premier League away games (D5 L25).\nVilla remain the only Premier League side without an away clean sheet this season, with their last shut-out on the road coming in January 2016 (0-0 v West Brom)\nSouthampton faced just four shots - their joint-lowest tally in a Premier League match since the start of last season (also four v Wolves in October 2019).\nSouthampton have kept two clean sheets in their past four home Premier League games - as many as in their previous 28 matches at St Mary's in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton visit West Ham next Saturday (15:00 GMT) while Villa face Manchester City in the EFL Cup final at Wembley next Sunday (16:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 3-0 Bournemouth: Eddie Howe feels 'very harshly treated' after VAR controversy\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe says his Cherries side were \"very harshly treated\" after losing to Burnley in a game that had a pivotal video assistant referee decision at its centre.\nWith the home side ahead through Matej Vydra's second goal in two games, Bournemouth broke the length of the field for Callum Wilson to set up namesake Harry for what they thought was an equaliser.\nBut VAR judged that Adam Smith had used his upper arm to control and clear a Burnley cross in his own area right at the start of the move - meaning the goal was disallowed and the home side were awarded a penalty at the other end.\nJay Rodriguez scored the resulting spot-kick to give the Clarets a two-goal lead, before Dwight McNeil found the net from distance to seal victory late on.\n\"I haven't seen that yet in the Premier League,\" Howe said. \"Psychologically, we thought it was 1-1 but then we were 2-0 down moments later.\n\"I don't think we dealt with the emotions of that very well. The players are human beings and I have to understand how they felt in that moment. I think we were psychologically spent.\"\nThe Cherries had further causes for grievance, not least of all an earlier goal ruled out by VAR.\nWith the game at 0-0, Joshua King struck from a corner but saw the goal disallowed after a video check because of a handball by Philip Billing.\n\"For me, it's a clear goal,\" said Howe. \"I think it's come off Phil's shoulder, and without that I don't think VAR get involved in [Wilson's] goal.\n\"I've always been clear on VAR. I like the offside decisions as it's black and white, right and wrong. But I've always maintained the referee should make the final decision on the pitch.\"\nThe defeat is another costly one for Howe's side, who remain 16th in the table, two points above the bottom three but having left the door open for the two teams below to overtake them.\n\"There is a big job ahead,\" added the Cherries manager. \"We create our own destiny - not VAR, the referees or the studio. There were things we could have done better today, but my support is with the team. I thought we were very harshly treated.\"\nBurnley are now up to eighth - a position that could result in a Europa League spot should Manchester City's ban from Champions League football be upheld.\nClarets continue upward trajectory\nBurnley's recent turnaround in form has been stunning.\nSix weeks ago, they were well beaten at Chelsea, conceding three unanswered goals and dropping to their lowest point of the campaign in terms of form and league position.\nBut as Dyche and his side have repeatedly shown, they are most dangerous with their backs to the wall and a point to prove.\nA haul of 13 points from the past available 15 has certainly done the trick and now, instead of worrying about the prospect of trips to Reading and Hull next season, they are dreaming again of visits to Istanbul and Athens.\nPutting aside VAR for now, it was in many ways a typical Clarets display - full of running, crammed with commitment, but with that bit of decisive class when it mattered.\nThis class was provided by Vydra, who followed up his scoring appearance off the bench at Southampton with an excellent all-round display.\nHis movement caused the away side no end of trouble as he continually found space for himself to run into or have an effort at goal.\nThree of those efforts failed to find the net - two of them saved by Aaron Ramsdale, the other he put past the far post on the slide.\nBut the finish he did pull off was brilliant - a dinked shot over the Cherries keeper after he had sold the backtracking defenders with an expert dummy to cut inside in the box.\nIt is some comeback for a player who was one of the top flight's forgotten men. A few weeks ago, the Burnley fans weren't batting an eyelid when his manager was unable to find a spot for him on the bench. Here they stood, applauded and chanted his name.\nThe result was already a formality when McNeil struck his superb effort from the edge of the box past Ramsdale.\nVAR kicks Bournemouth when they are down\nIt never rains, it only pours.\nThat must be how Bournemouth feel right now - such can be the reality of life at the bottom of the Premier League.\nThe better side for large chunks of this game, despite the absence of Nathan Ake and Jefferson Lerma, and having twice put the ball past Nick Pope, they somehow left Turf Moor with nothing.\nThey could have been 2-0 up inside the first five minutes but for a superb last-ditch sliding tackle from Phil Bardsley on King and a smart save by the boot of Pope to parry Callum Wilson's effort.\nThe home goalkeeper would also push away a Jack Stacey volley at the back post and a Harry Wilson header - efforts the away side should have scored.\nBut it will be the two VAR decisions that will overshadow all else when they come to reflect, not because of the legitimacy of the two handballs or the accuracy of the technology in the decision-making, but the misfortune it represents.\nBoth of the goals they scored - albeit different in nature - were ruled out for the a similar reason, but the second was far more costly than the first and came with an added sting in the tail.\nSmith's contact with the ball provoked cries of 'handball' from the home supporters, who were then incandescent when the visitors charged the length of the field to score.\nThe away fans' delight and the home support's anger were reversed as VAR stepped in, leaving the Cherries to bemoan not only their luck but also, when the dust settled, their own profligacy.\nThey can protest against the decisions made by the technology if they wish, but they had enough chances to take the fate of the game into their own hands.\nMan of the match - Matej Vydra (Burnley)\nCherries' away-day blues continue - the stats\nBournemouth have lost eight of their past nine away games in the Premier League, failing to score in four of their past five.\nBurnley have won four consecutive Premier League games against an opponent for only the second time, also doing so against Hull City between 2009 and 2015.\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe - a former Burnley boss - has lost six of his 10 matches against the Clarets as a manager (W2 D2 L6), including the past four.\nBurnley have won 37 points from 27 games this season - their highest points tally at this stage of a Premier League campaign.\nJay Rodriguez has scored five league goals against Bournemouth - only against Nottingham Forest (six) has the Burnley forward netted more in his English league career.\nBurnley's Dwight McNeil (20 years, 92 days) is the youngest player to reach 10 Premier League assists since Raheem Sterling (19 years, 335 days) in November 2014. In fact, McNeil has both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time in his career.\nBurnley's Matej Vydra has scored in consecutive league games for the first time since February 2018, with Derby in the Championship.\n'Hopefully it doesn't happen to us again' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a strange kind of game. You saw the momentum change with us in the second half because the wind was that powerful. I know you're going to ask me about some interesting moments, but I felt we had good control after that.\n\"I couldn't see [the Billing handball] from where I was. The players reacted, which isn't always a sign but it can be. It's a tough call. When it leads to a goal and it's an arm, it has to be given.\"\nOn Bournemouth's second disallowed goal: \"It's a penalty for me. His arm comes out into an unnatural position. That one I think was right.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I've seen loads of handballs this year and very rarely has one been given in your own box. They've been very careful in terms of decisions.\n\"At half-time we were OK. We were in a good place. We'd played well and we were looking forward to the second half.\n\"It's a new one for us. Hopefully it doesn't happen to us again.\"\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to St James' Park to face Newcastle on Saturday, 29 February (kick-off 15:00 GMT), while Bournemouth welcome fourth-placed Chelsea to the Vitality Stadium at the same time."

Vicente Guaita was at full stretch to keep out a long-range effort from Joelinton and tipped over a fierce effort from Fabian Schar.\nAnd to round off a thoroughly disappointing day for the visitors, January signing Valentino Lazaro was shown a straight red in stoppage time for hauling down Wilfried Zaha, who was through on goal.\nThe win moves Palace above Newcastle into 13th with 33 points. Newcastle drop down to 14th, with 31 points, seven clear of the drop zone.\nRelive Crystal Palace v Newcastle United plus reaction\nLive: Updates from all of Saturday's Premier League action\nPremier League predictions: This Country stars take on Lawro\nPalace attack thrives against Newcastle\nThanks to Van Aanholt's strike Palace are no longer the team with the fewest goals scored in the league. But having drawn level with Newcastle (also 24) they really should have ended the match well clear.\nThe Eagles managed six shots on target in a one-sided first half - equalling their best in an entire game this season - with Dubravka thwarting them twice with two remarkable saves.\nBoth Ayew and Zaha were allowed plenty of space against a Newcastle side set up with five at the back. Ayew in particular impressed, coming in from the right to produce seven efforts on goal - five of which were on target.\nThe Ghanaian summer signing was inches away from ending his five-game drought when his low strike from 10 yards cannoned off the post before Newcastle's keeper denied him from similar range.\nAs for Benteke, it was one of his better games but his first-half headed miss might play on his mind for a while longer.\nThis was a better attacking display from Palace, but they played a Newcastle side in a generous mood.\nJoelinton fires another blank\nThat is now no goals in three matches for Steve Bruce's side, and the discussions over striker Joelinton's inclusion in the XI will become more heated.\nThe Brazilian, signed for \u00a340m in the summer, has scored only one goal in the league and this week his boss suggested the Brazilian was not a natural goalscorer but a \"team player\".\n, external\nThere is little argument over the 23-year-old's workrate but, like Bruce also said, he needs to be more selfish.\nThe forward did bring the travelling support to their feet with his brilliant first-half strike which was kept out by Guaita, but it is in the penalty area where the fans want him to impose himself.\nThe touchmap above shows he only twice managed to get on the ball in the box, and even then it was near the edge.\nFor how much longer will Bruce persist with him?\nMan of the match - Jordan Ayew (Crystal Palace)\n'Maybe it's time to change' - reaction\nPalace boss Roy Hodgson: \"It was hard to lose three in a row especially when in the last two we were hard done by. We dominated the game but I am disappointed we had to suffer towards the end. When it's 1-0 they are never out of the picture.\n\"It's our first win in 2020. It was vitally important, and had we conceded in the last few minutes it would have been disastrous. That would have knocked us for six.\n\"But it's a win that moves us up the table and away from the relegation zone. We never lost sight that this would be a dogfight and we wanted to stay ahead of the curve on that.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce: \"The better team won. We have had decent possession, but we gave the ball away too cheaply especially when in good areas.\n\"We didn't ask questions, maybe it is a time to change - we have to score to win a game. It was difficult with the conditions, but we have no complaints saying the better team won.\"\nOn Lazaro's red card: \"With 10 seconds to go, does the referee really have to send him off? Is a yellow not sufficient? But rules are rules, and we will abide by it.\n\"He played very well today, we didn't find him enough - in wide areas, we ignored the lad. We needed to get it out to him, but he played very well.\n\"Our biggest problem all season has been evident - we have to create more of a threat in the opponent's area. We have to look at it and analyse it. Maybe change is sometimes for the best.\"\nVan Aanholt: the best attacking defender? - stats\nPalace secured their first win in eight Premier League games, after losing three and drawing four.\nNewcastle have managed just one win in their last nine Premier League games (D3 L5).\nPalace registered their first clean sheet in 11 top-flight games, since a 0-0 draw with Watford in December 2019.\nNewcastle have failed to score in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since January 2016.\nPalace directed nine shots on target, more than in any of their other Premier League games this season (six came in the first half).\nSince returning to the Premier League ahead of the 2014-15 season, Van Aanholt has scored 20 goals in the competition, more than any other defender.\nWhat's next?\nPalace are at Brighton in the Premier League next Saturday (12:30 GMT) while the Magpies are at home to Burnley (15:00)."

We've had bad days, but we've taken the game to the opposition wherever we've been.\n\"This club is in good shape, we're in a good place, and the supporters should really know that and appreciate what's going off in front of their eyes.\"\nEnda Stevens' rasping finish put the Blades in control against Brighton but the lead was short-lived as Neal Maupay marked his return to the starting line-up with a headed equaliser.\nLewis Dunk missed a glorious chance to put the visitors ahead after the Blades lost Stevens to injury.\nJohn Fleck, who signed a new Sheffield United contract\n, external\nuntil 2023 before kick-off, went close from distance but Brighton worked hard to secure a third successive draw.\nForty points but will the Blades make Europe?\nFor Sheffield United, a League One side three years ago, to reach 40 points with more than a quarter of the season remaining is nothing short of remarkable.\nThe Blades have every chance of securing a top-four or top-five finish, which would rank as one of the greatest achievement of the Premier League era - yet they were unable to finish off a Brighton side battling to stay away from the bottom three.\nTheir first game back from the winter break appeared to be going to plan when Stevens, who was playing in League Two with Portsmouth three years ago, produced a sublime finish after Brighton could only half clear Oliver Norwood's cross.\nYet Brighton were level 193 seconds later as United, who lost Stevens to injury, struggled to reach the heights that have seen them dismantle so many teams this season.\nOli McBurnie and Fleck had chances to win it and send the Blades above Tottenham into the fifth spot, which could be enough to earn a place in next season's Champions League now that Manchester City have been banned from Uefa competitions for the next two seasons, pending an appeal.\nBut for now Chris Wilder's side stay sixth - level on points with Spurs.\nWinless run a worry but Brighton show fight\nBrighton remain without a Premier League win in 2020 - a worrying statistic as they try and keep some distance between themselves and the bottom three.\nYet for the third successive game they demonstrated they have the character for a scrap as they came from behind to take a point.\nA return to goalscoring form for French forward Maupay could be critical, especially in view of Brighton's tough run.\nAlthough they are four points above the relegation zone, six of their remaining 11 games are against Wolves (away), Arsenal (home), Leicester (away), Manchester United (home), Liverpool (home) and Manchester City (home).\nMaupay, who started the previous two games on the substitutes bench, was at his sharpest to score after Aaron Mooy's long ball forward had been flicked on - the former Brentford player's eighth league goal of the season and his first in nine top-flight appearances.\nWhile Brighton have forgotten how to win, their last league success was on 28 December 2019, their tenacity to come back from falling behind has not been lost on boss Graham Potter.\n\"We came back from two goals down in our last away match [against West Ham], and came from behind again.\n\"The resilience of the group is fine but we have to show more quality with the ball.\"\nMan of the match - Neal Maupay (Brighton)\nSeagulls make a point - the stats\nBrighton have gained nine points from losing positions in the league this season, their most in a single Premier League campaign, overtaking the eight they recovered in games in which they fell behind last season.\nSheffield United have earned 40 points from their 27 Premier League games this season - the fastest they have reached the target (assuming three points for a win) in a top-flight season since the 1971-72 campaign (22 games).\nBrighton have drawn three consecutive league games within the same season for the first time since November 2015 in the Championship.\nEnda Stevens scored his first Premier League goal at home for Sheffield United and his first overall at Bramall Lane since April 2019.\nNeal Maupay ended a run of 660 minutes of play and 21 shots without scoring for the Seagulls in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United are not in action next weekend as scheduled opponents Aston Villa are in the Carabao Cup final - the Blades next play on 3 March when they visit Championship side Reading in the FA Cup fifth round (20:00 GMT). Brighton host Crystal Palace in the Premier League next Saturday (12:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Leicester 0-1 Man City: Gabriel Jesus' late strike earns win at King Power\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola praised his players for passing \"an incredible test\" as Gabriel Jesus came off the bench to score a late winner at Leicester and cement themselves in second spot.\nJamie Vardy had hit the post for Leicester in the first half, but both sides wasted numerous chances before Jesus slotted home with a cool finish after a surging run from Riyad Mahrez had opened up the home defence.\nThe best of those opportunities saw Foxes keeper Kasper Schmeichel deny Sergio Aguero from the spot on the hour mark as the Blues' penalty problems continued.\nThe defending champions are now seven points clear of the Foxes having won twice since being banned from European football for two years by Uefa.\n\"Don't ask me about the attitude of these guys,\" said Guardiola. \"You still doubt what they have done. These players have won seven titles in the last eight [domestic] competitions.\n\"Today, after missing the penalty, see the reaction we had against an incredibly good team, not just for where they are in the table right now but the way they played in general this season. It was an incredible test for us.\"\nGuardiola's side have now missed five of their seven Premier League spot-kicks this season, but Leicester will argue they should have been given two of their own before the break.\nNothing was given when Kevin de Bruyne had his arms up in the wall and James Maddison's free-kick clearly hit them, and even more mystifying was the decision to give Leicester a corner when Ederson took out Kelechi Iheanacho.\nIheanacho had beaten the Brazilian to Maddison's delightful chipped pass and was floored by the goalkeeper's attempt to punch the ball to safety, but referee Paul Tierney and the video assistant referee both felt Ederson had touched the ball.\nThe next time VAR got involved, it was to award the visitors a penalty - after Dennis Praet charged down Ilkay Gundogan's effort with his arm.\nBut Schmeichel preserved parity when he saved with his legs after Aguero went for power and blasted his spot-kick down the middle, leaving the game in the balance.\nThe Foxes keeper denied Aguero again soon after, but he could do nothing to keep out Jesus' strike which brought a jubilant reaction from the away fans, and the Manchester City players joined them in celebration at the final whistle.\nIt is almost an irrelevance that the Blues have cut Liverpool's lead at the top to 19 points, but they can head for the Bernabeu for their Champions League last-16 tie with Real Madrid on a high after a difficult week.\nReaction from this match and Saturday's other Premier League games\nPremier League predictions: This Country stars take on Lawro\nCity warm up for Real test\nThe strength of Manchester City's team selection was an indication Guardiola was looking to build rhythm rather than rest his players for their crucial clash with Real.\nThe only absentee from his squad who could figure on Wednesday night was Raheem Sterling, who is hoping to recover from a hamstring injury in time to feature against the team he talked about joining this week.\nThis was a decent warm-up for that tie, and an altogether more demanding test than the midweek stroll over a meek West Ham side.\nAymeric Laporte was again used for around an hour as he builds his fitness, and showed his value to the side with quick balls forward as well as calm defending under pressure.\nMahrez, booed by his old fans before the game, was again impressive and his running with the ball showed how important he could be against the Spanish giants if Sterling is not fully fit.\nManchester City were by no means perfect - their sloppy passing in the first half in particular was worrying.\nBut the resolve they found to hold off a spirited Leicester side and find a winner will offer Guardiola much encouragement at the start of a huge week, that ends at Wembley next Sunday when they play Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup final.\nLeicester still look Champions League material\nLeicester have now lost home and away to the two teams above them in the table this season but they again showed why they occupy such a lofty position, and will feel they deserved more from this game.\nThe Foxes may have been forced into an attacking outlook by their lack of available defensive midfielders but boss Brendan Rodgers demonstrated his tactical versatility by switching to a three-man defence and his side looked comfortable, and dangerous, as they carried out his instructions.\nConceding so late will hurt but at one point Leicester's fans started singing about how they are \"going on a European tour\" after being called out by the away fans, and it still looks like that excursion will be of the Champions League variety even after this defeat.\nTrue, Leicester have now won only two of their seven league games in 2020 but their performance levels have not noticeably dropped and, just as importantly, they still hold a healthy lead over the teams outside the top four.\nIf Manchester City's Uefa ban is upheld then fifth place will see the Foxes return to the top table of European football in 2020-21, but more displays like this from Rodgers' side should see them safely in the Champions League places regardless.\nMan of the match - Gabriel Jesus (Man City)\nSchmeichel eclipses dad Peter with save - the stats\nLeicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel's save from Sergio Aguero's penalty was his fourth Premier League penalty save - one more than his father Peter made in his entire Premier League career.\nManchester City have kept successive clean sheets in the Premier League for only the second time this season (also in October 2019).\nManchester City have won six of their last seven league meetings with Leicester City (L1), as many as their previous 21 such clashes.\nLeicester City have lost three of their last five home league games (W1 D1); they had only lost one of their first 14 such matches under Brendan Rodgers.\nRodgers has lost all three of his Premier League meetings with Manchester City as Leicester manager, as many such defeats as he suffered in eight games against the Citizens in charge of Swansea and Liverpool (W3 D2 L3).\nGabriel Jesus has scored four goals in his five Premier League appearances against Leicester City; only versus Everton (seven) has he scored more in the competition.\nManchester City have failed to score from each of their last four Premier League penalties, with each being missed by a different player (Aguero, Ilkay Gundogan, Jesus, Raheem Sterling).\nManchester City attempted 18 shots in this match, the most Leicester have faced in a single league game at King Power Stadium since Manchester United had 19 in December 2017.\n'VAR interpretation needs sorting' - what they said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We're obviously very disappointed not to get something from the game. We had big opportunities. Of course you have to defend well, too. You're going to get moved about at times, but I thought we did very well.\"\nOn the two handball incidents: \"Manchester City's was a penalty. Kasper makes a fantastic save, but ours is clear too. Everyone bar Kevin's arms are down. I believe this was one of the reasons VAR was introduced.\n\"VAR is fine, it's the interpretation of it. That's what needs sorting out.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Leicester are a top side. It was a good performance. We didn't give up and that's an incredibly good sign for us.\n\"We have missed four penalties in a row, but maybe we will score a penalty when we need it to win something. The keepers are good too, but the next one we are going to score.\"\nOn Champions League opponents Real Madrid: \"The preparation after 12 days off was good. We have played two good games and it's good to prepare for Real Madrid with these good opponents. We are playing the kings of the competition. We will see, we will try to enjoy it and do our game.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to bottom side Norwich on Friday (20:00 GMT) in the Premier League.\nManchester City head for the Bernabeu on Wednesday to face Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League tie (20:00), then go to Wembley on Sunday to play Aston Villa in the final of the Carabao Cup (16:30)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 3-0 Watford: Fernandes scores first goal as Utd go fifth\nBruno Fernandes' first Manchester United goal set his new club on their way to a comfortable home win against relegation-threatened Watford and into fifth in the Premier League.\nFernandes, a \u00a347m January signing from Sporting Lisbon, converted a 42nd-minute penalty after he had been taken out by Watford keeper Ben Foster.\nThe goal ended a 236-minute wait for a United home goal in the Premier League after they had failed to score against Burnley and Wolves.\nAnthony Martial scored an excellent second on Sunday after Watford's Troy Deeney had a goal ruled out by VAR for handball in the build-up. Mason Greenwood, 18, lashed home his 11th of the season 15 minutes from time to complete United's scoring.\nFernandes told the BBC it was a dream to score at Old Trafford. \"This is the day every player wants to have. I feel lucky to score,\" the Portuguese midfielder said.\n\"Everyone knows we want to get into the Champions League places. I am here to help the team conquer this place and keep winning games, it's what I want to do, it's what I need to do.\"\nAfter beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Monday, it was only the third time this season that United had won successive Premier League games.\nWhile Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men have now moved into the top five, Watford remain second from bottom.\n'Bruno, Bruno'\nFernandes' arrival at Old Trafford has provided an injection of enthusiasm on and off the pitch.\nThe United fans sing \"Bruno, Bruno\" in the way they used to chant Wayne Rooney's name. They certainly respond to his directness, and it was from one such burst that Foster brought him down.\nGiven the midfielder's elaborate jump as he ran up to take the kick, he needed to score - and he did, with Foster diving the wrong way.\nMartial also seems to have responded to Fernandes' arrival.\nThe Frenchman's latest goal means he has found the net in three consecutive games for the first time since September 2017.\nThe manner of it was superb - first nudging Christian Kabasele aside, then brilliantly finding space with a neat bit of skill after Foster's initial save had returned the ball to him before keeping his composure to chip into an empty net.\nGreenwood has taken a back seat in recent weeks after all the attention he was afforded in the early part of the season, but he also made his mark by smashing a shot into the roof of Watford's net to end any lingering hopes of a comeback.\nWatford's worry\nWatford's noisy band of supporters cannot have travelled north with much optimism.\nTheir side have still never won at Old Trafford, and have now lost nine in a row since their last draw in 1995.\nThey did have chances. Deeney took too long to try to profit from a ridiculous early mix-up in the home defence, and Luke Shaw snuffed out the chance. Abdoulaye Doucoure also forced a decent save out of David de Gea when the game was still goalless.\nThere was also the obligatory chant against VAR - in front of watching referees' chief Mike Riley - after Deeney's 'equaliser' was ruled out, although the handball decision given against defender Craig Dawson as he met the corner that preceded the goal was automatic under the current regulations.\nAfter an encouraging start under Nigel Pearson, who became their third manager of the season on 6 December, Watford have now collected a single point from their past four games.\nThey still have to play Leicester and Manchester City, who have already beaten them 8-0 this season, in a tricky run-in that begins against Liverpool at Vicarage Road on 29 February.\nHarry Gregg remembered\nPrior to the game, there was an impeccably observed minute's silence for former United keeper Harry Gregg, who died on 16 February, aged 87.\nIn addition to a the silence, a banner was pulled across the Stretford End, proclaiming Gregg's name with a picture of the man who will forever be remembered for pulling survivors out of the wreckage following the Munich air crash in 1958, in which eight of his team-mates were killed.\nSir Bobby Charlton, who watched this game from the directors' box, is the only player from that day still alive.\nMan of the match - Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United)\n'Now we want to kick on' - what they said\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer to BBC Match of the Day: \"A very good win, two good wins and two clean sheets, some goals to celebrate, now we want to kick on.\n\"I thought first half we started by gifting them some good opportunities and gradually we created more and more chances.\n\"Bruno Fernandes is quicker than he looks. I'm very excited by having him in. He has come in, given everyone a boost and wants to conduct a game. There are big games coming up now.\n\"The thing that matters in football is scoring goals and that is what Mason Greenwood does.\"\nNigel Pearson to Match of the Day: \"It was a difficult day. A day in which we started OK.\n\"We had opportunities we did not make the most of and really think we put them in a position where we frustrated them. I think we started the second half OK and we went on to be opened up.\n\"It's frustrating because I know when we are at our best we could have had them. I thought today we were a little disjointed from time to time.\"\nOn Watford's disallowed goal: \"I was unaware until I went to look at the monitor. I think we are all pretty accustomed to the wait to confirm the decision. It's a part of the game now.\"\nGreenwood's teenage dream - the stats\nUnited have won all seven of their Premier League games against Watford at Old Trafford, scoring 17 goals and conceding just two.\nWatford have never won an away league match against United in 13 attempts (D2 L11), losing each of the past nine in a row since avoiding defeat in November 1985 in a 1-1 draw.\nWatford have lost four of their past five games in all competitions (D1). They had only tasted defeat once in Nigel Pearson's first eight matches (W4 D3).\nUnited are only the second Premier League team to be awarded 10+ penalties in consecutive seasons, after Crystal Palace (2017-18 & 2018-19).\nMason Greenwood has scored 11 goals in all competitions this season, more than any other Premier League teenager.\nAnthony Martial has scored in three successive appearances for the first time since September 2017.\nBruno Fernandes is the first United player whose maiden Premier League goal for the club was a penalty.\nFernandes has scored each of the past 13 penalties he has taken in top-flight football (including 12 with Sporting Lisbon) since missing a spot-kick for Udinese in April 2016.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United's next game is on Thursday, when they entertain Club Brugge in the second leg of their Europa League last-32 tie, currently level at 1-1. They then visit Everton next Sunday, 1 March, in the Premier League (14:00 GMT).\nWatford's next game is at home to Premier League leaders Liverpool on Saturday, 29 February (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 3-0 Norwich City: Diogo Jota scoring run continues in convincing win\nDiogo Jota made it five goals in two games as Wolves reignited their chase for a Champions League spot with victory against basement side Norwich.\nThe Portuguese forward was at his lethal best in recording a hat-trick in the 4-0 Europa League victory over Espanyol on Thursday and he took just 19 minutes to add to his tally for the season.\nInitially it seemed Matt Doherty's assist would be ruled out for handball but replays showed that the ball bounced against his stomach. When the chance was presented to Jota he turned in one movement and struck a low shot through the legs of Tim Krul.\nJota's second was also reviewed by VAR. The striker was offside when the ball was initially played into the area but drifted back onside to tap in Romain Saiss' volleyed cross.\nHe came close to a second successive hat-trick as Wolves made it 3-0 soon after the break. His low strike thundered off the post but the loose ball was turned in by Raul Jimenez.\nNorwich's brightest spell came in the opening 10 minutes when Teemu Pukki managed a shot at the near post before Kenny McLean's arrow of a strike from 20 yards was plucked out of the air by Rui Patricio.\nCanaries boss Daniel Farke might be aggrieved that Wolves full-back Jonny was not punished for stepping on the leg of Max Aarons, who was on the ground following a challenge.\nHowever, of more concern was how his side lost their shape so soon after Wolves scored their opener. They remain seven points adrift of safety with only 11 games remaining.\nWolves, on the other hand, are now two points shy of fifth - which could potentially become a Champions League spot - and five behind fourth-place Chelsea.\nReaction from this match and Sunday's Premier League action\nPremier League predictions: This Country stars take on Lawro\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nJota and Jimenez back on song\nNuno Espirito Santo's men had only recorded one win in their past seven league games coming into the match, although there were signs his side might have turned a corner during the impressive win over Espanyol.\nJota was the star that evening, taking his tally to nine in the competition this season. However, in the league he had only managed three before Sunday.\nBut the 23-year-old, who initially joined the club on loan in 2017 when they were in the Championship, seems to have rediscovered his best form - and at the perfect time for Wolves as they push for their best-ever finish in the Premier League.\nNuno will also be hoping Jimenez's first goal in four matches will also send him on a run. The Mexican forward has a great on-field understanding with Jota, and his initial charge from midfield led him to add the third goal.\nIt was a match where Nuno started winger Adama Traore on the bench, perhaps to keep his potent winger fresh for a final push. The Wolves boss will need all his key attackers on form as the club aim for what could be one of their most memorable seasons.\nNorwich crumble again\nIs it too late for Farke to change his tactics as his side fight to stay in the league?\nHis side have won admirers for their attacking intent in matches, but would setting up more defensively, akin to what Steve Bruce has done at Newcastle, reap them more points in the final third of this season? They have the pace and guile on the break with Todd Cantwell and Pukki in attack, supported by the swift full-backs.\nIt was during an early counter-attack that they caused Wolves problems when Pukki's close-range effort produced a good save from Patricio. And with the wind in their sails they pressed Wolves back again as McLean tested the agility of the Portuguese keeper with a firm long-range effort.\nBut then the visitors reminded us all why they have the second worst defence in the league - they allowed both Doherty and Jota to turn for the first goal, then three defenders went AWOL as Jota was left alone to tuck in the second.\nNorwich had keeper Krul to thank for keeping it at 3-0 after he pushed Ruben Neves' strike on to the bar, then saved Doherty's late header with his legs.\nIt is Leicester next for Norwich, followed by Sheffield United - their Premier League fate might be all but decided by the first week of March.\nNo punishment for Jonny\nThere was one contentious moment prior to the Wolves opener when Jonny trod on Max Aarons' leg when the Norwich player was on the ground following a challenge.\nThe right-back looked in pain but Jonny's action was judged as accidental. The replay showed the Spanish full-back was trying to hurdle over his opponent and caught him with his boot.\nThe incident came a day after VAR decided the tackle by Tottenham's Giovani lo Celso's on Chelsea Cesar Azpilicueta did not warrant a red card.\nMan of the match - Diogo Jota (Wolves)\n'You need to be convinced and not scared' - reaction\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo on Jota: \"He is always confident.\n\"We know a player's performance can go up and down. It's the right decisions, the right solutions we try to find to keep sustaining his performance - not only him, but all the team.\n\"Of course, I'm delighted with his goals. It's nothing specific. These things happen. His last touch has been clinical, Thursday and today. Hopefully it continues.\"\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke on needing more from his players: \"You have to give your life with each and every duel and I got the feeling that sometimes we were a bit soft and scared.\n\"We need to be greedy to win the duel, and unbelievably sharp. You need to be convinced and not scared. I think we lacked that and I'm disappointed with that fact.\"\nLucky omen Jota - the stats\nWolves earned their biggest win in the Premier League since January 2019 (3-0 v West Ham), while they have only won by a larger margin once previously in the competition - 4-0 v Blackpool in February 2011.\nNorwich have won just 18 points in the Premier League this season - of the previous 15 instances of a team having 18 or fewer points at this stage, only three have managed to avoid relegation (West Brom in 2004-05, Portsmouth in 2005-06 and Leicester in 2014-15).\nWolves have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the top-flight for the first time since between October and November 1981 (five in a row).\nSince beating Manchester City in September 2019, Norwich have been winless in their last 11 games against teams starting the day in the top half of the Premier League (D5 L6).\nWolves are unbeaten in the 10 Premier League games when Jota has scored, picking up the victory on eight of those occasions (two draws).\nJimenez has scored more Premier League goals than any other player this season without ever netting the first goal in a match (12).\nDoherty has been directly involved in 13 goals in the Premier League since the start of last season (seven goals and six assists), the third-most of any defender in this period behind Trent Alexander-Arnold (25) and Andrew Robertson (18).\nWhat's next?\nNorwich host Leicester on Friday (20:00 GMT) and Wolves are at Espanyol on Thursday (17:55 GMT) for the return leg of their Europa League last-32 tie."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-2 Everton: Aubameyang nets twice as Arsenal beat Everton in thriller\nMikel Arteta's encouraging rebuilding job at Arsenal continued with a thrilling victory over a resolute Everton, a result that could have a big say in the race for European football next season.\nThe Spaniard had Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang largely to thank for the outcome after the striker scored twice, including the winner - taking his personal goals tally to 19 for the season and an impressive 60 in 95 games for the Gunners.\nThe see-saw game could not have got off to a worse start for Arteta's side, though, as their shambolic defending allowed Dominic Calvert-Lewin to overhead kick Everton into the lead following a Gylfi Sigurdsson free-kick after just 49 seconds.\nBut the Gunners slowly wrestled control of the game away from the visitors, with Eddie Nketiah side-footing a volley home to draw them level from early substitute Bukayo Saka's superb left-wing cross, before Aubameyang slotted them into the lead.\nTheir progress was again checked when Richarlison capitalised on yet more defensive frailty to poke Everton level just before half-time, but Aubameyang headed the home side back ahead 26 seconds after the break.\nEverton had chances to get at least a point, but Calvert-Lewin saw a cross agonisingly elude his slide before firing straight at Leno from close range.\nThe win means Arsenal remain unbeaten in 2020 and gives them back-to-back league victories for the first time since the opening two matches of the campaign.\nShould Manchester City's Champions League ban be upheld, eighth place in the Premier League could be enough to qualify for the Europa League, and the top five could be good enough for Europe's premier club competition. The Gunners are now just two points off Wolves in eighth and four points behind fifth-placed Manchester United.\nEverton, who have European aspirations of their own following a run of five games unbeaten prior to this, are 11th but still in the mix, a point worse off than the Gunners.\nReaction to Arsenal v Everton and the rest of Sunday's Premier League games\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nArteta slowly making his mark\nArteta was in the stands at Goodison Park for the reverse fixture in December, when interim head coach Freddie Ljungberg led the Gunners to a 0-0 draw against a Duncan Ferguson-managed Toffees.\nBut this is now very much the Spaniard's side, and while he is in credit from his 12 games so far, there is still clear work to be done.\nHaving played in Athens in the Europa League on Thursday with a side that included five of the 11 that started against Everton, the Gunners had significantly less recovery and preparation time than the Toffees, who last played on 8 February.\nArsenal's quick turnaround can be no excuse for their shambolic start to this contest and their lacklustre defending, though.\nTheir back four was all at sea in the first minute when Sigurdsson's free-kick was floated in and they failed to react to prevent Calvert-Lewin's finish. It probably wasn't wise of Shkodran Mustafi to dye his hair light grey, thus making himself all the more conspicuous, while David Luiz responded by berating all those in red around him.\nThey were equally culpable in added time at the end of the first half, missing crucial headers before Mina and then Richarlison got the crucial touches.\nHowever, as Arteta has been at pains to point out in the early weeks of his tenure, the Gunners are a work in progress and one that will not necessarily improve at lightning pace.\nBut the obvious negatives were outweighed by the positives he can take from the game - not least the continued impressive displays of some of his young players and the ongoing potency of Aubameyang.\nIt was somewhat surprising to see 18-year-old wing-back Saka initially left out, but an injury to Sead Kolasinac meant he was unleashed early on, and he quickly made his presence felt with a wicked curling cross for the opener.\nThe scorer of that goal, Nketiah, has had a circuitous route to the Arsenal first team this season, via a frustrating loan spell at Leeds, but he is now showing why he has been likened to Ian Wright, and his finish was one that the Gunners' leading all-time goalscorer would have been proud of.\nWhat more can be said about Aubameyang? He was Arsenal's brightest light during recent difficult times and is now thriving as the team strives to lift itself to his standards.\nEverton leave with plenty to be upbeat about\nCarlo Ancelotti spoke before the game about the need for his side to make \"a statement\" at the start of a run of fixtures against the old-school 'big four' that will ruthlessly vet their suitability for a European spot next season.\nFollowing just their second defeat in 12 league games, their next three matches are against Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, with Tottenham to come in April.\nEven the Italian couldn't have wished for his side to act on his demands so quickly as Calvert-Lewin did when his athleticism came to the fore with a finish after Sigurdsson's free-kick had looped up off the back off Luiz.\nAncelotti will also have been delighted at the resolve and positivity they demonstrated to restore parity at 2-2, and also in striving for another leveller during the second half, albeit this time in vain.\nThey had more than enough chances to leave London with a point, not least when Calvert-Lewin found himself in space just a few yards out. But he was somehow unable to beat Leno. He also glanced a header from a corner just wide in the closing stages.\nEverton are used to getting worked over by Arsenal - they are winless in 24 visits to the Gunners and have conceded a Premier League-high 110 goals against them. But they will rarely leave with as much optimism following a defeat as after this.\nOn an afternoon when there were plenty of positives for Everton to reflect on, perhaps the most important was the return to action of midfielder Andre Gomes, just four months after suffering a fractured dislocation to his ankle.\nThe midfielder played the final 30 minutes and showed what the Toffees had been missing with his ability to pick a pass, a skill he demonstrated with one superb ball to release Richarlison for another shot that Leno saved.\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal)\nA Premier League first for early goals - match stats\nArsenal have registered consecutive Premier League wins for the first time since winning their opening two games of the season against Newcastle and Burnley.\nEverton are winless in 24 away Premier League games against Arsenal (D4 L20), only enduring a longer away winless top-flight run between 1946 and 2001 against Leeds United.\nArsenal have scored 110 Premier League goals against Everton - eight more than any other side has scored against an opponent in Premier League history.\nThis was the first Premier League match to see a goal scored in the opening minute of each half since 2001, when Leeds scored in the 1st and 46th minutes away at Charlton Athletic.\nArsenal conceded in the opening minute of a home Premier League game for only the second time - they also did so in 2007 against Fulham, when David Healy scored after 51 seconds.\nEddie Nketiah's goal, assisted by Bukayo Saka, was the first time two players aged under 21 have combined for a Premier League goal for Arsenal since 2008, when Denilson assisted Nicklas Bendtner against Bolton.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has scored seven goals in nine Premier League appearances under Carlo Ancelotti, having netted seven in his previous 31 games before the Italian took charge.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal are back in Europa League action on Thursday, hosting Olympiakos in the second leg of their last-32 tie. They then play Portsmouth in the FA Cup fifth round on Monday 2 March before returning to league action at home to West Ham on Saturday 7 March.\nEverton's next game is at home against Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday 1 March."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-2 West Ham: Mane scores winner as Reds forced to come from behind\nLiverpool survived a rare night of struggle in this stellar season to overcome West Ham United and close to within four wins of the Premier League title as keeper Lukasz Fabianski suffered an Anfield nightmare.\nVictory means Liverpool equal the English top-flight record of 18 successive wins, set by Manchester City from August to December 2017, with Jurgen Klopp's side last dropping points in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United in October.\nThe Hammers - whose fans staged protests against the club's owners throughout - threatened to inflict Liverpool's first league defeat this term when they led midway through the second half.\nLiverpool took an early lead when Fabianski failed to deal with a routine Georginio Wijnaldum header but David Moyes' side showed great character to hit back through Issa Diop's header, which should also have been kept out by Alisson.\nAnd when substitute Pablo Fornals swept West Ham into the lead nine minutes after the break Liverpool were faced with a fight to preserve their unbeaten 27-match league run.\nIt had been a poor display by their sky-high standards but their luck was in as Fabianski was the culprit again, inexplicably allowing Mohamed Salah's shot to squirm through his legs in the 68th minute.\nThere was a sense of inevitability as Liverpool went for victory and so it proved as Sadio Mane turned in with nine minutes left after Trent Alexander-Arnold lofted the ball over Fabianski.\nIt was cruel on West Ham and Moyes, with Liverpool keeper Alisson having to produce a crucial late block from substitute Jarrod Bowen.\nLiverpool have restored their 22-point lead at the top and the Hammers are left in the bottom three.\nFootball Daily podcast: West Ham come close to bursting Liverpool's 'invincible' bubble\nWhen and where can Liverpool win the title?\nKlopp thought matching winning record was impossible\nRelive Liverpool's victory over West Ham\nLiverpool find a way again\nLiverpool have produced months of thrilling football but this inevitable title triumph has also been about winning with narrow margins when just short of their best.\nThe champions-elect were a long way short of that here and the decisive moment in this match was when Fabianski, who has been a reliable figure for West Ham, compounded his error for Wijnaldum's goal with a horror moment as Salah's shot slipped through his legs and into the net in front of an exultant Kop.\nLiverpool missed the driving force and leadership of injured captain Jordan Henderson and it was no surprise when Naby Keita was substituted after a poor performance.\nThe great quality of this Liverpool side, and make no mistake they got lucky with Fabianski's howlers, is that they are currently driven by an unshakeable self-belief and the error for Salah's goal tipped the balance firmly in their favour.\nIt is a truly remarkable effort to have dropped only two points after 27 games and Liverpool will happily grab moments of good fortune when they can.\nLiverpool's celebrations were subdued at the final whistle, perhaps an acknowledgement of an average display - but this will not matter when in due course they are crowned champions for the first time in 30 years.\nWest Ham can take heart\nMoyes must feel Anfield holds him in a curse - he has never won at Anfield in 16 attempts as a manager with Everton, Manchester United, Sunderland or West Ham.\nThe Scot's joyous celebrations when Fornals gave West Ham the lead at a time his side were performing with real heart must have had him believing the drought might be over until things took a nasty twist with that Fabianski error.\nWest Ham's fans came here to protest against their owners, with black balloons let off and a series of banners unfurled reading \"Karren Brady - You're Fired. \"Sullivan This Charmless Man.\" \"Run Like A Circus Owned By Clowns\" and \"State Of The Art Retractable Promises.\"\nIf there was discontent off the field, they will have been pleased with what they saw on it as West Ham ran Liverpool as close as just about anyone at Anfield this season.\nMoyes still faces an uphill struggle but he can at least take some encouragement from West Ham's display once the bitter taste of defeat has eased.\nA bad record for Moyes - the best of the stats\nWest Ham manager David Moyes remains without an away win against Liverpool in all competitions, failing in 16 attempts (D7, L9) and losing the last four in a row with Man Utd, Sunderland and West Ham.\nLiverpool have won their last 21 home Premier League games, equalling the English top-flight record for consecutive home wins, set by the Reds themselves between January and December 1972 under Bill Shankly.\nThey have scored 14 headed goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nOnly Cesc Fabregas (20y 134d) and Wayne Rooney (21y 63d) have reached 25 Premier League assists at a younger age than Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold (21y 140d).\nSince making his debut for West Ham in February 2017, Robert Snodgrass has registered 12 assists in the Premier League for the Hammers, more than any other player.\nMohamed Salah has been directly involved in eight goals in six Premier League appearances against West Ham (6 goals, 2 assists).\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2014, Liverpool's Andrew Robertson has registered 27 assists in the competition, more than any other defender in that time.\nSadio Mane has been directly involved in eight goals in his last six Premier League appearances against West Ham (5 goals, 3 assists), scoring in each of his last four against the Hammers.\nMan of the Match - Trent Alexander-Arnold\n'I never thought it would be equalled' - what they said\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp speaking to Sky Sports: \"I liked a lot how we started. We scored a wonderful first goal. But then we weren't good in second ball situations. We have to pick them up much more often. We struggled in this situation and that gave West Ham a good feeling.\nOn equalling Manchester City's record winning run: \"I never thought it would be broken or equalled. We did it and I cannot believe it happened to be honest. I like a lot tonight that everything positive helps. When we equalised the stadium was rocking and that helps us. Whatever will happen this season is an effort of all of us. I could not be more thankful or appreciate the support we get. So far so good.\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We can take a lot of positives. Before the game nobody will have given us a great deal of hope. I thought for large periods of the game we had a chance.\n\"I'd hate to think my teams would do anything but put a lot of effort in and I'd be annoyed if anyone else thought otherwise. The disappointing thing is the individual mistakes. I thought tonight we did a really good job. We performed really well as a team but we go away with no points and it's the points we need.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Watford on Saturday, 29 February (17:30 GMT kick-off), while West Ham host Southampton on the same day (15:00 GMT kick-off)."

It was his first league goal for the club on his 82nd appearance.\nThe hosts actually wasted two great counter-attacks - including a six-on-three break - but held on for just a second league win since November.\n\"A win is always good for the mood and confidence but I am not over the moon,\" Farke said.\n\"It was important that we were on top of our game to get some points because we are the underdogs in this league.\n\"There are more than 20 points, let us see how far we can go. We will be brave and let's see what the outcome can be.\"\nRelive Norwich's win\n'We can't dance around the truth'\nThis week marks the first anniversary of Rodgers' arrival at Leicester and the club are perhaps facing their first real blip.\nVardy was missing with a calf strain but Leicester still could and should have been ahead before Lewis' intervention.\nDennis Praet hit the outside of the post as Leicester had 12 first-half efforts and Iheanacho's 'goal' would surely have stood in any previous season.\nAs the striker jostled with Godfrey for a bouncing ball, both players appeared to unintentionally handle it before the former Manchester City man went on to power home a brilliant finish with his left foot.\nThere was a long wait as VAR Graham Scott consulted the footage and the goal was ruled out. It was another blow for Leicester and Rodgers, who felt his side were denied a penalty for handball against Manchester City last week.\n\"We are disappointed with our goal being ruled out,\" Rodgers said.\n\"We felt it was very, very harsh. It was unintentional but it hits their player's arm and drops on to Kelechi's.\n\"We have been inconsistent. We can't dance around the truth, we need to be better but that is something I am confident we can do.\n\"We need to get that focus back in our game.\"\nAn expected late onslaught never really came as Leicester failed to force Norwich goalkeeper Tim Krul into a save in the final 20 minutes despite plenty of pressure.\nThey retain a nine-point cushion over fifth-placed Manchester United but need a win soon to get their Champions League hopes back on track.\nMan of the match - Emiliano Buendia (Norwich)\nWhat next?\nNorwich head to Tottenham in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday night - live on the BBC - while Leicester host Birmingham at the same time.\nLeicester slump continues - the stats\nNorwich City enjoyed only their fifth Premier League win of the season, with two of those coming against teams occupying the top three (3-2 vs Man City in September)\nLeicester have lost six of their last 11 Premier League games (W3 D2 L6), one more than they lost in their first 27 matches under Brendan Rodgers (W17 D5 L5)\nLeicester have now lost three of their last four Premier League games against teams starting the day in the bottom half (W1 D0 L3), having lost just one of their first 18 games of this kind under Brendan Rodgers (W13 D4 L1)\nLeicester suffered a Premier League defeat against a team starting the day bottom for the first time since December 2016, when they lost 2-1 against Sunderland\nNorwich defender Jamal Lewis - aged 22 years and 34 days - became the youngest Northern Irish player to score in the Premier League since Craig Cathcart in January 2011 for Blackpool against Man Utd (21y 353d)"

Both teams will feel they did everything they could possibly do. We knew we'd have to dig in and fight plenty of battles out there.\n\"It's a remarkable victory because this is a fixture where we haven't done so well in recent years, and it's nice to break that hoodoo.\n\"It's good to get back-to-back wins and we've got two important games coming up [at home to Watford then away at Bournemouth]. If they go well, we can kiss relegation goodbye.\"\nThe result leaves Palace nestled safely in mid-table, while the Seagulls, who have not won since their victory over Bournemouth on 28 December, sit one point above the bottom three.\nHowever, the outcome in many ways mirrored Brighton's season so far.\nThe hosts dominated possession and carved out several opportunities to score but were eventually punished by their more incisive opponents.\nChristian Benteke, a threat throughout for Hodgson's side, created Ayew's winning goal against the run of play.\nThe Belgian forward turned away from a home defender to find his strike partner with a clever reverse pass, Ayew converting with a low shot under Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan.\nFollow all Saturday's Premier League action\nHodgson's landmark day goes to script\nDespite Brighton enjoying greater possession and more efforts on goal than Palace, this was another performance that went to script for Hodgson who was celebrating his 100th Premier League match in charge of the Eagles.\nThe former England boss stressed before kick-off that he was not bothered about controlling the game as long as his team could deliver in the final third.\nAnd he would have been delighted by their start which saw them keep the Seagulls at arm's length while creating clear-cut chances of their own.\nBenteke spurned the first, awkwardly miscuing his effort wide of goal after James McArthur's lofted pass sent him clear.\nCheikhou Kouyate then got the ball caught under his studs after latching on to a Benteke header which allowed Ryan to smother the ball at his feet.\nWhile the hosts poured forward after the break and had 15 shots on goal to Palace's six, goalkeeper Vicente Guaita was rarely troubled by some errant finishing.\nAnd Hodgson's landmark day could have ended even more satisfactorily - with Wilfried Zaha remarkably prodding a right-foot effort against the left post late on with the Brighton goal completely unguarded.\nBrighton's challenging run\nWhile Brighton racked up 24 shots against Crystal Palace, their best-ever total in a Premier League game, that only served to underline another performance that brought a distinct lack of cutting edge.\nFor all the flowing football that head coach Graham Potter has introduced, he has now overseen just one win from the past 14 games in all competitions.\nA wider concern for Potter and his players is that they can hardly take solace from the home games in front of them as the season draws to its conclusion.\nArsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City are Brighton's next four home opponents, with trips to Wolves and Leicester also on the horizon.\nPotter also appeared to make some curious decisions with Glenn Murray, who carried an aerial threat when he came on as a substitute, left out of the starting XI.\nSolly March, the man Murray replaced, had arguably been one of Brighton's most effective players, attempting six shots - more than any other player before his withdrawal.\nWhat cannot be laid at Potter's door was some of the dreadful finishing that proved their downfall. March missed Brighton's best first-half opportunity, with the winger firing a close-range effort into the side netting after a sweeping move down the left.\nBrighton's miserable day was summed up by Lewis Dunk's goalbound header from a Mooy corner, which hit Seagulls forward Neal Maupay in the six-yard box before bouncing to safety.\n\"It's a sore one for us. That's football, you have to put the ball in the net,\" Potter said. \"We created stuff, we tried, had shots, had chances, they didn't have too much.\n\"I feel for the boys. We have to dust ourselves down. There's enough quality there. We showed enough to say that we can move forward, that's what we've got to do.\"\nMan of the match - Gary Cahill (Crystal Palace)\nAyew equals best goal return - the stats\nCrystal Palace striker Jordan Ayew's goals this season have won his side 12 points. Only Andy Johnson in 2004-05 (15) won more in a single Premier League season for the Eagles.\nAyew has equalled his best goal return in a Premier League season - also netting seven goals in 2015-16 with Aston Villa and in 2017-18 with Swansea.\nBrighton remain the only side without a Premier League win in 2020 (D5 L3), with the Seagulls last enjoying a top-flight victory against Bournemouth on 28 December.\nCrystal Palace have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since December.\nBrighton mustered 24 shots against Crystal Palace, their best ever tally in a Premier League game.\nRoy Hodgson oversaw his 100th Premier League game in charge of Crystal Palace (W34 D27 L39), the first club he's reached the milestone with in the competition.\nSixteen of Crystal Palace's 28 Premier League games this season have been goalless at half-time, at least five more than any other side.\nCrystal Palace attacker Christian Benteke has registered two goal involvements in his past three Premier League appearances (one goal, one assist), as many as he managed in his previous 34 in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton face Wolves at Molineux in their next Premier League game on Saturday, 7 March (15:00 GMT), while Palace host Watford at the same time."

The Magpies last went four in a row without a goal in September 2015.\nBurnley are unbeaten in six Premier League games (W4 D2), their longest unbeaten run in the competition since February 2019 (8 games).\nSince the start of last season, Newcastle have played out seven goalless draws in the Premier League, more than any other side.\nBurnley failed to direct a shot on target in the first half of a Premier League game this season for the 10th time, a joint-high along with Crystal Palace.\nMatt Ritchie mustered seven shots in the game, the most by a Newcastle player in a Premier League game since February last year (Salomon Rondon with 7 v Huddersfield).\n'I'm pleased we created more' - what the managers said\nNewcastle head coach Steve Bruce: \"It was a better performance. There are positives I can take - a clean sheet and a point which gets us to the target we want to get to.\n\"When you do create chances in the big league, you need to take them. I'm pleased we created more and were a threat.\n\"There are still eight or 10 teams in there. When you are in the bottom half of the division you know how hard it is to win a game.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"I think overall it was a below par performance from us. I'm being critical of our own performance, but 11 clean sheets speaks for itself.\n\"It wasn't a great game by any means from any side. Newcastle have only lost here three times this season, so to get a point was a good point.\n\"The game never got into any rhythm. You have to try and find another way, but I'm pleased we got something from the game.\"\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle will look to progress to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for the first time under Mike Ashley's ownership when they face West Bromwich Albion in the last 16 on Tuesday 3 March (kick-off 20:00 GMT).\nBurnley return to action on Saturday 7 March, when they welcome Tottenham Hotspur to Turf Moor in the Premier League (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-2 Chelsea: Marcos Alonso double rescues Blues\nMarcos Alonso scored twice as Chelsea came from behind to earn a point against struggling Bournemouth in an entertaining encounter at Vitality Stadium.\nWing-back Alonso followed in Olivier Giroud's shot which had come back off the bar to open the scoring in the 33rd minute and struck again five minutes from time to rescue the Blues, whose top-four aspirations were dealt another blow.\nIt could have been much worse, however, after Eddie Howe's side scored twice in three second-half minutes through Jefferson Lerma and Joshua King to leave the visitors stunned.\nThe Cherries, who remain two points above the Premier League relegation places, had made an excellent start but midfielder Philip Billing spurned two glorious opportunities inside the opening five minutes before Chelsea took control.\nIn a reversal of the first half, Giroud should have doubled Chelsea's advantage within minutes of the restart, but Lerma's 54th-minute equaliser saw another momentum swing.\nThe hosts fought hard defensively to protect their slender lead, but Chelsea's late pressure eventually told as Alonso popped up in the right place once again.\nThe draw sees Chelsea edge four points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United, who face Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday (14:00 GMT).\nBournemouth v Chelsea as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nChelsea's hold on fourth continues to slip\nChelsea arrived at Vitality Stadium with one clear objective after they were comprehensively outclassed by Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday night - to claim three points and maintain their diminishing hold on fourth position at all costs.\nA disheartening 3-0 home defeat by the German champions left Chelsea's chances of reaching the quarter-finals in tatters, and while this season - Frank Lampard's first as Chelsea boss and with the club initially operating under a transfer ban - had always been viewed as a transitional one, falling short of fourth would surely be viewed as a failure after building a nine-point cushion to fifth place in November.\nThe players responded to Lampard's claim that their season \"starts now\" after defeat against Manchester United almost two weeks ago, beating another top-four rival Tottenham 2-1 last weekend to end a four-game winless run, but they were rather fortunate not to find themselves behind early on against a lively Bournemouth side.\nThey weathered an early storm that saw Billing twice allowed to shoot from close range, a Fikayo Tomori miskick at fault for one of those as he initially appeared uncertain in his first league start since December.\nBut the Blues patiently asserted themselves and Mason Mount's saved attempt after eight minutes signalled the start of an otherwise dominant first-half display - though Jorginho's needless 10th yellow card of the campaign and subsequent two-match suspension will not have pleased manager Lampard.\nAlonso was frequently Chelsea's furthest man forward and registered seven shots - more than anyone else - as he scored in consecutive Premier League games. Ultimately, it was the Spaniard's determination to get into the box which eventually saved Lampard's side.\nAnd in the absence of injured top scorer Tammy Abraham, Giroud offered a reliable target to draw his team-mates into the box as Chelsea peppered the goal with 23 attempts.\nWith the outcome of Manchester City's appeal against a two-year European ban uncertain, fourth spot still offers the Premier League's last guarantee of Champions League football, and Lampard will certainly not want to leave Chelsea's situation out of their own hands. With their late point, they have just about managed that for now.\n\"We've created a lot again, but we need to stick the ball in the back of the net,\" said manager Lampard.\n\"I'm very happy for Marcos Alonso but when I think that my left-back is the one scoring the two goals and he scored our last goal in the league as well, and you're creating that many chances in between, you have to question why we're not finishing them.\"\nBournemouth show they are up for the fight\nAfter recording a crucial win over Aston Villa at the start of the month, the Cherries had fallen to back-to-back defeats - including a disheartening 3-0 loss at Burnley last weekend - leaving them in real danger.\nTeetering two points above the drop zone in the Premier League at the start of a run-in which included seven of the league's current top eight teams over their next nine league fixtures, including Chelsea, Bournemouth boss Howe called for a \"siege mentality\" from his side.\nHis players responded appropriately, though they will be left to rue a host of early missed chances as Billing was unable to add to his sole league goal this season despite Tomori handing him the opportunity to make amends for a poor miss just two minutes earlier.\nThe return of central defender Nathan Ake and Lerma in midfield ensured Bournemouth stood firm under growing Chelsea pressure in the first half, but there was little they could do to prevent Alonso opening the scoring once Giroud's flicked shot had grazed the bar.\nThat leaves Bournemouth with just one clean sheet in 17 games - their last in a 1-0 win over Chelsea in December.\nThe Cherries appeared to be struggling before Lerma fired in the equaliser, and with the home crowd now roaring Howe's side on King's tap-in from Stacey's low cross completed a remarkable 176-second turnaround.\nBournemouth dropped deep in an attempt to see out their slender advantage, with Ramsdale providing the heroics in goal before Alonso dealt a cruel late blow.\nWith seven points fewer than at this stage last season, there is no mistaking Howe's side remain in deep trouble as four points separate five sides in the fight to stay up.\nIt is easy to forget that 11 years ago the club fought back from a 17-point deduction to secure its Football League status - and there is plenty of evidence the current side is up for this rather different challenge now.\n\"The last five performances have been stronger and we've started to score goals and create chances from open play,\" said Howe.\n\"We're not where we want to be though, and it's going to be really tight and a big battle to get the points we need from now until the end of the season.\n\"We're prepared to fight for the challenge ahead, but I cannot predict what it will take for safety, it's too tight.\"\nMan of the match - Marcos Alonso\nPoints shared for the first time - the stats\nThis is the first draw between these sides in the Premier League, in what was their 10th meeting.\nBournemouth have scored two or more goals in each of their past three home league games, having scored more than once in just three of their previous 17.\nChelsea are winless in four Premier League away games - their longest run within the same season since a run of seven in 2015.\nBournemouth's Joshua King has scored in each of his past three home league games against Chelsea, scoring four times. He's only scored more at home against West Ham (five).\nSince the start of last season, only Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold (24) has more Premier League assists than Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser (18).\nChelsea's Marcos Alonso scored his third brace in the Premier League, with all three coming away from home.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round on Tuesday (19:45 GMT), before welcoming Everton to Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on Sunday (14:00).\nBournemouth travel to Anfield to face league leaders Liverpool on Saturday (12:30)."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 3-1 Southampton: Hammers climb out of bottom three\nWest Ham's first Premier League win in two months was enough to take them out of the relegation zone as \u00a320m Jarrod Bowen marked his full debut with a goal against Southampton.\nSebastian Haller and Michail Antonio were also on target at the London Stadium after teenage forward Michael Obafemi had levelled Bowen's opener for the Saints.\nThe excellent Antonio might have had another for the hosts after he had been sent free by an audacious rabona from Haller but goalkeeper Alex McCarthy made the save.\nUnlike their last home game against Brighton, when they squandered a 3-1 lead, this time the Hammers eased home, moving above Aston Villa with a much-needed victory after a run of two points from their last seven games.\nThe result was also positive for co-chairman David Sullivan and David Gold given the protest against them that took place before the game by thousands of Hammers fans, angry at the way the club is being run.\n'Relief for West Ham after win but divisions remain'\nSaints defending 'absolute joke' - Hasenhuttl\nRelive Saturday's Premier League action\nBowen's bounty\nA lot of haggling took place before Bowen's January transfer deadline-day move from Hull finally went through. The striker even had his medical in Yorkshire just in case the deal was not completed and he was required for duty in the Championship the following day.\nIt has taken a bit of time for Bowen to get his chance but, finally given a start by manager David Moyes, the 23-year-old showed why he has scored 39 goals in the last season-and-a-half.\nEven from a wide position on the right, Bowen was a threat and had a good chance blocked before opening his Hammers account after 15 minutes, running on to an excellent pass from Pablo Fornals before supplying the neat finish.\n\"I think that's the way it went in my dreams last night,\" said Bowen.\n\"The assistant manager said the keeper liked to go down quickly. I knew the angle was tight so I got enough on it to dink it over him.\n\"I thought it might be offside - I joked with my dad last night about what if I scored and it was ruled out.\"\nSuch is the general feeling of discontent around the London Stadium at the moment that Southampton's equaliser could easily have been a body blow from which the hosts could not recover.\nTo that end, their were indebted to McCarthy, who gifted the hosts their second by getting his positioning all wrong to challenge for a routine up and under by Antonio.\nHaller out-jumped McCarthy to get his head on the ball and then reacted quickly to squeeze the ball home from a tight angle.\nA lofted Fornals pass sent Antonio through for the Hammers' third and while they have given away 22 points from winning positions this season, most recently at Liverpool on Monday, this time they completed the job.\nThat was particularly welcome for Bowen, who had lost all nine previous Premier League games he had been involved in.\nSaints undone by Moyes approach\nIt is three months now since the end of Southampton's own desperate run of two points from nine games, including that calamitous 9-0 home defeat by Leicester.\nSuch is their improvement that two more wins will probably be enough to keep the Saints safe.\nHowever, three defeats in their last four games is a concern and, even though the absence of top scorer Danny Ings was a factor, Moyes seemed to have worked out letting the visitors have the ball was important in reducing Southampton's attacking threat. Southampton's defeat came despite them having 66% possession.\nAs if to emphasise the point, Southampton's goal was essentially a counter-attack after a West Ham raid had broken down.\nJames Ward-Prowse was afforded too much time to cross and Obafemi swept home.\nIt was only the Dubliners' second Premier League goal but the manner of the finish, lifted over a despairing Fabianski, suggests there will be a few more before the campaign reaches its conclusion.\nIngs was introduced midway through the second-half in the hope of sparking a comeback but failed to threaten.\nMan of the Match - Jarrod Bowen (West Ham United)\nHammers dominate Saints - the stats\nWest Ham picked up just their third win in their last 14 games in the Premier League (D2 L9), with all three of those wins coming against south coast opposition (Southampton x2 and Bournemouth).\nSouthampton have lost three of their last four Premier League outings (W1), as many as they had in their previous 12 games in the competition (W7 D2 L3).\nWest Ham have won five consecutive games against Southampton in the Premier League; their joint-longest winning run against an opponent in the competition (also five against Blackburn between 2006 and 2008).\nSouthampton have suffered consecutive away defeats in the same Premier League season for the first time since March 2019 (0-2 v Arsenal and 2-3 v Manchester United).\nJarrod Bowen became the first English player to score on his first Premier League start for West Ham since Kevin Nolan in August 2012 (v Aston Villa).\nEach of Sebastien Haller's 31 goals within the top five European leagues have been scored from inside the box (seven for West Ham and 24 for Eintracht Frankfurt).\nAll four of Michael Obafemi's goals in all competitions for Southampton have been scored away from home, with each of his three this season being netted in London.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham's next game is a London derby at Arsenal on Saturday, 7 March (15:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "Watford 3-0 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp's side lose first Premier League game of the season\nLiverpool's hopes of remaining unbeaten for an entire Premier League season were ended in sensational style by a rampant Watford at Vicarage Road.\nIsmaila Sarr scored twice while captain Troy Deeney added a third in a sparkling second-half display from the hosts as Liverpool's run of victories was brought to a shuddering halt.\nThe Reds had won their past 18 Premier League games and another at Vicarage Road would have made history as the longest winning run in the English top flight.\nBut they never got going against a Watford side who were superb from start to finish and who move out of the relegation zone as a result.\nThe Hornets had more chances in the first half and only a superb save from Alisson, to deny Troy Deeney, prevented them from leading at the break.\nHowever, Watford deservedly went in front when Abdoulaye Doucoure squeezed a cross in from the left and the impressive Sarr was there to stab in.\nLiverpool had fallen behind against West Ham last week but still managed to grind out a win. However, there was a feeling that this time was different, with the Reds sloppy in possession and lacking bite in attack.\nIt was no surprise that Watford doubled their advantage. Sarr was put through on goal by Will Hughes and the winger calmly lifted the ball over Alisson and into the net.\nCaptain Deeney then completed a famous victory, curling into the back of the net from the edge of the area.\nThis is not a result that is going to halt Liverpool's title charge with the Reds 22 points clear at the top but it was nevertheless an unexpected and memorable result for Watford.\nReaction to Liverpool's defeat\nSarr the star for superb Watford\nMany had arrived at Vicarage Road expecting to see Liverpool make history by winning in the league for the 19th game in a row.\nIndeed, such was the level of expectation that press accreditation for the game had been oversubscribed, with hundreds of media outlets keen to cover a moment in English football history.\nBut Watford were clearly not reading from the same script.\nA superb run of four wins in five games at the start of Nigel Pearson's reign had lifted them up from the foot of the table and out of the relegation zone but five games without victory prior to the visit of Liverpool had dropped them back into trouble.\nDespite the recent poor run of results, performances had still been good and they were boosted for this game by the return from injury of Sarr.\nThe winger has been a real creative spark for the Hornets this season, and he was a menace from the outset, taking advantage of the surprising amount of space he was afforded on the wing to deliver a number of dangerous crosses.\nHis pace and trickery unsettled the Reds, who were unable to handle him and both his goals were taken with an assured calmness.\nIf he can remain fit for the remaining 10 games of the season then Watford have a real chance of retaining their Premier League status.\nAn off day for champions-elect Reds\nThere is no getting away from the fact that Liverpool have been simply sensational this season and the only surprise is that they have been able to maintain a consistent level of brilliance for so long.\nRecent performances have not been quite at the level they have been capable of, losing to a resilient Atletico Madrid in the Champions League before scraping past West Ham last week.\nThe Hammers showed that if teams attack the Reds defence then they stand a better chance of upsetting them and that was the case on Saturday as they struggled to deal with the Hornets' high press.\nA couple of wayward clearances from Alisson early on, when the Liverpool goalkeeper was under pressure, provided a hint of what was to come.\nThe defensive pairing of Virgil van Dijk and Dejan Lovren also looked vulnerable, certainly in comparison to the seemingly impenetrable Van Dijk-Joe Gomez partnership, with Gomez out because of a fitness issue.\nIt was an off day for the Reds and one that may provide them with renewed spirit to finish off in style what is sure to be a title-winning campaign but we should take nothing away from what was an excellent display by Watford.\nMan of the match - Ismaila Sarr (Watford)\n'It's not hard is it, football?' - what they said\nWatford boss Nigel Pearson: \"It's such an important win for us. But it is one win. Our season has been tough so far, with losing last week and not playing well, we were keen to get a response.\n\"They are such an outstanding side, we had to get our performance right - as close to max as possible - and I thought we thoroughly deserved the win. We threatened with the ball and defended with discipline, energy and commitment. That's been the message from day one.\n\"It's in our own hands, and we have to deliver that performance week in, week out.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"They did exactly what they wanted to do, we did not. That's how football works.\n\"You have to accept it, it's not so easy, but it's the proof we were not good enough. It's always very difficult.\n\"If you win good, if you lose, try to do it in the right manner and do it like a man.\"\nLiverpool defender Virgil van Dijk: \"Credit to Watford, they played well, a lot of fight, very disciplined and scored three goals - that's the reality, we couldn't find a way through. It was difficult and we have to do better.\n\"The record and the talk of the records is all media, we just try to win every game.\n\"We will focus on the next game, the cup game, and we try to win there. We have to stay humble and work harder next game.\"\nWatford goalkeeper Ben Foster, speaking to Sky Sports: \"Just do that every week. It's easy if you do it like that - we had a game plan and stuck to it really well.\n\"Ismaila Sarr is a crazy good talent, he's so calm in front of goal and has electric pace. Buzzing.\n\"It's not hard is it, football? We stuck to our task and took our chances when they came.\"\nFiring blanks - the stats\nWatford are the first side to beat Liverpool in the Premier League since Manchester City in January 2019, ending the joint-longest winning streak (18) and the second longest unbeaten run (44) in English top-flight history.\nLiverpool's 0-3 loss was the biggest margin of defeat for a side starting the day top of the Premier League since November 2015 (Man City 1-4 Liverpool).\nWatford's victory over Liverpool was the biggest over a side starting the day top of the top-flight table by a team in the relegation zone since Leicester beat Manchester United 3-0 on November 23rd 1985.\nWatford secured their first top-flight victory against a side starting the day top of the table since the final day of the 1982-83 season, also beating Liverpool that day (2-1).\nLiverpool failed to score in a Premier League game for the first time since March 2019 (0-0 v Everton), ending a run of scoring in 36 consecutive league games.\nLiverpool have conceded 2+ goals in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2016 conceding as many goals in their last two league games (5) as they had in their previous 14.\nLiverpool had just one shot on target in a Premier League game for the first time since February 2019 in a goalless draw against Manchester United (1).\nWhat next?\nLiverpool travel to Chelsea in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) and then host Bournemouth in the league on Saturday, 7 March (12:30 GMT). Watford travel to Crystal Palace on the same day at 15:00 GMT."

        "article_text": "Everton 1-1 Manchester United: Toffees see late goal disallowed\nEverton had a late winner against Manchester United ruled out and manager Carlo Ancelotti was sent off in an entertaining game in which both teams were undone by goalkeeping mistakes.\nThe hosts made a dream start thanks to a calamitous error by United's David de Gea, whose clearance cannoned straight into Dominic Calvert-Lewin and then into the net for the striker's 15th goal of the season.\nUnited responded from that early setback when Nemanja Matic's shot smacked against the Everton crossbar, and they equalised after 31 minutes when Everton's Jordan Pickford failed to stop Bruno Fernandes' bouncing shot from 20 yards.\nEverton upped the tempo following the break in a feisty game where seven players were booked, and the hosts came close to scoring when Gylfi Sigurdsson hit the post with a dipping free-kick.\nBut there was late drama as both keepers redeemed themselves with fine saves, and Calvert-Lewin had a goal ruled out by the video assistant referee in added time because Sigurdsson had been lying on the ground in front of De Gea in an offside position.\nThat led to Ancelotti confronting the referee and being shown a red card after the final whistle, with boos ringing around Goodison Park.\nThe result means United extended their unbeaten run to eight games and remain fifth, while Everton's chances of reaching the Europa League were dealt a blow following Wolves' win at Spurs.\nI did not disrespect referee - Ancelotti\nReaction from Goodison Park plus Wolves' win at Tottenham\nAncelotti cements bond with Everton fans\nEverton have flourished since Ancelotti took charge in December, putting them in touch of a Europa League place - and they extended their unbeaten home run to seven games with this point.\nBut after Calvert-Lewin's second goal was ruled out, there was a sense of injustice from the manager, the Everton players and a raucous crowd, who all thought they deserved victory.\nDe Gea appeared to have redeemed himself when he saved Sigurdsson's shot in injury time, but he protested that the Everton midfielder was in his line of sight when Calvert-Lewin followed in.\nReferee Chris Kavanagh initially awarded the goal, creating pandemonium inside Goodison - but the mood threatened to boil over once VAR intervened.\nDespite being dismissed - Ancelotti became the first Premier League boss to be shown a red card - his passion at full-time delighted the home fans, and only cemented his bond with them.\nEarlier, he had steamed onto the pitch to break up a melee after a strong Calvert-Lewin tackle on Luke Shaw led to several players squaring up to each other.\nThere will be disappointment about the manner of the result among Everton fans, but they had a clear demonstration that as well as possessing urbane charm, Ancelotti is willing to fight for their cause.\nOn a day when former striker Dixie Dean was remembered and midfielder Andre Gomes made his first start since a horrific ankle injury almost four months ago, it made it an occasion to remember.\nHenderson's relish as keepers struggle\nCalvert-Lewin's goal was his eighth in 10 Premier League games, but few have been as easy or fortunate as the game's opener after only three minutes.\nDe Gea had plenty of time to clear following Harry Maguire's careful backpass, but he dithered and the Everton forward's willingness to press from the front would have impressed the watching England manager Gareth Southgate, who will pick his squad to play Italy and Denmark later this month.\nThe United keeper atoned for his mistake when he saved smartly from Calvert-Lewin moments later, but it means that no player has made more errors leading to goals since the start of last season than De Gea's seven.\nPickford then contributed to his own team's downfall by letting Fernandes' shot bounce under his outstretched arms.\nHis mistake was not in the same category as De Gea's, but with Southgate watching on, it may lead the England boss to consider Sheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson for the forthcoming friendlies.\nThe fact he is on loan at the Blades from Manchester United may also offer Ole Gunnar Solskjaer food for thought, although the United manager insisted afterwards that he wasn't worried by De Gea's errors and said the Spaniard was \"the best keeper in the world\".\nSolskjaer will once again be delighted by the form of Fernandes, who was the visitors' most creative outlet and scored his third goal since joining the club for \u00a347m at the end of January.\nMan of the Match - Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\n'Disappointed with red card' - what they said\nCarlo Ancelotti to Match of the Day on his red card: \"When I saw the red card it was a disappointment. I asked for an explanation and afterwards I had a conversation with him - I want to keep that private.\"\nOn Everton's disallowed goal: \"The decision was difficult. From our side we say Gylfi [Sigurdsson] didn't affect the vision of the goalkeeper and they decided differently. Sometimes it is right sometimes it is wrong. But the performance gives us more confidence that we can compete with these teams.\n\"I don't think [David de Gea's view was obstructed]. His vision was clear, but the ball moved past really close to [Sigurdsson] - it's really difficult, it is not an objective decision, it is subjective.\"\nOle Gunnar Solskaer to Match of the Day on David de Gea's error: \"It's something that happens in football once in a while if you take too long on the ball. Calvert-Lewin always chases everything and it's unfortunate that it goes in the goal. We responded and got the goal we deserved.\"\nOn the impact of Bruno Fernandes: \"He's a good player and we have been missing that type of player to do that for us, I'm very pleased with his contribution.\"\nFortress Goodison since Silva sacking\nSince Carlo Ancelotti's first game with Everton on 26 December, only Liverpool (30) and Manchester City (19) have won more points in the Premier League than the Toffees (18).\nEverton have yet to lose at Goodison Park in the Premier League since sacking Marco Silva, winning four and drawing three games since his departure.\nManchester United have lost just one of their last 11 games against Everton in all competitions (W6 D4 L1), losing 0-4 at Goodison Park in April 2019.\nBruno Fernandes has been directly involved in 19 goals in 21 league games this season for Sporting Lisbon and Manchester United (10 goals & 9 assists).\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has scored 13 Premier League goals this season - the last English player to score more in a single campaign for the club was Paul Rideout in 1994-95 (14).\nSince Ancelotti's first game in charge, Calvert-Lewin has scored more Premier League goals than any other player in the competition (8).\nDavid De Gea has made seven errors leading directly to an opposition goal in the Premier League since the start of last season, the joint highest alongside Jordan Pickford, Martin Dubravka and Bernd Leno.\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea in the Premier League next Sunday, 8 March (14:00 GMT).\nManchester United are in action in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Thursday, 5 March (19:45 GMT), before the Manchester derby at Old Trafford against Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday, 8 March (16:30 GMT)."

The players didn't deserve the defeat. We were punished by, I would say, mentality mistakes. You have to be ruthless against teams like Wolves that plays fantastically well on the counter-attack.\n\"We deserve much more than these results but this is what it is. [The front three] combined well, they did what they can. They did the plan that we worked on in the week. We had lots of arrivals in dangerous positions, but it is quite frustrating to see they don't have that feeling.\"\nOn leaving out Alderweireld and Vertonghen: \"I think Eric Dier played very, very well, so when the player you bring in as a replacement plays very, very well the question could be why did you play Dier and not why did you leave out Toby and Jan.\n\"I tried to play with Davinson [Sanchez] and Tanganga, which are the two fastest players. Dier is because he is a midfield player, he has the possibility to come out with the ball and play as an extra midfield player. I thought they did very well apart from the goals, which are collective responsibility, not individual responsibility.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, also to Match of the Day: \"It's amazing the energy levels that we put into the game. They recover very well. It's a challenge, and when you really embrace the challenge you give everything you have, and this is what we are doing.\n\"We should start the game better.

If that looks good, I have to make a decision.\"\nThe win means Liverpool could be champions by the time they play Everton in the league on 16 March - if Manchester City lose their next three games against Manchester United, Arsenal and Burnley.\nEddie Howe's Bournemouth side remain in the relegation zone, level on points with Watford and West Ham but with a worse goal difference than their nearest rivals at the bottom.\nReds back to winning ways - just\nKlopp spoke before the game about \"getting back on track immediately\" after watching his side slip to consecutive defeats in the league and FA Cup.\nThey made the worst possible start, however, as Bournemouth capitalised on the Reds' early nerves to take a shock lead - albeit in controversial fashion.\nWilson finished off a neat move involving Lerma and Philip Billing, but Liverpool felt the goal should have been disallowed for the striker's push on Gomez. The video assistant referee saw no infringement and the goal was given.\nThings could have got worse for Liverpool when Nathan Ake's powerful header was unconvincingly shovelled on to the top of the crossbar by stand-in goalkeeper Adrian, although they continued to create chances and deservedly restored parity through Salah's low finish - his 70th league goal for the club.\nIf Bournemouth fans could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when Mane scored with a delightful dink over Aaron Ramsdale 12 minutes before half-time, Liverpool failed to carry that momentum into the second half.\nChances were few and far between until Ryan Fraser spotted Adrian off his line, with the retreating Milner producing an outstanding clearance, while Mane's 25-yard strike cannoned back off the bar.\nIndividual errors cost Bournemouth\nHaving seen his side taken a deserved early lead, Howe will be bitterly disappointed with the manner of Liverpool's two first-half goals.\nSimpson, who replaced the injured Steve Cook after 19 minutes, was easily dispossessed by Mane in the build-up to Salah's equaliser, before another sloppy pass allowed Van Dijk to tee up the Senegal forward for Liverpool's second.\nThere were positives for Bournemouth, who caused Liverpool problems and were only denied a share of the spoils by Milner's superb clearance from Fraser's looping effort.\nAke spurned an opportunity to equalise in the 90th minute when he opted to pass to the offside Wilson with only Adrian to beat.\nHowever, Bournemouth will need to cut out individual mistakes if they are to prolong their five-year stay in the Premier League.\n\"The two goals come from us having possession and they punished us on the transition,\" Howe said. \"It was a ruthless game for us today because I don't think we did much wrong.\"\nWith games against Wolves, Manchester United, Tottenham and Leicester coming up, Bournemouth will be desperate to claim maximum points at home to Crystal Palace in their next league match.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\nReds stretch unbeaten Anfield run - the stats\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 55 league matches at Anfield (W45 D10). Only Chelsea between 2004-2008 (86 games) have had a longer unbeaten run at home in Premier League history.\nSince the start of last season, Bournemouth have lost more Premier League away games than any other side (24).\nBournemouth have lost all eight of their Premier League matches against teams starting the day in first place by an aggregate score of 27-4.\nMohamed Salah is the first Liverpool player to score 20 goals in all competitions in three consecutive seasons since Michael Owen in 2000-01 and 2002-03.\nSalah has scored 70 goals in 100 Premier League appearances for Liverpool, seven more than any other player in their first 100 for the club (Fernando Torres 63). Only Alan Shearer with Blackburn (79) has scored more goals in his first 100 Premier League appearances for a club in the competition's history.\nLiverpool's Sadio Mane has had a hand in six goals in his past four Premier League starts against Bournemouth (4 goals, 2 assists).\nCallum Wilson's opener was the first Premier League goal Bournemouth have scored against Liverpool since April 2017 (Josh King), ending a run of 17 consecutive goals scored by the Reds in this fixture.\n'We have to give everyone a proper fight' - what the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I know what the boys are able to do, but I am not the one that is playing - they are. We have said before, confidence is not something that you get, put in your pocket and keep for the rest of your life. It comes and goes.

Only League One sides Oxford and Portsmouth have played more in England.\nWolves would have gone fourth with victory, but fifth place could still yield a Champions League spot if Manchester City do not win an appeal against their two-year European expulsion.\nMost of Wolves' chances were from distance, with Ruben Neves shooting over on a couple of occasions and Raul Jimenez poking a shot wide. Jimenez had one of their best chances of the game with a fine volley from Willy Boly's long pass but it hit the stanchion behind the goal.\nThey looked brighter when Adama Traore, who dislocated a shoulder in last weekend's win at Tottenham, came on in the second half. He had a hand in their only effort on target.\nTraore ran down the right and found substitute Daniel Podence. His effort was blocked by Lewis Dunk and the loose ball fell to Jimenez, whose shot took a slight nick off Adam Webster and Ryan saved.\nWolves - who have only beaten Brighton four times in 32 league meetings - pushed for a late goal but none came, with Jimenez laying the ball off for Dendoncker to shoot over.\nBrighton buoyed but search for win goes on\nThis could yet prove a crucial point for Brighton, who are the only team left in the top four divisions not to win this year. This was their 10th attempt, drawing six and losing four.\nGraham Potter's side were well organised and kept their first clean sheet since that most recent win, 2-0 against Bournemouth on 28 December.\nThey will need to match that resilience in their next five games, four of which are against Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City.\nPropper's shot from 25 yards was their only effort on goal, but they had several other chances. Yves Bissouma was especially bright with three of their four shots off target.\nAttacking midfielder Alexis Mac Allister made his debut in the second half - the Argentina international joined Albion in January 2019 but has spent loan spells with Argentinos Juniors and Boca Juniors.\nThe 21-year-old was lively, with several dangerous set-pieces causing concern for Wolves.\nThe visitors spent the latter stages pushing for a goal but struggled to create a clear-cut chance.\n'All the games in this league are quite brutal' - manager reaction\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Match of the Day: \"We didn't perform so well, like we wanted. It was a tough game against a very good team.\n\"They were organised, but so were we. It was a game of not too many chances.\n\"It's about where we came from. We started three years ago and we keep on building, trying always to sustain the level of performance. I think today we didn't, and we have to improve for the next one.\"\nBrighton manager Graham Potter told MOTD: \"It was important for us to keep a clean sheet. We took part in a game against a team with a lot of dangerous players, but we restricted them to not too many clear-cut chances.\n\"We did well. Defensively we're really pleased. It was a collective effort. With the quality they have they can put you in dangerous places.\n\"We took part in the game. We tried to play and attack when we could. We had opportunities but it wasn't to be. We move forward really positively with a clean sheet - we hadn't had one for a while.\n\"All the games in this league are quite brutal. We just need to keep working, fighting and preparing for the next game.\"\nMan of the match - Yves Bissouma\nMatch stats - Wolves are the 0-0 kings\nWolves have drawn five games 0-0 this season in all competitions, the most of any Premier League side.\nWolves have played 47 matches this season, one more than in the whole of last season.\nWolves have kept four clean sheets in their past five Premier League games, as many as they in their previous 25.\nSeven of the past nine league meetings between Wolves and Brighton at Molineux have ended as draws, with last season's encounter at Molineux also finishing goalless.\nDespite coming on in the 64th minute, Adama Traore completed more dribbles than any other player (five).\nWhat's next?\nWolves visit Greek side Olympiakos in the Europa League last 16 on Thursday, before travelling to West Ham in the Premier League on 15 March.\nBrighton host Arsenal on Saturday, the first of four games against the 'big six' in five matches."

He has that natural ability in abundance.\"\nSouthampton had been reduced to 10 men midway through the first half when Moussa Djnepro's yellow card was upgraded to a red following a VAR review of his foul on Isaac Hayden.\nBut McCarthy had looked set to earn the Saints a battling point after making a stunning triple save to keep out efforts from Dwight Gayle and Miguel Almiron in the first half before then denying Matt Ritchie from the penalty spot.\nHowever, Saint-Maximin had the final say to secure a win that moves Newcastle up to 13th in the table, eight points clear of the relegation zone.\nSouthampton, meanwhile, drop to 14th following a third defeat in their last four Premier League games.\nNewcastle end goal drought at crucial time\nThe win could not have come at a better time for Newcastle after a run of five games without victory in the Premier League had fans glancing nervously over their shoulder.\nThey started the day five points above the relegation zone and in severe lack of form in front of goal after drawing blanks in their previous four league outings.\nIt looked like that scoreless run would stretch to five games, although arguably through no fault of their own as they found Saints keeper McCarthy in inspired form in front of goal in the first half.\nHe saved everything that was thrown at him, keeping out Gayle from close range and then two efforts in quick succession by Almiron on the follow up.\nGayle was denied again with a point-blank header and when McCarthy stretched superbly to keep out Ritchie's well-hit spot-kick, it appeared that it was not going to be Newcastle's day.\nBut in Saint-Maximin they have a player who is unpredictable but possesses explosive pace and strength and, in the closing stages, he stole the ball from Valery before placing a neat finish beyond McCarthy to ensure Newcastle escaped with three important points.\nSaints' struggles continue\nSouthampton have struggled for consistency this season with long periods of losing often followed by excellent winning runs.\nFour wins from five games in December and January had looked to have put them on course for a mid-table finish but Southampton have picked up just three points since the start of February.\nTheir good form in the middle of the season is likely to be enough to keep them out of trouble as they sit seven points above the bottom three but they will be keen to arrest their current slide soon just to be certain.\nThe home fans will feel aggrieved with some of the decisions that went against them in this game, although there can be few complaints about the red card for Djnepro. While his challenge was not malicious, his foot did land on Hayden's ankle and the outcome could have been much worse for the Newcastle man.\nSaints can take heart from how they battled for so long with 10 men and they will need to show those battling qualities once again with tough trips to relegation-threatened Norwich and Watford on the horizon.\nMan of the match - Alex McCarthy (Southampton)\n'A tough one to take' - what they said\nSouthampton goalkeeper McCarthy: \"It's definitely a tough one to take. In the second half Newcastle didn't have many clear chances but it's a little error that has cost us a point.\n\"After the way the first half panned out, I thought we could stay in this. It's very disappointing to come away with nothing. It's frustrating.\n\"I've not had much luck with penalties but I ended up guessing. We haven't had a few results go our way lately. We have played well but it's a hard one to take.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We have a had a tough time, but it's been a good week. There is a marked improvement.\n\"The three players brought in in January have helped us. It has been difficult, but 35 points with eight to go is good. It's another one off, we are back running and again and it's decent.\"\nNot so saintly Saints see red again - the stats\nNewcastle have won three consecutive league games against Southampton for the first time in their history.\nSouthampton have lost both matches against Newcastle in a single Premier League season for only the second time, also doing so in 2004-05.\nNewcastle were awarded their first penalty in 37 Premier League games (March 2019 v Everton), while the Magpies have now missed four of their last five penalties in the Premier League.\nAlex McCarthy is the first Southampton goalkeeper to save a penalty at St Mary's in the Premier League since Kelvin Davis vs Manchester United in September 2012 - 2,743 days ago.\nAll three of Allan Saint-Maximin's goals for Newcastle in all competitions have come away from home, also netting vs Sheffield United at Bramall Lane in the Premier League.\nNo Premier League side has received more red cards in 2019-20 than Southampton (three), following Moussa Djenepo's 28th minute sending off.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton travel to Norwich on Saturday, 14 March (15:00 GMT) while Newcastle host Sheffield United at the same time."

It doesn't happen overnight.\"\nWest Ham, who have now lost their past six Premier League away games, had enjoyed the better of the scoring opportunities until Lacazette's intervention and remain 16th, above the bottom three only on goal difference.\nWhile David Moyes' side had limited possession, they took the game to their hosts, who came out of the blocks sluggishly and struggled to inject any tempo to their play.\nJarrod Bowen's early shot was tipped on to a post by Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno and Michail Antonio failed to score from two clear chances either side of the interval.\nGreece defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos earlier went close for Arsenal - he headed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's cross against the bar - before Lacazette popped up with the winner.\nImprovement needed from sluggish Arsenal\nSince his appointment as Arsenal boss on 20 December, Arteta has lost only one league game, and appears to have injected more resilience, energy and a pattern of play into his side.\nHowever, for large parts of this encounter the Spaniard's imprint on his team was barely visible.\nInstead, they served up the sort of rudderless display - lacking in leadership, guile and pace - that led to the departure of former manager Unai Emery in November.\nWhile the outcome may have enhanced Arsenal's chances of qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2016-17, Arteta suggested that his side will have to improve further to make up ground in the race for a top-four finish.\nLeading scorer Aubameyang, was a peripheral figure throughout. Although the Gabon forward showed glimpses of his talent, laying on chances for Sokratis and Nicolas Pepe from wide positions, he touched the ball only twice in the Hammers' penalty area.\nIn midfield, Arsenal were slow and ponderous, while a defence that included on-loan Flamengo defender Pablo Mari for the first time in the top flight was repeatedly caught out by West Ham's swift counter-attacking.\nThe one element that pleased Arteta, is that his side found a way to grind out a victory when not at their best, with Leno excelling in goal and Ozil's intelligence coming to the fore for Lacazette's goal.\n\"The most important thing is to find a way to win. That is what the big clubs do,\" Arteta added.\n\"A lot of things need to improve. But let us just enjoy today. We have to take it game by game.\"\n'I don't want us to be a hard luck story'\nIf this contest was between teams with disparate ambitions, West Ham's performance made it difficult to distinguish which side were struggling towards the bottom of the table.\nThe Hammers' tally of five points from the past 27 available may well make for uncomfortable reading but Moyes will be delighted by the way his team carried out his instructions against Arsenal.\nWest Ham were disciplined in defence, and the pace and power of Bowen, Sebastien Haller and Antonio ensured they carried a threat on the break.\nBut for some errant finishing and wayward final passes, they could have claimed a notable scalp and three precious points.\nBowen's early effort which grazed the right-hand post was a precursor of what was to follow, with Haller and Antonio denied by Leno when well placed and the latter also flicking a close-range shot wide just before the break.\n\"The opportunities were there to win and we didn't take them,\" Moyes said.\n\"I don't want us to be a hard luck story. I told my players I thought they played well but let's get rid of that tag. We can't let that happen again. We have got to be more ruthless. At this stage, I would rather we had not played well and won.\"\nMan of the match - Bernd Leno (Arsenal)\nArsenal extend unbeaten run - the stats\nArsenal are unbeaten in eight Premier League matches (W4 D4), the longest current run in the competition.\nWest Ham have lost their past six Premier League away games, their longest run on the road since a run of eight defeats between August and December 2006.\nArsenal have kept three clean sheets in their past four league games, as many as they had in their previous 23.\nSince the start of last season, Arsenal have scored 16 league goals via substitutes, more than any other side in the competition.

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford: Jordan Ayew proves the difference again for Roy Hodgson's side\nCrystal Palace recorded a third successive Premier League victory as they beat relegation-threatened Watford to climb into the top half of the table.\nHaving scored the decisive goal against Brighton last weekend, Jordan Ayew proved the difference once more for Roy Hodgson's side as he converted his eighth league goal of the campaign with a smart finish from the edge of the penalty area after 28 minutes.\nWatford started much the better side at Selhurst Park but attempts by Abdoulaye Doucoure and Will Hughes failed to trouble Vicente Guaita.\nPalace, who also record a third straight clean sheet, went close through Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke's overhead kick during a scrappy second half which neither side was able to really seize control of.\nWatford captain Troy Deeney's powerful strike from outside the box forced Guaita to tip over the bar - the Palace goalkeeper also equal to Doucoure's header as the hosts held out.\nIn a week when manager Roy Hodgson signed a one-year contract extension, Palace rise to 10th, four points behind fifth-placed Wolves.\nAlthough unable to build on last weekend's stunning 3-0 win over league leaders Liverpool, Watford remain outside of the relegation places, albeit on goal difference.\nCrystal Palace v Watford as it happened\nHodgson \"in the best possible place\" amid coronavirus concerns\nPalace maintain momentum\nCrystal Palace manager Hodgson's contract extension will see him remain at the club until the end of the 2020-21 campaign.\nThat would see the 72-year-old enter a 45th year as a manager - and a fourth with the Eagles, whom he joined early in the 2017-18 campaign with the club rock-bottom after taking no points from their opening seven matches.\nTying ex-England boss Hodgson down to an extra year was an obvious decision for Palace chairman Steve Parish, given Hodgson's consistent ability to guide the club clear of end-of-season relegation scraps, with 11th and 12th place finishes in last two years.\nLast season's tally of 49 points now appears a very realistic target with nine games remaining after another solid performance which typified Hodgson's spell at Selhurst Park to date and perhaps even sees Palace trade safety concerns for unlikely dreams of European football.\nRecent back-to-back 1-0 wins against Newcastle and Brighton epitomised the no-nonsense style with which Hodgson's Palace have repeatedly steered clear of trouble and this showing was no different as centre-backs Gary Cahill and Scott Dann protected Guaita with unrelenting determination.\nIn an otherwise pedestrian start, Cheikhou Kouyate provided the energy in the centre to put some pressure on Watford's passing before Ayew's excellent finish kick-started the hosts.\nAyew's eight league goals have been worth a significant 15 points to Palace's fight this season and, following a serious injury to loan signing Cenk Tosun, his continued contribution will prove crucial to how far Palace can go in the remaining games.\nHodgson's side still face a tough run-in with six of the current top seven sides to come in their remaining games, but their recent form means they can now afford to enjoy those challenges.\n\"I'm delighted. We showed incredible character to dig in and defend valiantly,\" said Hodgson.\n\"We have every faith that this team won't get dragged in [to a relegation fight] and will maybe even start looking to push further up the table and get in behind one or two teams above us. I would be very surprised if that was to happen but I don't rule anything out because in football you're foolish to rule anything out.\"\nWatford unable to build on stunning Liverpool win\nWatford recorded the shock of the Premier League season so far as they produced a magnificent performance to end leaders Liverpool's unbeaten campaign in stunning style and provide a significant boost to their survival prospects last weekend.\nHowever, manager Nigel Pearson will be desperately disappointed that his side were unable to reproduce a similar level of performance against Crystal Palace to that which saw them swat the champions-in-waiting aside.\nThe loss of Gerard Deulofeu to a season-ending injury this week comes as a huge blow to the Hornets and Watford's lack of incision against a well-organised defence only served to highlight his absence.\nRoberto Pereyra started on the left but failed to assert himself as the obvious replacement for Deulofeu, while Ismaila Sarr was unable to have the same devastating influence on the right as he did at Vicarage Road last week.\nOn recent evidence, club-record signing Sarr could well be the spark of quality that pulls Watford to safety - the 22-year-old recording two goals and one assist against Liverpool - but his crosses struggled to find team-mates, while goal-scoring opportunities were few and far-between for the Senegalese winger against Palace.\nDeeney attempted to single-handedly pull his side level, a great strike from distance drawing Guaita into a great save, but substitute forwards Danny Welbeck, Ignacio Pussetto and Andre Gray failed to have an influence.\n\"We have missed an opportunity in many ways. We had lots of good situations to get shots away when we were actually trying to score the perfect goal. It's frustrating because we've played pretty well today and it's not gone our way,\" said manager Pearson.\n\"It is a disappointment but at least I can look back at it and know the players have been positive again. We've worked exceptionally hard. The players know they've done okay today but have not maximised the chances we had.\"\nMan of the match - Cheikhou Kouyate (Crystal Palace)\nAyew's earliest - the stats\nCrystal Palace have won three consecutive Premier League games without conceding for the first time since March 2017. The third game of that run was also a 1-0 home win against Watford.\nWatford have failed to score in a league-high 13 different Premier League games this season.\nThere were eight yellow cards in this match. Only the nine during Arsenal against Chelsea in December has seen more in the Premier League this season.\nCrystal Palace striker Ayew's eighth Premier League goal of the season mean he has scored more than in any of his previous campaigns.\nAyew's 24th Premier League goal overall came in the 28th minute, his earliest ever strike in the competition.\nBenteke was involved in 60% of Crystal Palace's 10 shots in this match (two shots, four chances created).\nWhat's next?\nWatford host Leicester City next Saturday (12:30 GMT), while Crystal palace travel to face Bournemouth later that day (15:00 GMT)."

He made some really important saves for us and we're delighted to have him.\"\nWhile the Blades are now two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, who play on Sunday, the defeat leaves Norwich still six points adrift of safety at the bottom of the table.\nThe Canaries claimed their first win in five league games against Leicester last Friday before knocking Tottenham out of the FA Cup in midweek, but they now have just nine games to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.\nCould Dean Henderson be England's Euros keeper?\nRelive the action as the Blades beat Norwich\nHenderson shows England class\nBoth clubs returned to the Premier League this season after Norwich edged the Yorkshire club to the Championship title.\nWhile both sides have kept faith with the playing style and many of the players that got them promoted, they have had contrasting fortunes in the top flight.\nThe Blades have been this season's surprise package in the Premier League, helped in no small part by the form of Henderson, who also spent last term on loan at Bramall Lane.\nThe former England Under-21 keeper had no opportunity to show his England class against the Canaries until his late interventions.\nIt seemed Norwich were destined to equalise when substitute Vrancic slid in as Godfrey headed goalwards from a corner but Henderson saved the initial effort then showed quick reflexes to palm the ball away as the prone Bosnia midfielder nudged the rebound towards the net with his knee.\nA combination of Henderson and David McGoldrick blocked Josip Drmic's follow-up, then five minutes from time the keeper was at his best again to block a firmly struck volley by Lewis.\nThe saves ensured United held on for a deserved win, with Oli McBurnie and John Lundstram going close to adding to Sharp's goal, which came after Lundstram delivered a fine cross for the unmarked striker to head home.\nBlades boss Wilder has joked the team's end-of-season trip to Magaluf is the only continental trip he has on his mind but European football looks likely for his side next season - and before then Henderson could easily be off to the Euros with England.\nSame old problem for Canaries\nWith 15 games left and Norwich six points from safety, boss Daniel Farke has said it would take \"maybe a miracle\" to avoid relegation.\nThey picked up four points from their next five games thanks to last Friday's win over Leicester, and kept the feel-good factor going as 9,000 travelling fans watched them knock Spurs out of the FA Cup on penalties.\nFarke reverted to the side that started the Leicester win and the Canaries had a good chance to open the scoring when Teemu Pukki volleyed against the outside of the post from close range following an early corner.\nBut it was the same old problem for Norwich as they continued to produce nice passing moves and enjoy the majority of possession without creating enough chances.\nThe introduction of Swiss striker Drmic for Todd Cantwell at half-time saw them go more direct in the second half and that led to the late chances.\nIt suggested the Norfolk side might be wise to continue that more robust approach in a bid to preserve their top-flight status with a late run of positive results.\nMan of the match - Dean Henderson (Sheffield United)\n'It's dramatic and tragic' - what they said\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder: \"The wheels haven't fallen off again today. I don't know if they are going to in the future but they're showing no signs of it at the moment. It was a gritty performance, we just felt we were a bit better than them in both boxes.\n\"They played the second half with nothing to lose, a dangerous shape, and caused us a few problems. Thankfully my goalkeeper's made a couple of saves.\n\"Billy Sharp didn't play a lot of football before Christmas but understood there would be an opportunity for him and he kept training well. He looked after himself and he's reaping the rewards.\"\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke: \"We should have been in the lead after Teemu's shot. Then there were 20 minutes when they put a lot of pressure on us and we reacted the wrong way. We sat deeper and deeper, and that's exactly what you can't do against Sheffield United.\n\"We showed great character in the second half and I still can't explain how the ball didn't go in during that situation. It's dramatic and tragic for the lads, because they tried everything.\n\"If there was an equaliser in the second half everyone would say 'great point away', especially after this week. It's a big setback in the fight to stay in this league but it's also important not to lose nerve and to stay calm.\"\nBlades looking Sharp - the stats\nSheffield United have won home and away against Norwich in a single league season for the first time since 1938-39 in the second tier.\nUnited have lost just two of their last 11 Premier League home games (W6, D3), winning two of their last three.\nBilly Sharp has netted twice in his last three Premier League games after scoring just once in his first 17.\nSharp has scored four goals in his last three league appearances against Norwich, including in each of his last two at Bramall Lane.\nNorwich have won fewer away points in the Premier League this season than any other side (six).\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United are away to Newcastle in the Premier League next Saturday while Norwich host Southampton (both 15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 Tottenham: Sean Dyche frustrated after Clarets not given penalty\nSean Dyche fears football is in \"dangerous territory\" after his Burnley side were denied a penalty in their draw with Tottenham.\nThe Clarets boss felt Chris Wood should have been given a penalty after Spurs' equaliser, but the striker did not go down under Davinson Sanchez's tackle.\nIn the end, Dele Alli's penalty after Wood's opener was enough to earn Tottenham a point.\n\"The game has got to be really careful now with which way it is going,\" said Dyche.\n\"If he [Wood] flails his arms and goes flying across the floor, I bet he gives it.\"\nDyche added: \"We are in dangerous territory here because if a player doesn't dramatically play act for a penalty, he doesn't get it.\n\"Chris did the right thing and stayed on his feet.\"\nThe Clarets took a deserved first-half lead when Wood tapped home the rebound after Hugo Lloris had spilled Jay Rodriguez's long-range shot.\nAt that stage, Jose Mourinho's side looked completely out of sorts but the half-time introduction of Lucas Moura and Giovani lo Celso sparked the visitors.\nIt was Lo Celso's superb through ball that forced a rash challenge on Eric Lamela by Ben Mee and Alli scored from the penalty spot for his 50th Premier League goal.\nIn a frantic finish, Lo Celso almost scored with a curling 20-yard effort before Lloris denied Matej Vydra from point-blank range.\nThe result means Tottenham have now gone five games without a win in all competitions - their worst run since they went seven without a victory in the autumn of 2016.\nTottenham's top-four struggle\nDele's goal was his first in nine matches in all competitions.\nThe England man was used as a central striker by boss Jose Mourinho, who is trying to find a solution to the lack of striking options at his disposal following the injuries to Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\nDele looked more of a threat once Mourinho changed the shape of his side at the break but he lacks the physical presence to unsettle Burnley's defensive pair Mee and James Tarkowski. Mee in particular was a commanding presence once Tottenham sorted themselves out after the break and ensured goalkeeper Nick Pope was not truly tested.\nThe result leaves Tottenham four points behind Chelsea, having played a game more. Unless there is a swift reversal of fortunes, their four-year run of top-four finishes will come to an end this season.\nDier in the spotlight\nPredictably, Eric Dier strode into Turf Moor without a word, which was a wise choice given he still has the possibility of an FA charge hanging over him following his confrontation in the stands after Tottenham's FA Cup defeat by Norwich on Wednesday.\nJust as he promised, Mourinho picked the England man, who slotted into the middle of a three-man central defence that also included Toby Alderweireld and Davinson Sanchez.\nEqually predictable were the Burnley fans' unsavoury chants against him, or more accurately, his brother. Before and afterwards, the Tottenham fans sang in support of the 26-year-old.\nIt was just Dier's luck that when he really wanted a quiet game, it was his clearance that resulted in Burnley's first-half goal.\nIn fairness, Dwight McNeil's cross had to be cleared. Sadly for Dier, it went straight to Rodriguez, allowing the Burnley striker to get enough power into his first-time shot to make it awkward for Lloris, who gifted Wood his goal.\nDier's evening did improve, particularly after Mourinho's double change at half-time, which involved moving him into central midfield. Had it not been for Dier's superbly-timed tackle on Burnley substitute Vydra, Tottenham may well not have come away with anything from the game.\nDyche's VAR observations\nDyche used his programme notes to add his thoughts to the general debate about the video assistant referee system.\nThe Burnley boss is supportive of VAR, saying he is \"convinced it will become more streamlined the more the powers-that-be get used to the technology\".\nThere will always be grey areas though. If McNeil's cross had gone straight to Wood, any goal would have been disallowed because the ball struck the winger's hand after a ricochet off Sanchez. However, because it was initially cleared, the infringement did not count.\nBurnley have nudged back into the top half of the table- and are unbeaten in the past 14 Premier League matches in which they have led at the break.\nMan of the match - Ben Mee (Burnley)\n'We are not the real deal yet' - what they said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"A very rare mistake from Ben Mee and you wonder how it would affect things, but we gripped the game and I was really pleased with it.\n\"We build slowly, we are not the real deal yet. But I think everyone saw a good Burnley side here.\n\"In the second half, the referee changed his performance. Everything was given for very little, after their staff had a word coming off at half-time.\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho: \"The quality of Lucas Moura and Giovani lo Celso made a difference in the second half. I want to say but cannot say. We had something in the first half, not in the second.\n\"In the second we improved a lot. I think fatigue, Lucas and Lo Celso, Alli and Bergwijn had fatigue - they gave what you saw.\nWood hits new heights - the stats\nThis was the 100th league meeting between Burnley and Spurs, and the 25th draw. Spurs have won 39 games to Burnley's 36.\nOnly Liverpool (48) and Manchester City (32) have earned more points than Spurs since Jose Mourinho's first game in charge in November (27 - tied with Wolves).\nBurnley have failed to win a Premier League game at Turf Moor despite scoring the opening goal for the first time since December 2018 against Liverpool (1-3) - they had won 11 games in a row from such a position.\nThere were nine yellow cards in this match - the joint-most in a single Premier League game this season (level with Arsenal v Chelsea in December).\nDele Alli became the seventh player to reach 50 Premier League goals for Spurs - only Harry Kane (23 years 44 days) reached this milestone at a younger age for the club than Alli (23 years 331 days).\nBen Mee has given away five penalties in the Premier League in his career, at least three more than any other Burnley player.\nChris Wood has netted 11 league goals this season, his best-ever top-flight campaign. Wood is the third Burnley player to net more than 10 times in a Premier League campaign after Ashley Barnes last season (12) and Danny Ings in 2014-15 (11).\nMourinho has only faced Swansea City as many times in the Premier League without losing as he has Burnley (nine each).\nWhat next?\nBurnley's next Premier League game is away at Manchester City on Saturday, 14 March (15:00 GMT). Tottenham entertain Manchester United the following day (16:30 GMT) but before that, they will try to overturn RB Leipzig's one-goal first-leg advantage when they go to Germany for their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday, 10 March (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 4-0 Everton: Hosts ruin Carlo Ancelotti's return\nCarlo Ancelotti endured a miserable return to Stamford Bridge as Chelsea thrashed his Everton side to boost their top-four Premier League hopes.\nHelped by the inclusion of 18-year-old Billy Gilmour, who made his full Premier League debut, Chelsea started the game with a far greater tempo and went ahead after 14 minutes when Mason Mount ended an 18-game goal drought by firing past Jordan Pickford at his near post.\nPedro then latched on to a superb through ball by Ross Barkley to score his first league goal of the season as Frank Lampard's side took control.\nEverton had a chance to strike back five minutes later but top scorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin duffed a shot with only Kepa Arrizabalaga to beat.\nTwo goals in the space of three minutes shortly after the break ended the game as a contest as Willian found the bottom corner with a low shot and Olivier Giroud continued his renaissance with a tap-in from a short corner. \nEverton have been in form since Ancelotti's first game in charge on 26 December, during which time they have picked up 18 points. \nBut this was a desperately disappointing day for the Italian on his return to the club where he won the league and FA Cup double in 2009-10.\nThe result meant Everton remain 12th, eight points behind fifth-placed Manchester United, while Chelsea stay fourth, three points ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men.\nIncluding two wins over Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho, Lampard now has three victories over former Chelsea managers this season as fans serenaded him with \"super Frank\" from all four sides of the stadium.\nChelsea boosted by Gilmour's influence\nGilmour's first Premier League start came after a man-of-the-match performance in their FA Cup fifth-round win over Liverpool on Tuesday.\nThat game appeared to give the club a lift after a disappointing run of one win in six league matches, and the glow continued against Everton.\nGilmour offers a quicker alternative to Jorginho, suspended for this game, at the base of their midfield, and the young Scot seemed to have an effect on those in front of him, who played with extra vigour.\nMount had already tested Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who had a very good game, before he scored.\nBut he celebrated his sixth goal of the season with genuine relief after struggling to match his early-season form in the past couple of months.\nPickford, who was criticised after conceding against Manchester United last Sunday, made another smart save from Willian, but could do little when Barkley proved a point to the booing Everton fans by slicing his former team open for Pedro to score his first league goal in 13 months.\nAside from Calvert-Lewin's chance, which came from a mix-up between Marcos Alonso and Kurt Zouma, Chelsea continued to press for a third.\nAnd they wasted little time after the break in extending their lead as Willian scored his seventh of the season with a superb strike and Giroud showed his quality at the point of Chelsea's attack with his second goal in three league games.\nSuch was Chelsea's dominance that they could afford to hand Premier League debuts to teenagers Tino Anjorin and Armando Broja off the bench.\nFor Lampard and Chelsea, it was one of those games where everything clicked.\nThe only concern was for Mount, who came off after appearing to suffer the effects of a heavy Everton challenge early in the second half.\nAncelotti's nightmare reunion\nAncelotti admitted he would be \"emotional\" on his return to west London after spending two seasons with the club.\nDespite being sacked for finishing second in the league following his Double-winning campaign, the Italian said he had an \"unbelievable\" time at Chelsea, and he could have used the same word on Sunday, but for altogether different reasons.\nHis appointment has been greeted with enthusiasm and delight by Everton fans, and he was cheered by Chelsea supporters before the game.\nBut that mood was brought crashing down to earth as the visitors were outclassed. In fact, had it not been for Pickford, the scoreline could have been even worse.\nSimilar to their draw with Manchester United, Everton started poorly, but at least there was a second-half upturn at Goodison Park. Here there was no improvement after the break.\nHaving opted to play Bernard on their right side, Ancelotti appeared to undo that decision by changing formation midway through the first half with the Brazilian midfielder being replaced at half-time by Theo Walcott.\nThat change had little time to have an effect as six minutes after the interval Everton found themselves further behind.\nAncelotti's side have been unbeaten at home since he took over, but they have now lost three league games on their travels and their midfield looked slow in comparison to Chelsea's.\nCalvert-Lewin was also outmuscled by Zouma at times and, after scoring eight goals in his last 10 league games, he had an off day which summed up Everton's afternoon.\nIt leaves the Toffees, who have not earned an away clean sheet since the opening day of the season, struggling to reach their Europa League target with games against rivals Wolves, Tottenham and Sheffield United to come.\nIt was also the first time they had failed to score in 12 games under Ancelotti, who still has plenty of work to do to turn them into European contenders this season or next.\nMan of the Match - Billy Gilmour (Chelsea)\n'I was so sad, everything was wrong' - what they said\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard: \"We have injuries but that gives opportunity so we don't want to moan, especially when Billy Gilmour plays how he plays, and Ross Barkley and Mason Mount, and the collective of the team.\n\"It reminded me of some of the performances we have lost at home this season - lots of good play and chances but we haven't taken them. We can reflect on this, what we did, and it was comfortable.\"\nLampard on Giroud, Pedro and Willian: \"They are very good players. Everyone speaks about youth but we need experienced players. Oli come into the team and gets his goal. He is a great team-mate. I am really pleased there is a mix in this squad and those boys were really good today.\"\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti: \"It's very disappointing. This is the first time I was so sad for the performance of the team. Everything was wrong. We were not good defensively, lost a lot of duels, were not compact and did a lot of mistakes.\n\"It is a little bit strange. We did well against Manchester United and competed against Arsenal and Manchester City. It is really strange but we have to analyse this and try to do better.\"\nPedro back in form - the stats\nChelsea have scored 21 goals via English players in the Premier League this season - only Leicester City (31) and Southampton (24) have had more.\nPedro scored and assisted in the first 21 minutes of this game - he had only been involved in two goals in his previous 21 Premier League matches.\nPedro has ended on the winning side in all 24 matches at Stamford Bridge in which he has scored.\nChelsea used three 18-year-olds in this game - Gilmour, Anjorin and Broja - becoming the first team to field three players aged 18 or younger in the same Premier League game since May 2016, when West Brom drew 1-1 with Liverpool.\nEverton had just three shots - their fewest in a Premier League game since December 2017 against Liverpool (also three).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Aston Villa in the Premier League next Saturday (17:30 GMT) while Everton host Merseyside rivals Liverpool on Monday, 16 March (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Man Utd 2-0 Man City: Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay score in derby win\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said it is a \"privilege\" to manage his players as they completed the Premier League double over derby rivals Manchester City for the first time in a decade.\nThis thunderous encounter was a personal nightmare for Manchester City's normally reliable Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson, who gifted Solskjaer's side both goals in sharply contrasting fashion.\nHe allowed Anthony Martial's routine shot to squirm under his body from a quick Bruno Fernandes free-kick on the half-hour and then, with seconds left, threw a clearance straight to Scott McTominay, who showed great technique to send a long-range finish, struck first time, into the net in front of a delirious Stretford End.\nIt is a win that leaves Liverpool - who now have a 25-point lead at the top of the table - requiring only two more wins to secure their first league title for 30 years and Manchester United only three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, after their first derby league double since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.\nCity hotly contested the free-kick, given by referee Mike Dean for a foul by Ilkay Gundogan on Fernandes, that led to Martial's goal - although United also felt they were denied a penalty when Fred was booked for diving after tangling with Nicolas Otamendi.\nSergio Aguero had a goal ruled out for offside by VAR and even though City enjoyed the greater share of possession, United sealed a crucial win with McTominay's strike to take their unbeaten run to 10 games in all competitions.\n\"It's a privilege to be their manager,\" Solskjaer told BBC Sport. \"They give absolutely everything. They know they are all good players but they want to learn as well.\n\"We feel we are improving as a squad and a team. We feel the fans want us to do well and they see what we are doing, so it is getting better and better.\n\"But we are still fifth. We need points to catch Chelsea and Leicester, so need to keep plugging away.\"\nSolskjaer sensing top-four finish\nThe jubilant scenes and the sound of his name echoing around Old Trafford at the final whistle will have been music to the ears of Manchester United manager Solskjaer.\nThe Norwegian, still to convince many of his suitability for the giant task of turning Manchester United's fortunes around, has now enjoyed three wins over Pep Guardiola and Manchester City this season - and this was surely the most satisfying day of the season at 'The Theatre Of Dreams'.\nUnited may still be light years away from the glory days of old but victories such as this sustain hope, and the atmosphere inside Old Trafford as Solskjaer's side first held on to their advantage and then sealed the win was reminiscent of days gone by.\nManchester City may have enjoyed the greater share of possession but United showed great resilience and always carried a threat on the break.\nFernandes once again confirmed what a shrewd piece of business his signing was from Sporting Lisbon - although why wait so late in the window to sign him? - and why he is already a hero to United's fans.\nThe Portuguese has that touch of class and creativity while United had another outstanding performer in defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who won his battle with Raheem Sterling as he hounded the England star for 90 minutes and beyond.\nManchester United, who have looked off the top four for so much of the time this season, are now right in the fight and credit must be given to the manager who has helped fashion this impressive run.\n\"We feel we are improving all the time. We know we lack one, two, three players to be considered a title contender and some experience,\" said Solskjaer. \"We are just going to start talking about going up the table, getting more points.\n\"Chelsea and Leicester are too far ahead for my liking.\"\nEderson's day to forget\nManchester City's defeat is hardly damaging in the context of their Premier League title defence - that was lost to Liverpool a long time ago.\nGuardiola's concern, and admittedly he was without his star player Kevin de Bruyne, will be that once again his side had plenty of possession but did not create enough, not showing enough urgency until it was too late.\nAnd he will be concerned by the performance of goalkeeper Ederson, who was over-confident throughout and paid a heavy price.\nEderson was not only badly at fault for both goals but almost gave away another when he allowed a routine pass to roll under his foot at the Stretford End, resulting in a desperate tackle on Martial almost on the goalline to spare his embarrassment.\nGuardiola will be additionally unhappy about this defeat, not least because it was City's seventh of the Premier League campaign, making 2019-20 the season in which he has lost the most league games in his managerial career.\nCity now face home games against Arsenal and Burnley to get themselves in shape for the Champions League last-16 second leg meeting with Real Madrid, in which they hold a precious 2-1 advantage from the first leg in the Bernabeu.\nGuardiola will hope Ederson has got this carelessness and over-confidence out of his system.\nMan of the match - Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Man Utd)\n'It was a good performance', says Guardiola\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola to BBC Match of the Day: \"We played good, we missed a little in the final third but the second half was better and it was a good performance.\n\"We play the same way, tried the press and defend well and we did well.\n\"Our game is there, we played really good in terms of coming here. They wait and did long balls on the counter-attack for Daniel James and Anthony Martial.\n\"We did our game but unfortunately we conceded a goal. They waited for our mistakes.\"\nUnited's best run since Solskjaer's start - match stats\nUnited are unbeaten in their last 10 games (W7 D3); their longest run without defeat since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first 11 games in charge.\nThis is the second time in Pep Guardiola's managerial career that he has suffered three defeats against a specific opponent in a single season (also versus Liverpool in 2017-18).\nAnthony Martial is only the second United player to score in three consecutive Premier League starts in Manchester derbies, and the first since Eric Cantona netted in five in a row between March 1993 and April 1996.\nSince making his debut in the competition on 1 February, United's Bruno Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals in the Premier League than any other player (five - two goals and three assists).\nManchester City's Raheem Sterling became the fourth youngest player to reach 250 appearances in the Premier League, after Wayne Rooney, James Milner and Gareth Barry.\nWhat's next?\nCity host Arsenal on Wednesday at 19:30 GMT in a rearranged Premier League fixture, with United going to LASK in Austria in the Europa League the following day (17:55 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 4-0 Aston Villa: Jamie Vardy scores twice in big win\nLeicester City manager Brendan Rodgers thought his side looked back to their best as Jamie Vardy ended his goal drought in their convincing win over Aston Villa.\nThe Foxes had only picked up two wins in their past eight Premier League games - and two points in their past four matches.\nThey led through Harvey Barnes' goal after the winger took advantage of visiting keeper Pepe Reina's baffling decision to run out of his box.\nVardy's first touch after coming on was to score a penalty after Tyrone Mings' handball, before he smashed in at the near post - his first goal in 10 games.\nBarnes scored his second from a Marc Albrighton cross.\n\"It was a very, very good win. An important win,\" said Rodgers. \"The past few games we haven't been at our level. In terms of attacking, we were much better this evening. After the first goal we went on and played very well.\n\"We want to win and early on you could see our confidence wasn't where it has been. The only way you regain that confidence is hard work and these players have been brilliant. Tonight the intensity was there and we didn't give away too much.\"\nDean Smith's Villa remain in the relegation zone after a fourth consecutive league defeat, and a fifth in all competitions.\n\"Individual mistakes are costing us. We need to get better at it. Teams capitalise on our errors,\" said Smith.\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nFootball Daily podcast: Has Vardy ruined Villa's Premier League party?\nPremier League predictions: How did singer Tom Grennan get on against Lawro?\nVardy back with a bang\nLeicester had missed Vardy for a couple of weeks with a calf injury, but really they had been missing his goals since 21 December when he last scored against Manchester City.\nSince then he had gone nine games in league and cup without scoring - although he remains the top scorer in the Premier League, now with 19 goals.\nFoxes manager Brendan Rodgers said it was no coincidence their recent blip - two points from four games - came during midfielder Wilfried Ndidi's absence. Ndidi was back, and so too is Vardy.\nLeicester were already ahead when the 33-year-old Englishman replaced Kelechi Iheanacho after 59 minutes. The first thing he did was slot a spot-kick down the centre after Mings had been penalised for handball.\nThe ball appeared to hit centre-back Mings' shoulder - but the decision stood after a check by the video assistant referee. Smith fumed afterwards at a \"very, very harsh\" decision that killed the game.\nVardy only had seven touches of the ball - but two of them were goals. His second arrived after his attempted cross had come back to him, allowing him to rifle past Reina at his near post.\nThat was a particularly impressive goal, starting with defender Jonny Evans winning the ball outside his own box before he played it forward to Barnes, who found Vardy.\n\"Vardy looked bright in his running and his movement was very good,\" said Rodgers. \"He's struggled since December with injuries, but he looked all over it.\"\nLeicester's fourth gave them a scoreline their performance deserved - Barnes, who merited his second goal for an industrious performance, blasting home from Albrighton's cross.\nRodgers said: \"Harvey has got a very bright future. He's been getting better, his intensity and hunger to get in and score is what we've spoken about, and now he gets in there regularly and he's getting goals. I'm delighted for him.\"\nThe result boosts Leicester's Champions League chances, with the 2016 title-winners sitting eight points above fifth-placed Manchester United with nine matches remaining.\nReina error increases Villa's problems\nVilla's cup keeper Orjan Nyland played well in their Carabao Cup final defeat by Manchester City last Sunday and there was some talk that he could keep his place instead of Reina being recalled. Manager Smith may wish he had done just that.\nLeicester were already on top without finding the breakthrough when Reina decided to run about 20 yards outside his penalty area in an attempt to cut out Albrighton's long ball to Barnes. Why he did so was a mystery, with several defenders running back into position.\nBarnes took advantage by nipping the ball past the Spaniard - the oldest player to make an error leading to a goal in the Premier League this season - before scoring past two defenders on the line from 20 yards.\n\"Pepe came out for a ball he wasn't going to get and made Barnes' goal easy,\" said Smith. \"One of my biggest regrets was how we gave the ball away so cheaply against a team who want the football.\n\"We've probably made more individual errors than anyone his season.\"\nVilla had a glorious chance to move out of the relegation zone with none of the five teams above them winning this weekend. They had a bright start at the King Power Stadium with Conor Hourihane and Mbwana Samatta going close to getting on the end of set-pieces.\nBut that was their best spell of the game and Frederic Guilbert's 78th-minute effort, which was easily held by Kasper Schmeichel, was their only shot on target.\nVilla have lost all five games since beating Leicester in the EFL Cup semi-finals. They will need to improve drastically if they are to stay in the Premier League, especially as their next four games are against sides currently in the top six - Chelsea, Wolves, Liverpool and Manchester City.\nMan of the match - Harvey Barnes (Leicester)\nAlbrighton matches Mahrez total - match stats\nLeicester have scored four or more goals home and away against the same side in a top-flight season for the first time since 1967-68 against Southampton.\nVilla remain the only side in this Premier League season yet to register an away clean sheet.\nThe Foxes secured their first win in five league games (D2 L2), their last victory coming on 22 January against West Ham\nAston Villa players have made 10 errors leading to goals in the Premier League this season - more than any other side in the competition.\nKasper Schmeichel became only the fourth Danish player to hit the 200-game mark in the Premier League, after Thomas Soensen (364), his father Peter Schmeichel (310) and Christian Eriksen (226).\nMarc Albrighton now has as many Premier League assists as Riyad Mahrez for Leicester City (27). Only Jamie Vardy (28) and Steve Guppy (34) have more for the club.\nVardy is now the division's outright top scorer this season (19) after ending a run of 644 minutes without finding the net in the league.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester visit Watford in the league for the 12:30 GMT kick-off on Saturday, with Aston Villa hosting Chelsea at 17:30."

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 0-0 Sheffield United: Goalless draw on Premier League return\nThe Premier League made its return after a 100-day absence as Aston Villa and Sheffield United played out a goalless draw in a match memorable for powerful statements before kick-off - and a major technology controversy.\nAs the action resumed behind closed doors at a largely deserted Villa Park, the players of both sides and officials took a knee for 10 seconds immediately before kick-off in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThis was preceded by a minute's silence in memory of those who have died as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\nWhen the game got under way in this new environment, Sheffield United were the victims of a serious first-half injustice when Villa keeper Orjan Nyland fell behind his goalline clutching Oliver Norwood's free-kick in the 41st minute, only for referee Michael Oliver's watch to fail to signal a goal.\nIt was the pivotal moment of an affair high on endeavour but low on quality that at least represented the success of 'Project Restart' after the season was halted because of the global coronavirus crisis, bringing a result that was arguably more satisfactory for the visitors.\nVilla - who were thwarted by some fine saves from United keeper Dean Henderson - will feel an opportunity has been missed, while a point for the Blades leaves them four points from Chelsea in fourth place.\nThere was, at least, a sense of relief that domestic football was finally up and running once more.\nFootball Daily: The Premier League takes a knee, and the 'ghost goal'\nPlayers and staff take a knee\nPowerful moments amid 'the new normal'\nThe silence enforced on this occasion by circumstances, with barely 300 people inside this vast Villa Park stadium, only added to the powerful moments that took place before kick-off.\nAfter a minute's silence in memory of those who have died as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, players and officials took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement at the sound of Oliver's whistle.\nIt was a truly atmospheric moment amid a game lacking the theatre and soundtrack traditionally provided by fans, while players also had Black Lives Matter printed across the back of their shirts where their names would usually be.\nAston Villa did their best to build the tension with a bombastic pre-match play-list and theatrical announcements of the home team line-up, but there is no doubt the so-called \"new normal\" will take some getting used to and may never be to the taste of many traditionalists.\nThis, however, is the current reality in the middle of a global crisis and there was no lack of effort, endeavour - or noise - from two highly-committed sets of players.\nChris Wilder was the more vocal and visible manager in his technical area and, for all the restrictions, the physical challenges were as committed as ever.\nThis alien environment will need acclimatisation from the players themselves, as well as all those in and around the other parts of the game. Muscle memory kicks in but there is no question the absence of a crowd and the flow of adrenaline that provides may take some getting used to, so there may well be something of a transitional period.\nWelcome back technology\nThose who have missed Premier League football so much during its 100-day hiatus may even have been tempted to greet the return of the video assistant referee (VAR) and goalline technology as old friends rather than the unwanted distraction that made them a target for such criticism before the campaign was halted.\nDo not tell that to Sheffield United.\nThe Blades were denied a clear goal when Villa keeper Nyland carried Norwood's free-kick behind the line.\nUnited's players were incredulous when the goal was not given, Oliver pointing to his watch to insist he had received no signal that the ball had crossed the line. It later became clear that he should have been alerted but was not and VAR was unable to intervene.\nSadly, a failure of technology meant a serious injustice was done on the Premier League's big comeback night.\nHenderson shows his class\nHenderson's reputation has soared during his loan spell at Sheffield United from Manchester United - and it is easy to see why Wilder was delighted the 23-year-old is staying with the Blades until the end of the season.\nHe has calm command and produced the goods when called upon with some fine saves, including from Conor Hourihane, Keinan Davis and John McGinn.\nThere was plenty of endeavour but not huge amounts of quality, with Villa probably regretting their failure to make the most of some early chances, especially when Davis headed over from under the bar after a corner.\nUnited, as ever, were resilient and showed the grit they have demonstrated throughout this excellent season.\nAnd, when this first Premier League game back is analysed, they will have every right to curse the failure of technology we have been led to believe we can rely on.\nFootball is back - with all its qualities and faults.\nMan of the match - Dean Henderson\n'I think the keeper was in the Holte End' - manager reaction\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder: \"I think the goalkeeper was in the Holte End when he caught it - or dragged it back. My issue is obviously one of frustration. Seven cameras haven't picked it up - the most technical league in the world - everything we see at every angle and it hasn't seen a goal. That is disappointing from our point of view.\n\"I did have a laugh and joke beforehand that we have had some poor decisions go against us and I said I wouldn't bet against one going against us this evening.\n\"We were waiting for somebody at Stockley Park to show a bit of courage and say they will make that decision, but if they've not seen it and seven cameras haven't seen it I suppose they will say that it was not their decision to make.\n\"It was a really strange afternoon and evening. Quite difficult as well. We should never underestimate the effect of playing in front of supporters. That was quite difficult for both sets of players. Most times we would be talking about a pretty average game but we are not, we are talking about a decision that has affected the result.\"\nThe best of the stats\nToday's meeting between Aston Villa and Sheffield United was the first English top-flight game to be played in the month of June since Sheffield United beat Stoke 2-1, on the 14th June 1947.\nAston Villa have lost just one of their eight Premier League games against Sheffield United (W5 D2), a 0-2 defeat in this season's reverse fixture at Bramall Lane.\nSheffield United are the first side to stop Aston Villa from scoring at home in the Premier League since West Ham in September 2019 (0-0), ending their run of scoring in 10 consecutive league games at Villa Park.\nSheffield United have won 44 points from their opening 29 Premier League games this season; the highest points tally in the competition by a newly promoted side at this stage of a season since Birmingham City in 2009-10 (also 44 pts).\nAston Villa's Jack Grealish has won more fouls this season (131) than any other player in a single Premier League campaign since Opta started recording such data (1998-99).\nNo goalkeeper has kept more Premier League clean sheets this season than Sheffield United's Dean Henderson (11, also Burnley's Nick Pope).\nConor Hourihane created seven chances for his Aston Villa teammates in this game, the joint most by a Villa player in a Premier League game this season (Jack Grealish also seven vs Southampton in December 2019).\nSheffield United's Jack Robinson made his second ever Premier League start in this game, nine years & 55 days after making his first start in the competition, for Liverpool against Birmingham in April 2011 - the second longest gap between a player's first two Premier League starts and the longest for an outfield player."

De Bruyne was the best player on the pitch.\nThe Manchester City midfielder, widely regarded as one of the best in the business, reminded those watching at home of his quality with several intricate passes in the first half.\nHe forced the first save of the match from Leno with a curling free-kick in the first three minutes and two of his defence-splitting passes again tested the keeper's reactions half an hour later.\nIt was ironic one of his poorer passes would lead to Sterling's opener - helped by Luiz's poor control - but De Bruyne stamped his mark on the game even further by scoring City's second from the spot.\nHe needed only 69 minutes to whet the appetite of those who feared football would not be the same on its return.\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We are really concerned [about Eric Garcia]. He responded quite well but we have to wait. He is conscious which is a good sign. We will make another test.\n\"In the beginning it was a lot of energy. Everybody wanted the ball. It was not quiet. We had chances. It was important to score before half time. I am happy with the performance of the team.\"\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports: \"Everything went wrong from the first minute. Every possible accident that could have happened hopefully happened today.\n\"[David Luiz] is someone that is very honest and straight forward. My opinion on David Luiz hasn't changed. It won't change because he had a difficult performance tonight.\nOn leaving Mesut Ozil out of the squad: \"It was a tactical reason.\"\nPlayer of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nSterling hits 50 - the best of the stats\nManchester City have won their past seven matches against Arsenal in all competitions, extending their best ever winning run against the Gunners.\nArsenal have lost by three or more goals both home and away in a league season versus an opponent (Man City in 2019-20) for the first time since 1969-70, against Chelsea.\nArsenal are winless in their past 26 Premier League away games against fellow 'big six' opposition (D10 L16), with their last such victory coming at Etihad Stadium in January 2015 (2-0).\nKevin de Bruyne has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other player this season (25 - nine goals and 16 assists) - it's also his best goal involvement tally in a single top-flight campaign in England.\nRaheem Sterling became the first player to score a goal in the month of June in the English top-flight since Walter Rickett, for Sheffield United against Stoke on 14 June, 1947.\nSterling also scored in his 50th home club game in all competitions - he's never been on the losing side in those fixtures for Liverpool and Manchester City (W47 D3).\nDavid Luiz became the first player to be sent off, concede a penalty and commit an error leading to an opposition goal in a Premier League match since Carl Jenkinson for West Ham against Bournemouth in August 2015.\nHe has conceded four penalties in the Premier League this season - the joint-most in a single campaign in the competition's history (also Jose Fonte 2016-17, Gary Caldwell 2011-12, Ibrahima Sonko 2007-08, Claus Lundekvam 1999-00, Ken Monkou 1993-94 and Luc Nijholt 1993-94)."

        "article_text": "Norwich 0-3 Southampton: Danny Ings scores as Norwich suffer crushing defeat\nThree second-half goals from Southampton condemned Norwich to their fourth defeat in five games, denting their hopes of Premier League survival.\nSaints top scorer Danny Ings curled in the opener shortly after half-time, before Stuart Armstrong doubled their lead five minutes later.\nNorwich looked lacklustre at an eerily empty Carrow Road, and Nathan Redmond confirmed a win for Southampton against his old club when he slotted into the bottom right corner late on.\nThe Canaries remain bottom of the table following a 104-day absence.\nAnd the time away from Premier League action, due to the coronavirus pandemic, did little to spark any signs of a comeback from Norwich, who have just eight games to claw back a six-point deficit on 17th-placed Watford above the relegation zone.\nIn the Premier League era, no team with 21 points or fewer after their 30th game of a season has survived the drop.\nIt was a positive performance from Southampton, who capitalised on the break, pressing high and taking advantage of space in behind the Canaries' defence.\nThe Saints move up into 13th place, and have opened up a 10-point gap on the bottom three, having played a game more than those hovering around the safety mark.\nHow to watch, listen to and follow every Premier League match\nRelive Southampton's victory over Norwich\nExperimental Norwich running out of time\nBefore the game, Norwich boss Daniel Farke said he believed five wins from their nine remaining fixtures would be enough to preserve their Premier League status.\nBut they remain six points from safety, with a goal difference considerably inferior to their rivals, and are still to travel to Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City in July.\nThis was a game against a side in the bottom half of the table which Farke would have been hoping to tick off as one of those five desired victories.\nHe experimented with their formation - starting Josip Drmic and Teemu Pukki up front together - but it did not pay off.\nPukki's superb pass set up Drmic in the first half but the Swiss international looked rusty throughout and he needed a touch too many to get the ball out from under his feet, wasting the opportunity.\nIt was met with a faded roar from the new television-enhanced crowd noise - something that became a common theme in the first half as the hosts probed but ultimately failed to create many clear-cut chances.\nAnd when Ings' effort curled in, early in the second half, Norwich never recovered, conceding again five minutes later. They remain the only top-flight club yet to earn a point from a losing position this season.\nIngs looks sharp on Saints return\nWhen the Premier League kicked off in August, Ings was in top form for Southampton, netting 10 goals in his first 15 starts following a \u00a320m move from Liverpool last summer.\nBut before the league was suspended, he had scored just once in seven games.\nThe break seemed to give him a boost because Ings came back looking sharp from the off.\nHe cracked the crossbar in the first half with a chance he would usually have buried, but he made no mistake second time around after the ball fell kindly for him in the box and he curled it past Tim Krul.\nMoments later, he set up Armstrong for Southampton's second.\nThe England striker's energy did not fade in the second half as Southampton looked fresh and full of running - even the extra yards needed to fetch the ball in the absence of familiar ball boys and girls, did not affect them.\n'The confidence was not there' - what they said\nNorwich head coach Daniel Farke: \"To concede two goals that quick in the second half was of course a defining moment in terms of confidence. We had setbacks we had to accept. The confidence was not there.\n\"It's important that you are effective. The situations before the two goals were ones you should not concede. We were just not willing enough to follow the movement.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"The start was not perfect. We had a few problems in the beginning but after that we won more duels and had better aggression. That was the key.\n\"In the second half we were more clinical and it was a deserved win from a very fit team. Danny Ings is a fantastic finisher when he is around the box. He is working very hard for the team. The key was our work against the ball. When we are pressing together it is not so easy to play against us.\"\n'There is no way back' - analysis\nConor McNamara, BBC Radio 5 Live commentator: \"After this I don't think Norwich are going to be good enough to stay in the Premier League. They had early opportunities but no composure in front of goal and then the belief just evaporated.\n\"Second half - I don't think embarrassing is too strong a description.\"\nChris Sutton, former Norwich striker on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Norwich are down, I don't think there is any way back. It is the nature of the defeat too, Southampton were a different class.\n\"Where do Norwich go from here? It doesn't look good for them, very, very difficult after this result to even contemplate staying in the Premier League.\"\nMan of the match - Danny Ings\nCanaries can't find the net - the best of the stats\nSouthampton recorded their biggest away Premier League win since beating Sunderland 4-0 at the Stadium of Light in February 2017.\nThey have taken 23 away Premier League points this season (W7 D2 L6) - only Chelsea (24), Man City (28) and Liverpool (37) have more in 2019-20.\nNorwich have failed to score in six of their last nine Premier League games (W2 D1 L6), netting only three goals in that time.\nOnly Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (17) and Jamie Vardy (19) have scored more Premier League goals than Ings (16) this season.\nNorwich manager Daniel Farke has lost 19 of his first 30 Premier League games (W5 D6) - only Graham Taylor (21) and Mick McCarthy (26) have lost more of their first 30 games in the competition.\nArmstrong has scored more Premier League goals in his last seven appearances (four) than in his first 44 (three).\nWhat's next?\nNorwich welcome Everton - and the live BBC TV cameras - to Carrow Road on Wednesday, 24 June (18:00 BST), while Southampton host Arsenal the following day (18:00)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Manchester United: Bruno Fernandes' late penalty earns visitors draw\nPaul Pogba returned to action for first time since 26 December to win the late penalty that earned Manchester United a crucial point at Tottenham Hotspur.\nPogba, who had not played for almost six months because of an ankle injury that needed surgery, emerged as a second-half substitute and demonstrated he has the creativity to make a difference as United battle for a place in the top four.\nUnited keeper David de Gea was badly at fault when he failed to stop Steven Bergwijn's powerful 27th-minute drive, so there was relief all-round for the visitors when Pogba surged into the area before he was hauled down clumsily by Eric Dier.\nIn the cavernous spaces of the deserted Tottenham Hotspur Stadium - as the match was played behind closed doors - Fernandes equalised with an emphatic penalty.\nSpurs survived a last-minute scare as referee Jon Moss pointed to the spot again when Dier collided with Fernandes but the video assistant referee correctly reversed a poor decision.\nDe Gea made a measure of amends with a superb save from Son Heung-min shortly after his error, while Hugo Lloris made a magnificent flying save from Anthony Martial as United chased an equaliser.\nIt finally arrived via that Fernandes spot-kick nine minutes from time to leave United in fifth place, four points ahead of Spurs.\nDe Gea and Maguire 'should get taxi back to Manchester'\nRelive the draw between Tottenham and Manchester United\nHow you rated the players\nPogba shows Solskjaer his class\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer kept faith with the side that went 11 games unbeaten in all competitions as their season restarted here in north London - which meant no place for Pogba, despite his recovery from injury.\nIt was no surprise, however, when he was called into action just after the hour to inject some zest into what had been a lifeless United performance up to that point.\nPogba was right in the fray, having a shot instantly - but he made his most significant contribution when he tricked Dier in the area and drew a foul from the Spurs defender to win that point-saving penalty.\nIt was a timely reminder to Solskjaer, should he even need one, of the rare talent he has at his disposal if Pogba could only show consistency and put the speculation about his future behind him.\nDe Gea did not have such a good night. There were already questions about his form before this game and he produced another error here - all with Dean Henderson's reputation growing in his loan spell at Sheffield United.\nFrustration for Mourinho\nSpurs will be bitterly disappointed to concede a goal so late on, and in such needless fashion, although it could have been worse when referee Moss erroneously awarded that second penalty - before VAR put matters right.\nLloris had produced that outstanding save from Martial but Spurs were hardly under siege and manager Jose Mourinho, who stalked the touchline in fury when United were originally awarded that injury-time penalty, will feel an important two points have been cast aside.\nMourinho will take some solace in the return of Harry Kane after hamstring surgery and Son after he broke his arm, as well as goalscorer Bergwijn.\nSpurs, however, need wins, and this result leaves them in eighth place, six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea in the chase for Champions League places.\nMan of the Match - Bruno Fernandes\n'A strange penalty'\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Radio 5 live: \"I think difficult to find the word, I have to try to find a nice word - a strange penalty because the team was so compact, so well organised.\n\"The players did fantastic work defensively - they had two dangerous shots that Hugo Lloris saved and nothing else. Everything else was under control. I have to admit for the last 15 minutes I would love to have had Lucas Moura here, Dele Alli here. The last 15 minutes were difficult for us.\n\"Lucas and Dele are players we need and we could feel that today. when you look to their bench and then to ours the difference in attacking options. Hopefully they will be back for West Ham because in this moment it is very, very important to change players.\nOn the penalty for Manchester United: \"Paul Pogba did his job. That is it. I think Jonathan Moss was also trying to do his job the best he could. I think the VAR is a different situation.\"\nManchester United on the spot again - the stats\nManchester United are unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions (W8 D4), scoring 30 goals and conceding just three in that run.\nSteven Bergwijn became only the second player to score in his first three home Premier League appearances for Spurs, after Rafael van der Vaart in 2010.\nSince the start of last season, Manchester United have both taken (23) and scored (16) more penalties than any other Premier League side.\nOnly Trent Alexander-Arnold (14) has more assists among Premier League defenders in all competitions than Spurs full-back Serge Aurier this season (eight).\nJose Mourinho has won none of his past six matches against his former clubs in all competitions (D2 L4), taking just one point from four Premier League matches against Chelsea and Man Utd this season (D1 L3).\nSpurs are winless in seven games in all competitions (D3 L4), their worst run since November 2016 (also seven without a win).\nWhat next?\nTottenham host West Ham in the Premier League on Tuesday, 23 June (20:15 BST) while Manchester United are at home to Sheffield United on Wednesday, 24 June (18:00 BST)."

It is not something we'd thrive on. We need to negotiate this period of time and as a football club we need to do what we can to retain our status.\"\nThe Hornets were led by captain Troy Deeney, who was late back to training after deciding he did not want to put his child, who has had breathing difficulties, \"in more danger\" from coronavirus.\nDeeney looked as sharp as anyone and went close with a header at 0-0 before the late flurry of excitement.\nDefeat would have been harsh on the Hornets, who, with home games against Southampton, Norwich and Newcastle still to come, look set to fight for survival all the way.\nVardy's wait goes on\nLeicester looked typically slick and tidy and controlled much of the game's possession without getting Jamie Vardy into the game too often.\nThe striker, who only made his top-flight debut at the age of 27, is remarkably just a goal away from reaching the landmark of 100 in the Premier League but his only sight of the net was a powerful shot driven wide on the spin.\nThe introduction of Demarai Gray helped Leicester raise the tempo, and they finally tested Ben Foster through James Maddison's low shot seconds after Marc Albrighton had thumped the post.\nChilwell then broke the deadlock with his superb goal, smashing in from 20 yards off the far post, but the visitors could not hold on.\n\"It was a great pass to Ben Chilwell for the goal and we have said to him that he has a great strike on him,\" said manager Brendan Rodgers.\n\"It was sweet and could have won the game but it wasn't to be. But in patches we were good and in the course of time will be better.\n\"We felt we had done enough to win it. Kasper made some good saves but Ben Foster had to make them too. We will take a point and move on.\"\nA return to the Champions League looks likely for Rodgers' side, who now have an eight-point cushion to fifth-placed Manchester United.\nManchester City's two-year ban from European competition - appeal pending - means fifth place will be enough for a Champions League spot.\nMan of the match - Ben Chilwell\nExpect the unexpected late drama - the stats\nSix of the past seven meetings between these two sides in the Premier League have seen a goal or a red card in the 90th minute or later (six goals, one red card).\nWatford have won just one of their past eight top-flight games (D3 L4), after winning four of the five before that (D1).\nLeicester have enjoyed just four wins in their past 14 Premier League games (D4 L6), after winning 12 of the 14 before that (L2).\nBrendan Rodgers is the fourth manager from either Northern Ireland or the Republic to hit the 200-game mark in the Premier League (also Joe Kinnear, David O'Leary and Martin O'Neill).\nLeicester full-back Ben Chilwell has scored two goals in his past five Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 91 in the competition.\nCraig Dawson's goal was his first in the Premier League in 31 appearances (since February 2018) and his first ever in the competition for Watford (21 games).\nWhat next?\nWatford travel to Burnley for an 18:00 BST kick-off on Thursday 25 June, while Leicester are at home to Brighton at the same time on Tuesday 23 June.\nPreview the latest must-see drama: I May Destroy You\nFootball fan?

        "article_text": "Brighton 2-1 Arsenal: Maupay stuns Gunners with late winner\nNeal Maupay scored the winner five minutes into added time as relegation-threatened Brighton clinched a huge win over Arsenal, who once again lost a key player to injury.\nMaupay showed coolness and class to slot in his ninth and most important goal of the season to give Albion their first league win of 2020 and cap a remarkable comeback.\nNicolas Pepe had fired the Gunners into a deserved lead with a superb curling shot with just over 20 minutes to go, but Lewis Dunk scrambled an equaliser over the line from close range to set up a barnstorming finish.\nMaupay's winner was a sucker punch for the Gunners, who have now lost back-to-back games since the Premier League returned - results that surely make a late run to Champions League qualification very unlikely.\nThey may also have to navigate the rest of the season without goalkeeper Bernd Leno, who was taken off on a stretcher in the first half after landing awkwardly on his ankle following an aerial challenge with Maupay.\nMaupay's role in the incident seemed to anger Leno's team-mates, some of whom became embroiled in a shoving match with the striker at full-time.\nLeno will be sidelined along with defender Pablo Mari and midfielder Granit Xhaka, both of whom were injured in Wednesday's 3-0 loss at Manchester City.\nThere is no such negativity for Brighton, though. They appeared to come through the game largely unscathed and are now five points above the bottom three.\nAction and reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\n'Arsenal got what they deserved' - Maupay\nBrighton dig deep\nBrighton were the first team to publicly voice opposition to games being played at neutral grounds as the debate raged last month about how the Premier League might conclude during the coronavirus pandemic.\nWith five of their remaining nine matches at home, four against teams in the top half of the table (including Saturday's), the Seagulls need every advantage that playing on home turf brings.\nBut while the Amex was obviously lacking in fervent home support, this did not hamper Albion's appetite for the fight or ability to rouse themselves after a setback.\nPepe's opener was a hammer blow, especially coming at a time in the game when the league's three-month hiatus would have started to take its physical toll on the players.\nBut they dug deep and found parity through Dunk, who took advantage of some Arsenal hesitancy to poke the ball in after it had ricocheted his way.\nPrior to that they had threatened rarely, with Aaron Mooy's low first-half drive their best effort.\nThey would have the final say, though, as Maupay gathered the ball from substitute Aaron Connelly before producing a deft, decisive finish.\nFamiliar failings cost Arsenal\nArsenal were shambolic at Manchester City on Wednesday, primarily because of a calamitous display from centre-back David Luiz who came on for the injured Mari, gifted two goals to the home side and was then sent off.\nThe Gunners were more solid in Sussex, returning more closely to the kind of form that had seen them go unbeaten in 2020 prior to their visit to the Etihad.\nThey were also more solid, with Rob Holding in the suspended Luiz's place. But this defeat will be more painful than that incurred three days ago.\nThey were the better side for much of it - more creative, more threatening and for 70 minutes at least, more assured.\nBukayo Saka was a menace in the first half and struck the bar with a fierce drive, while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a number of efforts saved by Mat Ryan and would have had his 50th Arsenal goal but for an offside flag after he had broken clear.\nPepe has flattered to deceive at times since his club record \u00a372m move from Lille, but his goal was superb - curled over the keeper and into the top corner from the left side of the box.\nBut a familiar soft underbelly was again their undoing. The equaliser came from more shoddy defending and they had no response to the setback.\nWith respect to Brighton, the Gunners have now lost twice to a side who only have seven league wins to their name all season - not a statistic associated with a team that has Champions League aspirations.\nMan of the match - Lewis Dunk (Brighton)\nBrighton's late, late show - the stats you need to know\nAt 94 minutes and 26 seconds, Neal Maupay's winner was the latest Premier League goal Brighton have ever scored, while it was also the latest winning goal scored against Arsenal in the competition since exact goal-time data became available (2006-07).\nBrighton picked up their 100th victory in all competitions at the Amex Stadium since moving to the ground in 2011.\nExcluding penalties, only Aston Villa (15) have conceded more goals from set-piece situations than Arsenal this season (13), with Brighton's leveller today coming from a corner.\nEighteen-year-old Bukayo Saka has provided 11 assists in all competitions this season, at least three more than any other Arsenal player.\nNicolas Pepe's opener was his seventh goal in all competitions for Arsenal, but his first scored outside London.\nLewis Dunk scored his sixth Premier League goal for Brighton, with Arsenal the only team he's scored more than once against (2). Brighton have lost four of the six Premier League games in which Dunk has scored, with the exceptions being in those games against Arsenal (2-1 in 2017-18, 2-1 today).\nArsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had seven shots against Brighton, the highest number of shots he's had in a single match for the Gunners without scoring (all competitions).\nWhat next?\nBrighton face another tough game away at Leicester on Tuesday, while Arsenal have a couple of days more to prepare for their trip to Southampton."

We missed the atmosphere, that's what we're going to have to get better at dealing with.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo on whether Traore will start against Bournemouth on Wednesday: \"We introduced some speed and we were more accurate and able to finish more actions. The idea is always the same, the players come onto the pitch to help the team.\n\"Each game has it's own history and it's own preparation. In the next game we have to decide again who plays.\n\"The performance was good. We kept West Ham, a good team with good players, away from our goal and we managed the second half well.\n\"I take satisfaction from that. But we hope and pray that soon we can play in front of fans.\"\nNuno's 100% record against West Ham - the stats\nNuno has won all four of his meetings with West Ham as a manager, his best 100% record against an opponent in league competition.\nThe Hammers have failed to score in consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since March to April 2019.\nWolves are unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League matches in London (W5 D5).\nJimenez and Traore have combined for nine Premier League goals this season (6 assists from Traore, 3 from Jimenez).\nSince the beginning of last season, only Trent Alexander-Arnold (27) and Andy Robertson (19) have been directly involved in more Premier League goals among defenders than Wolves' Doherty (15 - eight goals, seven assists).\nWhat's next?\nWhile Wolves entertain struggling Bournemouth at Molineux on Wednesday (18:00 BST), West Ham have a London derby at Tottenham on Tuesday (20:15)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 0-2 Crystal Palace: Eagles increase Bournemouth relegation worries\nEuropean football \"is possible\" next season, says Crystal Palace skipper Luka Milivojevic after helping his side to a comfortable victory over strugglers Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium.\nIn the first top flight game shown live on BBC TV since 1988, Roy Hodgson's side moved into the top 10 and left the mediocre Cherries in the relegation zone.\nThe Eagles are now just four points adrift of fifth-placed Manchester United, who currently occupy a Europa League spot for next season.\nMilivojevic told BBC One: \"We are not far from it and the last few seasons we have been looking behind.\n\"It was a perfect night for us, we cannot have imagined a better beginning after a big break. Three points and clean sheet, I am very proud of the boys.\n\"It is not easy to continue after a break but it is great tonight to come here against a good team to win 2-0 and so I'm happy to be honest.\"\nPalace took the lead when Milivojevic curled in a 12th-minute free-kick before Jordan Ayew swept home a second after 23 minutes.\nPalace saw out the victory in comfort as Bournemouth failed to mount any sort of serious pressure, to leave manager Eddie Howe and his side in serious trouble at the foot of the Premier League.\nRelive the BBC's first live Premier League game\nBournemouth simply too soft\nHowe has received lavish praise for his work at Bournemouth over the years - but he has hit a brick wall as old problems are haunting The Cherries this season.\nBournemouth, at their best, are pleasing on the eye and can pull off the occasional shock as they did in winning at Chelsea in December, but too often they are simply too soft and too easy to score against.\nAnd in their first game since the resumption of the Premier League, Bournemouth looked the same old side, one destined for relegation.\nHowe has had long enough to solve the issues Bournemouth have faced but this game once again illustrated the problems he has failed to solve.\nHe now has the added problem of one of his best attacking players, Ryan Fraser, having taken himself out of the equation by announcing he would not extend his contrast beyond 30 June, thus finishing his Bournemouth career.\nGiven the fact Bournemouth have not taken a single point away from home in 2020 it is clear the Vitality is their best hope of survival - but not on this evidence.\nHowe has a big reputation. Now he must justify it.\nHodgson's top class job\nRoy Hodgson is nowhere near as fashionable as Eddie Howe - and it was understandable he received so much criticism following his England failure in the last 16 in Euro 2016.\nThere is no question, however, that Hodgson is in his element at Palace, building a side that is solid in defence, dangerous in attack and solid enough to ensure Premier League stability.\nThis win leaves Palace sitting comfortably in the top 10 and the goals, from Milovjevic's free-kick and Jordan Ayew's sweeping finish, showed exactly what they are about.\nHodgson may have his critics for his previous work with Liverpool and England, but when his efforts at the likes of Fulham and West Bromwich Albion are examined, it is no surprise what an excellent job he is doing at his boyhood club.\n'I worry for Bournemouth' - what BBC pundits said\nFormer Arsenal and Crystal Palace winger Ian Wright, speaking on BBC One: \"When you look at their lack of creativity, you do worry for Bournemouth.\n\"Their next game is away to Wolves who like to play on the counter-attack and whose creativity will cause Bournemouth a lot of problems.\"\nEx-England captain Alan Shearer: \"Palace will find it tougher in midweek when they have to go to Liverpool, but that win will give them great confidence.\n\"Teams can start rusty and be slow, which has been evident in the games since Wednesday, but in the main teams have picked up. There was nothing from Bournemouth and that will be a real worry.\"\nMan of the Match - Luka Milivojevic (Crystal Palace)\n'We have to play better' - what they said\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"We know now we have one game less to achieve our objective.\n\"The table is still so tight, the difference is so tight and we could look at back-to-back wins as being the difference for us. We have to believe that is going to happen but we have to play better than we did in the first half an hour in this game.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: \"I thought the first half was very good. We passed the ball well and I thought our defending was excellent throughout but I thought the game became a bit more bitty in the second half.\n\"To go in 2-0 up at half-time was a good reward for what was an excellent performance. The front three were excellent today. I think we have had a threat up front all season but the problem is we don't score enough goals. We have just perhaps not taken them as well as we should do but today we did.\n\"We've had four wins in a row which is something I've never had in the Premier League with any of my clubs before and four clean sheets. That is very commendable but now that will be put to the test when we go to Liverpool on Wednesday.\"\nA rare four in a row for Palace - the stats\nCrystal Palace have won four consecutive Premier League games, the best ongoing winning run of all sides in the competition; only in December 1992 and April 2014 (both five in a row) have they enjoyed a longer winning streak in the top- .\nBournemouth have lost seven Premier League games in 2020; no other side has lost more during this calendar year (level with West Ham).\nThis was the first time Crystal Palace scored more than one goal in the first half of a Premier League game this season; they last did so on the final day of the 2018-19 campaign, also against Bournemouth.\nBournemouth have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their past 13 league matches, conceding 25 goals across this spell. Crystal Palace have won three consecutive league meetings with Bournemouth for the first time since April 1988.\nComing in the 12th minute, Luka Milivojevic's opener was the first goal Crystal Palace have scored in the opening 20 minutes of any Premier League match this season.\nBoth of Jordan Ayew's last two Premier League goals have been scored in the first half; only one of his first 23 strikes in the competition had been in the opening 45 minutes before this.\nWhat next?\nBournemouth travel to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League on Wednesday, 24 June (18:00 BST) while Crystal Palace are at Liverpool later the same day (20:15 BST)."

The points return with eight games to go... I can't be more pleased.\n\"If somebody said with eight games to go that we're two points behind Arsenal, I wouldn't quite believe it.\"\nIt was a great day for Bruce and his striker Joelinton, who scored only his second Premier League goal, and his first since 25 August.\nThe relief on the Brazilian striker's face was apparent when he tapped in Newcastle's third, and although there were no fans inside St James' Park to celebrate with, no doubt many were screaming with delight as the \u00a340m striker ended his terrible run in front of goal.\n2,130 minutes later... Joelinton scores again\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nThat was the icing on a sweet Magpies cake. Despite playing their first match since the Premier League restarted, they looked far fresher than their opponents who produced one of their worst defensive displays of the season, capped by the red card shown to John Egan five minutes after the break.\nIt means Chris Wilder's side, who drew against Villa on Wednesday, have taken only one point from two games. Next up for them is Manchester United - a crucial match in the race for a top-four spot.\nAs for Newcastle, Allan Saint-Maximin sent them on their way when he fired home at the far post after Enda Stevens inexplicably allowed Matt Ritchie's low ball to go between his legs. Ritchie then added a second with a thunderous strike from the edge of the area.\nThen came Joelinton's strike from close range after Miguel Almiron delivered a pinpoint low ball to his feet.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action live\nBruce makes his case again\nSteve Bruce has somehow remained gracious ever since he took his dream job last summer. As an ex-Sunderland manager who followed former fans' darling Rafael Benitez, he was already in the red when he arrived.\nHis team selections, particularly the reluctance to drop Joelinton, further frustrated the supporters and now the possibility of new, moneyed owners from Saudi Arabia has cast further doubt on the future of the manager.\nBut time and again Bruce has confounded his critics this season with wins over Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea and now this double over the Blades.\nHis side produced a disciplined display with plenty of verve provided by Saint-Maximin, Almiron and Ritchie.\nSaint-Maximin, in particular, was exceptional. The \u00a320m outlay last summer now seems a snip for the 23-year-old who embarrassed the visiting defence with his trickery and pace, before he got his reward in the 55th minute.\nRitchie added the second 14 minutes later with the goal of the game - a fierce drive which was too hot to handle for Dean Henderson.\nAnd with 12 minutes remaining, Joelinton, who had missed an easy chance in the first half, scored his second league goal for the club - 2,130 minutes and 39 shots after scoring the first.\nBlades lose sharpness at St James'\nWilder's post-match talk to his team might not be repeatable. His side's success this season has been built on unwavering discipline and a miserly defence - the second best in the league before Sunday - but neither were evident here.\nThere were suggestions something was not right early in the match when midfielder Oliver Norwood lost possession far too easily on a couple of occasions before Egan got caught up in an unnecessary altercation with Joelinton which earned him a yellow card.\nThat became two yellows for the Irishman in the 50th minute when he got on the wrong side of the striker, who he pulled back as Joelinton tried to run in on goal. Referee David Coote was given an easy decision.\nIf Wilder had his face in his hands then, worse was to follow. For Newcastle's first, the usually dependable Stevens got his legs in a muddle as he tried to stop Ritchie's ball from finding Saint-Maximin and for the second, right-back George Baldock's reluctance to close down Ritchie gave the Scot room to shoot.\nMan of the match - Allan Saint-Maximin (Newcastle)\nWilder unhappy with Egan booking - reaction\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder speaking to BBC Match of the Day about the first caution for Egan: \"Steve Bruce is a competitor and I'm a competitor - we wouldn't have backed away from that. That yellow then puts John in a difficult position.\n\"We then allowed a poor mistake for them to go 1-0 up. We had to then chase and open up, and they punished us.\n\"People will look at the goals conceded today and will ask how we managed the amount of clean sheets this season and to be defensively tight.\n\"We all need to sharpen up and tighten up. If we don't, it'll be a long five weeks. We've got a huge game on Wednesday night. We just want the overall performance to be better than what it is.\"\nHeaviest defeat for Blades since 2018 - the stats\nNewcastle are now unbeaten in four Premier League games on home soil without conceding a goal (W2 D2) - the Magpies have kept four straight clean sheets in the top flight at St James' Park for the first time since April 2012.\nAfter losing none of their first nine Premier League away games this season (W3 D6), Sheffield United have since suffered three defeats in their last six on the road (W1 D2), failing to score on four occasions during this run.\nWilder and Sheffield United have suffered their heaviest league defeat together since a 3-0 loss at Middlesbrough in August 2018, shipping more than two goals on the road for the first time in the Premier League this season.\nThere were 264 seconds between John Egan's sending-off and Allan Saint-Maximin scoring the opener. It was the second red card of Egan's English league career, with his only previous dismissal coming against Millwall in April 2019.\nAfter scoring with only one of his first 30 Premier League shots, Saint-Maximin has now netted with each of his last two attempts (also v Southampton back in March). Only Jonjo Shelvey (five) has netted more times for Newcastle in the top flight this season than the French winger (three).\nWith his first goal involvements of 2019-20, Matt Ritchie has both scored and assisted in a Premier League game for the first time, with the Scotland winger's strike his first home league goal since January 2019 (v Manchester City).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle host Aston Villa on Wednesday while Sheffield United are at Manchester United on the same day (both at 18:00 BST).\nLockdown for the super-rich: How did they spend it?\nDiet cheat days: Are they ever a good idea?"

I know that and I felt for him, as I felt for the players with long-term injuries.\n\"The ability he's got to arrive in the box, it's a big thing, I've spoken about it with him all season.\"\nThe win means fourth-placed Chelsea restored their five-point advantage over Manchester United and Wolves, who are fifth and sixth respectively.\nAston Villa, meanwhile, remain in the relegation zone, one point from safety after taking one point from their first two games back following the resumption of the Premier League.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nChelsea pick up from where they left off\nThe suspension of the season had perhaps come at a frustrating time for Chelsea. They had just beaten Liverpool 2-0 in the FA Cup fifth round and then thrashed Everton 4-0 in the league.\nBut, 105 days on from that win against the Toffees, Chelsea looked fresh and motivated from the outset against a Villa side fighting for survival.\nThe only concern, however, was their inability to turn chances into goals - particularly in the first half.\nMason Mount saw a powerful strike kept out by Villa keeper Orjan Nyland before Ruben Loftus-Cheek, making a welcome return to the side after a year out with injury, just failed to turn home a teasing ball across the face of goal.\nIt could have proved costly, particularly when Villa scored from only their second shot on target to take the lead.\nIn the end Chelsea got the job done but, with 19 attempts on goal, they should perhaps have won by a more comfortable margin.\n\"It has been the story of our season - to play well, concede and then have to fight your way to try and get the victory,\" Lampard added.\n\"We haven't always got the victory and that is the next step for us - to be clinical when we are on top.\"\nThe signing of Timo Werner for next season will hopefully address Chelsea's struggles to make the most of their opportunities but for now, Frank Lampard will hope his current forwards will use the striker's impending arrival as motivation to be more clinical in the end-of-season run-in.\nA tough return but some hope for Villa\nIt has been a tough return to Premier League action for Aston Villa, who resumed their survival bid against two opponents fighting to secure European football next season.\nThey were fortunate to pick up a point against Sheffield United, with goalline technology failing to register a goal for the Blades.\nBut despite seeing their winless run in the Premier League extended to six games, there are some signs of encouragement for Villa.\nThey competed well against high-flying Sheffield United and against Chelsea they started with a good shape and discipline that initially served to frustrate their opponents, although seemingly lacked a Plan B and never looked like getting back into the game once they fell behind.\nJack Grealish has also continued to be an influential and dangerous presence in their team.

        "article_text": "Everton 0-0 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp praises 'world class' Alisson\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp praised \"world class\" goalkeeper Alisson after his late save secured a point against Everton in the Merseyside derby.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin's close-range flick was kept out by the Brazilian before Tom Davies' shot from the loose ball struck the post.\nThat was the closest either side came to scoring in a low-key Goodison Park encounter, which ended goalless.\n\"We should not take him [Alisson] for granted,\" said Klopp.\n\"Absolutely outstanding. That's what a world-class goalkeeper is - nothing to do for pretty much 90 minutes then he's there.\"\nLiverpool now need five points to be sure of the Premier League title and can still clinch their first top-flight trophy in 30 years against Crystal Palace at Anfield on Wednesday - but only if Manchester City fail to beat Burnley at Etihad Stadium on Monday.\nAlisson also saved well from Brazilian compatriot Richarlison as a largely tame game, with the surreal atmosphere of a derby played behind closed doors, sprang to life.\nEverton keeper Jordan Pickford saved well from Fabinho's free-kick in the closing moments but it was a game that highlighted two understandably rusty sides - although Liverpool's coronation will come soon.\nRelive Sunday's Premier League action\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nLiverpool struggle to shake off ring rust\nLiverpool would have hoped to set up a potential title win at Anfield on Wednesday with victory here at Goodison Park - but after 106 days out of action, it was perhaps understandable that a side that have overpowered so many were short of their best.\nForward Mohamed Salah was only fit enough for the bench while left-back Andy Robertson was injured. Both were missed as Liverpool saw plenty of the ball but struggled to seriously test Pickford.\nNaby Keita looked energetic until he came off but boss Jurgen Klopp now has further concerns over James Milner, who sustained a hamstring injury, and Joel Matip who also limped off - although Joe Gomez is an ideal replacement there.\nLiverpool's star of the show was keeper Alisson, who was in superb form when called upon in those crucial late moments.\nThis point - and Liverpool certainly did not deserve more - means the celebratory champagne may be on ice a little longer but it is only a matter of time, even days, before they are back at the peak of the domestic game by clinching that long-awaited title.\n\"The point is one we deserve,\" added Klopp.\n\"Everton were well organised so we had to run a lot but we looked fit and ready.\n\"Now we've got three days. Crystal Palace looked good on Saturday and we have to make sure we are ready for Wednesday.\"\nAncelotti can be pleased with Everton\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti's predecessor Marco Silva was sacked after a 5-2 derby capitulation at Anfield in December - and the difference the decorated Italian has made since was in evidence here.\nAncelotti had already made a good start to his Goodison career before the season was halted, but he has now had more of a chance to impart his methods and can be well pleased with what he saw here. In fact, he may feel disappointed his side did not win.\nEverton conceded possession for long periods but were superbly organised defensively, and Alisson was much the busier goalkeeper.\nCaptain Seamus Coleman was simply outstanding for Everton, while the budding leadership qualities of young defender Mason Holgate could be heard as his instructions echoed around Goodison Park.\nAncelotti also has two dangerous forwards in Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison while talented teenager Anthony Gordon, who struggled to make an impact, will be better for the experience.\nAncelotti will know he needs more strength and physical presence in central midfield but this is a different Everton side to the one that capitulated so miserably in December, before also losing to a youthful Liverpool side in the FA Cup third round under the new manager.\nEverton will be better when Ancelotti has more of his own signings in the team, but the signs are still promising.\n\"Honestly we were really close to winning but it was a tough game, difficult game,\" Ancelotti said.\n\"We performed really well. We were focused, we sacrificed. We had opportunities to score at the end.\n\"Liverpool played a good game, they had more possession but defensively we were really good.\"\nMan of the match - Seamus Coleman (Everton)\nAn expected result? The stats\nSeven of the last eight Premier League Merseyside derbies at Goodison Park have ended level. Indeed, Everton-Liverpool has finished goalless on more occasions than any other Premier League fixture (11, includes Anfield meetings).\nLiverpool have gone 22 games without defeat against Everton in all competitions, since a 0-2 loss at Goodison in October 2010 (W11 D11) - the Reds' joint-longest unbeaten run against a single opponent in their history (also a run of 22 games without defeat against Aston Villa from 1981-92).\nEverton remain winless in their last 22 matches against Liverpool in all competitions (D11 L11) - only against Chelsea (24 games from 2001-09) have the Toffees gone longer without a victory against a single opponent.\nEverton are the only Premier League side to remain unbeaten at home in 2020 in all competitions (P5 W2 D3).\nLiverpool have failed to win two of their last three Premier League games (W1 D1 L1) - as many as in their previous 38 (W36 D2).\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has managed more games against Everton in all competitions without defeat than against any other opponent in his managerial career (P11 W7 D4).\nThe average age of Everton's starting XI here was 24 years 356 days - the Toffees' youngest starting line-up for a league match against Liverpool since February 1986 (24 years 250 days), when they won 2-0 at Anfield.\nLiverpool's James Milner made his 535th Premier League appearance in this game, the joint-fifth highest total in the competition's history, alongside Gary Speed.\nWhat next?\nEverton travel to Norwich on Wednesday, 24 June (18:00 BST) while Liverpool will hope to cement the Premier League title (if Manchester City fail to win on Monday) when they host Crystal Palace on the same night (20:15)."

If it was Spain, they would make him the core of the team early on. I watch Chelsea who have a lot of good young players, but Foden is extraordinary and has the vision that others don't.\"\nFrom City's point of view, this was the perfect way for them to ease more of their players back into action with Pep Guardiola making eight changes from the side that beat Arsenal last week.\nThe only blip was the injury sustained by Aguero as he won City's penalty, with the Argentine striker forced off and Guardiola saying afterwards that it \"does not look good\".\nGuardiola added: \"He felt something in his knee. He struggled in the last month with some pain in his knee. We will see on Tuesday.\"\nCity were able to give Leroy Sane his first competitive outing of the season before the end, when the German winger replaced Foden.\nGuardiola confirmed on Friday that Sane, who had been out of action since injuring his knee ligaments in the Community Shield in August, will be leaving the club either in the next transfer window or when his contract ends in the summer of 2021.\nHe was given an 11-minute cameo against the Clarets, which suggests he will play a part in Guardiola's plans during the remainder of this campaign as City, who have already collected the Carabao Cup, look to defend the FA Cup and try to win the Champions League for the first time.\nWeakened Burnley given a harsh lesson\nBurnley have now lost 5-0 on their past three visits to Manchester City in all competitions, but this defeat could have been even worse.\nThe Clarets did not manage an effort at goal until Dwight McNeil lashed a free-kick into the empty stand behind Ederson's goal after 63 minutes, and that was the only time they came close to threatening a reply.\nThere were mitigating circumstances for Burnley boss Sean Dyche, however.\nA trip to this part of Manchester is hard enough without the contract issues and injuries which meant he could not fill his bench in his side's first game after their enforced three-month break.\nFirst-choice strikers Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood were absent through injury, while Jeff Hendrick, Aaron Lennon, Phil Bardsley and former England goalkeeper Joe Hart are all free agents from the end of June and were not considered for selection.\nIt meant that, while City had players of the calibre of Kevin de Bruyne and Raheem Sterling among their substitutes, the Clarets named two untried youngsters in Max Thompson and Bobby Thomas, and two keepers - Lukas Jensen and Bailey Peacock-Farrell - among their potential replacements.\nBefore their season was stopped, Burnley were on a seven-game unbeaten run that had taken them to the fringes of the race for Europe. Dyche's mission now is to try to regain some of that momentum in the next few weeks.\nMan of the match: Phil Foden (Man City)\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host Watford on Thursday (18:00 BST) while Manchester City play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge later the same evening (20:15).\nGrounded with Louis Theroux: Louis sits down with Troy Deeney\nFootball Daily: Liverpool move one step closer to the title"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 3-0 Sheffield United: Anthony Martial hat-trick sinks Blades\nAnthony Martial scored Manchester United's first Premier League hat-trick in more than seven years as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men eased past Sheffield United at Old Trafford.\nRobin van Persie was the last United player to score a treble in the league.\nAnd while there was nothing to compare with the Dutchman's brilliant volley against Aston Villa that helped seal the 13th and final title of Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious reign, Martial did complete his own milestone with a delightful chipped finish over Simon Moore after collecting Marcus Rashford's return pass.\nThe result moves United to within two points of fourth-placed Chelsea, who entertain Manchester City on Thursday.\nHowever, for Chris Wilder's visitors it was another disappointing day. The Blades have now picked up just one point from three games since the resumption and are yet to score.\nReaction from Wednesday's Premier League games\nMartial benefiting from Fernandes' arrival\nUnited's decision to sell Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez to Inter Milan in August and not buy an attacking replacement has been a talking point for most of the season.\nAnd for most of the campaign, it looked like a poor move.\nBut, just as United's fortunes have changed markedly since the arrival of Bruno Fernandes in January, so Martial has profited too.\nIn seven league games since Fernandes arrived from Sporting Lisbon for \u00a347m, Martial has scored six goals.\nHe now has 19 for the campaign - his best return in five years at Old Trafford. And while he has a bit to do before he matches Lukaku's 27 goals from two seasons ago, it is three more than the Belgian managed last term.\nEven more satisfying for Solskjaer, the Frenchman's first-half strikes were exactly the kinds of goals he has been imploring him to score.\nBoth were runs to the near post, the first took him a bit nearer to the goal than the second. But on each occasion, Martial found the net with a clinical first-time finish to convert low crosses from first Rashford and then Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\n\"I am very happy for Anthony,\" said Solskjaer. \"We have worked with him getting in the box. The first goal, I think that's a vital goal with they way he turned and got himself into a position to score from Marcus' cross.\n\"He's getting into those positions more and more. He is in good form.\"\nMartial is not known for his smiling but even he managed one after scoring his third, his delight obvious after previously scoring twice in a game for United five times in five years without ever going on to complete his treble.\nHowever, to put it into context, Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has scored 11 hat-tricks in the time United have managed two.\nThe Pogba and Fernandes axis\nIt was the first time Paul Pogba and Fernandes had started a game together and there were signs the pair could be a potent midfield combination.\nPogba operated in a slightly deeper role, closer to holding midfielder Nemanja Matic but evidently with licence to go forward.\nHad Rashford not fluffed his first-time volley as he latched on to a brilliant chipped pass from Pogba at the end of a move Fernandes did much to influence, it would have ended a superb passage of play.\n\"Paul and Bruno showed quality and it's exciting for us to be working with talent like this,\" added Solskjaer.\n\"Paul is still a bit away from his best form. That's natural on his first start since September and he's been working hard, so hopefully it won't be too long, but I thought he controlled the game.\"\nWith Matic as well, there was a synergy about the home side in the middle of the field that, in the second half in particular, the visitors found it difficult to contain, judging by the rather blunt messages being delivered by the Blades' players.\nPogba was mesmeric at times. One run through the visitors' defence involved close control with both feet, balance on both sides and delightful close control. The pity was Martial stepped in to take the shot - which he missed - rather than let his fellow Frenchman try to find his own way to goal.\nDisappointing restart for Blades\nIt has not been a great restart for the Blades. One point and no goals from three games in a week has ended the optimistic talk about a Champions League place.\nThe loss of goalkeeper Dean Henderson - not allowed to play against his parent club - John Egan through suspension and Jack O'Connell to injury meant there was reduced chance of the visiting United recording a first Old Trafford success since April 1973.\nHowever, they looked tired at the end and need to pick themselves up quickly if they are to secure a top-half finish, which would be their first in the top flight since 1974-75.\nMan of the match - Anthony Martial\n'We want third' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: \"I've never said fourth is our aim, we want to go up to third but we have to focus on each game as it comes and there's two cups for us there as well. In the end, we can count the points and maybe have only two teams in front of you.\"\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder said: \"I expect a better performance from my team. I don't want people looking at our defensive record and saying 'how have they done that?' To concede after three or four minutes put us on back foot.\n\"If you give the ball away to players like that you are going to get hurt. Lot to look at from our point of view. Easy night for them.\"\nBlades continue to struggle in front of goal - the stats\nAnthony Martial scored Manchester United's first Premier League hat-trick since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson at the end of the 2012-13 season, with Robin van Persie the last Red Devils player to score one in April 2013 against Aston Villa.\nManchester United have won their last four home games in all competitions by an aggregate score of 13-0.\nSheffield United have failed to score in their three Premier League games in June, attempting just three shots on target across those games.\nManchester United have kept seven clean sheets in their last eight matches at Old Trafford in all competitions (W6 D1 L1), including shutouts in each of their last five at home.\nSheffield United have failed to score in three consecutive league games for the first time since September 2013 under David Weir.\nAnthony Martial has scored 19 goals in all competitions for Manchester United this season - his most prolific season for the Red Devils.\nMarcus Rashford has been directly involved in 13 goals in 12 home Premier League appearances this season (10 goals, 3 assists).\nSheffield United have shipped three goals in consecutive league games for the first time since January 2016 under Nigel Adkins.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United's next game is at Norwich in the FA Cup sixth round on Saturday, 27 June (17:30 BST).

        "article_text": "Newcastle v Aston Villa: Ahmed Elmohamady rescues point for Villa at Newcastle\nAhmed Elmohamady's late header rescued a point for Aston Villa at Newcastle, but it was not enough to lift Dean Smith's relegation-threatened side out of the Premier League's bottom three.\nThe Egyptian stooped low to divert his effort into the net from a corner just six minutes after coming on as a substitute, shortly after Dwight Gayle's goal for Newcastle had looked like giving United the points.\nGayle's impact was even more immediate than that of El Mohamady, with his neatly-taken finish coming just 94 seconds after he was introduced for the injured Matt Ritchie.\nVilla's point is reward for a first half in which they were the more positive of the two sides, and also their determination not to allow themselves to sink to another damaging defeat.\nIt may not take them out of the relegation zone but it will be a boost after they were denied by Sheffield United in their first game after the restart and allowed Chelsea to come back to beat them on Sunday.\nNewcastle are now just a point shy of the 40-point mark - often cited as the tally required to ward off the threat of relegation.\nAction and reaction from Wednesday's Premier League games\nVilla refuse to give up\nIt has been a frustrating return for Villa.\nThe repeated failure of their relegation rivals to pick up points has presented the opportunity for them to claw their way out of the bottom three, but although they have come close, they have not been able to find that elusive win.\nGranted, they benefited from a failure of technology in their home draw against Sheffield United but having done so could easily have taken three points as opposed to one.\nThey then almost burgled a win against Chelsea on Sunday, taking the lead despite having precious little of the ball, before the Blues rallied to turn the game their way.\nThis may only be the second point they have taken from the last 21 avaialable to them but it is a timely boost, reminding them that they can mix it with some of the top-flight's most stubborn sides and may yet well edge themselves ahead of a faltering pack of sides above them.\nThey should have led in the first half, but Trezeguet and Mbwana Samatta both spurned chances on their return to the side.\nThe best fell to the former, who hit his back-post effort into the ground and over after being found by a superb cross from Ezri Konsa.\nNewcastle's goal could have been a hammer blow, but in the end it was the home side hanging on.\nNewcastle take the positives\nNewcastle produced arguably one the finest displays of the first initial round of games back, winning 3-0 at home against an admittedly under-par Sheffield United, who played for 40 minutes with 10 men.\nEverything that could have gone right for the Magpies did in that game and it looked like that form was going to continue on Wednesday, as misfortune in the shape of Ritchie's injury immediately turned into a positive courtesy of Gayle's tidy finish - his first Premier League goal in 773 days.\nThe assist for that goal also came from a man making a quick impact, with Andy Carroll's pass coming just four minutes and 51 seconds after he had been sent on by Steve Bruce.\nBefore then, the home side had battled hard but were too reliant on the creative pair of Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin, who threatened in flashes but failed to produce anything decisive.\nAfter breaking his 27 game and 10 month drought on Sunday, Joelinton could have added another league strike to his meagre tally of two, but Tyrone Mings denied him with a superb challenge in the box.\nElmohamady's goal is a setback, ending a run of three successive clean sheets, but only a minor one for a side that have already exceeded many critics' expectations this season.\nBruce was asked after the game if would have taken 39 points at this stage of the campaign if offered it at the beginning. His positive answer will be a surprise to nobody.\nMan of the match - Douglas Luiz (Aston Villa)\n'We threw the kitchen sink at them'\nAston Villa manager Dean Smith speaking to Match of the Day: \"It's an annoying point. The majority of the game I thought we were the better team. Our defensive display was good but we Elmohamady rescues point for Villahave to be more clinical.\n\"There are lots of positives to take. The commitment from the players was great, I thought we threw the kitchen sink at them.\n\"We were throwing everything at their box trying to get back in to the game and then we almost won it. We had a bit of stick at the weekend about not having much of the ball against Chelsea but they're a well established Premier League team.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce: \"We would have all accepted [the points total] but we can't forget that we have a great opportunity to push on a bit now.\n\"Can we push on and catch the teams above us and finish the season looking upwards, rather than just looking over our shoulders?\"\nNewcastle extend home run - the stats you need to know\nNewcastle are now unbeaten in five Premier League games at St James' Park (W2 D3), with Aston Villa's goal the first they have conceded on home soil since New Years' Day against Leicester (0-3).\nAston Villa have picked up just two points from the last 21 available in the Premier League (P7 W0 D2 L5), although they have avoided defeat on the road for the first time in four games.\nSince beating Dean Smith's Brentford with Hull back in April 2016, Steve Bruce remains winless in seven games against his fellow Englishman (D3 L4) including both Premier League matches with Newcastle this season (D1 L1).\nAndy Carroll's assist for Newcastle's opening goal was his fourth in the Premier League in his last eight appearances, as many as he managed to register across his previous 100 in the competition.\nAhmed Elmohamady's equaliser for Aston Villa was his second Premier League goal at St James' Park, also scoring for Hull City there in September 2013 under Steve Bruce. Newcastle are the only side he has netted more than once against in the top flight.\nWhat next?\nAston Villa host in-form Wolves at Villa Park on Saturday lunchtime, while Newcastle could do today's opponents a favour if they beat struggling Bournemouth in their next fixture at the Vitality Stadium at 18:00 BST on Wednesday, 1 July.\nThat Peter Crouch Podcast: Crouchy is joined by former boss Sean Dyche\nApologising to an ex in lockdown: 'I know that I crossed a bunch of lines'"

        "article_text": "Wolves 1-0 Bournemouth: Jimenez boosts Wolves' European hopes\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe said \"it hurts deeply\" after a 1-0 defeat at Wolves kept them in the Premier League relegation zone.\nRaul Jimenez scored almost a carbon copy of his opener in Saturday's win at West Ham to claim his 15th league goal of the season and bolster Wolves' Champions League qualification hopes.\nBournemouth, who failed to produce a shot on target, remain without a point away from home in 2020 and stay behind 17th-placed West Ham on goal difference.\n\"We are well aware of where we are and the challenges we face in forgetting that position,\" said Howe.\n\"One result will change everything for us at this moment and that is what we have to try and commit to.\"\nAdama Traore was recalled by Wolves after coming off the bench to play a part in both goals at West Ham and the Spanish winger again crossed for Mexico striker Jimenez to head home.\nIt was the 10th time they have combined for a league goal this season - more than any other pair in the top flight.\nThat was enough to keep Wolves level with fifth-placed Manchester United - 3-0 winners over Sheffield United on Wednesday - and move to within two points of fourth-placed Chelsea, who host Manchester City on Thursday.\nTraore steals the show again\nHaving been man of the match on Saturday despite playing only 26 minutes, Traore was not a surprise inclusion for Wolves' 50th game of an arduous season.\nAlthough the hosts took a while to get going, with neither side managing a shot on target in a disjointed first half, Traore ultimately stole the show.\nThe 24-year-old lit the game up by holding off one man in his own half before going on a blistering run past another three to earn a free-kick 25 yards out.\nHe also fired narrowly over from the edge of the box, while whipping in teasing crosses either side of the break.\nBut then he found his target, taking Matt Doherty's ball wide and getting down the right before standing up a cross for Jimenez to power into the roof of the net.\nAfter Traore was replaced in the 73rd minute, substitute Pedro Neto burst forward and dragged a shot wide.\nThe clean sheet was Wolves' 10th in the league this season, and sixth in the past seven games.\nCherries with work to do\nAfter resuming their season with a lacklustre home defeat by Crystal Palace, Bournemouth made a bright start, with the returning Philip Billing providing more attacking thrust than usual.\nBut the midfielder hobbled off early in the second half and the Cherries must find a solution to the absence of winger Ryan Fraser, one of their main attacking threats in recent years, who chose not to sign a short-term contract extension and will not be available after 30 June.\nDespite chasing the game, the only shot Bournemouth managed in the second half was a late effort by Arnaut Groeneveld which curled well wide.\nThere is much work to be done at the back too as Jimenez leapt above Steve Cook and Jack Stacey to head home, meaning Bournemouth have failed to keep a clean sheet in 14 league games.\nMan of the match - Adama Traore (Wolves)\n'We deserved to win' - what they said\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo: \"The first half, for both teams it was tough and both teams were not able to play. Defensive organisation was very tight and the space was not there.\n\"It was a poor first half in terms of football but in the second half we managed to create a couple of chances. We deserved to win. The boys worked very hard and another clean sheet is important for us.\n\"It's about building and creating solutions going forward. On Saturday we have such a tough game so now we have to prepare.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"It hurts deeply at the moment, the run we're on and the results we've had. There was very little goalmouth action from either team and we could easily have picked up a point.\n\"Our organisation was good, but we were more wasteful with the ball as the game went on and that disappoints us as we're better than that.\n\"It was a definite improvement from the Crystal Palace game in terms of intensity and defensive organisation. I can't fault the attitude and commitment of the players so hopefully that will change our fortunes quickly.\"\nAnother Wolves clean sheet - the best stats\nWolves have kept four consecutive home clean sheets in the top flight for the first time since February 1980\nWolves' tally of 49 points is their best after 31 games of a Premier League season, beating the 1979-80 campaign (51 when adjusted to three points for a win)\nWolves have faced Bournemouth more often without losing in the Premier League (W3 D1) than any other opponent\nWhat's next?\nWolves have a Midlands derby at Aston Villa on Saturday (12:30 BST) while Bournemouth are at home to Newcastle next Wednesday, 1 July (18:00)."

We don't give up, for sure. We have seven games and have a chance.\n\"It's not realistic for us to win the FA Cup or stay in the league. When you wear this yellow shirt, you have responsibility and big pride. As long as there is a chance, we won't give up.\"\nToffees defender Michael Keane scored the winning goal in the second half, leaping highest at the near post to flick home Lucas Digne's corner at an empty Carrow Road.\nThe Canaries could have broken the deadlock in the first half but Onel Hernandez's deflected shot bobbled off the foot of the post.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin forced Canaries goalkeeper Tim Krul into a couple of saves, with victory for Carlo Ancelotti's side lifting them up to 10th in the table.\nRelive Everton's win over Norwich\nGoal-shy Norwich\nNorwich boss Farke sprung a surprise by opting to leave out his two most potent attacking threats in Teemu Pukki and Todd Cantwell, who have contributed 17 of the side's 25 league goals this season.\nThough Hernandez made some early darts forward and also struck the post, the Cuban drifted out of the game while fellow attackers Ondrej Duda, Lukas Rupp and Josip Drmic offered very little.\nWith just two goals between the quartet this season, the performance from the forward line showed why Norwich are the league's lowest scorers this season.\nEverton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was a spectator for the second half, and the closest the home side came to scoring was when Drmic headed wide of the post in stoppage time.\nThough they still face trips to Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City, Norwich have huge games coming up against fellow strugglers Brighton, Watford and West Ham. Results in those will go a long way to determining their fate at the end of the campaign.\nEverton on the rise\nEverton signalled their ambitions with the appointment of three-time Champions League-winning boss Ancelotti in December to replace Marco Silva, who was sacked after a string of poor results.\nWhen the Italian took over, Everton were 15th in the table and staring the wrong way - just four points clear of the relegation zone - but their latest victory sees them looking in the opposite direction, four points behind seventh-placed Tottenham.\nThe thought of clinching a Europa League spot at Christmas would have been wildly unrealistic but is now a real possibility with match-winner Keane telling BBC Sport \"it is definitely in our grasp\".\nThe Merseysiders created few clear-cut openings but took the big chance that fell their way as Keane headed in his second of the season to end a run of four games without a win.\nThe clean sheet was welcome too, having not managed a shut-out in their 14 previous away games, backing up the point they collected against rivals Liverpool on their return to action.\nAncelotti said: \"What we needed from this game was three points, the three points arrived and now we can dream to climb up the table. The players satisfied me a lot.\"\nWhat next?\nNorwich are in FA Cup action on Saturday, hosting Manchester United live on BBC One (kick-off 17:30 BST), while Everton are home to Leicester in the Premier Leicester on 1 July (18:00).\nDelightful Digne delivers - the stats\nEverton kept just their second away clean sheet in the Premier League this season, while this was their first away league win without conceding since March 2019 (2-0 against West Ham)\nNorwich suffered their 20th defeat of the Premier League season in this game - only once previously have they lost more after 31 games of a Football League campaign (22 in 1946-47 in the Third Division South)\nSince Carlo Ancelotti took charge, Everton have only lost one of their seven Premier League games against opponents starting the day in the bottom half (W4 D2) - 3-2 defeat against Arsenal back in February\nNorwich have won just one of their last 21 midweek Premier League matches (Tuesday-Thursday - D6 L14), beating Watford 4-2 in May 2016\nEverton have scored more goals from corners than any other team in the Premier League this season (10), while Norwich have conceded the most in this fashion (10)\nNorwich have recorded just two shots on target in two games since the Premier League season resumed (v Southampton and Everton)\nEverton's Lucas Digne recorded his sixth assist in the Premier League this season.

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-2 Arsenal: Arteta still hoping for Europe after Arsenal win\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta remains hopeful that his side can qualify for Europe this season after they won their first game since the restart of the Premier League at Southampton.\nThe Gunners had lost both of their previous two games, to Manchester City and Brighton, but Thursday's victory arrests the slump, moving them up to ninth in the table.\nChampions League qualification looks unlikely, but with Manchester City's involvement in Europe still up in the air pending their appeal against a ban for breaching financial fair play, Arteta's side could well claim a Europa League spot.\n\"I am always very positive,\" said Arteta. \"We have enough time, we have enough games left to do it.\n\"We had two defeats for the first time since I joined, but now we have won and it lifts the spirit, it lifts the belief.\n\"The calendar of the Premier League has given us is pretty tough. We have four away games and we have to recover the players now.\"\nThe Gunners were helped along their way at St Mary's by a dreadful error from Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy who faltered under pressure from Eddie Nketiah following a back-pass, allowing the striker to intercept his attempted ball out and slot into an unguarded net.\nThe win was sealed late on when Jack Stephens was sent off for fouling Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as the last man and from the resulting free-kick substitute Joe Willock finished after Alexandre Lacazette's free-kick struck the wall and his follow-up was parried.\nIt was timely boost for the Gunners, who have struggled with injuries and form since the restart.\nThe victory, though, was not undeserved. Prior to the goal, Nketiah had seen a close-range finish ruled out for offside and Aubameyang had crashed an angled effort against the bar.\nComing after such an impressive display in their first game back at Norwich, the result continues Southampton's woeful inability to replicate their away form at St Mary's.\nThis was their 10th loss at home this season - equalling the club record for a Premier League season, set back in 1993-94 when their were 42 games in a campaign.\nWith 10 points separating them and the bottom three it is very unlikely that they will get dragged into a relegation fight.\nAction and reaction from Thursday's Premier League games\nSmall steps forward for Arsenal\nSince the restart, the Gunners have lurched from one mini-crisis to the next - David Luiz's calamitous display against Manchester City, injury problems galore, and a winning position thrown away at Brighton.\nTwo defeats from two games since the restart had already put paid to Arsenal's already slim hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.\nIt also placed them in serious danger of recording their worst league finish since 1994-95 - the season in which George Graham was sacked and they ended up 12th.\nThat threat is far from over but what is just a third away win in 16 fixtures this season, coming from a much more assured performance, will bring at least a small injection of confidence and calm.\nGoalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, in for the injured Bernd Leno, was solid, Granit Xhaka returned effectively in midfield and Nketiah and Aubameyang were typically lively in attack.\n\"I asked the players to be together, to defend each other and to play for 90 minutes and that is what they have done today,\" said Arteta.\n\"We gave the ball away very easily in the second half. They committed a lot of men forward and we had to defend but the commitment and the way they competed was really good.\"\nHowever, it would not be this current Arsenal without some shadows lurking in the background.\nFull-back Kieran Tierney, who has been hampered by injury problems since joining the Gunners from Celtic last summer, limped out of the game in the second half.\nAlso, Matteo Guendouzi was left out of the squad entirely. While manager Mikel Arteta stated that his exclusion was down to \"squad management\", he also did not entirely dismiss speculation that the Frenchman blotted his copybook by clashing with Neal Maupay at the end of the Brighton game on Saturday.\nNo home comforts for Saints\nSouthampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl is an animated manager at the best of times but spent much of Thursday's game prowling the touchline with a frustrated look and sweat on his brow.\nHaving handed the Austrian a new four-year deal at the start of this month, the Saints recognise a man with a plan and a project worth pursuing.\nHis first job, though, is to rectify the disparity between their away and home results.\nAway from St Mary's they appear unburdened, pressing effectively and counter-attacking with menace, but back on the south coast they struggle to exert themselves, even without the pressure of fans in the stands.\nTheir display was not completely without merit but attacks tended to yield half-chances from long range for James Ward-Prowse, Stuart Armstrong and Nathan Redmond as opposed to the kind of clear-cut ones that have enabled the likes of Danny Ings to thrive this campaign.\nIngs' one big chance of the game came in the final quarter when he was released behind the defence by a long ball forward, but his drive was parried well by Martinez.\n\"It is always difficult when you give away too easy goals to such an opponent,\" said Hasenhuttl.\n\"But in the second half only we were playing, The decisions we made in the final third were not that bad and we had some good chances. It is a step forward, especially in possession.\"\nIt may get worse before it gets better, though, for Saints. Manchester City are the next visitors to St Mary's.\nMan of the match - Rob Holding (Arsenal)\nSaints top errors chart - the stats you need to know\nNo team has made more errors leading to opposition goals in the Premier League this season than Southampton (10). Arsenal registered only their third away Premier League win of the season (W3 D8 L5) with all three wins coming under different managers (Emery, Ljungberg and Arteta).\nSouthampton have lost more home Premier League games than any other team this season (10).\nMikel Arteta has won as many as game in 18 matches as Arsenal manager in all competitions (W9 D5 L4) as Unai Emery and Freddie Ljungberg managed in 26 games combined this season (W9 D11 L6).\nSouthampton have lost 10 home league matches in a season for only the second time in their history, also losing 10 in the 1993/94 season.\nEddie Nketiah has scored six goals in 11 starts in all competitions this season for Arsenal (4) and Leeds United (2).\nBoth of Jack Stephens' Premier League red cards for Southampton have come against Arsenal, also seeing red in April 2018 against the Gunners.\nJoe Willock scored his first Premier League goal for Arsenal in his 26th appearance in the competition and with his 13th shot.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton visit Watford in their next league fixture on Sunday at 16:30 BST. Arsenal are in FA Cup action this weekend, visiting Sheffield United in the sixth round on Sunday at 13:00."

Someone wrote the first time in seven years I had questioned the board, I think that's pretty good.\"\nBurnley are now up to 11th in the table after Jay Rodriguez scored the decisive goal, with a glancing header from Dwight McNeil's cross.\nThe Hornets, who had hoped to use a game in hand to pull clear of their rivals at the bottom of the table, remain 16th, a point above the relegation zone.\nWhile the Clarets enjoyed the better of the early stages, with Matej Vydra hitting the post and Rodriguez twice going close to scoring, Watford will consider themselves unfortunate not to have gained a point.\nDanny Welbeck was tackled when well placed to score, while Troy Deeney's powerful header from a corner was cleared off the Burnley line by McNeil.\nPrior to kick-off Burnley displayed a fan led video in support of Black Lives Matter with a players from both sides also taking a knee in support of the movement.\nFollow all Thursday's Premier League games\nBurnley back to winning ways\nHaving scored just once in a winless three-game run that, due to football's suspension, dates back to February, this was a welcome return to winning ways for Burnley and their manager Sean Dyche.\nIt may also help quell media speculation that the 48-year-old is considering leaving the Lancashire club after becoming frustrated by the approach taken on player contracts and transfers.\nDyche oversaw the club's return to European competition in 2018 - in the Europa League - after a 51-year absence but the Clarets have the fourth lowest transfer spend of top-flight clubs over a five-year period.\nAnd with injuries to with Ashley Barnes, Chris Wood and Johann Berg Gudmundsson they were also unable to name a full complement of substitutes for their 5-0 defeat in Manchester on Monday.\nHowever, this victory, like so many previously under Dyche, was built on application and determination in the hot and humid conditions.\nAdded to that, Vydra, Rodriguez and McNeil provided the intelligent running to create several openings that, on another occasion, might have brought more than one goal.\nWatford goalkeeper Ben Foster brilliantly parried an early Rodriguez effort to safety while the 30-year-old striker, who returned to the club in 2019, also saw a drilled effort cleared off the line by Craig Dawson.\nBut his clever movement was finally rewarded as he darted across Dawson to guide an exemplary header into the bottom corner from McNeil's fine delivery.\nWatford on the slide?\nWhile Nigel Pearson has overseen a revival that has carried Watford off the bottom of the table and out of the relegation places, this was another reminder that their work is far from complete.\nThe Hornets have now taken just six points from the last 27 available to them and have slipped into worrying form at just the wrong moment.\nSince convincingly defeating champions-elect Liverpool in February they have also managed just one goal.\nAnd while Danny Welbeck's athleticism was added to the brute force of Troy Deeney in attack, neither was given the service to truly flourish.\nOn the occasions the ball was worked forward to the pair they did appear threatening, with Deeney supplying Welbeck with a neat pass that the former Manchester United and Arsenal man should have done better with.\nBut aside from offering an aerial threat at set-pieces that moment and Deeney's header represented Watford's best attacking moments.\nWe were fortunate to be leave at half-time, we didn't impose ourselves on the game. Our second-half performance was much better.\n\"It is a missed opportunity but no point in dwelling on these situations,\" said Pearson.\n\"They are good at what they do and saw the game out. We have to move on. There is no point spending too much time talking about the negatives.\"\nMan of the match -Jay Rodriguez\nWatford's barren run\nBurnley extended their unbeaten league run at Turf Moor to five games (W3 D2), conceding just two goals in this time.\nWatford have failed to score in three consecutive away league outings for the first time since May 2018 (eight in a row).\nOnly league leaders Liverpool and second-placed Manchester City have won more Premier League games in 2020 than Burnley (five).\nWatford have only won one of their last nine Premier League matches (D3 L5); they had won four of their five such games before this (D1).\nOf Burnley's last 19 Premier League goals, 16 have been scored in the second half of their matches.\nBurnley's McNeil has assisted more Premier League goals (six) than any of his teammates this season; indeed, the winger has surpassed his assist tally for the whole of last season's competition (five).\nRodriguez's winning goal for Burnley came from what was their first shot of the second half against Watford.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Crystal Palace on Monday 29 June (20:00 BST) in their next Premier League outing.\nWatford host Southampton a day earlier, also in the Premier League, on Sunday 28 June (16:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-1 Man City: Liverpool win title as Chelsea beat Man City\nLiverpool were crowned champions of England for the first time in 30 years after Manchester City lost to Chelsea.\nOnly a win for City at Stamford Bridge would have allowed them to hold on to the Premier League trophy for a little longer and their two-year reign is now officially over.\nPep Guardiola's side lost a total of six league games in those two seasons combined, but their eighth defeat of this campaign leaves them 23 points behind the leaders, with seven games left.\nKevin de Bruyne's brilliant second-half free-kick cancelled out Christian Pulisic's breakaway goal for the hosts but Liverpool's title was confirmed with 12 minutes left when Fernandinho was sent off for handball on the line and Willian dispatched the resulting penalty.\nWhile City are still in the Champions League and continue their defence of the FA Cup at Newcastle on Sunday, their next act in the league will be as part of Liverpool's coronation when they welcome the Reds to Etihad Stadium next Thursday.\nHow Klopp turned Liverpool into title winners - the inside story\n\u00a31.47bn spent, 239 players, nine permanent managers - Liverpool's 30-year wait in numbers\n10 games which shaped Jurgen Klopp's reign\nChelsea v Man City as it happened\nThe outcome of this season's title race has been inevitable for many months but Liverpool's long wait to wrap up their 19th triumph, extended by the Premier League's three-month break amid the coronavirus pandemic, is finally over.\nCity's hopes of delaying them further ended in all-too familiar fashion, with crisp passing and forward moves undermined by fragile defending and lapses in focus.\nThey had been the better side until they gifted Chelsea the lead courtesy of a terrible mistake by Bernard Mendy after Chelsea had cleared a first-half free-kick.\nThe France left-back had Ilkay Gundogan in support but was far too casual as he gave Pulisic possession near the halfway line, then compounded his error by diving in and allowing the American to sprint clear and slot home.\nDe Bruyne's brilliant dipping free-kick arrowed into the top corner to bring City level shortly after the break and they almost took the lead moments later when Raheem Sterling hit the post after a stunning counter-attack.\nChelsea went close at the other end when Fernandinho let Pulisic in and he rounded Ederson, only to be denied by a brilliant goal-line clearance by Kyle Walker.\nThat was a huge let-off for City but they were not so lucky the next time Chelsea came forward.\nEderson denied substitute Tammy Abraham and then Fernandinho blocked Pulisic's follow-up but the video assistant referee confirmed what everyone watching on TV had already seen - that he had used his hand to clear.\nReferee Stuart Attwell showed the Brazilian a red card after pointing to the spot, and Willian planted his spot-kick into the net to ensure the night belonged to Chelsea - and Liverpool of course.\nChelsea boost their top-four hopes\nWhile this was a momentous result at the summit of the table, it was also hugely significant in the race for the top four.\nChelsea have seen Manchester United and Wolves close the gap this week but this was a convincing response, and not just because of a result that moves the Blues five points clear of the teams immediately below them.\nThey showed impressive resolve and organisation at the back in the spells when City were on top, but also always looked dangerous at the other end.\nPulisic's pace on the break was a big part of that but Chelsea carved out plenty of other chances, with Ederson brilliantly denying Andreas Christensen and Mason Mount wasting a glorious opening from a poor clearance by the City keeper.\nCity show familiar failings\nIt is no secret that City have struggled at the back this season, with Vincent Kompany's exit and Aymeric Laporte's long-term injury among the reasons why they have sometimes had a soft centre.\nFernandinho, for so long an imperious presence in front of City's defence, has been far less convincing since he was moved back to become part of it and this game was another example why that department has to be a priority for City when the next transfer window opens.\nCity still offered much to savour, of course, not least some superb touches from De Bruyne in addition to his free-kick. Bernardo Silva, operating as a 'false nine' in the absence of injured centre-forward Sergio Aguero, also frequently showed his quality.\nBut, as has happened on too many occasions this season, City still came up short when it mattered. If they are to get closer to Liverpool next time, they have a lot of work to do.\nMan of the match - Christian Pulisic (Chelsea)\nWhat next?\nBoth teams hit the road for the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday.\nChelsea travel to Leicester (16:00 BST) and holders City make the trip to Newcastle (18:30) in a tie that you can watch live on BBC One and the BBC Sport website."

We just have to do our best game by game.\"\nWolves, surprisingly, only managed two efforts on goal on Saturday, but the Belgium midfielder made it count with their second when he struck low past Orjan Nyland after an excursion into the area.\nAs for Dean Smith's men, they remain in 19th with 27 points. A draw could have lifted them out of the bottom three, which was as much as they looked like achieving at Villa Park.\nJack Grealish's first-half low, driven effort was their only shot on target.\nReaction from Villa Park\nWolves march on\nEven when the most potent pair do not combine for a goal, they still manage to influence the outcome.\nThe partnership of Adama Traore and Raul Jimenez has provided 10 goals in the league this season, but for the only goal at Villa Park, their mere presence together had a impact.\nFour Villa players surrounded the pair on the left side of the pitch before Jimenez dug out a ball into the area which resulted in Dendoncker's strike. Traore had only been on the pitch for two minutes at that stage with Nuno electing to rest the Spaniard, taking into account the busy schedule.\nThe only other clear opportunity for Nuno's men came when the ball fell to Diogo Jota who elected power instead of accuracy after the ball slipped out of Nyland's hand as he attempted to find a team-mate.\nAs an attacking force the visitors were not at their most threatening but a solid defensive display, led by the impressive Willy Boly, meant they did not have to change gears.\nWorrying signs from ineffective Villa\nSmith will not need reminding that time is running out. With Liverpool and then Manchester United on the horizon, Villa's position could fast become that little bit more precarious.\nIt has been a season of taking one step forward and two steps back for the promoted side. Following the boost from earning a deserved point at St James' Park in midweek, they perhaps should have taken the initiative against a Wolves side not at their most cavalier.\nVilla had enough of the possession around the area, but their movement was ponderous at times and the Wolves back line easily dealt with the tame deliveries.\nUnderstandably, they looked to Grealish - their conductor in attack and top scorer with nine goals - to create opportunities, and he impressed again. There was one dazzling moment of skill in the first half when he tip-toed past challenges on the left before winning a corner, and he also tested the palms of Rui Patricio with a low, firm shot.\nIn the build-up to this match, Smith said that his side needed to be more clinical, but they did not appear to heed those words. Neither of the strike-force of Mbwana Samatta and Keinan Davis got much service nor did they look like much of a threat.\nGrealish cannot get them out of this position alone - his team-mates need to urgently step up.\nMan of the match - Leander Dendoncker (Wolves)\n'Crazy to play four games in 11 days' - reaction\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"I'm happy with the hard work of the players, but we did not start well. We were not able to have our possession. We won a lot of second balls which was important in this game.\n\"The aim of the second half, after we scored, was to hold on and stay compact but after that we did not create many chances.\n\"I'm very happy for Leander Dendoncker - he gives so much to us and he truly deserves this moment.\"\nOn moving into fifth: \"What's in front of us will be very tough, but it's a welcome week to recover. We will prepare ourselves to compete and see what happens.\"\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were the better team before the break - not many teams have created chances against us. We more than matched a top-six team today, but they managed to get a goal from the edge of the box out of nothing, and we didn't convert the chances we had.\n\"We started the game well, put good balls in from set-pieces, but our headers were probably not as good as they should have been. I thought today was about fatigue - crazy to play four games in 11 days.\n\"Right from the start it is fine margins. I think we look a sound team, we are hard to beat and I am sure the teams we play will say that too, but we just probably need a bit of quality in the final third.\"\nAnother shutout for Wolves - the stats\nWolves have completed a league double over Villa for the first time since the 1962-63 campaign.\nWolves are unbeaten in Premier League games this season that have been level at half-time (W4 D8 L0), the only side with such an unbeaten record in the division.\nVilla have scored just two goals in their past six Premier League games, failing to score in four of those matches. The Villans only failed to find the net in five of their first 26 league games this season.\nWolves have kept four successive clean sheets in the top-flight for the first time since the 1981-82 season (five shutouts between October-November 1981).\nVilla have conceded more Premier League goals than any other side in 2020 so far (24), with their only clean sheet coming against Sheffield United in the first game of the restart.\nSome 33 of Wolves' 45 Premier League goals this season have come in the second half (73%); the highest ratio of any team in the competition this season.\nThere were just three shots on target between Villa and Wolves. Three of the past four instances of three shots on target or fewer in a Premier League game have involved Wolves (Wolves v Bournemouth - two, Bournemouth v Crystal Palace - three, Wolves v Brighton - two).\nWhat's next?\nVilla face champions Liverpool away next Sunday (16:30 BST) while Wolves are at home to Arsenal on Saturday (17:30 BST).\nLiverpool win the title: The 10 games that defined their season\n50 years of Glastonbury: Get the full Glastonbury experience..."

You can't concede goals like we have, give gifts to the opponents. It makes the job harder.\n\"We have to go back to showing a cohesion as a group of people. At the moment it is frustrating, because we are not achieving the performances we know we are capable of.\n\"We have games left in which it is in our own hands to make sure we secure our future in the Premier League. No-one is going to do it for us.\"\nSouthampton forward Danny Ings, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It was a physical battle and the lads really fought hard.\n\"After the last game, we were very disappointed. It was important we came here and did something about that.\n\"I just want to play each game and score as many goals as I can.\"\nMatch stats - Foster becomes oldest centurion\nSouthampton have won eight away league matches this season - the most they have ever managed in a top-flight campaign.\nWatford have won just one of their past 10 Premier League matches (W1 D3 L6), a 3-0 win over champions Liverpool in February.\nHornets goalkeeper Ben Foster, 37, is the 19th player - and the oldest - to make 100 consecutive Premier League appearances.\nDanny Ings has been directly involved in 12 goals in his past 11 away Premier League starts for Southampton (10 goals, two assists).\nSince the Premier League resumed this month, none of the teams currently in the bottom five have won a game - with three draws from 13 games.\nOnly Matt le Tissier (7) has scored more direct free-kick goals for Southampton in the Premier League than James Ward-Prowse (6).\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides have a little break before their next - difficult - games.

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-1 Burnley: Dyche committed to European hopefuls Burnley\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche said he remains committed to the club after they boosted their hopes of qualifying for Europe with victory at Crystal Palace.\nThe Clarets have had a challenging time since lockdown, with the failure to extend a number of first-team players' contracts meaning Dyche has only been able to name a seven-strong substitutes' bench, comprised mainly of individuals from the club's academy.\nHowever, after suffering a 5-0 loss at Manchester City in their first game back after the Premier League's 100-day suspension because of coronavirus, they have now won successive games 1-0 to take them up to eighth in the table.\n\"In the 100 days from the start of lockdown to the end, the dynamic of the club has changed somewhat, so that has been interesting to compute and to make sense of. But [today] you saw a group fully motivated, as am I,\" Dyche told Amazon Prime.\n\"We've got a group here who never go under. I'll be working hard. You saw me committed in the last game and this game and you saw a team full of commitment to playing for Burnley.\"\nWhen asked directly about his future by BBC Radio 5 Live, Dyche replied: \"Everyone keeps talking about my future apart from me. I'm getting on with my job as I always do - I'm still here.\"\nBurnley's victory came courtesy of a second-half header from captain Ben Mee, who threw himself in to meet an Ashley Westwood free-kick and steer an effort past Vicente Guaita, although the home keeper should really have saved it.\nIt was reward for a side hampered by the contract situation and who were also without three injured forwards.\nHowever, they were marginally the more positive of the two, with Dwight McNeil showing flashes of inspiration in the final third.\nPalace had Wilfried Zaha fit after he limped out of their previous game, at Liverpool five days ago, but his was a subdued display, like the rest of his fellow home forwards.\nTheir best chance fell to defender Gary Cahill, who fired straight at Nick Pope from inside the box.\nBurnley's win takes them to 45 points and eighth - a league position that could well result in a Europa League place if Manchester City's European ban is upheld.\nPalace, who also hold out hope of a late surge for a European place, are now 11th in the table, three points worse off than Monday's opponents.\nAction and reaction from Crystal Palace's draw with Burnley\nMee epitomises Burnley resolve\nBurnley continue to find ways to confound expectation.\nTheir first game back saw them hammered at Manchester City on a night overshadowed by a plane flying over the Etihad and arranged by some of their fans, pulling a \"White Lives Matter\" banner.\nPhil Bardsley, fresh from signing a new deal, was restored to the side at Selhurst Park, but they were again without Jeff Hendrick and Aaron Lennon (both out of contract this summer), and lost Jack Cork to injury during the game.\nBut a second successive win was built upon a rock solid defensive display and the ruthlessness to seize on a big chance when it came.\nCaptain Mee has stood tall for his side both on and off the pitch since the restart.\nIt was he who came out to passionately and eloquently condemn the banner flown by Clarets fans at the Etihad and he who stuck his head in where it hurts to score his side's winner at Selhurst Park.\nHe also contributed superbly to yet another clean sheet. That is 13 for the season now - only newly crowned champions Liverpool have more.\nDyche may not have the biggest squad, but the players he does have are full of character and resolve.\n\"In the first half we played very well. We've had to change things with the stretched squad we have and we did very well,\" said the delighted manager.\n\"In the second half Palace came out strongly and we lost our way a little bit but we stayed resolute and we had to change our shape, because we had kids on the bench and we didn't want to throw them in.\"\nWhen asked about the prospect of qualifying for Europe - a feat they achieved in 2017-18 - Dyche added: \"There's a long way to go because of how thin our squad is. There are no excuses though and the mentality is good, the physicality has to remain strong.\"\nPalace fail key test\nIt was no disgrace for Palace to have been dismantled at Liverpool in their previous game. Most teams have left Anfield on the back of a hiding this season.\nPrior to that they had won four on the bounce to propel themselves into the position to make an unlikely late dart for a European spot.\nTonight was a better gauge for where Roy Hodgson's side are at - and they were largely found wanting.\nTheir organisation is well-established - prior to the defeat at Liverpool they had won four on the bounce without conceding - but with the onus on them to find a way to unlock their opponents they had little to offer.\nZaha was shackled superbly by the combination of Bardsley and Josh Brownhill, Andros Townsend did little and Jordan Ayew headed the best chance that came his way over the bar.\nThe Palace forward also planted an arm into the face of Brownhill, prompting a VAR review for a possible red card, but the video officials sided in his favour.\nEuropean qualification is not completely beyond Hodgson's side this season, but this was a big test of their suitability and one they failed.\nAsked about his side's chances of European qualification, former England boss Hodgson responded: \"Europe depends a lot on our personnel. We're certainly not giving anything up.\n\"The matches are coming thick and fast these days. There will be strange results along the way but this was a great opportunity for us.\"\nMan of the match - Ben Mee (Burnley)\nBurnley break London hoodoo\nCrystal Palace have lost three of their last five Premier League home games (W2), as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 13 at Selhurst Park in the top-flight (W5 D5).\nBurnley secured their first Premier League win in their last 11 visits to London (D1 L9) and just their fourth overall in the capital in the competition (31 games).\nCrystal Palace's starting line-up had an average age of 30 years and 323 days, the second-oldest in the Premier League this season (after the Eagles against Bournemouth on June 20 - 30y 334d).\nBurnley registered their 13th clean sheet of the Premier League season, their most-ever in a campaign in the competition.\nCrystal Palace and Burnley have failed to score in the first half of more Premier League games this season than any other sides (24 each).\nAshley Westwood registered his 14th Premier League assist for Burnley, with only Johann Gudmundsson managing more for the Clarets (16).\nWhat next?\nBurnley face another big test of their European credentials when they host Sheffield United at Turf Moor on Sunday, 5 July at 12:00 BST.\nPalace play the day before, in a 15:00 kick-off at a side firmly in the mix for a European spot - Leicester.\n50 years of Glastonbury: Get the full Glastonbury experience...\nDreaming of Ibiza? 10 Brits try to kick start their careers on the world's most famous party island"

And he could have had a hat-trick, but struck the foot of the post.\nAlongside Fernandes, French World Cup winner Paul Pogba eased back into action following a long injury lay-off and caressed the ball around the pitch, while Nemanja Matic expertly patrolled the centre of the park.\nUnited were outstanding going forward but their performance at the back will be pleasing too, staying largely untroubled and keeping the eighth clean sheet from their past 13 top-flight games.\nThe Old Trafford side won only one of their last seven games last season to finish sixth but can be confident in the run-in this term with games against strugglers Bournemouth, Aston Villa and West Ham coming up, and a chance to collect silverware in the FA Cup and Europa League too.\nUnited sit fifth but it could be enough to gain entry into the Champions League next season as rivals Manchester City await the fate of their appeal for a two-year ban from the competition.\nBack to the drawing board for Brighton\nBrighton have been in good form since the restart, having won once and drawn twice, and had won their previous three top-flight games against United - but they were well beaten on this occasion.\nWith six games remaining, they will still be nervously looking over their shoulders at the five teams behind them, but showed glimpses that suggest they should be able to claw themselves away from danger.\nLeandro Trossard made an impact after coming on in the second half, flashing two shots wide with De Gea rooted to the spot, and the United goalkeeper had to react sharply to keep out Connolly's curling strike and Neal Maupay's drive.\nBrighton face a huge game against bottom-of-the-table Norwich on Saturday, knowing victory will give them some breathing space before hosting champions Liverpool and second-placed Manchester City in their following fixtures.\n'99% is not enough' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to BBC Sport: \"The players have reason to be confident because they are playing fantastically. There is quality in that team, our players are fit and we have competition for places now.\n\"We know Mason Greenwood can score goals like this but he is getting stronger, lockdown helped him. He had time to fill out and you can see the benefit from it. He will be exciting to follow.\n\"I've got more than one game-changer. We have some top players and Bruno has come and been fantastic. He has brought that winning mentality with him, that 99% is not good enough - it has to be 100%.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter to Sky Sports: \"We played against a really good side tonight. Manchester United were the better team and they had some quality. Our response in the second half was really good and maybe deserved a goal but the better team won. I am proud of how the players stuck at it and kept going.\n\"We got killed on the counter attack for the third goal but we had some good play but against United you are always on the stretch. It is a tough evening for us but one we will take a lot from and learn from it.\n\"We always look at ourselves to try to improve and they are as good as anyone we have played this year. It is hard to contain but a positive performance in the second half.\"\nMan of the match - Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd)\nWhat next?\nBrighton travel to Norwich on Saturday (kick-off 12:30 BST), while United host Bournemouth on the same day (15:00).\nFantastic Fernandes - the stats\nManchester United extended their unbeaten run to 15 matches across all competitions (W11 D4); only Bayern Munich (25 games) are currently on a longer streak without defeat among all sides in Europe's big-five leagues.\nBrighton have won fewer Premier League games in 2020 than any other side (P13 W1 D7 L5).\nThis was Brighton's biggest home league defeat of the season, with their last Premier League loss by a three-goal margin at the Amex coming on the final day of the 2018-19 campaign (4-1 v Man City)\nManchester United have kept more clean sheets in their last 13 league games (eight) than they managed in their first 40 under manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r (seven).\nManchester United completed a league double over Brighton for the first time since the 1981-82 campaign, with tonight their first away win over the Seagulls since April 1982.\nMason Greenwood's six goals for Man Utd in 2019-20 is the most by a player aged 18 or younger in a single Premier League season since Wayne Rooney scored nine for Everton in 2003-04.\nSince his debut for Manchester United in February, Bruno Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals in all competitions than any other Premier League player (10 - six goals, four assists).\nFernandes has been directly involved in eight goals in his first eight league games for Man Utd (five goals, three assists) - only Robin van Persie had more goal involvements (nine) after as many games at the start of his Premier League career with the club.\nAaron Wan-Bissaka's assist for Greenwood's opener was his fourth in the Premier League for Manchester United (29th appearance); one more than he provided in 42 league games for former club Crystal Palace.\n50 years of Glastonbury: Get the full Glastonbury experience...\nFestival food: Which dishes should you recreate at home?"

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-4 Newcastle: Cherries fighting for survival after thrashing\nBournemouth's Premier League survival hopes were dealt another blow as Newcastle beat them comprehensively with an exciting performance at Vitality Stadium.\nJefferson Lerma's mistake was punished by Dwight Gayle to give Newcastle an early lead and Cherries manager Eddie Howe shook his head in frustration as Sean Longstaff made it 2-0 within half an hour.\nBournemouth hit the woodwork twice in the second half but could not recover once Miguel Almiron netted a third for Newcastle.\nSubstitute Valentino Lazaro made it 4-0 after he was slipped in by Jonjo Shelvey and he hit the post moments later, before Isaac Hayden skewed the rebound over from a few yards out.\nDan Gosling bundled in a consolation goal in stoppage time for Bournemouth, who now sit second-from-bottom of the Premier League with six games remaining.\nPainful times continue for Cherries\nRelegation now seems a matter of when and not if for Bournemouth, who desperately needed points from this game.\nManager Eddie Howe said their situation \"hurt deeply\" following their recent 1-0 defeat by Wolves; against Newcastle, his players looked like a team resigned to going down rather than one fighting to stay up.\nLerma's early mistake summed them up - his poor first touch invited pressure from Longstaff, who won possession back for Newcastle. From that point on, Bournemouth looked shaky, short of confidence and reluctant to play out from the back.\n\"The players are playing slightly tense, you could say understandably with the position they are in,\" Howe said afterwards. \"I urged them to play the game and not the situation but they are struggling a bit under the weight of that.\"\nBournemouth were punished by Gayle, who showed composure in front of goal for the opener, while Saint-Maximin continued to torment the defence for the impressive hour he was on the pitch.\nHowe's half-time team talk seemed - momentarily - to kick some life into his side as Dominic Solanke's deflected shot bounced off the inside of the left post but Joshua King was offside when he headed in the rebound.\nAny hopes of a comeback, though, were dashed minutes later when Almiron clipped it into the top left corner to make it 3-0 to Newcastle.\nDavid Brooks curled a shot on to the crossbar for Bournemouth, for whom it looked like being a blank evening until Gosling got on the end of Nathan Ake's header seconds before the full-time whistle.\nHowe, who looked dejected throughout, walked off the pitch with his head hung low, while some of the Bournemouth players crouched down on the pitch at full-time.\nThe result leaves second-bottom Bournemouth fighting for their safety with six games remaining and they still have to travel to Old Trafford and Etihad Stadium, as well as welcoming Tottenham and Leicester to Vitality Stadium.\nSaint-Maximin 'capable of doing anything'\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce said before the game his side had a \"wonderful opportunity\" to break into the Premier League's top 10 by the season's end.\nHis optimism has clearly rubbed off on his players as they got off to a rapid start - Gayle scoring within five minutes, setting the tone for a comfortable first-half performance.\nThe visitors' creativity was showcased in full by their star man Saint-Maximin, who Bruce said after the match is \"capable of doing anything\".\nThe summer signing, who picked up three assists in this match, produced the goods after half an hour when he deceived three defenders on the left and put a chance on a plate for Longstaff to fire into the roof of the net.\n\"I like my second assist because it is good dribbling,\" Saint-Maximin told Sky Sports at full-time. \"I said to Longstaff to wait for this and he was to score a great goal so I am really happy.\"\nAnd while Bournemouth's heads went down, Newcastle continued to play with freedom and expression - Saint-Maximin taking on defenders at any opportunity, while Shelvey's passing was full of vision and precision, and Almiron was a burst of energy when he came on.\n\"He has wonderful talent,\" added Bruce, when discussing Saint-Maximin's impact on the victory. \"Every time I go to a ground and people haven't seen him play, they always say what a talent he is. He can only get better.\"\nNewcastle will have a spring in their step after picking up three consecutive away wins for the first time since November 2016 and they now sit two points off Sheffield United in 10th place with six games remaining.\n'We contributed to our own downfall' - what they said\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was another difficult start for us. The two games have been built up so much here at home [against Crystal Palace and Newcastle]. The importance of them... both times we have conceded an early goal and it has really knocked our stride and confidence.\n\"We contributed to our own downfall. There were some uncharacteristic mistakes. It may be a lack of confidence. It was close to being a lot better than it looked. There were some good bits mixed in there but they get lost and deservedly so with the result.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Some of the football we played and the goals we scored were a delight to watch. All credit to the players.\n\"I felt we had lost that cutting edge, creating an opportunity to try to win a match. We enjoyed playing, that was pretty evident. There was a certain cutting edge to them. Long may it continue.\"\nMan of the match - Allan Saint-Maximin\nA decent run on the road - the best of the stats\nNewcastle scored four goals in a Premier League game for the first time since May 2019, when they won 4-0 away at Fulham.\nBournemouth have suffered 16 defeats in their past 21 Premier League matches (W3 D2), losing each of the past four in a row.\nNewcastle have won three consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time since November 2016 (four in a row) when they were in the Championship - as a Premier League side, it is their best run since November 2014 under Alan Pardew.\nSince joining the Premier League in 2015-16, Bournemouth have conceded more home goals in the competition than any other club (145).\nNewcastle are unbeaten in their past five Premier League games (W3 D2), their best run since going undefeated in their final six games of the 2015-16 season.\nAfter a run of no goals in the first half of any of their previous nine Premier League games, Newcastle scored twice inside half an hour in this match.\nSaint-Maximin became only the third player to assist three goals in a Premier League game for Newcastle, after Andy Cole (in March 1994 at West Ham) and Moussa Sissoko (in October 2015 against Norwich).\nNewcastle have ended a run of 19 Premier League games on a Wednesday without a win (D4 L15). This was their first since a 2-0 away win at Chelsea in May 2012.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Old Trafford next, taking on Manchester United on Saturday, 4 July (15:00 BST kick-off). Newcastle return to St James' Park to welcome West Ham on Sunday, 5 July (14:15 BST)."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-1 Leicester: Hosts boost European hopes with victory\nEverton kept up their post-restart push for a place in next season's Europa League with an impressive victory over Leicester at Goodison Park.\nThe Blues are unbeaten since the Premier League began again two weeks ago, with a second successive win coming courtesy of two goals in quick succession in the game's first quarter.\nRicharlison struck from close range before Gylfi Sigurdsson scored a debatable penalty, awarded following a lengthy VAR review for handball against Wilfred Ndidi.\nLeicester rallied at the start of the second half and pulled a somewhat fortuitous goal back when Mason Holgate's attempted clearance flew into the net off the face of substitute Kelechi Iheanacho.\nBut they were unable to make the most of the larger share of possession and chances to gain parity.\nIt is another blow for the Foxes, who exited the FA Cup at the hands of Chelsea at the weekend and now face a real test to hang on to their top-four spot in the table.\nTwo points from their past three games has opened the door to Manchester United and Wolves, both of whom are only three points behind Leicester and in much better form.\nEverton, though, are looking up the table, with this win leaving them one point behind eighth-place Tottenham - a position that could be good enough to secure a European spot for next season.\nRicharlison limped from the field in the second half following a challenge by Ndidi, although manager Carlo Ancelotti eased fears after the game by stating the Brazilian should be fit to face Tottenham in five days time.\nAction and reaction from Wednesday's Premier League games\nLawro's predictions v grime MC and Liverpool fan Big Zuu\nAncelotti continues to make his mark\nEverton came into the game off the back of a seven-day rest from action - a rarity in this post-lockdown rush to conclude the 2019-20 season.\nIt enabled Ancelotti to make only minor tweaks to a side that had initially struggled in a 1-0 win at Norwich in their previous game.\nSigurdsson, who came on to contribute to an improved second-half display at Carrow Road, was restored to the team, as was fellow midfielder Anthony Gordon for his second Premier League start.\nThe pair both contributed to Everton's first-half onslaught, which brought the two goals that won them the match.\nGordon's whipped cross from the left laid Richarlison's 11th goal of the season on a plate, while Sigurdsson demonstrated calmness to slot away the spot-kick soon after.\nThe Iceland international had to wait to dispatch it, with the video official needing numerous replays to decide if the ball had struck Ndidi's outstretched arm during his aerial challenge with Michael Keane.\nEverton could be forgiven for being shocked at the award of the penalty - it was their first in 38 league games, and the first they have scored at Goodison since Wayne Rooney against Swansea in December 2017.\nThey were forced to dig deep for the win, though, especially after the double blow of conceding and losing Richarlison to injury.\nEverton gave away 65% of possession and numerous chances to Leicester, and almost gifted them an equaliser through a mix-up between Keane and keeper Jordan Pickford before the defender hacked the ball off the line.\nLeicester's top-four grip loosens further\nUnlike their opponents, Leicester's involvement in the FA Cup meant they had only two days after the FA Cup quarter-final defeat to recuperate and refocus on the league task at hand.\nThat involves securing a Champions League spot to reward what has been a season of significant progress under manager Brendan Rodgers.\nBut that is looking a lot less certain than it did before sport was halted because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt is not just that Leicester have dropped points; it is that they look so bereft of creativity and threat for long periods, especially before the break, when a Jonny Evans' effort from close range that was saved by Pickford was the best opportunity they fashioned.\nThe absence of James Maddison, who sat out the cup defeat, did not help in the first half, but his introduction for the second - along with Iheanacho - at least gave them some impetus.\nThey moved the ball quicker, pressed better and had more players on the pitch who could damage the home side, even if this was only by sticking their head in where it hurts as Iheanacho did to reduce the deficit.\nJamie Vardy was involved in the build-up to the goal but he was otherwise given very little to work with as he went in pursuit of a 100th Premier League goal.\nLeicester's race is far from run, though, with this unorthodox, condensed end to the season meaning the chance to rectify matters is only ever a few days away.\nMan of the match - Michael Keane (Everton)\n'The dream of the Europa League is very important to Everton'\nEverton boss Carlo Ancelotti told BBC Sport: \"We started well, got in front and had control. But second half was totally different,\" \"Leicester changed shape, put more pressure on us and we had difficulties.\n\"We didn't play well but we were focused defensively.\n\"The team are showing a good spirit and motivation. The dream of the Europa League is very important for us and for this reason we are going to fight. There are a lot of teams fighting for the Europa League and it will be an exciting run.\"\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers: \"We're disappointed with the start, it's something that has crept back into the game. We gave away a soft goal, but I thought the penalty was harsh.\n\"I assume the responsibility for the results. That's what I'm here to do.\n\"We're in a strong position. We still have it within our hands to achieve what would be a dream for us. Since we've come back we've not got the performance right. The second half was better. We need to win on Saturday.\"\nOn Everton's penalty: \"I think it was so harsh. We've had so many of those that we haven't had this year. It was difficult to go behind with that. It wasn't clear and obvious.\"\nEverton making Goodison a fortress\nEverton are unbeaten in their past nine league games at Goodison Park (W5 D4), their longest run without defeat there since April-December 2016 (11 games).\nLeicester have failed to win any of their past five away league games (D2 L3), after winning six of their past seven away matches before that.\nSix of Everton's seven league wins under Carlo Ancelotti have been by a one-goal margin, including both since the competition restarted last month.\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers suffered his first defeat against Everton in the Premier League since March 2012 (Everton 2-0 Swansea), having been unbeaten in eight games against them before this match.\nSince the start of last season, Neymar (28) is the only Brazilian player with more goals than Everton's Richarlison (24) in the top five European leagues.\nEverton had gone 38 league games without a penalty, their joint-longest run in the competition (also in 2008).\nSince making his Premier League debut in August 2015, Kelechi Iheanacho has scored eight goals as a substitute. Only Olivier Giroud (16) has more in that time frame.\nLeicester striker Jamie Vardy is goalless in his past four away league games - his longest run since seven barren matches from September to December in 2017.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host Crystal Palace on Saturday at 15:00 BST, while Everton visit Tottenham on Monday at 20:00."

When Chelsea came under pressure in the first half, he failed to command his area and they were fortunate to see Soucek's goal chalked off by VAR before the Czech rose to head West Ham in front from another corner.\nHe still has much to prove and Chelsea boss Frank Lampard will expect better as he tries to cement a season of improvement with a place in the top four and another season in the Champions League.\nThis was a real disappointment for Chelsea, especially as the force appeared to be with them after William's second goal and they looked the most likely winners.\nBut they were caught out by a lightning break that ended in Yarmolenko's goal and the chance to close even further on fading Leicester City and maintain the gap between themselves and in-form Manchester United was lost.\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio (West Ham)\n'Everything was going against us' - what they said\nWest Ham boss David Moyes, speaking to BBC Sport:\nOn VAR decision: \"At that moment I thought everything was going against us. The first goal is vital and when you lose it you think here we go again but great credit to the players, they kept at it and I thought we got the reward. The equaliser was deserved.\"\nOn the winning goal: \"We had to counter because they had pinned us right back. We were always waiting for a moment or a chance. We hoped luck would change for us, we felt it had not been with us in some games, we worked harder and deserved that luck.\n\"We need him (Antonio) so much. He led the line really well. You have to win a game people have not been expecting. I think it was a shock after we saw the performance of Chelsea at Manchester City. Chelsea played a lot of good football. We've done well but our football has to get better.\"\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"We dominated the game in terms of possession, but make mistakes and teams will hurt you. I'm not happy with any of the goals. You don't get given victories for scoring two goals, you have to be better than that.\n\"There were moments they counter-attacked, which we knew they would. There were details in the game which we knew but we lost because we didn't get them right. Against West Ham you have to make recovery runs. That is the bit we got wrong.\n\"It is why we are fighting for top four not one or two, because we don't get things right as much as the big boys do. I am not happy but at the same time we are two points ahead of Manchester United, who have been going great for some time.\n\"If you don't get details right in big games, you're going to drop points. At times we have played really well this season. As a group we need to find more consistency.\"\nWillian in the goals all year round - the stats\nWest Ham ended a 20-game losing run when conceding the first goal in Premier League fixtures, with this the first time they avoided defeat after conceding first in the competition since February 2019 - a 3-1 win over Fulham.\nOnly opponents West Ham (22) and Aston Villa (19) have dropped more points from leading positions in this season's Premier League than Chelsea (18).\nThis was West Ham's sixth Premier League win over Chelsea after conceding the first goal; only against Southampton (seven) have the Hammers come from behind after conceding first to win more times in the competition, while only Arsenal (seven) have beaten Chelsea more after conceding first to them in the division.\nThis was Chelsea's 10th Premier League defeat of the season; only in 2015-16, when they finished 10th, have they suffered more in a single campaign in the Roman Abramovich era (12).\nWest Ham have now won three of their seven home league games under David Moyes since his return to the club (D2 L2), one more than they won in their nine Premier League matches at the London Stadium under Manuel Pellegrini this season (W2 D1 L6).\nChelsea's Willian became the first player in Premier League history to score in all 12 calendar months in the competition.\nWillian has scored in back-to-back Premier League appearances for Chelsea for only the second time, and the first since October 2015. The Brazilian was the first player to score both a direct free-kick and a penalty in the same Premier League game since Cesc Fabregas also did so for Chelsea against West Ham back in March 2016.\nAll 29 of Michail Antonio's Premier League goals for West Ham have been scored inside the penalty area. Among current Premier League players, only Gabriel Jesus (37) has scored more goals with 100% coming inside the box.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Watford in the Premier League on Saturday, 4 July (20:00 BST), while West Ham travel to Newcastle the following afternoon (14:15)."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 3-1 Tottenham: Blades end losing run to strengthen top six bid\nSheffield United picked up their first win since the Premier League restarted as they produced a hugely impressive display against Tottenham to keep alive their hopes of playing European football next season.\nBlades' record signing Sander Berge opened his account for the club with a neat finish in the first half, completing a fine, attacking move by the hosts.\nHarry Kane thought he had equalised moments later but his strike was controversially ruled out by VAR because of a handball by Lucas Moura in the build-up.\nRelive Sheffield United's win against Tottenham\nSpurs were unable to mount a response after that as they struggled to break through a strong Sheffield United defence.\nInstead, Chris Wilder's men added a second midway through the second half when Lys Mousset turned in Enda Stevens' cutback from close range.\nAnd an ultimately comfortable victory was completed in the closing stages as Oli McBurnie swept in for his fifth goal of the season.\nKane, who had another goal ruled out for offside at 2-0, finally got on the scoresheet when he steered in Son Heung-min's cross for his 13th goal of the season, but it was to be only a consolation strike.\nVictory moves Sheffield United above their opponents into seventh in the Premier League, five points behind Manchester United and Wolves, who are fifth and sixth respectively.\nTottenham, who have not finished outside the top six since 2009, are ninth, seven points adrift of Wolves.\nBlades back to their best\nIt had been a tough return to Premier League football for United, with Wilder's side having not won all three games after the restart without scoring a goal.\nTheir lack of attacking threat had not helped their cause as the Blades failed to manage more than a single shot on target in each of those three league fixtures.\nBut they started against Spurs with much more intent in the final third and both George Baldock and David McGoldrick found the target early on, albeit with tame attempts.\nHaving conceded six goals in their previous two Premier League outings, the Blades had recently lost some of the confident, attacking swagger they had displayed earlier in the season, but that all came flooding back at the moment they opened the scoring.\nThe goal came from a flowing move that opened up the Tottenham defence before Berge turned in Chris Basham's cutback.\nFrom then on, Sheffield United looked much more like their old self - strong in defence and capable in attack - and the win, particularly given the strength of the opponents it came against, will provide a much needed boost as they look to claim a top-six finish - something that would be an incredible accomplishment on their first season back in the top flight.\nSpurs disappointing, despite VAR frustration\nTottenham will perhaps look back at the decision to now allow Kane's equaliser as a crucial turning point in the game.\nThe England striker had appeared to score a perfectly good goal as he slalomed through the home defence to slot in, but it was ruled out by VAR for a handball by Moura.\nIt was undoubtedly unfortunate, with Moura having appeared to have the ball kicked against his arm as he fell under pressure from a number of United players.\nDespite that disappointment the visitors still had plenty of time to turn things around. However, Spurs were lethargic and struggled to find their rhythm, while in the second half they were simply outworked by their determined opponents.\nJose Mourinho's side have won just one of their last six Premier League games and look certain to miss out on a top-four finish for the first time since 2015 as they sit nine points adrift of Chelsea.\nSpurs have not finished lower than sixth in 11 years but even that is looking increasingly unlikely unless their form improves soon.\nMan of the Match - Oli McBurnie (Sheffield United)\nKane completes the set - the stats\nSheffield United have extended their unbeaten run at home to Tottenham in the top flight to six games (W4 D2) since their last defeat in December 1975 (2-1).\nTottenham have lost their first Premier League away game against a promoted side since a 1-0 defeat to Queens Park Rangers in April 2012, ending a run of 23 such matches (W19 D4).\nSheffield United have gained their first league victory since the Premier League restart in June, with more shots on target against Tottenham (five) than they managed in their previous three such games combined (three).\nJose Mourinho has lost seven Premier League games as Tottenham manager, one more defeat (6) than he suffered in his first two seasons in the competition as Chelsea boss (2004-05/2005-06) combined.\nNo team have scored more goals via substitutes than Sheffield United (seven) in the Premier League this season, while no player has scored more as a substitute than Lys Mousset (three).\nSander Berge has scored his first goal for Sheffield United in the Premier League on his eighth appearance, with his first shot on target in the competition.\nSheffield United's Chris Basham has registered his first Premier League assist since August 2010 for Blackpool, nine years and 323 days ago. This is the fourth longest gap between assists in the competition, and longest since Robbie Blake went 10 years and one day between October 1999 and October 2009.\nTottenham's Harry Kane has now scored against all 29 of the Premier League teams he has faced - he is the only player to face more than one club in the competition and score against all of them.\nWhat next?\nSheffield United travel to Burnley on Sunday, 5 July (12:00 BST) while Tottenham host Everton on Monday, 6 July (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Man City 4-0 Liverpool: Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling & Phil Foden score\nLiverpool's Premier League title-winning celebrations were slightly dampened as they were thrashed by deposed champions Manchester City.\nJurgen Klopp's side ended an agonising 30-year wait for the top-flight title when City lost at Chelsea last week, but were resoundingly hammered on their return to action.\nThe Reds, who were given a guard of honour by the hosts before kick-off, could have taken the lead at Etihad Stadium but Mohamed Salah's low drive cannoned off the post.\nIt proved costly as Pep Guardiola's men took complete control with a devastating first-half display in which they scored three goals within 20 minutes.\nThe sublime Kevin de Bruyne converted the opener from the penalty spot after Joe Gomez hauled down Raheem Sterling and the England international finished off a swift counter-attack for the second.\nMidfielder Phil Foden further enhanced his reputation as a star in the making, coolly slotting home before half-time following a quick one-two with De Bruyne.\nCity scored their fourth in the second half when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain inadvertently slid the ball into his own net from Sterling's low drive.\n'Man City want the title back - and Foden could prove key'\nRelive Manchester City's thrashing of Liverpool\nFootball Daily podcast: Sublime Sterling & fantastic Foden\nCity prove a point\nManchester City have been champions for the past two seasons, pipping Liverpool by a point in 2018-19, and will have been frustrated at how they surrendered their grasp on the trophy in such meek fashion.\nIt is only the third time in 11 campaigns as a manager that Spaniard Guardiola has not ended the campaign by lifting the domestic title at either City, Barcelona or Bayern Munich.\nA close contest was expected between the top two sides in England, but it turned into an absolute stroll for City and pointed to signs that they will aim to come back stronger next year.\nDe Bruyne pulled the strings and was unplayable at times with his array of passing, while Foden highlighted why he is a ready-made replacement for the departing David Silva with his intelligence both on and off the ball, contributing a goal and an assist.\nThe home side may be disappointed to have scored just the four in a dominant showing with Sterling seeing a shot deflected wide and Foden having a low strike cleared off the line by Virgil van Dijk.\nRiyad Mahrez came off the bench and thought he had netted a fifth with a low drive at the near post, but the effort was ruled out by the video assistant referee for handball in the build-up.\nThough they kept a clean sheet this time, City have struggled at the back by conceding 33 goals in 32 league games, and may well look to use the money from Leroy Sane's sale to Bayern to add a new centre-back.\nHaving already claimed the Carabao Cup and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup while remaining in contention in the Champions League, City have plenty to look forward to from now until the end of the season and could well finish with another treble of trophies.\nRampant Reds suffer hiccup\nGerman manager Klopp has turned Liverpool into a footballing force since taking over in 2015 and finally delivered the one trophy the players, staff and supporters have craved the most - the Premier League.\nDespite suffering just their second league loss of the campaign, clinching the title with seven games to go is the earliest any team in English top-flight history has managed to achieve the feat.\nHaving thrashed Crystal Palace at Anfield on 24 June and become champions the following day, Liverpool may point to a week of celebrations for their off-day in Manchester.\nThe Merseysiders started sharply, pressing and harrying their opponents and even striking the post through Salah on 20 minutes, but capitulated once the first goal went in and never managed to recover.\nThe Egyptian curled another effort straight at Ederson, who was barely troubled by the subdued Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino.\nRecords still in sight\nLiverpool will want to pick themselves up quickly for their remaining six games and not let their superb season fizzle away.\nWriting in his BBC Sport column, former England striker Alan Shearer said that Liverpool had taken City's trophy and now have an eye on their records too.\nHere is what Liverpool can still achieve:\nTaking 15 points from a possible 18 remaining will take them to 101 points, one better than City's total from the 2017-18 season.\nClaiming those five victories will also mean they win 33 games during the season, beating City's number from the same campaign.\nCity won the title that season with a record 19-point margin to second - Liverpool are currently 20 clear.\nVictories in their three remaining games at Anfield against Aston Villa, Burnley and Chelsea will ensure they win all 19 league games at home.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City)\n'They didn't come here to celebrate'\nMan City boss Pep Guardiola said: \"I'm delighted. Congratulations to the team, we beat the champions with the quality they have.\n\"I saw in the guard of honour how incredibly focused they were, how they shouted. I saw their faces, that's why they're champions.\n\"They didn't come here to celebrate. They'd drunk enough beers and they came here to compete.\n\"So the chances we created, to beat them 4-0, it was so important for preparing against Arsenal and Real Madrid.\"\n'Man City are incredible'\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp told Sky Sports: \"Is the game important to us? I saw a brilliant attitude.\n\"They were quicker than us in mind. We lacked fluidity. Against Man City you have massive problems. We had moments. We had chances, we didn't use them. The result we have to take.\n\"If you want to lead this story in direction we were not focused, then do it. I liked my team's attitude. Isn't it nice another team can be champions when Man City can play so well?\n\"Man City are incredible. I saw their season, they didn't play a bad game.\"\nWhat next?\nManchester City host Southampton on Sunday (kick-off 19:00 BST), while Liverpool are home to Aston Villa on the same day (16:30).\nDe Bruyne the key for Man City - the stats\nLiverpool's two heaviest Premier League defeats under Jurgen Klopp have both been at Etihad Stadium against Manchester City (4-0 on Thursday, 5-0 in September 2017)\nManchester City have won their past four home Premier League matches by an aggregate score of 14-0\nLiverpool have failed to score in five consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time since April 1992, when they went eight on the road without a goal\nThis was the joint-heaviest defeat by a side already crowned Premier League champions in a season, with Arsenal losing 4-0 away at Liverpool in 1997-98, which was also the game after they won the title\nManchester City's Raheem Sterling scored his first Premier League goal against former side Liverpool in his ninth appearance against the Reds in the competition\nKevin de Bruyne has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other player this season (28), with the midfielder scoring 11 goals and assisting 17 in 30 appearances\nSince the start of the 2015-16 season, only Wilfried Zaha (15) has won more Premier League penalties than Manchester City's Raheem Sterling (14)\nOnly rivals Manchester United (11) have taken more Premier League penalties than Manchester City (10) this season, and only United have scored more (seven) than City (six)\nManchester City's Phil Foden has been directly involved in 14 goals in his past 17 appearances in all competitions (six goals, eight assists), despite only starting 10 of those 17 games"

The story of our game was the story of our season, we didn't find the cutting edge and we then make a big mistake.\n\"After a few losses, we don't have the right to make any fighting messages or to make any unrealistic claims. We are not naive, lets show our pride.\"\nFarke dropped Teemu Pukki and Cantwell - his two leading scorers - but the move backfired as the Premier League's bottom club mustered just one serious attempt on target.\nBelgian winger Trossard settled a scrappy match with a smart finish, sweeping home Aaron Mooy's perfect delivery in what was Brighton's first genuine attack.\nNineteen-year-old substitute Adam Idah was denied an equaliser when he headed against the post in stoppage time.\nBrighton's third away win of the season lifts them nine points above the relegation zone.\nReaction from Carrow Road as Norwich slip closer to relegation\nFarke's bold changes backfire\nThis was a must-win game if Norwich were to revive their fading hopes of staying in the Premier League. Instead they fell to a fifth straight league defeat without scoring.\nThey can still reach 36 points, and 17th-placed Watford have 28 points. But it is hard to see where their next goal - never mind win - is going to come from.\nThis was the first of three successive matches against teams in or just above the relegation zone yet Farke opted to start without Pukki and Cantwell for his side's fifth match in 15 days.\nFinland forward Pukki has scored 11 of his team's 25 league goals this season, but none in his past 10 league and cup games, while midfielder Cantwell has also chipped in with some key goals, including efforts against Manchester City, Arsenal and Wolves.\nFarke said the changes were to freshen up the side after an error-ridden 4-0 midweek defeat at Arsenal but there was a distinct familiarity to the way his team huffed and puffed without creating much.\nCuban forward Onel Hernandez was lively without testing keeper Mat Ryan, while Republic of Ireland Under-21 forward Idah was only denied by a post in the dying moments.\nIn two of their final three games before football was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic, Norwich beat Leicester in the Premier League and Tottenham on penalties in the FA Cup.\nSince the restart, they have failed to register a single point and are going backwards.\nAre Brighton safe?\nWhile Norwich have faltered since the restart, Brighton have thrived.\nThe Seagulls were just two points above the relegation zone when the season was suspended. They are now nine points clear of 18th-placed Aston Villa and 19th-placed Bournemouth, both on 27 points.\nGraham Potter's side have reached 36 points - a tally that has been good enough to stay up for the past three seasons - with five games to go, meaning the pressure of hosting champions Liverpool and second-placed Manchester City in back-to-back fixtures is eased considerably.\n\"No I don't think it makes us safe,\" said Potter afterwards. \"It's a huge win for us and a hard-fought three points.\"\nBrighton carved out more and better openings than their hosts, the move for Trossard's composed finish coming straight off the training ground. Yet once again they impressed especially at the back.\nWith Lewis Dunk and Adam Webster dominant at the centre of defence, they came away with an eighth clean sheet of the season and are now unbeaten in five straight league away games.\nAnd despite 11 places separating the two sides in the table, Brighton have conceded only as many goals - 44 - as fourth-placed Chelsea.\nMan of the match - Aaron Mooy (Brighton)\nFirst double over Norwich since 1951-52 - the stats\nBrighton have completed their first league double over Norwich since 1951-52 (they won 2-0 at the Amex in November).\nNorwich have failed to score in three consecutive home Premier League games for the first time ever.\nBrighton enjoyed their first win in their past nine away Premier League games (D5 L3).\nNorwich have lost each of their past six games in all competitions, the worst run suffered by Daniel Farke in his managerial career.\nBrighton have registered three consecutive away clean sheets in all competitions for the first time since December 2016.\nNorwich have failed to score in 16 Premier League games this season, more than any other side.\nWhat's next?\nThe games are coming thick and fast - Norwich are away at fellow strugglers Watford on Tuesday (18:00 BST), while Brighton host champions Liverpool on Wednesday (20:15 BST).\nRadio 1's Movie Mixtapes: Ali Plumb delivers top tracks from legendary films\nGrounded with Louis Theroux: Comedian and actor Chris O'Dowd joins from LA to chat to Louis"

And true to form their lead only lasted six minutes before they conceded a soft equaliser.\nDawson lost his marker and was too strong for Alexander Tettey to head into the net from close range from Etienne Capoue's delivery.\nFarke will also be unhappy with Watford's second, as Aarons should have done much better with his clearance before Welbeck's overhead kick.\nNorwich have now conceded more goals than any other team in the Premier League this season (63).\nPearson close to completing remarkable turnaround\nWhile Norwich, who still have to play both Chelsea and Manchester City away from home, will be preparing for Championship football next season, Nigel Pearson's Watford still have their fate in their own hands.\nThis victory takes them on to 31 points, four more than Aston Villa and Bournemouth, with the Hornets also having a better goal difference than those two sides.\nThey take on a Newcastle side in mid-table on Saturday, before an away match at another team looking to stay up, West Ham, on 17 July, before ending the season with games against Manchester City and Arsenal.\nIf Watford can survive in the top flight it will complete a remarkable turnaround under Pearson - their third manager of the season after Javi Gracia was sacked in September and Quique Sanchez Flores was dismissed in December.\nWhen Pearson took over, Watford had only eight points from 14 games and were six points adrift of safety, but have now gained 23 points from 20 matches since Pearson's appointment.\nMan of the match - Danny Welbeck (Watford)\n'We're going to do everything we can' - what they said\nWatford boss Nigel Pearson to Sky Sports: \"I thought we showed a lot of character - not always composure - but the result was more important than the performance.

        "article_text": "Wolves 0-2 Arsenal: Gunners keep pressure on the hosts in race for Europe\nArsenal's Bukayo Saka said he has had a \"week I will remember my whole life\" after he celebrated signing a new long-term contract by scoring the opener in the Gunners' victory at Wolves on Saturday.\nThe teenager struck his first Premier League goal with a sweet, left-foot volley to deliver a blow to the hosts' hopes of Champions League football next season.\nArsenal made sure of a fourth successive victory when Alexandre Lacazette capped a fine team display by turning on fellow substitute Joe Willock's pass and firing emphatically past Wolves keeper Rui Patricio with five minutes left.\n\"It has been such a great week, signing my contract and then getting my first Premier League goal,\" England Under-19 international Saka told BBC Sport. \"And it wasn't a bad goal either so I'm very happy.\n\"I have to stay humble and keep my feet on the ground to keep learning. It's important for us to have experience and world-class players around to advise us. It was tough for us today but we gave our all and that is what got us over the line.\"\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta described Saka as \"talented and intelligent\" after the player committed his future to the club on Wednesday, and was impressed once again at Molineux.\n\"The finish was really difficult,\" Arteta told BBC Sport. \"It was a turning point in the game.\"\nWolves had been hoping to build on an impressive restart to the season but knew the pressure was on to win after fellow top-four contenders Leicester City and Manchester United had recorded victories earlier in the day.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side were not at their best. Adama Traore had their clearest chance after the break when he raced in on Arsenal keeper Emiliano Martinez from Diogo Jota's pass, but the Spanish forwrd lifted his finish over the top in wasteful fashion.\nWolves are still sixth in the Premier League table on 52 points, but seventh-placed Arsenal are now only three points behind.\nReaction from Molineux and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nPerfect end to Arsenal's week\nSpirits have soared at Arsenal since they made a desperate restart to the Premier League season with defeat at Manchester City and then that acrimonious late loss at Brighton, a match that also cost them goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\nThey have since recorded league wins over Southampton and Norwich City, as well as progressing to the FA Cup semi-finals with victory at Sheffield United - but this win at Wolves was the most impressive demonstration yet of Arteta's growing influence.\nAnd it came at the end of a pleasing week for the club with exciting teenagers Saka and Gabriel Martinelli both signing long-term contracts.\nSaka showed his quality with that left-foot volley, taken with athleticism, composure and guided cleverly out of Rui Patricio's reach - but it came amid a fine all-round team performance.\nArsenal arrived at Molineux with Wolves storming into contention for the top four after three straight wins - over West Ham United, Bournemouth and Aston Villa - since the season's resumption.\nIndeed, such was their form, Saka's goal was the first they had conceded in 448 minutes.\nHowever, Arsenal were resolute, determined and willing to trade in the physical exchanges, and they produced the decisive moments of quality to win the game.\nIt continued the renaissance under Arteta, and while it is wise to keep all optimism in perspective given previous false dawns, this recent run leaves them only six points behind fifth-placed Manchester United, with that position potentially bringing Champions League football if Manchester City's European ban is upheld.\nWolves miss a big chance\nWolves carried real momentum into this meeting with Arsenal after their flawless restart - but they fell flat on Saturday and could have no complaints about the outcome.\nNuno's side remain in a superb position with a real chance of Champions League football next season, a tribute in itself to the outstanding work of the Portuguese manager and his players.\nHowever, they struggled to exert any serious pressure on the Gunners and dangerman Traore was relatively well contained, although he was always a threat and should have equalised with Wolves' best chance.\nIt was a disappointed group of players who trooped off at the end to the silence that is now the accompaniment to these behind-closed-doors games, but their previous record suggests they still have the determination and talent, as well as the manager, to bounce back.\nWolves will need to do it quickly, though, with time running out in this restarted season and their rivals picking up wins.\nMan of the match - Shkodran Mustafi (Arsenal)\n'When we had to suffer, the team enjoyed suffering together' - what they said\nWolves boos Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Sport: We needed more urgency in some moments. On and off the ball we were a little but unbalanced and the urgency to chase a result was not there. In the beginning, we were threatening, but the rest of the game we were too passive. This is something we cannot replace [the home fans]. The atmosphere is not here and we miss them.\n\"All the players need improvement. Sometimes it goes OK when he [Adama Traore] tries something. Today it was not good, but it was important he was there. Now we have to improve from this game and challenge ourselves [against Sheffield United] on Wednesday. What means something is how we want to play, and today we were not able to play well. Credit to Arsenal, they are a good team, but we should do better.\"\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta told BBC Sport: \"It was a massive win. We had two and a half days to prepare and they had a week. We played two games while they were training.\n\"They [Wolves] are a really well organised team and it's really tough to come here and win, we needed everybody to play with high attention and commitment. We had good possession and scored two goals. When we had to suffer, the team enjoyed to suffer together, which is massive for us.\"\nWolves lack cutting edge - the stats\nArsenal have won three consecutive league games without conceding for the first time since November 2017, while this is the first time they have won back-to-back away league games without conceding since October 2015.\nWolves suffered their first Premier League defeat in nine games, while this was their first league loss by more than one goal since September (5-2 to Chelsea).\nThis was Arsenal's first away league victory against a side starting above them in the league table since September 2015, when they won 5-2 at Leicester.\nWolves managed just one shot on target in this match, with that coming after just 17 seconds courtesy of Adama Traore.\nBukayo Saka's goal was his first in the Premier League for Arsenal - aged 18 years 303 days, he is the second youngest English player to score in the Premier League for the Gunners, after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain against Blackburn in February 2012 (18 years 173 days).\nAlexandre Lacazette's goal was his first away from home in the Premier League since February 2019, ending a run of 16 away games.\nDespite only coming on as a 76th-minute substitute, Joe Willock's two chances created - including the assist for Lacazette's goal - was more than any other Arsenal player.\nEmiliano Martinez has kept a clean sheet in six of his eight Premier League starts for Arsenal (75%), the best ratio of any Gunners keeper with at least five starts in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host Leicester City on Tuesday (20:15 BST), while Wolves travel to Sheffield United the following evening (18:00).\nRadio 1's Movie Mixtapes: Ali Plumb delivers top tracks from legendary films\nGrounded with Louis Theroux: Comedian and actor Chris O'Dowd joins from LA to chat to Louis"

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 Sheffield United: Egan rescues draw for Blades at Turf Moor\nJohn Egan scored with 10 minutes to go to earn Sheffield United a draw at fellow European hopefuls Burnley.\nThe defender struck a rising half-volley into the far top corner of the net after a short corner had been swung into the box and flicked on by Billy Sharp.\nIt was reward for a positive display from the Blades, who pressed forward for much of the second half after James Tarkowski had given the home side the lead with a sliding close-range finish.\nBoth sides will feel they had the chances to secure what would have been a big three points in their quest to secure a place in the Europa League.\nThe Blades had enough of the play and chances, with Oli McBurnie denied by Nick Pope in the very first minute, and could have had a penalty had the VAR officials deemed Erik Pieters' accidental handling of the ball in the box a punishable offence.\nAt the other end, Matej Vydra and Dwight McNeil both fired superb opportunities wide of goal for the Clarets.\nThe draw means Sheffield United stay eighth - a position that could be good enough for European qualification - two points ahead of ninth-placed Burnley.\nAction and reaction from Sunday's Premier League games\nA fair result between two well-matched sides\nThe game was an advert for the quality and resolve of two of the league's biggest over-achievers.\nSean Dyche continues to a do a stellar job at Burnley in incredibly trying circumstances, with his side hampered both by contract issues with some players and by injuries.\nHe was able to name nine substitutes for the first time since the restart, including Chris Wood, Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Robbie Brady, but had to cope without captain Ben Mee and midfielder Jack Cork because of injury.\nThe Clarets continue to find a way to achieve results, though.\nAfter all, this is a team who were three points above the relegation zone in January and are now eyeing a potential late run into the division's top third.\nThey have won as many games this season as in any of their previous Premier League campaigns, equalling the number they managed when finishing seventh in 2017-18.\nEven with Mee absent, they were defensively solid, with Kevin Long stepping in to ensure Pope was largely protected, barring an early effort from McBurnie that the keeper parried and Egan's shot that he had little chance of saving.\nThe Clarets will feel they should have wrapped up the points with 15 minutes left but after following up Jay Rodriguez's parried shot from long range, McNeil fired wide with just Dean Henderson to beat.\nThat they did not, left the door open for the Blades to claim a deserved point.\nIn Wilder, the Blades have their own Dyche - a manager who demands commitment from his players and offers them the promise of self-improvement in a successful side.\nAt no point during the game did the heads of the Blades players drop, nor their faith in the strategy wane.\nTheir territorial advantage did not result in an abundance of opportunities, but when their one big chance came they had the skill and composure to capitalise and claim their point.\nHaving taken four points from their past two games, following back-to-back 3-0 defeats, and with Jack O'Connell making a welcome return from injury, the Blades have cause for optimism.\nMan of the match - John Egan (Sheffield United)\n'These players are giving us everything'\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"I'm certainly not disappointed. We are maximum stretch at the moment with the squad. I thought we were very competitive in awkward conditions and made chances that should really have got the game done.\n\"Fair play to Sheffield United, they have some resilience to them, which we have seen all season. They got some luck as well with the corner and delivery as it has got a little nick.\n\"Normally players coming out of an injured spell would have reserve games but we can't do that. We just have to get them involved.\n\"Seven points from the four games is acceptable. All you can ask is for players to give you everything and they certainly are.\"\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder: \"I didn't think it was a game with a lot of quality. Conditions didn't help - blustery and a dry pitch. But it is always going to be difficult coming here. There was never going to be anything handed out to us.\n\"They (Burnley) get over disappointment quickly, are consistent in their attitude and performance and they always turn up. The hard part now for us is to match what they have done. We have to emulate it.\n\"John (Egan) has missed some chances this season. It is an area we have looked at. We should be a bit more of a threat.\"\nRare first-half strike for Burnley\nJames Tarkowski's opener was only the fourth time Burnley have scored a Premier League goal during the opening 45 minutes in their past 21 games, and the first since Chris Wood netted against Spurs back in March.\nBurnley have now drawn three of their past five home games in the Premier League (W2), this after a run of 19 games without one and their previous three draws at Turf Moor coming across a 36-game spell.\nSheffield United have won just one of their past eight away games in the Premier League (D3 L4) never scoring more than once and failing to win any of their most recent four (D2 L2).\nOnly Wolves, Liverpool and Arsenal have won more points from losing positions in the Premier League this season than Sheffield United (14).\nBurnley's draw with Sheffield United was the first draw in the competition in 22 matches since Newcastle and Aston Villa also drew 1-1 at St James' Park.\nIncluding the opening goal at Turf Moor, Sheffield United have conceded just five goals from set-pieces in the Premier League this season (including penalties), still the fewest of all sides so far in 2019-20.\nDuring the second half Jack Rodwell came on for Sheffield United to make his first Premier League appearance since May 2017 (Chelsea 5-1 Sunderland). Indeed, the midfielder has ended on the winning side just once in his past 27 top-flight appearances (Crystal Palace 0-4 Sunderland - February 2017).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley are back in action on Wednesday, 8 July with a fixture at West Ham (18:00 BST), while Sheffield United host Wolves on the same evening at the same time.\nMan Like Mobeen: Binge on all three series of the hit comedy from BBC Three\nTalking Heads: New versions of Alan Bennett's classics starring Jodie Comer, Martin Freeman and many more"

If you turned it around and we had got a point against Chelsea and three against Newcastle today, I think people would have said it was a great return.\"\nSubstitute Andriy Yarmolenko - whose goal sealed victory over the Blues on Wednesday - came closest to finding another late winner, but his stinging strike was well kept out by Martin Dubravka.\nWest Ham remain 16th in the table and move four points clear of the relegation zone after ending their run of seven consecutive away defeats in the top flight, while Newcastle stay 12th.\nA valuable point, but an opportunity missed\nWest Ham were surprise winners over London rivals and Champions League-chasing Chelsea in their last outing, but they will feel this was an opportunity missed to claim only their fourth away win of the season.\nAntonio played a vital role in the win over the Blues and his physical presence and relentless running provides David Moyes's side with a focal point to their attack.\nWith the game just four minutes old, the Hammers fired the ball to Antonio straight from the back. It was played wide to Jarrod Bowen, who delivered the cross for the lone striker to fire his second goal in as many games into the roof of the net, after Lascelles failed to clear the danger.\nThe second goal was equally reliant on instinct as Soucek reacted quickest to smash the rebound past Dubravka after Declan Rice's powerful header clattered off the crossbar from a corner.\nBut teams are always most vulnerable just after scoring, and a lapse in concentration by Pablo Fornals played Dwight Gayle onside in the build-up to Shelvey's equaliser just moments later.\nWest Ham have now lost 24 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side, but on recent evidence they should have enough to remain in the division.\nBelow par Saint-Maximin under the spotlight\nNewcastle are unbeaten in their last six Premier League matches and quietly going about their business under Steve Bruce, with a top 10 finish in their sights.\nAllan Saint-Maximin has been crucial to the Magpies' progress since Project restart, with three assists in the heavy victory over Bournemouth last time around.\nThe skilful Frenchman is exciting on the ball and he is the first player his team-mates look for in possession, but he took a knock towards the end of the first half and struggled to find any rhythm against the Hammers.\nHe showed glimpses, drawing a foul as he skipped past opposition skipper Rice in the first half, and playing a role in spreading the ball wide for his side's opener, but he had clearly been identified as the danger man and was the subject of special attention by the visitors.\nRice was never far away from the Newcastle number 10 and the visiting captain did well to lunge in and win the ball in a firm challenge in the second half, as Saint-Maximin set off having knocked the ball past the Englishman.\nParaguay attacking midfielder Almiron is beginning to look more comfortable in the black and white shirt, and having only scored twice in his first 40 Premier League appearances, he now has two in as many games.\nBut 23-year-old Frenchman Saint-Maximin is their talisman, and if he has a quiet game Bruce's side lack potency in attack - they only managed four shots on target all game on Sunday.\nMan of the match - Declan Rice (West Ham)\n'The run continues' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce told BBC Sport: \"I was delighted the way we have come back twice. We didn't start well and we knew they would be a threat from set-pieces. We have managed to dig deep and find a reaction, which doesn't surprise me with the way the players are. The run continues and deservedly so.\n\"The draw was probably a fair result. West Ham were a very well-organised team and you would not expect anything different from David Moyes. They are fighting for their lives so their defensive organisation set them up well and they are a big powerful side.\n\"The players have enjoyed a change in formation and system but we still have to do things better. We have five points to go to beat the [points] tally from last year, and that has to be the aim. But if somebody had said to us we would have taken 40 points with five games to play, we would have snatched their hands off.\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes told BBC Sport: \"The second goal, especially, was a disappointment because we have conceded within a minute of scoring.\n\"Newcastle are playing with an air of confidence and you have seen that in the results. First half, they made it hard for us, but we grew into the game. We are disappointed, but we are not completely upset we have come away from here with a point because it's not a bad point.\n\"I cannot fault the players for what they have given and we probably had two or three chances to win it, but we take the point and move on.\"\nAnother draw at St James' Park - the stats\nNewcastle have had more home draws than any other team in the Premier League this season (8), with this being their most in a single campaign since 2010-11 (also eight).\nDespite losing their lead on two occasions, West Ham have gone consecutive games without defeat in the Premier League for the first time since September 2019.\nNewcastle have scored 10 goals in four games since the Premier League season restarted, as many as they netted in their previous 14 league games before the break.\nMichail Antonio's opener for West Ham was his 30th goal in the Premier League, with 100% of them coming from inside the box - this is also the first time he has scored in back-to-back league games since April 2019.\nMiguel Almiron became the first Newcastle player to reach 10 goal involvements across all competitions this season, having scored eight and provided two assists.\nNewcastle's Jonjo Shelvey scored his sixth goal of the Premier League campaign, equalling his previous-best return in a top-flight season (six goals in 2013-14).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Manchester City on Wednesday, 8 July (18:00 BST), while West Ham host Burnley at the same time.\nMan Like Mobeen: Binge on all three series of the hit comedy from BBC Three\nTalking Heads: New versions of Alan Bennett's classics starring Jodie Comer, Martin Freeman and many more"

They were strong and disciplined in defence and looked lively in attack, particularly on the counter.\nBut, as is so often the case in recent games, Villa were unable to make the most of the few opportunities that came their way and once Liverpool went ahead, a 10th game without a win looked a formality.\nVilla's performance should give them heart but time is rapidly running out for them to pick up the points they need to survive.\nThey are only a win away from climbing out of the bottom three but with tough fixtures against in-form Manchester United and Arsenal to come, they need to find a way to make the most of the few chances that come their way.\n\"I don't want to be a valiant loser, we're scrapping for points,\" Villa boss Smith said.\n\"To out-shoot Liverpool at home at Anfield, in terms of efforts on goal, it's excellent - but we need to take our opportunities. We never found the quality in the final third they did.\"\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\nMane the man again - the stats\nLiverpool have now won their past 34 Premier League matches when scoring the first goal of the game, since a 1-1 draw with West Ham United in February 2019\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 57 Premier League home games (W47 D10)\nAston Villa have failed to keep a clean sheet in their past 24 Premier League away games, since a 0-0 draw with West Brom in January 2016. It's their longest such run in the top flight since September 1989 (38 games)\nAston Villa are without a victory in nine Premier League games (D2 L7), the longest current winless run in the competition\nLiverpool's Sadio Mane has been directly involved in eight goals in his past five Premier League appearances against Aston Villa (six goals, two assists).\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah registered his 100th Premier League goal involvement in his 116th appearance (73 goals, 27 assists) - only Alan Shearer (100 appearances) took fewer games to reach this milestone in the competition (Eric Cantona also 116 games).\nWhat next?\nLiverpool travel to Brighton on Wednesday (20:15 BST) while Aston Villa host Manchester United on Thursday (20:15)\nMan Like Mobeen: Binge on all three series of the hit comedy from BBC Three\nTalking Heads: New versions of Alan Bennett's classics starring Jodie Comer, Martin Freeman and many more"

He showed the trust we had in him to start him today was the right one.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola made six changes to the side which thrashed champions Liverpool 4-0 at Etihad Stadium on Thursday, with key playmaker Kevin de Bruyne among those initially rested.\nAdams' goal drew an intense reaction from City, as Fernandinho hit the post and the in-form Alex McCarthy kept out David Silva's header in the aftermath.\nThe visitors rarely let up thereafter but were repeatedly left frustrated by Saints goalkeeper McCarthy, whose one-handed save from Gabriel Jesus in the second half was the pick of several superb stops.\nSouthampton had chances of their own amid the increasing City pressure but neither Nathan Redmond nor Danny Ings could convert rare opportunities, while Ederson was alert to Stuart Armstrong's swerving shot.\nThere was to be no repeat of City's comeback to win the reverse fixture 2-1 in November and defeat leaves Guardiola's side 23 points behind Liverpool, who beat Aston Villa 2-0 earlier on Sunday.\nGuardiola at a loss to explain Man City defeats\nReaction to Southampton v Manchester City\nResolute Saints battle to brilliant win\nSouthampton welcomed Manchester City to St Mary's with 40 points already secured - a tally which saw them a reassuring 13 points clear of the relegation places prior to kick-off.\nThat return, with six games remaining, had already bettered their total haul in each of the past two seasons and allowed Hasenhuttl's side to approach Sunday's fixture without fear.\nAlthough City settled into the mesmerising passing that has hypnotised many other opponents, Southampton once again demonstrated the desire and determination which has seen them admirably recover from their humiliating 9-0 defeat by Leicester in October.\nAdams has had to wait for his opportunities in his first season at Southampton but his first goal in 456 days was one to savour as Stuart Armstrong robbed Zinchenko and the striker punished the wandering Ederson emphatically.\nThe hosts could have led after just six minutes but Nathan Redmond was unable to convert after Adams had gathered an uncharacteristic miskick by Aymeric Laporte.\nIngs went close from Kyle Walker-Peters' excellent cross, but it was in defence where Southampton supplied the heroics as the returning Jack Stephens led by example with brave blocks and vital clearances in front of the unbeatable McCarthy.\nEpitomising the commitment to the cause despite there being little to play for, striker Ings - unable to add to his tally in the race for the Golden Boot - was among those throwing their body in the way as Saints held on for a rare home victory. They have now taken 17 points from 17 home games this season.\nHasenhuttl's side were staring at a relegation fight halfway through this campaign, but in 13th with five matches to go they have officially secured their Premier League status for another season.\nJesus struggles to replace injured Aguero\nManchester City's immediate response to officially being dethroned as Premier League champions was to dismantle Liverpool at Etihad Stadium.\nRaheem Sterling ominously claimed \"next season starts now\" after that result but, as Sunday's team news suggested, City's priorities now lie with the FA Cup and Champions League in a season in which they have already dropped more league points than in the previous two combined (33).\nA return to the consistency which had delivered back-to-back league titles is the task for Guardiola, given the sheer brilliance his team can produce on any given day - yet Sunday's defeat demonstrated that may take some work.\nZinchenko's error was typical of the momentary lapses in concentration that have cost City so dearly this campaign, though the visitors had ample opportunities to turn the game in their favour as they fired 26 shots at goal.\nJesus, with six of those attempts, was once again unable to provide the clinical touch in Sergio Aguero's absence, while De Bruyne and Phil Foden were unable to unlock a dogged Southampton defence following their second-half introductions.\nThe desire to recover a result was certainly evident in City's performance with Riyad Mahrez and Sterling both also going close, but with second place all but secure an FA Cup semi-final meeting with Arsenal on 18 July is where attentions surely now lie.\nMan of the match - Alex McCarthy (Southampton)\nGuardiola's worst away league run - the stats\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola has lost three consecutive away league games for the first time in his managerial career\nSouthampton have ended a run of six consecutive Premier League defeats against Manchester City, with their first league victory against them since May 2016\nCity have lost nine Premier League games this season, last losing more in a single campaign in 2015-16 under Manuel Pellegrini, when they lost 10\nSouthampton have won 11 points against 'big six' sides in the Premier League this season - only Wolves (12) have won more outside of those 'big six' sides\nChe Adams' first goal for Southampton was the longest-range Premier League goal so far this season (39 yards). It arrived in his 25th appearance, with his 22nd shot in the competition\nMan City had 26 shots in this game. That's their highest tally in a Premier League match without scoring since March 2016, recording the same number against Manchester United\nThis was the fifth time City have made six or more changes for a Premier League match this season. With 120, they have made 33 more changes than any other side during this campaign, ahead of Arsenal and Chelsea (87 each)\nWhat's next?\nManchester City host Newcastle on Wednesday (18:00 BST), while Southampton travel to Everton on Thursday (18:00).\nMan Like Mobeen: Binge on all three series of the hit comedy from BBC Three\nTalking Heads: New versions of Alan Bennett's classics starring Jodie Comer, Martin Freeman and many more"

And true to form their lead only lasted six minutes before they conceded a soft equaliser.\nDawson lost his marker and was too strong for Alexander Tettey to head into the net from close range from Etienne Capoue's delivery.\nFarke will also be unhappy with Watford's second, as Aarons should have done much better with his clearance before Welbeck's overhead kick.\nNorwich have now conceded more goals than any other team in the Premier League this season (63).\nPearson close to completing remarkable turnaround\nWhile Norwich, who still have to play both Chelsea and Manchester City away from home, will be preparing for Championship football next season, Nigel Pearson's Watford still have their fate in their own hands.\nThis victory takes them on to 31 points, four more than Aston Villa and Bournemouth, with the Hornets also having a better goal difference than those two sides.\nThey take on a Newcastle side in mid-table on Saturday, before an away match at another team looking to stay up, West Ham, on 17 July, before ending the season with games against Manchester City and Arsenal.\nIf Watford can survive in the top flight it will complete a remarkable turnaround under Pearson - their third manager of the season after Javi Gracia was sacked in September and Quique Sanchez Flores was dismissed in December.\nWhen Pearson took over, Watford had only eight points from 14 games and were six points adrift of safety, but have now gained 23 points from 20 matches since Pearson's appointment.\nMan of the match - Danny Welbeck (Watford)\n'We're going to do everything we can' - what they said\nWatford boss Nigel Pearson to Sky Sports: \"I thought we showed a lot of character - not always composure - but the result was more important than the performance. I feel for Norwich because they played pretty well and we've had to fight very hard. Their ability to keep the ball made it difficult.\n\"We desperately needed three points and we got it.

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-3 Chelsea: Blues beat Palace despite Wilfried Zaha stunner\nChelsea further strengthened their position in the Premier League's top four with victory over Crystal Palace in an entertaining encounter at Selhurst Park, that included a stunning long-range strike from Wilfried Zaha and a rare goal from Christian Benteke.\nThere was an element of fortune about the game's opening goal, with Palace defender Gary Cahill pulling up with a match-ending injury to allow Willian to charge into the box unimpeded and set up Olivier Giroud to finish.\nBut the rest of the match was a testament to the kind of competitive, high-octane, see-saw football that draws so many viewers to the English top flight, even when the grounds are empty of fans.\nTwice Chelsea looked to have put the game beyond the home side, first through Christian Pulisic's rising shot to make it 2-0 in the first half and then via Tammy Abraham's neat finish with 19 minutes to go to put the Blues 3-1 up.\nBut this reckoned without the input of Zaha and Benteke.\nZaha's goal was a superb strike, fiercely fired into the net via the crossbar from an unlikely distance. Benteke's was more routine, tapped in from point-blank range following a neat move, but almost as surprising, it being his first goal at Selhurst Park since April 2018.\nAnd Palace came within a whisker of snatching a point when Scott Dann's back-post header struck the inside of the post before Chelsea hacked the ball clear.\nChelsea's win means they move above Leicester into third place in the table, five points ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United.\nWith 42 to their name, Palace have too many points to worry about being dragged into a relegation fight, but manager Roy Hodgson and his side will be eager to end a losing streak that has now stretched to four games.\nAction and reaction from Tuesday's Premier League games\nLawro's predictions v DJ & Arsenal fan Joel Corry\nChelsea get the job done\nChelsea suffered a notable blip when they were beaten at West Ham six days ago, but apart from that their restart has gone pretty much to plan.\nA return of 12 points from a possible 15 has ensured they remain firmly in the mix for a place in next season's Champions League.\nThey are now above Leicester and have an advantage over the teams below them who pose the biggest threat to their Champions League hopes - Manchester United and Wolves.\nTheir performance once again showcased the attacking flair Frank Lampard has at his disposal, especially in Willian, who now has a couple of assists to go with the four goals he has scored since the restart, and Pulisic, who scored his third post-lockdown goal.\nHowever, there remains a fragility at the back, with Kurt Zouma and Andreas Christensen not the most solid of centre-back pairings, although the former did produce a stunning late tackle to deny Benteke.\nIn front of them, Lampard opted for young midfielder Billy Gilmour in the absence of the injured N'Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic, which leaves further question marks over the future of Jorginho, who came on for the final 10 minutes but has yet to start a game since football returned.\nHowever, in this compacted season finale and with the end goal in sight, wins are more important that perfect performances.\nLampard said as much himself when speaking to BBC Sport.\n\"There were moments in the game where our game-management wasn't great,\" said the Chelsea boss. \"At 2-0 we can dominate that game and finish it. When we went 3-2 up we had chances to finish the game and were sloppy.\n\"But at this point, three points is the critical thing.\"\nDespite the attacking prowess they demonstrated, Lampard felt his side should have made the game more comfortable for themselves in the closing stages.\n\"For the chances we create we don't score enough goals,\" he added. \"It changes the face of a game when you have chances and don't take them and nerves kick in.\n\"And you can't feel secure in football matches if you keep giving goals away. We still have to learn from moments in our game and be better.\"\nPositives and negatives for Palace\nThis was probably the best Palace have played during their run of four straight losses and certainly the most threatening they have looked.\nA large part of that is down to Zaha.\nIt has been a frustrating season for the 27-year-old forward, who looked like he might leave Palace last summer but ultimately stayed and has since struggled to recapture the form that had other clubs circling.\nBut despite his failure to regularly hit the heights of which he is capable, he remains a potent attacking weapon, as he demonstrated with 10 minutes to go in the first half.\nMore renowned for his speed, driving runs and trickery, his goal was more of a tribute to the Tony Yeboah school of finishing - a rasping effort from an unlikely distance that gave the goalkeeper no chance.\nIt is only his fourth goal of the season and his first since mid-December.\n\"When Wilf is in that type of form he shows he is one of the best players in the Premier League,\" said Palace boss Roy Hodgson.\n\"It is good for us because when you have him in that type of form you feel like you have a great chance of winning a match.\"\nBenteke has fared even worse in front of goal, with this just his second in the league this campaign from 23 appearances, but he showed an awareness that has often been lacking to be in the right place to finish Patrick van Aanholt's low cross.\nSadly for Palace, on a night of rare recent positives they leave with no points and must now wait to see the extent of Cahill's injury.\n\"I thought the fighting spirit, the way we played and the determination means at this moment in time we don't feel too disappointed,\" added Hodgson.\n\"But three weeks from now people will say that this is another defeat for Palace, it is four in a row and they are playing badly. We need to be strong and know we are not playing badly.\"\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\nChelsea's derby joy\nChelsea have now won 132 of their 256 London derbies in the Premier League; their 52% win rate is the highest for any side in such matches.\nCrystal Palace have lost four consecutive matches for the first time since March 2018 - the fourth game in that run was also against Chelsea.\nLampard is the first English Chelsea boss to achieve a league double over Crystal Palace since Dave Sexton in 1971-72.\nChelsea striker Giroud has scored five goals in his past eight Premier League appearances; his previous five goals in the competition were spread across 49 games.\nChelsea midfielder Gilmour (62 successful passes) is the first teenager to lead all players for successful passes in each of his first two Premier League starts since Denilson for Arsenal in March 2007.\nPalace winger Zaha's strike came from a distance of just over 30 yards; none of his previous 35 Premier League goals were from more than 19 yards out.\nBenteke scored his first Premier League goal for Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park since April 2018 against Leicester, while this was his first such goal there excluding penalties since May 2017 against Hull.\nThe average age of Crystal Palace's starting XI was 30 years and 351 days, the oldest of any starting XI in the competition this season. Palace have named 17 of the 20 oldest starting line-ups in 2019-20.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea are next in action on Saturday, when they travel to Sheffield United for a 17:30 BST kick-off. Palace play the following day in an away game at Aston Villa (14:15).\nItalia 90: Relive the epic emotions and memorable tales\nRacism in British sport: How do we change?"

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-1 Leicester City: Vardy rescues point for visitors after Aubameyang opener\nJamie Vardy's late equaliser gave Leicester City a vital point to keep their Champions League hopes on track and end Arsenal's recent winning streak.\nThe Gunners looked on course for a fifth successive victory to maintain their own outside chance of a place in Europe's elite competition next season after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang swept in his 20th league goal of the season in the first half.\nLeicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel kept Arsenal at bay with a string of fine saves before the interval, twice denying Alexandre Lacazette as well as Bukayo Saka - and it proved to be a vital contribution.\nArsenal were reduced to 10 men with 15 minutes left when Eddie Nketiah was sent off four minutes after coming on as substitute for a high challenge on James Justin, and Leicester cashed in when Vardy slid home Demarai Gray's cross in the 84th minute, the goal finally awarded after a lengthy VAR check for offside.\nIt was Vardy's 22nd league strike of the season and restored his two-goal advantage over Aubameyang at the top of the Premier League scoring charts.\nLeicester drop to fourth, four points ahead of Manchester United having played a game more, but this was an important point that left Arsenal frustrated in seventh.\nRelive Arsenal's draw against Leicester\nFrustration for Arteta and Arsenal\nArsenal's recent run of league wins, away at Southampton and Wolverhampton Wanderers and at home to Norwich City, sparked hopes they could force their way into the Champions League places, especially with the lingering possibility of Manchester City being banned from the competition.\nTheir hopes will have risen once more as they held the lead in impressive fashion but in the end Vardy's equaliser left manager Mikel Arteta cutting a frustrated figure at the final whistle.\nThere is, however, still plenty to admire about how Arsenal are developing under Arteta, especially teenager Saka, whose superb delivery for Aubameyang's goal was his 12th Premier League assist this season, with only Kevin de Bruyne (19) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (14) ahead of him.\nArsenal have a potent striker in Aubameyang and there is a tempo and focus about their play that certainly has Arteta's stamp - he will still feel the pain of those lost points so late on.\nSatisfaction for Rodgers\nLeicester may have slipped a place after occupying the top three for most of this season, but manager Brendan Rodgers will feel a measure of satisfaction after his side fought back to earn a point.\nThe Foxes have been in indifferent form since the league restarted and Rodgers will have been desperate to maintain momentum after a 3-0 victory over Crystal Palace last time out.\nFor long spells it looked like they would leave north London empty-handed, especially when they were relying on Schmeichel to stop them falling even further behind as Arsenal took control after going ahead.\nLeicester showed spirit and composure and were handed the initiative when Nketiah's reckless lunge at Justin gave them impetus to push for the leveller.\nInevitably it was Vardy, who joined the Premier League's '100 Club' after scoring twice against Palace, who was the scourge of Arsenal once more as he pounced for his 10th career goal against them, although there was an agonising wait before he and Leicester could celebrate.\nThe Foxes could not force home a winner but in the end Rodgers will take a point in the increasingly competitive fight for places in the Champions League next term.\nMan of the match - Kieran Tierney (Arsenal)\n'A point was the minimum we deserved' - what they said\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We lost two points. I think we deserved to win the game. But when you have the chances you have to kill them. Three- or four-nil and the game is over. We had to play a long time with 10 men.\n\"I was agitated for a previous incident that was a red card [in the first half]. The referee has made a decision and we have to learn from that, as well it is our fault because it is the fourth time since I have been here we have played with 10 men and we have to reflect on that.\"\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers: \"I thought a point was the minimum we deserved. We started well and then conceded too much space and they got the goal from that.\n\"There was a spell for 15 minutes where it was a bit like basketball. The game was a bit open for my liking.\n\"Towards the end of the first half we connected the game better and second half I felt we were excellent. We played with composure and got into some good areas.\n\"At 11 versus 10 we managed it really well, got the goal and unfortunate not to have got a second.\"\nSuper sub Gray - the stats\nArsenal remain unbeaten in 23 home league games against Leicester (W19 D4).\nLeicester City have scored 18 goals in the final 15 minutes of their Premier League games this season, more than any other side.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang is just the second Arsenal player to score 20+ Premier League goals in consecutive seasons, after Thierry Henry (five in a row between 2001-02 and 2005-06).\nOnly Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been involved in more goals for Arsenal this season in all competitions (25) than Bukayo Saka (16 - 4 goals, 12 assists).\nAt 21 years 38 days, Eddie Nketiah is the youngest Arsenal player to be sent off in the Premier League since Konstantinos Mavropanos, also against Leicester in May 2018 (20y 149d).\nLeicester striker Jamie Vardy is just the fourth player to score at least 10 Premier League goals against Arsenal, after Wayne Rooney (12), Robbie Fowler and Harry Kane (both 10).\nSince his debut in January 2016, Leicester's Demarai Gray has registered eight assists as a sub in the Premier League, more than any other player.\nWhat next?\nArsenal travel to north London rivals Tottenham on Sunday (kick-off 16:30 BST), while Leicester go to Bournemouth on the same day (19:00).\nItalia 90: Relive the epic emotions and memorable tales\nRacism in British sport: How do we change?"

        "article_text": "West Ham United 0-1 Burnley: Jay Rodriguez scores winner as hosts rue missed chances\nJay Rodriguez's winner edged Burnley closer to a Europa League spot as relegation-threatened West Ham were left to rue a host of missed chances.\nThe forward met Charlie Taylor's whipped delivery with a flicked header that looped over Lukasz Fabianski and dropped in off the crossbar.\nIt came after a string of fine saves from Clarets goalkeeper Nick Pope.\nMichail Antonio also struck a post and Pope then turned substitute Sebastien Haller's effort wide with his studs.\nIt was a glorious chance with his first touch of the game for West Ham's record signing, who came off the bench after returning from a hip injury.\nChris Wood thought he had added a second for the visitors with 14 minutes to go when he tapped in Phil Bardsley's low cross, but was ruled offside.\nThe win takes Sean Dyche's side to within one point of eighth-placed Arsenal, while the Hammers remain four points above the relegation zone.\nReaction to Wednesday's Premier League games\nIn-form Burnley eyeing Europe\nWith injuries mounting, the departure of out-of-contract players and their Premier League status safe, Burnley could have been forgiven for easing their way to the end of the season.\nInstead Dyche's side are one of the division's most in-form teams and eyeing a Europa League spot that seemed out of their reach before Christmas.\nBurnley have lost just once in 12 top-flight games and a clean sheet at London Stadium means they now have a league-high 14 to their name this term.\nRodriguez took his first-half winner superbly, one of few chances that came his way, but Dyche had goalkeeper Pope to thank for the three points as the England international made a number of smart saves.\nHe snuffed out West Ham's early pressure with a good block from Tomas Soucek's close-range volley and took command of his box as the hosts threw bodies into the Burnley penalty area late on.\nDyche was able to name a full complement on his bench, having twice been unable to fill the nine spots since the restart, and welcomed the return of forward Wood from injury.\nThe New Zealand international, after having an effort ruled out for offside, provided a valuable outlet for the visitors and forced Fabianski into a save as Burnley looked for a second on the break.\nHowever, the visitors were perhaps fortunate to not be reduced to 10 men after James Tarkowski's dangerous tackle on Jarrod Bowen, instead the Clarets skipper escaped with a yellow card.\n\"It's a red card,\" said Hammers boss David Moyes afterwards. \"It's not going to change the result - it might have done during the game.\n\"It is really disappointing that the referee didn't see it as a red, the linesman is very close to it and we have the chance to go to VAR to make a decision on it.\"\nCrunch time for Hammers\nThis was the second of three games in seven days for the Hammers, a run of fixtures Moyes bemoaned earlier this week and will not be any happier about after losing a contest they dominated for large spells.\nThe hosts had 22 shots but only managed five on target, one of which saw \u00a345m striker Haller denied by Pope seconds after coming off the bench.\nAntonio and Bowen linked up well in the first half to cause Burnley problems while on-loan midfielder Soucek would have opened the scoring if his volley was not straight at the goalkeeper.\nAnd despite throwing bodies forward in search of a leveller, the hosts created little of note in the second half.\nWest Ham's hectic spell will be completed by a visit to Norwich on Saturday, when a win at Carrow Road would not only boost their own survival hopes but also relegate their hosts.\nUltimately, the Hammers' destiny is in their own hands with home games against relegation rivals Watford and Aston Villa either side of a trip to Manchester United also still to come.\nBut they will watch on a little less comfortably when Bournemouth and Villa look to close the gap in their games in hand on Thursday.\nMan of the match - Nick Pope (Burnley)\n'We have a culture we believe in'\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"Last few games have been fantastic. It's a challenge when they lose team-mates. There's a resilience to them, you add in organisation and physical prowess, and they've got more talent than people mention.\n\"Two centre halves were outstanding, the keeper was outstanding. They asked a lot of questions, had a couple of golden moments, and our keeper was there when needed.\n\"We have a culture and environment we believe in. It's that commitment to the cause. The next game comes very quickly and it's Liverpool, they're not bad\u2026\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes: \"Frustration is probably the word I would use more than anything, the missed opportunities. I am disappointed that we didn't take something from the game because I feel we warranted something.\n\"I thought today was a must-win, I thought Newcastle was too, Chelsea we had to do the best we can and we did. We have been in that situation for a while. In fact, probably since I took over.\"\nClarets enjoy life on the road - the stats\nBurnley have picked up 13 points from the last 18 available to them in away league games, as many as they earned across their previous 16 such matches on the road beforehand.\nThis was West Ham's 19th Premier League loss of the season; only in 2006-07 (21) and 2013-14 (20) have the Hammers suffered more defeats in a single campaign.\nBurnley have won back-to-back away Premier League games without conceding for the first time since May 2015.\nWest Ham have lost three consecutive league meetings with Burnley for the first time since May 1947.\nBurnley have won successive away Premier League games in London for only the second time, having previously done so back in August 2017.\nThe Clarets have kept a clean sheet in both of those wins, having only kept two shutouts in their previous 24 Premier League away matches at London sides before this.\nBurnley's Ja Rodriguez scored his seventh league goal of the season; only in 2013-14 for Southampton (15) has he ever scored more in a single Premier League campaign.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham visit Norwich at Carrow Road on Saturday (12:30 BST), while Burnley head to champions Liverpool later the same day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Man City 5-0 Newcastle: Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, David Silva, Raheem Sterling score\nManchester City returned to winning ways in style by thrashing hapless Newcastle at Etihad Stadium.\nPep Guardiola's side were surprisingly beaten at Southampton in their previous Premier League game but two goals in the opening 20 minutes against the Magpies effectively settled this contest.\nGabriel Jesus ended his nine-game goal drought by converting from David Silva's cutback, while Riyad Mahrez swept home the second from Kevin de Bruyne's pass.\nIt got worse for Newcastle in the second period when Federico Fernandez inadvertently deflected Matt Ritchie's attempted clearance into his own net and David Silva added the fourth by curling in a sublime free-kick.\nRaheem Sterling came off the bench to add the fifth for City in injury-time, rolling in from Silva's pass.\nWith four games remaining, City have strengthened their claim to second place, moving nine points clear of Chelsea, while Newcastle drop to 13th.\nRelive Manchester City's win over Newcastle\nCity slickers\nManchester City's unsatisfactory title defence has seen them drop 33 points this season, three more than in their previous two campaigns combined, but they were a class apart against Newcastle.\nThe swift movement and quick passing in the final third tore apart the Magpies backline with ease time and time again and though their aggregate score from their last five home games now reads 19-0, it could have been much more.\nPhil Foden's growing influence in the starting line-up is clear to see, buzzing around in the final third, but the young Englishman will be disappointed by missing a hat-trick of chances, all dragged wide from promising positions.\nThe man Foden is tipped to replace next season, David Silva, showed why he will depart as one of the finest players the Premier League has seen, completing 106 of his 112 passes, contributing two assists as well as scoring a glorious free-kick.\nThe first two goals were similar, both coming from the left of the box, with Belgium international De Bruyne taking his assist tally to 18 for the campaign, just two short of Arsenal legend Thierry Henry's record.\nMeagre Magpies\nNewcastle's form since the restart has been excellent with two victories and two draws, but this heavy defeat ended a run of six unbeaten games in the league.\nThe appointment of Steve Bruce to replace Rafael Benitez last summer was not universally well received by the club's fans, but the 59-year-old has kept them away from the relegation zone and they are only two points short of matching last season's tally.\nBut Bruce extended his wretched record as manager against City. He has never beaten them, losing nine out of 12 matches.\nThey had several first-choice players missing, including Allan Saint-Maximin, Miguel Almiron and Jamaal Lascelles, and conceding two early goals did not help their cause.\nDefender Fernandez, who saw Ritchie's attempted clearance ricochet off him into his own net, recorded the away side's only shot on target, a weak header which was easily gathered by Ederson.\nMan of the match - David Silva (Man City)\nWhat next?\nManchester City travel to Brighton on Saturday (kick-off 20:00 BST), while Newcastle go to Watford earlier on the same day (12:30).\nJesus the lucky charm - the stats\nManchester City have won 11 consecutive top-flight home games against a single opponent for the very first time in the club's history.\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce has failed to win any of his 23 Premier League away games in Manchester (D4 L19), with this his ninth such defeat against City (10 v United).\nThanks to Riyad Mahrez's strike, Manchester City are the first English top-flight side to have five different players score at least 10 league goals in a single season since Everton in 1984-85 (Sterling, De Bruyne, Aguero, Jesus, Mahrez).\nHaving also suffered a 5-0 defeat at Leicester earlier in the season, Newcastle have lost by at least five goals on more than one occasion in the same Premier League season for the very first time.\nManchester City completed 787 of their 840 passes this evening against Newcastle, recording a pass completion rate of 93.7% - the highest passing accuracy we have on record in the Premier League since 2003-04.\nManchester City have scored 4+ goals in three straight home Premier League games for only the second time, also doing so between September and October 2017 under Pep Guardiola.\nKevin De Bruyne has assisted 18 Premier League goals this season for Manchester City, the most by any player in a season in the division since the Belgian himself also set up 18 in 2016-17.\nDavid Silva has now reached 10+ assists in all competitions in all 10 of his seasons with Manchester City, with his second in this game his 121st in total for the club.\nManchester City have now won 30 of the 31 Premier League matches when Gabriel Jesus has scored, drawing the other."

Right the way through, it was a great effort.\n\"We were stretched in terms of numbers, but it was a committed performance and one that, ability wise, had the hallmarks of a proper Sheffield United display.\n\"It reward for a positive second-half performance. We've had to defend really well but we wanted to carry a threat going the other way and I think we did.\"\nOn John Egan's second goal in two games: \"I've battered him for not scoring, but he has got two in two - the 10 goals he should be getting are a bit beyond him.\nEuropean aspirations? \"Nobody has talked about anything other than putting a shift in and a performance in. We wanted to move our points total from 48 and we've moved it.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to BBC Sport: \"We have to stay focused in the last minute. We had good movement and good chances that we should be more clinical with.\n\"What is in our mind is the last moment of the game but we have to analyse the whole of the game.

We created chances before scoring a really good goal. We tried to play, we went toe-to-toe and there were lots of positive performances.\n\"The scoreline can affect you but if you analyse the chances we had they were good chances. They are a top side who can hurt you, with unbelievable players everywhere. I'm proud of the players, they stuck with it and they played a good game.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to Match of the Day: \"I saw two very good teams, both trying to play football. They had a brave formation and set up but we had a super solution for that. Our high press was outstanding but when we lost the ball in the wrong moment it was really difficult.\n\"They deserved the goal so we had to adjust a few things like our protection and position in midfield and it helped. The beginning was outstanding and the end was good again. I couldn't respect more what Graham [Potter] is doing here - they made it a really tough game.\"\nOn Neco Williams: \"The yellow card was the only reason [he came off]. He was good but I cannot ask a 19-year-old not to make another challenge on a yellow card. We asked a lot, we put him on the wrong side and asked him for a really hard press. We asked for a lot but he can do that, he was good.\"\nOn chasing the points record: \"It's not important for me, I'm not interested in any of this but I want to win football games. For sports people in general it might be important. We are champions and it could be softening but it is not - the boys go with everything.\n\"We have 92 points and last season we had 97. We got five points more than this last season - that's unbelievable, I have no idea how we did that.\"\nAnother away success for Liverpool - the stats\nLiverpool have never won more matches (30) in a single league campaign (level with 1978-79 and 2018-19).\nBrighton have only won two of their 14 Premier League games in 2020 (drawn seven, lost five); no other side has won fewer in the calendar year.\nThis was Liverpool's 13th away league win this season; the joint-most the Reds have ever won on the road in a league season in their history.\nBrighton have lost back-to-back home league games for the first time since April 2019.\nAfter going seven hours and 47 minutes without scoring a goal away from home in all competitions, Liverpool scored twice within 127 seconds.\nLiverpool were 2-0 ahead in the eighth minute of this match, the earliest they have taken a two-goal lead in a Premier League match since May 2011 against Fulham (seven minutes).\nSalah has reached 100 goal involvements for Liverpool in the Premier League (73 goals, 27 assists in 104 appearances), becoming just the fourth player to do so for the Reds after Steven Gerrard (212), Robbie Fowler (158) and Michael Owen (148)\nSalah has been directly involved in eight goals in his six Premier League appearances against Brighton, scoring five and assisting three.\nLiverpool captain Henderson has scored more Premier League goals in 2019-20 (four) than in his previous three seasons combined before this (three).\nBrighton winger Trossard has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the very first time; seven of his eight combined goals (five) and assists (three) in the competition have come at the Amex Stadium.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool play at home against Burnley on 11 June (15:00 BST), with Brighton at home to Manchester City later that day (20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur: Callum Wilson has a late effort ruled out by VAR\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe says his side are \"still in the fight\" to stay in the Premier League despite being denied a late winner in a goalless draw with Tottenham.\nThe Cherries thought they had snatched a significant victory in their bid to avoid relegation only for Callum Wilson's overhead kick to be ruled out by the video assistant referee.\nHowe said it felt like a \"missed opportunity\" after Wilson's acrobatic stoppage-time effort struck Joshua King's arm on the way into the Tottenham net.\n\"The important thing was we stopped the losing run, that was absolutely vital,\" Howe told BBC Radio 5 Live after Bournemouth ended a run of five successive defeats.\nThe draw does, however, mean they remain in the drop zone, three points from a position of safety.\n\"It edges us a little bit closer to the teams above us. It gives us heart and confidence that we're still in the fight,\" added Howe. \"We answered that question to the outside world that we're still here.\"\nA point did little to further Spurs' European ambitions, though the visitors felt they should have had a penalty for a push on forward Harry Kane.\nKane did not have a touch in the opposition box until the 78th minute as a lacklustre Spurs side failed to register a shot on target.\nBournemouth substitute Harry Wilson forced Hugo Lloris into a late save while King had earlier put the ball in the net from close range, but Stanislas was offside earlier in the move.\nThere was also concern for Cherries defender Adam Smith, who was carried off on a stretcher following lengthy treatment after suffering a head injury in a heavy collision with Ben Davies.\nErik Lamela glanced a header wide in Tottenham's only real chance of note, with their early penalty appeal Jose Mourinho's side's best chance of breaking the deadlock.\nKane appeared to be shoved in the back by King from a corner but VAR looked at the incident and decided it was not a foul.\nIt leaves Tottenham ninth, one point behind north London rivals Arsenal, who they face on Sunday.\nReaction to Thursday's Premier League action\nCan Cherries conjure escape act?\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe says his love for the club is the driving factor behind his desire to extend their five-year stay in the top flight, having guided the Cherries from the fourth tier to the Premier League over two spells as manager.\nAfter his side shipped nine goals in their previous two outings, the 42-year-old will take comfort in a clean sheet and a point against last year's Champions League finalists.\nBut it could have been more for the hosts, had Callum Wilson's effort not clipped team-mate King's arm on its way into the net deep into stoppage time.\nThere was still time for namesake Harry to engineer a glorious chance to win it for Howe's outfit, but the on-loan Liverpool winger fired straight at Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris.\n\"It looked like a good goal but when there's a lull you're fearing the worst and unfortunately it hit his arm,\" said Howe.\n\"We looked a threat, albeit we had to defend well. The criticisms that were laid against us against Manchester United were put right tonight. We dealt with them very well.\"\nIt means Bournemouth remain three points behind 17th-placed Watford with four games to play.\nHowe's passion has seen the Cherries scale previously unthinkable heights, but they realistically need to win two of their remaining fixtures - against Leicester, Manchester City, rivals Southampton and Everton - to stay in the top flight.\nSpurs fail to trouble struggling hosts\nTottenham still have a Europa League spot to play for this season, though boss Mourinho's focus will no doubt already be on the rebuild required for next term.\nOn the evidence of Thursday's performance, he has a big job.\nSpurs have invested in a new stadium, world-class infrastructure and a high-profile manager but look to be lacking on the pitch compared with their Champions League-chasing rivals.\nChairman Daniel Levy will not want to contemplate an extended absence from Europe's elite competition and will be expecting Mourinho to rediscover some of the magic that saw him win three Premier League titles to make sure that does not happen.\nSpurs were wasteful, lethargic and lacking in ideas in the opening 45 minutes, having just four touches in the opposition box with none of those coming for Kane, who was more involved in his own penalty area.\nThe club's record signing, Tanguy Ndombele, had played just 19 minutes since being hauled off at half-time during Spurs' 1-1 draw at Burnley in March but was thrown on at the break to try to inject some life into the visitors.\nThe introduction of the \u00a355m midfielder, who has been linked with a move to Barcelona this summer, and forward Son Heung-min did lead to more urgency but Bournemouth were rarely troubled.\nMourinho could be happy with his team's second successive clean sheet, achieved without suspended centre-back Eric Dier, but Spurs' lack of attacking inventiveness will be worrying.\n\"I feel I got enough desire and they couldn't give more today,\" said the Portuguese. \"We were dominant behind but then there was lack of sharpness in the attacking areas. I made changes, I think the changes helped to improve the game in the last half but we didn't score.\n\"Credit to Bournemouth. I was a bit surprised because I thought they wanted to win the game and I was surprised they just wanted a point - but maybe they did their maths and I think a point gives them a chance.\"\nMan of the match - Nathan Ake (Bournemouth)\nEverybody knows it's a penalty - Mourinho\nTottenham boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to Sky Sports on the penalty incident: \"The game has the most important moment and I don't want to say any more in relation to that. Everybody knows. Everybody.\n\"The same referee who did the VAR decision against Sheffield United - Michael Oliver. Opinions matter. It's not only mine, everybody knows that is a penalty and when I say everybody, I mean everybody. Everybody.\n\"I'm not saying Harry Kane 100% would score but his penalty range is high so usually we could win one nil against teams.\"\nLerma fails to learn yellow card lesson - the stats\nBournemouth ended a five-game losing run in the Premier League while also keeping their first clean sheet in 17 matches in the competition.\nTottenham have kept back-to-back clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since April 2019.\nThis was only their second clean sheet in 24 away league outings (also 0-0 v Watford in January).\nBournemouth have only won one of their 10 Premier League meetings with Tottenham (D2 L7), failing to score in six of those.\nThis was the first time Bournemouth have stopped their opponent from having an attempt on target in a Premier League match, in what is their 186th game.\nIt is the first time a side managed by Jose Mourinho failed to have a shot on target in a Premier League fixture since April 2007 during his first spell with former side Chelsea (against Newcastle).\nCallum Wilson's disallowed strike was the sixth time Tottenham have conceded a Premier League goal which has later been ruled out by VAR - only Brighton and Southampton (both seven) have had more.\nSince his Premier League debut in September 2018, Bournemouth's Jefferson Lerma has been shown 23 yellow cards in the division (12 last season, 11 this) - the most of any player in this time.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth host Leicester City on Sunday (19:00 BST), while Tottenham welcome Arsenal in the north London derby earlier that day (16:30).\nBoost your strength and health: Easy exercises to do from home\nCoronavirus: Kickstart job scheme for young people analysed"

They have not lost in 10 Premier League games - currently the longest unbeaten run in the top flight.\nMidfielder Fernandes was brought in from Sporting Lisbon at the end of that month and he has completely revitalised the side from being a slow, ponderous team to one full of attacking intent and dynamism.\nA clever operator in the final third, Fernandes drives the team forward with his incisive passing and it was his crafty spin on the ball which earned the penalty, although Villa will be aggrieved by the decision made by Jon Moss and supported by VAR.\nFernandes, who has contributed seven league goals, took his assist tally to six by setting up Pogba's side-footed finish, with the Frenchman continuing to improving and looking settled in the side after a long injury lay-off.\nGreenwood's smashing 20-yard strike leaves him one short of George Best, Brian Kidd and Wayne Rooney's joint-record of most goals in a season by a United teenager, one which will surely be beaten by the end of the campaign.\nWith better finishing they could have had more but Greenwood and Martial had low shots kept out by Pepe Reina, while Fernandes and Aaron Wan-Bissaka both wasted headed opportunity.\nFree-scoring United's victory means they become the first team in Premier League history to win four consecutive games by at least a three-goal margin.\nLeaky Villa heading towards drop\nIf United are on the up, Villa are going in the opposite direction and are running out of time to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.\nDean Smith's side have collected just two points from their past 10 games, a run that includes eight defeats, and they concede just too many goals.\nThe three shipped against United means they have let in 65 from 34 games, the most in the division, and have conceded two or more goals in 21 Premier League games this term.\nRelegation will leave them with a big task of holding on to Jack Grealish, who has been linked with a move to United, but the captain could not conjure up any sort of threat to worry the opposition.\nHad his early volley, which sailed over the crossbar, found the net or Trezeguet's strike sneaked in, it may have been a different story but Villa have now won just one of their past 43 meetings against the Red Devils.\nUnited goalkeeper David de Gea became United's leading appearance maker from overseas with 399 games, surpassing the legendary Peter Schmeichel, but the Spaniard was called into action just once, a comfortable save from John McGinn's long range drive.\nMan of the match - Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd)\nSpot-on Man Utd - the stats\nManchester United are the first side in Premier League history to win four consecutive games by a margin of 3+ goals, with the last team to do so in the English top-flight being Liverpool in October 1987.\nUnited are the first team to beat an opponent on every day of the week in the Premier League, with this match against Aston Villa making it the sixth fixture to be played on all seven days of the week in the competition.\nAston Villa have conceded 65 goals in the Premier League this season; the same number they had after 34 games when they were last relegated in 2015-16 and finished 20th.\nManchester United are unbeaten in their past 21 Premier League away games against Aston Villa (W14 D7) - the longest unbeaten away run one team has had against another in English top-flight history.\nBruno Fernandes has been directly involved in 13 goals in his first 10 Premier League games for Manchester United (seven goals, six assists); the joint-most of any player in their first 10 appearances in the competition, along with Mick Quinn (13).\nMason Greenwood is only the second teenager to score in three consecutive Premier League appearances for Manchester United (18y 282d), following on from Wayne Rooney back in February 2005 (19y 125d).\nGreenwood is the fourth player aged 18 or younger to score in three consecutive Premier League appearances, after Danny Cadamarteri (1997), Michael Owen (1997 & 1998) and Francis Jeffers (1999).\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side have won 13 penalties in the Premier League this season; no team have ever won more in a single campaign in the competition (also Leicester in 2015-16 and Crystal Palace in 2004-05).\nUnited named the same starting XI in four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since November 2006.\nWhat next?\nAston Villa host Crystal Palace on Sunday (kick-off 14:15 BST), while Manchester United are at home to Southampton on Monday (20:00).\nBoost your strength and health: Easy exercises to do from home\nCoronavirus: Kickstart job scheme for young people analysed"

We have to keep our focus now, and it is not about thinking the job is done - we have got three more games to make sure we win enough points ourselves.\n\"What happens elsewhere can help, but if you are reliant on that you are in for a bit of a shock, so our focus has to be there.\"\nNewcastle were the better side in the first half at Vicarage Road and deserved the lead given to them when Dwight Gayle turned in Federico Fernandez's flick from Matt Ritchie's corner in the 23rd minute.\nWatford, who hit the post through Danny Welbeck, were indebted to a vital save by Ben Foster from Allan Saint-Maximim before the break - leaving them in position to mount another recovery in the second half.\nThey were handed a lifeline after 52 minutes when Deeney drilled home a spot-kick following Ritchie's foul on Kiko Femenia, and he repeated his heroics nine minutes from time after Javier Manquillo hauled down Ismaila Sarr in the box.\nIt gave Watford a priceless three points as they showed the same powers of recovery that saw them overturn a 1-0 deficit to beat doomed Norwich City in their previous home game - and crucially leaves them six points clear of Bournemouth in the bottom three, although the Cherries have played a game less.\nWatford were bottom, seven points adrift of safety after 16 games, when Pearson took charge for the first time on 14 December, but he says positive thinking has been behind their climb up the table.\nPearson explained: \"We are always working hard to try to find the solutions to the situation we find ourselves in.\n\"Back in December it didn't look possible and we have had some decent runs and difficult times but throughout it all you have got to remain with a balanced view.\n\"We know we've got good players and really important match-winners but this win was about us being able to respond to disappointment and still being able to function. That is not easy, especially with there being no fans, but it has been a reasonable week for us so far.\"\nDeeney holds his nerve to inspire Watford\nWatford needed a big performance to rescue a mediocre first 45 minutes that left them facing defeat against visitors who had looked sharper and more urgent.\nCometh the hour cometh Watford's talisman, though, as captain Deeney put a barren sequence of only one league goal in his previous 10 games behind him to make the contribution that could yet keep the Hornets in the top flight.\nThe goals may have come from the penalty spot but the 32-year-old showed commendable nerve on both occasions, using his tried and trusted technique of sheer power to beat Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka for the first spot-kick then winning a battle of wits to deliver in similar style late on when the pressure was at its peak.\nIt was just what Watford required to build on the home win against Norwich City, ensuring momentum was maintained and increasing the peril for the likes of Bournemouth and Aston Villa with Norwich City now relegated.\nManager Nigel Pearson has been involved in great escapes before, as an assistant at West Bromwich Albion and in charge at Leicester City - and this result goes a long way towards helping him preserve that record.\nNewcastle run out of steam\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce would have been confident his side would make amends for the embarrassment of their 5-0 thrashing at Manchester City after a confident and impressive first half.\nSadly for Bruce and Newcastle, it was all downhill once referee Craig Pawson penalised Ritchie when his knee made contact with Femenia in the area just after half-time.\nWatford gained the upper hand and did not let go as Newcastle faded badly, their fate sealed by Manquillo's unwise decision to tangle with Sarr as the Watford forward raced into the danger zone late on.\nGiven all the pre-season pessimism, and the lukewarm reception he received after succeeding the popular Rafael Benitez on Tyneside, Bruce has done a highly respectable job in consolidating Newcastle, especially with takeover talk a constant sub-plot to his work these days.\nNow he must ensure Newcastle's season does not fizzle out too much at the finale.\nMan of the match - Troy Deeney (Watford)\nWhat next?

but there are some important decisions to be made.\nThe former Borussia Dortmund reserve-team boss has a contract until 2022 and is keen to stay and rebuild a team capable of making an immediate return to the Premier League.\nWhether Farke will be in charge after a dreadful run of form remains to be seen, while Norwich's hierarchy has some tough decisions to make concerning the future of the club's playing assets.\nIn November 2019, the Canaries announced losses of \u00a338m\n, external\nfor the financial year ending June 2019 before senior staff forecast a profit in the region of \u00a316m for 2019-20.\nThat was before the season was suspended, Norwich warning in April that they could lose up to \u00a335m because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt may prompt Norwich to cash in on highly-rated young players like Ben Godfrey and Todd Cantwell, although Farke stated on the eve of the West Ham game: \"If we want to bounce back next season it is important we keep our best players to be competitive.\"\nDefender Godfrey, 22, has been linked with German teams Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig,\n, external\nwhile Sheffield United\n, external\nare reported to be interested in 22-year-old midfielder Cantwell.\nWill West Ham survive?\nThis was a huge win for West Ham - and not just in terms of the score.\nHaving started the game three points above the relegation zone, they have created some breathing space before the last three games of the season - and left Bournemouth and Aston Villa in big trouble.\nThe Hammers had failed to win any of their previous seven away league games under Moyes - but they made up for it as they claimed their biggest away win in the Premier League since November 2007.\nIn addition to scoring the first hat-trick of his professional career, Antonio became the first West Ham player to score four goals in a league match since David Cross against Tottenham in September 1981.\nSince the restart, Antonio has been involved in 78% of West Ham's Premier League goals, scoring six and assisting one - form Moyes will hope he can continue to the end of the season.\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio (West Ham)\nFifth Premier League relegation - the stats\nNorwich have been relegated from the Premier League for a record fifth time.\nWest Ham picked up their first away win in the Premier League since December (1-0 v Southampton), ending a run of eight games on the road without a win (D1 L7).\nNorwich have lost 24 Premier League games this season - in no league season in their history have they ever lost more.\nThe Canaries have conceded 17 goals from set-piece situations in the Premier League this season (excluding penalties), more than any other side.\nWhat's next?\nWhile Norwich are back in action on Tuesday at Chelsea (20:15 BST), West Ham host fellow strugglers Watford next Friday (20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 1-1 Burnley: Clarets end champions' 100% home record\nBurnley ended new champions Liverpool's hopes of completing the season with a 100% Premier League home record thanks to Jay Rodriguez's second-half equaliser.\nClarets striker Rodriguez swivelled and fired home from inside the box following a James Tarkowski header to reward Sean Dyche's side for their resilience and persistence in the face of large periods of home dominance.\nThe visitors could even have left Anfield with all three points, but Johann Berg Gudmundsson fired an effort against the crossbar with just minutes remaining.\nAndrew Robertson had given the home side the lead in the first half, but they also spurned a number of good opportunities to score more, with Mohamed Salah and Curtis Jones guilty of wayward shooting.\nThey also found Nick Pope in superb form, with the England goalkeeper producing a string of good saves to deny Salah and others.\nRoberto Firmino struck the inside of the post with a low shot as Liverpool poured forward to try to capitalise on having more than 70% possession.\nThe draw means Liverpool can now no longer beat the Premier League record for home wins in a season; they need to beat Chelsea in their last game at Anfield to equal the league high of 18.\nThey remain in decent shape to achieve a highest-ever Premier League points haul; although with three games left and seven points short of the record of 100 set by Manchester City in 2017-18, they have no room for error.\nBurnley are now five games unbeaten since they returned from the Premier League's three-month shutdown by losing 5-0 at Manchester City.\nA draw leaves them ninth and still firmly in the mix for a place in next season's Europa League.\nAction and reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nLiverpool reminded that they are not infallible\nLiverpool's main goal this season has already been achieved, with the title taken from Manchester City in emphatic fashion.\nJurgen Klopp may have said this week that surpassing City's Premier League points record of 2017-18 was \"not that important\" to him, but it would provide a fitting cap to a stunning campaign.\nThree wins from their remaining three games will see Klopp's side set a new benchmark, but it is not the only record still possible for them this season.\nIn reaching 100 points, City also set a record Premier League title-winning margin - finishing 19 points clear of their nearest challengers. Liverpool are 26 points ahead of City, albeit having played a game more.\nThey are also still on course to claim the most wins in a Premier League season (currently 32) and most home points in a campaign (55).\nThis was a small reminder, though, that for all the strides they have made over the past few seasons, the Reds remain fallible.\nA bit of luck would have seen Liverpool home, with a post denying Firmino, while Pope was inspired, but Klopp's side also contributed to their own failure to win.\nSalah was extremely wasteful, while Jones twice fired wide during an otherwise impressive display as midfield deputy for the injured Jordan Henderson.\nAt the other end, Alisson and Virgil van Dijk - for all their ability - can be as vulnerable as any to a well-placed delivery and a physical, aerial threat.\nDisappointment then for the Reds, but a timely reminder that they are there to be got at and never truly the finished article.\nBurnley continue to make a lot out of little\nBurnley's winless run at Anfield was extended to 13 matches by this draw, but they will only take positives from this display, offering further proof they are one of the Premier League's toughest nuts to crack.\nWave after wave of Liverpool attacks came and went without a goal as defenders Tarkowski and Kevin Long stood tall while goalkeeper Pope produced heroics.\nThey had just 29% possession, and only six shots to their opponents' 23, but Dyche's side are one of the masters of making a little go a long way.\nSince losing at City on 22 June - their only defeat in 13 league games - Burnley have picked up 11 points from five matches, conceding just twice.\nAnd all this has been achieved while dealing with an injury and contract crisis that deprived them of a host of their first-team regulars.\nThere is now light at the end of the tunnel in that regard, with Chris Wood fit to partner Rodriguez in attack again and Gudmundsson further stepping up his return.\nIt could be just the boost they need to push them over the line for another impressive European qualification.\nMan of the match - Nick Pope (Burnley)\n'For moments it was Liverpool against Pope'\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: \"For moments it was Liverpool against Pope, he did really well, but we should have scored. We did everything right and he made saves but we should have scored more, that's on us.\n\"We didn't close the game and they took their moment. It feels like we lost a game, we have to look after the game better. We were angry with the referee but we have to criticise ourselves first for not finishing the game.\n\"The team do it right 99% of the time but I will never stop criticising them.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche to BBC Sport: \"We hit the bar late on but I think three points would have been over-egging it, we defended well and our keeper played well. They're a fine side, they're all over you so quickly and we couldn't get a foothold in the first half.\n\"Second half I reminded them that the presure was off, just go and play. Get it forwards and ask them more questions. You've got to find a moment, and we've been great at that.\n\"It's down to the players, we have built a mentality over time and they are delivering it with aplomb. We had some really good chances and we've taken one of them against a top, top side.\n\"Nick Pope makes saves, he's a top keeper.\"\nWasteful Salah outshoots Burnley\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah had as many shots as the whole Burnley team in this match (six) and twice as many on target (four), but failed to score.\nJurgen Klopp's side are now unbeaten in 58 Premier League home games - however, this draw ended their top-flight record run of 24 consecutive victories at Anfield.\nBurnley have lost just one of their past 13 Premier League games (W7 D5), and are unbeaten in their past five. Only Manchester United (10) are on a longer current unbeaten run.\nLiverpool had 23 shots in this match, their most in a Premier League game they failed to win since December 2017 (23 against Everton).\nAndrew Robertson's goal was his first in the Premier League for Liverpool at Anfield in 790 days, since netting against Brighton on the final day of the 2017-18 campaign.\nBurnley's Jay Rodriguez has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since April 2018. Indeed, Rodriguez has been involved in a goal in each of his past four Premier League games (three goals, one assist).\nFabinho has been involved in three goals in his last five Premier League games for Liverpool (one goal, two assists), more than he had been in his previous 39 games in the competition (one goal, one assist).\nWhat next?\nBoth teams are back in action on Wednesday 15 July, with Burnley hosting Wolves at 18:00 BST before Liverpool face Arsenal at Emirates Stadium at 20:15."

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 3-0 Chelsea: Blades move into top six\nSheffield United continued their push for European qualification as they moved into the Premier League's top six with a convincing win over in-form Chelsea at Bramall Lane.\nDavid McGoldrick's first Premier League goal opened the scoring, pouncing after Kepa Arrizabalaga had saved brilliantly from a deflected Oli McBurnie shot in the 18th minute.\nChelsea's defence was shaky throughout and they were ruthlessly punished just 15 minutes later when Enda Stevens crossed and McBurnie was left completely unmarked in the six-yard box to power home a simple header.\nThe damage was completed when McGoldrick capitalised on a dreadful defensive mix-up to plunder his second late in the second half.\nThe visitors had scored the most number of away goals in the Premier League before this match, including three at Crystal Palace in midweek, but never looked like adding to their tally.\nManager Chris Wilder has drawn many plaudits this season for Sheffield United's organisation and team ethic, their desire to keep the ball out of their net a telling contrast to the fragility of their illustrious visitors.\nIf Leicester City and Manchester United win their games in hand against Bournemouth and Southampton respectively, Champions League-chasing Chelsea, currently third, could find themselves in fifth when next in action against Norwich on Tuesday.\nAction and reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nReward at last for McGoldrick\nMcGoldrick was named Sheffield United's player of the year in 2019 as he scored 15 times in their successful promotion campaign, but until now has had no luck in front of goal in the Premier League.\nHe will, however, be a very popular goalscorer among Blades fans who appreciate the hunger and work ethic he brings to every performance.\nAnd, despite that lack of goals, his sharpness was in evidence when he pounced midway through the first half.\nMason Mount lost the ball for Chelsea, Kepa somehow kept out McBurnie's deflected volley but McGoldrick followed up to lash home the opening goal.\nHe then got a well-deserved second with 13 minutes to go as his driving run created an opening and he was in the right place to bury the loose ball.\nHis strike partner McBurnie had scored United's second with a powerful header before half-time and substitute Lys Mousset should have made it four when he raced clear but clipped past the post.\nThis was United's 10th home win of an outstanding season and Wilder's side are a good bet to secure European football at Bramall Lane for the first time in their 130-year history.\nNo defence for Chelsea\nChelsea had plundered 36 goals in their 17 matches away from Stamford Bridge in 2019/20 and Christian Pulisic, Willian and Olivier Giroud were in excellent form coming into this game.\nBut their leaky defence has caused them problems throughout this season and once again it was far too easy for their opponents to score.\nAfter Mount had failed to clear in the run-up to the opening goal, for the second, Willian allowed Stevens to escape down the left before centre-backs Andreas Christensen and Kurt Zouma went missing and McBurnie capitalised.\nBoth Christensen and Mount were replaced at half-time as manager Frank Lampard tried to wrest back control of the game.\nGiroud came off the bench as well but Sheffield United boast the Premier League's third meanest defence and they comfortably kept Chelsea at arm's length throughout the second half.\nIndeed, it was another horrible error from the Chelsea backline that led to the home side's third, substitute Antonio Rudiger screwing a clearance into the path of McGoldrick.\nLampard's team have now shipped 49 goals this season, compared with the 27 conceded by title winners Liverpool.\nAfter Norwich at home, Chelsea travel to Anfield to face the champions before wrapping up the season at home to fellow European hopefuls Wolves.\nIt could be a very tight finish for the Champions League spots.\nMan of the Match - David McGoldrick (Sheffield United)\nHome comforts for the Blades - the stats\nSheffield United have won four consecutive home top-flight matches for the first time since March 1991, when they had a run of six consecutive wins at Bramall Lane under Dave Bassett\nChelsea have lost 11 Premier League games this season, at least two more than any other team currently in the top-eight of the division and their most in a season since 2015-16 (12)\nSheffield United registered their biggest victory over Chelsea since April 1967, when they also won 3-0 at home against the Blues in a top-flight meeting\nThis was Chelsea's heaviest Premier League defeat since Frank Lampard's first game in charge against Manchester United, when the Blues were beaten 4-0\nMcGoldrick and McBurnie scored for Sheffield United, only the second time two players whose surnames start with \"Mc\" have scored for a team in a Premier League game along with Wigan Athletic against West Brom in May 2013, who saw Callum McManaman and James McArthur on the scoresheet that day\nChelsea have shipped 33 away Premier League goals this season, their joint-most in a season (also 33 in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1996-97)\nAfter a run of eight consecutive Premier League matches scoring at least two goals in each match, Chelsea failed to score for the first time since losing 2-0 to Man Utd in February\nChelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga has conceded 42 Premier League goals this season - the only Blues keeper to concede more goals in a single season is Dmitri Kharine in 1993-94 (48)\n'Not good enough' - what they said\n'Better than us in every way' - what they said\nSheffield United striker David McGoldrick: \"Thirty-five games in and the table doesn't lie. That was us at our best today. I said in the press I wasn't concerned that I hadn't scored. The goals were coming as I have had chances. I hope there is many more to come as it means the world to me.\"\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard: \"They were better than us physically, in the mind and with the ball. So you lose the game. They were stronger than us. You feel and hear every noise and all I could hear was Sheffield United voices. They are a good team. If you come here and perform below par this is what will happen.\n\"I am concerned with how we performed. I learned a lot today. We need to put that to bed and fight for the top four.\"\nWhat's next?\nSheffield United could do Chelsea a favour when they play fourth-placed Leicester at the King Power Stadium on Thursday (18:00 BST) while before that the Blues are at home to Norwich on Tuesday (20:15)."

Football sometimes is strange. We just didn't score there. We're a team who create a lot of chances and this time we converted them.\"\nBrighton endure a difficult night\nBrighton still need five more points from their remaining three games to be mathematically certain of safety, although their eight-point cushion over the bottom three currently appears healthy enough.\nIt was just as well their survival was not reliant on them getting anything here, as City tore into them and met little resistance.\nThe Seagulls went toe-to-toe with Liverpool in midweek and competed admirably with the new champions after conceding twice in the first 10 minutes, but this was a very different evening against the team the Reds have just deposed.\nThere were no early mistakes that cost Graham Potter's side this time, but they had to battle all game to keep out a relentless City side and enjoyed few opportunities at the other end.\n\"City were too good tonight,\" Potter said. \"We were well beaten by the better team.\n\"First half, we were in it a bit and had a couple of opportunities but they have got players that can hurt you everywhere.\n\"We are disappointed with how we petered out in the second half but it's a big ask to play Liverpool and City in the space of four days.\"\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling (Manchester City)\nWhat next? City warm up for Wembley\nCity warm up for next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal at an empty Wembley with a home game against Bournemouth on Wednesday (18:00 BST kick-off).\nBrighton make a short trip down the coast to play Southampton on Thursday (20:15).\nSeagulls cannot end City losing streak - the stats\nManchester City have won their last two Premier League games by 5+ goals, the first time this has happened in the Premier League since City themselves did so in three consecutive games in September 2017.\nBrighton suffered their worst home Premier League defeat since losing 5-0 to Bournemouth in April 2019.\nSince the 2015/16 season when he joined Manchester City, only Harry Kane (9) and Sergio Aguero (7) have scored more Premier League hat-tricks than Raheem Sterling (4).\nGabriel Jesus has scored in 32 Premier League games for Man City - they have won 31 of those games and drew the other. City have now won their last 29 Premier League games when Jesus has scored.\nBrighton have lost all six of their Premier League matches against Man City, scoring just two goals and shipping 20.\nRaheem Sterling has scored 27 goals in all competitions for Manchester City this season - this is his best scoring season in his career.\nThis was Graham Potter's heaviest ever home defeat as a manager and his joint-heaviest overall, also losing 5-0 in May 2016 as Ostersunds FK manager away at GIF Sundsvall in the Swedish Allsvenskan.\nGabriel Jesus became the third City player to reach 20 goals in all competitions this season (also Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling), with City having the most players to have scored 20 goals for a team in Europe's top five leagues in all competitions in 2019-20.\nRiyad Mahrez has registered 13 assists in all competitions for City, with this his best tally of assists in a season in all competitions as a Premier League player.\n17% of the goals conceded by Brighton in the Premier League this season have been against Manchester City (9/52)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 3-0 Everton: Hosts boost Champions League hopes\nWolves boosted their chances of claiming a place in next season's Champions League with a comprehensive home victory over Everton.\nWanderers bounced back from consecutive defeats with a victory through goals either side of half-time and a game-sealing third from Diogo Jota with 15 minutes to go.\nRaul Jimenez scored the first from the penalty spot in first-half injury time following a clumsy Lucas Digne foul on Daniel Podence.\nLeander Dendoncker headed in the second just a minute after the restart before Jota lashed in from just inside the box to put the game beyond the visitors.\nIt moves Wolves back up to sixth in the table, three points behind Manchester United in fifth - a position that could be good enough to earn a place in Europe's top club competition next season.\nEverton committed so much of their efforts to keeping the home side at bay and as a result offered little at the other end of the pitch, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison given scraps to feed off at best.\nThe closest they came to a goal was a Digne angled drive that flashed past the far post in the second half.\nThe defeat leaves the Toffees 11th and surely ends their hopes of securing a Europa League spot for 2020-21.\nAnd there was more bad news for manager Carlo Ancelotti, who was already without Mason Holgate and saw fellow centre-back Yerry Mina limp off in the first half with what appeared to be a thigh injury.\nEverton spirit unacceptable - Ancelotti\nAction and reaction from Sunday's Premier League games\nLawro's predictions v The Manor's Scotty Stacks\nWolves return to winning ways in style\nWolves returned to action in June in fine form, winning their first three games without conceding a goal to increase hope that a late dart for a Champions League place was on.\nBut early July checked that optimism, courtesy of successive defeats without scoring against Arsenal and Sheffield United - opponents who are also in the mix for a place in the top five.\nThis, then, was a necessary victory, resulting from very timely goals.\nPodence had already tested Jordan Pickford twice with low angled drives inside the box before he used his trickery to good effect to turn and draw a mistimed challenge from Digne.\nJimenez was coolness personified from the spot, meaning he has now been involved in 35 Premier League goals this season (goals and assists combined). Only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, with the same number, can match him.\nDendoncker's headed goal was the real killer, coming so early in the second half from Pedro Neto's well-delivered free-kick.\nJota's excellent finish simply confirmed what was already known, although Ruben Neves' superb floated long pass to release him is also worthy of emphasis.\nAdama Traore came on for the last 19 minutes and should have added to the scoreline but instead planted an effort against the crossbar after he was found unmarked in the box by Jota.\nEverton lack steel and style\nEverton retained some hope of a Europa League place when the Premier League restarted but more than that you sense the final nine games were a chance for Ancelotti to assess which members of his squad have a future at the club.\nOn this evidence, the Italian has his work cut out.\nThey possess two superb centre forwards, but without much of a creative midfield behind them the Blues are unable to maximise their most potent weapons.\nSo little an impact did top-scorer Richarlison have on the game he was withdrawn shortly after the hour mark.\nFailing to provide ammunition is not the only failing of the Toffees midfield. It also struggles to provide an adequate shield for the defence - especially one hit by injuries.\nJordan Pickford was too often exposed and had to make three saves to deny Podence a goal his display deserved, although the Everton keeper was fortunate to be able to scramble the last off the line after allowing it to go through his legs.\nHaving now won just three of their past 32 Premier League away matches against teams in the top half of the table, and suffered 11 top-flight defeats on the road for the first time since 2003-04, the Blues desperately need some grit to complement the guile up front.\nMan of the match - Ruben Neves (Wolves)\nWolves hitting their goals under Nuno\nThis was the third time Wolves have won a game by three goals in the Premier League under Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo - prior to his reign, they had only won once in the competition by more than two goals (4-0 v Blackpool in February 2011).\nEverton have only kept one clean sheet in their past 17 away games in the Premier League, conceding at least two goals in 10 of these fixtures.\nWolves have now kept a clean sheet in five of their past six Premier League games at Molineux (W3 D2 L1), as many as they had in their previous 18 combined.\nWolves striker Raul Jimenez has scored with all six of the penalties he has taken in the Premier League; only Yaya Toure (11), Dimitar Berbatov (nine), Jan Molby (seven) and Rickie Lambert (seven) have a better 100% ratio in the competition.\nDiogo Jota has scored five goals for Wolves after coming on as a substitute - more than any other Premier League player across all competitions.\nWhat next?\nWolves travel to face Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday in a 18:00 BST kick-off.

We have been playing tournament football since we came back.\n\"We haven't got the points we need but we're still in the tournament.\"\nIn an eventful game at Villa Park, Mamadou Sakho thought he had put Palace ahead when the ball appeared to strike the defender's shoulder on its way into the net - but it was ruled out for handball after a lengthy delay, much to the visitors' dismay.\nVilla then took the lead just before half-time when Egypt winger Trezeguet side-footed the ball into the net at the back post after Palace had failed to clear a free-kick.\nShortly after the break, the hosts were awarded a penalty by referee Martin Atkinson after Patrick van Aanholt's challenge on Jack Grealish, but the decision was overturned after another long VAR check.\nVilla sealed the points when Trezeguet toe-poked home his second goal and, after the final whistle, Palace forward Christian Benteke, who was playing against his former club, was shown a red card as tempers boiled over.\nPalace, who have now lost their past five league games, started with Wilfried Zaha, who revealed before the match he had received racist abuse on social media.\nPalace manager Roy Hodgson described the abuse of the 27-year-old Ivory Coast forward as \"cowardly and despicable\".\nFollow all of Sunday's Premier League action\nRacist abuse of Zaha 'cowardly and despicable' - Hodgson\nHuge three points for Villa\nVilla are running out of time to pull off a miraculous escape but a battling win at least gives them a fighting chance of avoiding the drop.\nAfter victories for fellow strugglers Watford and West Ham United on Saturday, the visit of Palace was a must-win game for Villa and Smith's side delivered - even if they did require a slice of luck to achieve it.\nWith the game goalless, it appeared a harsh VAR decision to deny Sakho a goal because of handball as Luka Milivojevic's looping ball appeared to come off the defender's shoulder on its way past keeper Pepe Reina.\nVilla recovered from that scare to seize control, Mbwana Samatta heading over a good chance before Grealish was denied by a smart Vicente Guaita save.\nThe breakthrough came on the stroke of half-time, Trezeguet pouncing after Conor Hourihane's free-kick was inadvertently flicked on by Joel Ward into the path of the forward.\nVilla, who were forced into a late change after losing defender Kortney Hause to a groin injury in the warm-up before the game, kept their focus after having Atkinson's decision to award a penalty overturned, and Trezeguet struck a crucial second after the ball fell to him inside the penalty area.\nReina produced a fine stop to keep out Van Aanholt soon after Guaita had prevented Hourihane from making it 3-0.\nVilla's aim is to be in with a chance of staying up by the time they face West Ham on the final day of the season on 26 July. This result at least gives them hope.\nBenteke 'did something he is now going to regret'\nPalace will be upset that Sakho's goal was overturned but they were well beaten in a match which ended in ugly fashion.\nBenteke, who was twice denied in the first half by Reina, was shown a red card following a flashpoint after the final whistle had been blown.\nThe forward appeared to kick out at an opponent and now faces a three-match suspension which will rule him out for the remainder of the season.\nIt completed a miserable day for Hodgson's side, who have lost five of their six games since the Premier League resumed.\n\"Christian Benteke has missed a lot of football this season through injury and got himself fit to play,\" said Hodgson.\n\"Now he has taken himself out of the last three of them for kicking out at an opponent. There is nothing I can say to excuse it. I'm obviously very unhappy about him being sent off.\n\"Quite frankly I don't know what he is going to be able to say to any of us to justify it other than the fact the red mist came down. He did something he is now going to regret.\"\nPalace, who have already secured an eighth successive campaign in the top flight, have failed to score in five of the past six matches.\nWith home games against Manchester United and Tottenham, as well as a trip to Wolves, still to come, Hodgson will be seeking an improvement from his side before the end of the season.\nMan of the match (Trezeguet - Aston Villa)\nBack in the goals - the stats\nVilla scored as many goals in this win as they had across their previous eight league matches combined beforehand (two).\nPalace have lost their past five league games, their poorest run since they lost eight in a row in September 2017.\nPalace have failed to score in the first half of 26 of their 35 Premier League games this season - more than any other side.\nTrezeguet scored his fourth and fifth Premier League goals for Villa, and his first since December 2019 against Chelsea.\nOnly Jack Grealish (seven) has scored more Premier League goals for Villa this season than Trezeguet (five), who became only the second Villa player to score a double in this season's competition (also Wesley against Norwich in October 2019).\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in action on Thursday. Villa travel to Merseyside to face Everton (18:00 BST), while Crystal Palace host Manchester United at Selhurst Park (20:15).\nGrounded with Louis Theroux: Top 10 most surprising celebrity revelations of the series\n15 memorable sporting moments from the '90s: Italia 90, Denise Lewis, Tiger Woods and the Chicago Bulls"

But it came from their hearts this effort, this battle.\n\"Even in the last minutes of the game after 2-1, zero problems, everything under control, so we are happy.\n\"We are happy because we made the fans happy, we are happy because we are still in the fight to win a Europa League position.\n\"We have nine points to fight for. If Manchester City do not play in the Champions League then there is one more space. If the FA Cup winner is a top-five or top-six team it opens a bit more space so we have to keep going until the end and try to get into a position that lets us play in the Europa League.\n\"That's not what we want but I prefer to play in the Europa League than not at all.\"\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I was really proud of the way we played, the way we approached the game, the way we dominated the game. We nullified the opponents but when we play at this level you have to win the game.\n\"An individual error and a set-piece cost us. When you are so dominant you have to kill the game. I am pleased with a lot of the things I have seen. The way we conceded, it has to be more difficult [for the opponent].\"\nJose loves playing Arsenal at home - the stats\nTottenham (W4 D2) have gone unbeaten in six consecutive home league games against Arsenal for the first time since January 1968 (nine games).\nTottenham's 2-1 victory against Arsenal was the 10th time either side has come from behind to win this fixture in the Premier League (Tottenham 4, Arsenal 6).\nArteta is the first Arsenal manager to lose his first north London derby in the Premier League since Bruce Rioch in November 1995.\nSpurs manager Mourinho has never lost a home game against Arsenal, winning six and drawing four of his 10 matches to date.\nOnly West Ham (24) have dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than Arsenal (21).\nLacazette became the first Arsenal player to score home and away against Spurs in a single Premier League season since Per Mertesacker in 2012-13.\nSon has scored 13 goals in all competitions at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, more than any other player (Kane has 12).\nSon is the first Tottenham player to both score and assist in a Premier League game versus Arsenal since Emmanuel Adebayor in February 2012.\nWhat next?\nTottenham visit Newcastle on Wednesday (18:00 BST), while Arsenal host champions Liverpool later that day (20:15).\nGrounded with Louis Theroux: Top 10 most surprising celebrity revelations of the series\n15 memorable sporting moments from the '90s: Italia 90, Denise Lewis, Tiger Woods and the Chicago Bulls"

A difficult first half.

It was probably the first time in a long time where we've had some luck.\"\nOn Dominic Solanke's two-goal performance: \"I thought he was very good today. He took his goals very well, both showed his qualities. I always believe Dominic is going to be a massive player for us in the future and that will do his confidence the world of good.\n\"Dominic is a very unique player, he has attributes we really like and value and I think he's done very well mentally to make sure outside noise doesn't affect him.\"\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers on BBC Radio 5 live: \"I didn't see that coming but we are not good enough to get too comfortable. We were in control of the game, Bournemouth changed their shape and you expect a 10-minute spell when you are up against it. But we let them into the game with a penalty and I was very disappointed with how we played from there.\n\"I've always said it's a dream for us to finish in the top four but we have to worry about playing well.

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-2 Southampton: Late equaliser sets back hosts' top-four hopes\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says his players \"will put it right\" after they missed a chance to climb into the Premier League's top four by conceding an injury-time equaliser against Southampton.\nUnited led 2-1 for 73 minutes before substitute Michael Obafemi scored in the 96th minute, bundling in a set-piece at the back post after it had been flicked on by Jan Bednarek.\nStuart Armstrong had given Southampton a 12th-minute lead, but Anthony Martial set up Marcus Rashford to equalise before firing a superb second goal for United.\nSolskjaer's side were on course to leapfrog top-four rivals Chelsea and Leicester - who both suffered defeats over the weekend - and move up to third but they remain fifth with three games left in the chase for Champions League qualification.\n\"The mentality has been brilliant. We have had a few setbacks this season. This is another challenge for us,\" said Solskjaer.\n\"I am very confident in [the players'] mentality. I'm disappointed of course, but you have to take the disappointments as well as the positives. We have learned a hard lesson. We will put it right. I trust the boys in that respect.\"\nArmstrong had opened the scoring for Southampton, following Paul Pogba's mistake, and after fighting back to draw, the visitors now sit five points outside of the top 10 and level on points with Everton.\nDespite United's setback, they will still qualify for the Champions League if they win their last three games, as they travel to the King Power Stadium to face Leicester on the final day of the season.\nSolskjaer was unhappy with what he called a \"nasty\" first-half challenge by Oriol Romeu on Mason Greenwood, for which the Southampton midfielder went unpunished after a video assistant referee review.\n\"I know my ankle wouldn't take that challenge,\" Solskjaer said. \"It was a nasty one but we have said enough about VAR.\"\nMan Utd chained to fifth spot\nUnited's fate remains in their own hands.\nBut the late goal from Obafemi came as a blow for the Red Devils, who had been the better side for most of the match.\nThey had chances to extend their lead at 2-1 - Martial proving a constant threat throughout, while Rashford came close with a driven effort from long range after having a goal ruled out for offside in the first half.\nBut the Saints never looked out of it and the clinical edge United had shown coming into this match - they had scored 15 goals in their five previous games - seemed to evade them in the second half when Rashford's effort was blocked on the line by a sliding Ryan Bertrand.\nThere will be concern for Solskjaer over Luke Shaw, who hobbled off in the second half after he seemed to twist his ankle, before Brandon Williams took a heavy blow to the head.\nHowever, United's hopes of Champions League football are still very much alive.\nSaints' bright form continues\nSouthampton were full of confidence heading to Old Trafford, having lost just one of their past five matches and seen off Manchester City earlier this month.\nThey showed that in the opening stages - Bertrand and Kyle Walker-Peters getting in behind the United defence before Nathan Redmond's cross to Armstrong was fired into the far corner for the opening goal.\nBut United's in-form attackers were quick to respond - Martial's neat first touch, smart turn and determined poke through finding Rashford unmarked in the box for the equaliser before he cut inside of Walker-Peters with ease and smashed it beyond Alex McCarthy for their second.\nThat goal looked set to be the winner as Rashford and Martial continued to threaten and Southampton remained in the game thanks to Bertrand's stunning block in the six-yard area.\nBut as the game went on, Southampton sensed there was an opportunity - Redmond drew a save from David de Gea with five minutes of normal time remaining before Bednarek's flick wasn't dealt with by United and Obafemi pushed the ball over the line, having been on the pitch for less than 10 minutes.\nMan of the match - Anthony Martial\n'The guys deserved the point' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to Sky Sports: \"If you stop being brave, stop being on the front foot, then you have problems against one-on-one quality.\n\"It was a very strong start from my side. We scored and we were really aggressive.\n\"We gave two chances away but then just before half-time we got back to our game and then I could feel we were better. We had good possession and good balance and had good chances in the second half. The guys really deserved the point, I think.\"\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It was the worst time to concede a goal but it happens in football. We have won so many games in that way. It is all part of the learning for this team. You think you have three points in the bag but we probably didn't deserve three points today.\n\"Southampton are a good team, they run, and run and chase. We never got into our rhythm today. We played some fantastic football at times. The two goals we scored were very, very good. It was just one of those days where we did not take our chances and they took theirs.\"\nThe best of the stats\nObafemi's equaliser for Southampton was the latest Premier League goal Manchester United have conceded since Opta began collecting exact goal-time data (2006-07).\nIn this season's Premier League, Manchester United have now lost one home match (against Crystal Palace) and drawn another (against Southampton) thanks to conceding in the 90th minute or later - in their 519 home games in the competition before this season, they'd only dropped two points as a result of conceding so late (one draw).\nUnited are unbeaten in their past 18 games in all competitions (W13 D5), last having a longer run between April and November 2010 (29 games).\nSouthampton's Armstrong has been involved in five goals in his last six Premier League games (two goals, three assists) - as many as he had been in his previous 40 appearances in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Brighton in their next Premier League match on Thursday, 16 July (20:15 BST), while Manchester United play at Crystal Palace at the same time."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 1-0 Norwich: Lampard 'wants more' as Blues move clear in Champions League race\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard says he \"wants more\" from his team but it \"can wait\" as their pursuit to secure a Champions League spot was given a boost by a narrow victory over relegated Norwich.\nStriker Olivier Giroud guided a header past Tim Krul on the stroke of half-time after Christian Pulisic created space for the cross on the right.\nThe Chelsea pair almost combined again in the second half but Pulisic could not guide Giroud's chipped ball past Krul.\nVictory strengthens Chelsea's hold on third place in the Premier League, where they sit four points above Leicester and Manchester United, who both play on Thursday.\n\"At this stage of the season results are critical and we didn't concede any chances of note to let them score,\" Lampard told Sky Sports.\n\"Where we are at as a team and where we are in the table, it is all about the result.\"\nNorwich, who were relegated following a 4-0 thrashing by West Ham on Saturday, failed to record a shot on target during the match.\nBut Lampard said his team \"can improve\" despite showing \"a bit more personality in our game\".\n\"We need to move the ball quicker and be more mobile with our rotations,\" he added. \"We have done it in parts this season but if we want to move on, it needs to be better. But I don't want to be too critical after a win.\n\"We didn't give them anything to worry us. We had 10-15 minutes in the second half where we were slow and I didn't like it but after that we got it back.\"\nFrustrated Chelsea get the job done\nThe first half was lacking in action as Norwich sat back and squeezed out any space available for Chelsea. The hosts just could not seem to get things clicking.\nFollowing Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Sheffield United, Chelsea would have wanted to start brightly and they showed signs with Ruben Loftus-Cheek heading wide and Marcos Alonso firing a dangerous cross in from the left within five minutes.\nBut as the half wore on, Chelsea struggled to create any clear-cut opportunities - Giroud, who admitted the team was \"under a bit of pressure\" to win, reacted to a third scuffed shot with a roar of frustration in the box after 40 minutes.\n\"I missed some things that I wouldn't miss usually but maybe I lost a bit of confidence,\" Giroud told Sky Sports afterwards. \"My desire to score was bigger though so I tried to stay focused.\"\nPulisic had provided the best chance of the half - controlling Antonio Rudiger's cross, turning sharply and firing it towards the roof of the net, forcing a save from Krul - before he eventually set-up Giroud's header with a swinging cross from the right.\nThe goal should have been a catalyst for Chelsea to release the shackles but the fluidity never really materialised, despite them still being able to create further chances.\nGiroud and Pulisic were busy but not clinical, though it didn't prove costly as Norwich never presented any real threat.\nIn the end, it was a comfortable victory for Chelsea despite a lack of ruthlessness. Manager Frank Lampard will hope that clinical edge returns for a significant run of matches - they face Manchester United in an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday, visit champions Liverpool in the league next Wednesday and then finish the top-flight campaign at home to sixth-placed Wolves four days later.\nNorwich fail to inspire\nNorwich boss Daniel Farke said before the match he wanted his team to show a response to their relegation, have \"pride\" in wearing the shirt and \"create good memories\".\nBut they did not show any spark until the second half and only 15% of the match was played in Chelsea's third.\nWhen they did put pressure on the ball and pushed high up the pitch, Chelsea showed nerves in a match crucial to their pursuit of Champions League qualification.\nJamal Lewis and Todd Cantwell won possession in Chelsea's half and tempted Chelsea duo Mateo Kovacic and Kurt Zouma into rash challenges which brought them yellow cards.\nFarke also introduced Adam Idah, Teemu Pukki and Emiliano Buendia as attacking substitutions in the second half but none had any impact on the game.\nIn the end, Norwich managed just two shots, neither on target, and one corner - and set a new club record of eight consecutive league defeats.\nBut Farke said he was pleased with the \"commitment and desire\" from his side, while they finished the match with several academy graduates on the pitch.\nMan of the match - Olivier Giroud (Chelsea)\n'Pleased with the reaction' - what they said\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It is tough one to call [on the top four]. This is the Premier League and it is not easy. Rather than give you a pointless answer, we take our three points, worry about ourselves, watch the others teams and think about the FA Cup.\nOn Olivier Giroud: \"He is always going to give you a desire to get in there for the team. He had a few half chances in the central area. That is what you have to do when he is in the team - use his attributes. He has scored important goals. He has never given me a problem, always trained well. His professionalism is always good.\"\nNorwich boss Daniel Farke, speaking to Sky Sports: \"On Saturday, we were relegated, so not happy days but I am pleased with the reaction of my boys.\n\"We were not far away from winning a point. The commitment and desire was really good. I just have compliments for my boys. On a good day we are competitive against the best teams in the world but once we are not spot on, we are not.\"\nThe best of the stats\nChelsea have won five consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since December 2017.\nNorwich have now lost 25 Premier League games this season - the most defeats they have ever suffered in a league campaign.\nChelsea stopped their opponents from mustering a single first-half shot for the fourth time in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nNorwich have now lost eight consecutive league games for the first time in their history.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2012, Chelsea striker Giroud has scored 31 headed goals in the competition, five more than any other player in that time.\nGiroud has scored in three successive Premier League starts for the first time since January 2017 when netting six in a row for Arsenal.\nPulisic has registered 11 goals involvements in the Premier League this season (eight goals, three assists), the most by a USA player since Clint Dempsey in 2012-13 (also 11).\nAlexander Tettey became the ninth player to make 100 or more Premier League appearances for Norwich City.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea take on Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday, 19 July at Wembley (18:00 BST kick-off) before travelling to Anfield for their next Premier League game against champions Liverpool on Wednesday, 22 July (20:15 BST).\nNorwich host Burnley on Saturday, 18 July (17:30 BST) in their next league game.\nRomesh is back!: Brand new Misadventures is streaming now\nHayley Goes: What are the obstacles in class mobility?"

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 1-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Jose Mourinho praises Harry Kane after 200th club goal\nJose Mourinho praised the \"incredible\" Harry Kane after the Tottenham striker passed 200 goals at club level with a double in Wednesday's 3-1 win against Newcastle.\nThe 26-year-old's two strikes took his tally to 201 goals in 350 games, with all but 16 of those for Spurs.\n\"Harry Kane knows how important he is, he is incredible,\" said Spurs boss Mourinho.\n\"After such a difficult recovery [from injury] he is playing every minute of every game, this is the fourth game with two days in between and Harry gave everything.\"\nThe victory took Spurs up to seventh and boosted their Europa League qualification hopes.\nIt was also the first time Mourinho had won a Premier League game at St James' Park in his eighth attempt.\nThe visitors led in the first half when Son Heung-min drilled a low shot into the bottom corner moments after the drinks break disrupted Newcastle's dominance.\nDwight Gayle almost levelled when his header hit the post and Matt Ritchie blasted an equaliser home 11 minutes after the restart.\nBut that parity only lasted four minutes as Kane headed home a deep cross from substitute Steven Bergwijn.\nThat was the England captain's 200th club goal, with 184 coming for Spurs and the other 16 for loan clubs Millwall, Leyton Orient and Leicester.\nHe got the 201st late on with another header after Martin Dubravka parried Erik Lamela's shot.\nIt was an impressive performance from Newcastle, who managed 22 shots to Spurs' eight, but their season is just petering out as uncertainty over their Saudi Arabian takeover continues.\nFollow live text and reaction to all of Wednesday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v DJ & Aston Villa fan Nathan Dawe\nSpurs stay in hunt for Europe\nSpurs manager Mourinho said in the build-up to the game they would \"fight\" for a Europa League spot even though he compared it to Lewis Hamilton racing in \"Formula Two or 3,000 or whatever you call it\".\nHis previous seven visits to Newcastle in the league with Chelsea and Manchester United had resulted in three draws and four defeats.\nThey were unchanged from the side who beat Arsenal on Sunday, with Serge Aurier starting just two days after his younger brother Christopher was shot dead. The Ivory Coast right-back will return to France on Thursday to see his mother.\nSpurs were second best until the drinks break with Mourinho reshuffling to a 4-2-3-1 from 4-4-2 and it immediately paid dividends.\nLucas Moura stole possession off Fabian Schar before picking out Kane, who found Giovani lo Celso. He fed Son, who smashed his shot through DeAndre Yedlin's legs and into the net.\nSon has been directly involved in more goals under Mourinho than any other Spurs player (10 goals and eight assists).\nRitchie's fine goal got Newcastle level but Kane - who was quiet until then - headed home to settle the game as Bergwijn got his first Premier League assist.\nKane then managed a second header - the first time he has ever achieved that in a Premier League game - after starting a move in the centre circle before finishing it off from close range.\nThey are now within one point of Wolves in sixth place, which could be the final Europa League slot if Arsenal win the FA Cup.\nNewcastle fail to take chances\nSteve Bruce's Magpies are 12 points away from the top seven and the bottom three with two games to go.\nBut they cannot start planning for next season with Premier League lawyers assessing their proposed takeover for the last three months.\nBruce said before the game \"we need a decision for everyone's sake\".\nHe made three changes at the back from last weekend's defeat by Watford, with a wing-back formation, and they had seven shots to Spurs' one before the visitors took the lead.\nThey played well throughout and had more possession than Spurs and almost three times as many shots by full-time.\nAllan Saint-Maximin was lively as always and forced Hugo Lloris into three saves.\nJonjo Shelvey, Ritchie and Miguel Almiron all caused Spurs problems throughout - and Gayle's glancing header from Shelvey's cross hit the post.\nThey got their goal when Valentino Lazaro went on a mazy run and Aurier booted the ball straight to Ritchie, who smashed a screamer past Lloris.\nBut they were made to pay by the clinical Kane as their six-game unbeaten home run in the league came to an end.\n'The best we've played in a long time' - manager reaction\nSpurs manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Sport: \"The team was tired before we even started. We had resilience and a great desire to win the match and to fight until the last for our objective, which is the Europa League.\n\"Since I started we are fourth in the table. If we cannot get the Champions League then the Europa League is important.\n\"No doubt the subs were important. I knew they would give us the freshness that we needed.\n\"I am proud of them and happy with the points. Serge Aurier is a very strong character, every person is different and in his case he wanted to play.\"\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce: \"It's the best we've played in a long time. They were excellent. Realistically we were safe months ago so the challenge has been can we finish as best as we can? Their attitude and application was excellent today and you don't always get what you deserve.\n\"We were naive after we equalised and we gave Harry Kane too much room. You know it's a goal and that's the difference, that quality at the top of the pitch.\n\"Fabian Schar looks like he has dislocated his shoulder and Allan Saint-Maximin has a calf [injury] - we'll have to see on him but we are down to the bare bones. We were already missing seven.\n\"It's about getting a few back for the start of next season now.\"\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\nMatch stats - Son's best Premier League season\nOnly Liverpool and Manchester City have won more Premier League games than Tottenham since Mourinho's first game in November.\nOnly against Alex Ferguson (17) has Newcastle manager Steve Bruce managed more Premier League matches without winning than he has against Mourinho (10 - two draws and eight defeats).\nNewcastle had 22 shots, the most they have had in a Premier League game this season and the most they have had in a defeat in the competition since October 2018 v Brighton (27).\nMatt Ritchie has scored two goals in six Premier League games for Newcastle since the return in mid-June, as many as he managed in his previous 51 appearances in the top flight.\nSpurs forward Son Heung-min has had a direct hand in 21 Premier League goals this season (11 goals, 10 assists), his best return in a single season in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nSpurs host Champions League hopefuls Leicester City on Saturday (16:00 BST), with Newcastle at struggling Brighton on Monday (20:00).\nThe Young Offenders are back: Watch the series three trailer now\nJoe Wicks with Gordon Ramsay: Nine things we learned about the famous chef"

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Late Chris Wood penalty steals point for hosts\nChris Wood scored a dramatic stoppage-time penalty to secure a draw with Wolves as both sides failed to further their European ambitions.\nWood fired his spot kick into the top corner in the 96th minute after Matt Doherty was judged to have handled in the area.\nRaul Jimenez had put Wolves ahead with a superb volley from the edge of the box after 76 minutes.\nIt looked like Nuno Espirito Santo's side had closed the gap on a Champions League place to one point, albeit having played a game more than rivals Leicester City and Manchester United.\nHowever, Burnley, who have Europa League hopes of their own, almost levelled when Wood nodded wide of an open goal with keeper Rui Patricio stranded.\nAnd moments later a hopeful cross struck Doherty on the arm and the New Zealand international made no mistake with his penalty.\nIt means Burnley sit ninth in the Premier League, whiles Wolves remain sixth and three points off the top four.\nIs this the end of the road for Dyche and Burnley?\nAction and reaction from Wednesday's Premier League games\nClarets show resolve to snatch point\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche says he was once told by Ian Holloway his side have a \"strong jaw\", and they had to show all their resilience to earn a point against Wolves.\nJimenez looked to have landed a knockout blow when he struck with 14 minutes to play but Burnley have lost just one of their past 14 league games for a reason.\nThe hosts had offered little in way of an attacking threat before added time, half chances for Jay Rodriguez and Josh Brownhill not troubling goalkeeper Patricio.\nBut then came two glorious opportunities for Wood, who showed composure to convert his spot-kick after a long VAR check having earlier turned his header wide.\n\"I went all game with one chance I didn't put away so it's nice to get another chance and get a point,\" said Wood afterwards.\n\"It was great mentality from Woody,\" Dyche added. \"When he missed that chance, it shows you what a strong character he is to step up and take the penalty and finish it in the style he did.\"\nIt means the Clarets are unbeaten in six games and still hold an outside chance of making the Europa League.\nDyche, however, will no doubt be satisfied if they record a top-half finish this season.\nWolves let it slip late on\nWolves' hopes of qualifying for the Champions League this season were dealt a significant blow when Manchester City's two-year European ban was overturned on Monday, taking fifth place out of the equation.\nThey will be looking at themselves for dropping points on Wednesday, however, after failing to convert their attacking dominance into more goals.\nThis was the 26th time Wolves have failed to score in the first half of a league game this season, with Jimenez heading straight at Pope and Romain Saiss flicking Joao Moutinho's dangerous corner over the crossbar.\nAdama Traore, a constant threat on Wolves' right, flashed an effort wide of the far post shortly after the break and it took a wonderful piece of skill from Jimenez to put them ahead.\nAfter another threatening Traore run, Doherty's effort deflected into the path of Jimenez and the forward opportunistically struck it first time on the volley for his 17th Premier League strike of the season.\nIt was Wolves' 36th goal in the second half this season - three times more than they have netted in the first 45 minutes of games.\nIt is also almost a year since Wolves began their season, a 2-0 second qualifying-round win over Crusaders in the Europa League on 25 July 2019, and this was their 55th game in all competitions.\nPerhaps that lengthy campaign took its toll late on at Turf Moor, when the visitors looked set for another impressive win before Burnley's last-gasp equaliser.\nMan of the match - Adama Traore (Wolves)\nProlific Jimenez notches again - the stats\nSince beating Burnley in their first Premier League meeting under Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo (1-0 in September 2018), Wolves have gone winless in the three meetings since (D2 L1).\n73% of Wolves' goals in the Premier League this season have been scored in the second half (36/49); the highest percentage of any side.\nRaul Jimenez is the first Wolves player to reach 17 league goals in the top flight in a single season since John Richards in 1975-76 (also 17).\nOnly Mohamed Salah has scored more Premier League goals in 2020 than Wolves' Jimenez (9).\nChris Wood's equaliser from the penalty spot was Burnley's only shot on target in the game, coming in the 96th minute.\n'They never seem to know when they're beaten'\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"It's another interesting twist that goes our way, and we worked to make it do so. It was another good finish to a strange game.\n\"The Premier League is very unforgiving, and to put that run of games together and put points on the table in that run as well, coming out of a tough run when it started, I can't speak highly enough of this group.\n\"They continue to give more and more to the cause. Players come in and they deliver. There is a relentlessness to what they're doing. They never seem to know when they're beaten.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"Every goal you concede is hard to take and if it is in the final moments it is even harder.\n\"I think we played good, we were well organised on the pitch and it was a good game. The team were always in control, we managed the game well. You try to prepare good but after that sometimes justice in the game doesn't exist.\n\"But this is not the point of football.

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 Bournemouth: David Silva scores one and assists another to leave Cherries in trouble\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe said he was \"devastated\" after their battling defeat at Manchester City left them three points adrift of Premier League safety with two games remaining.\n\"It's difficult at this stage to cling to positives because you need results and points over everything,\" said Howe, who has been Cherries manager in each of the top four divisions.\nAfter Bournemouth had seen a series of chances come and go, David Brooks' late strike gave them the hope of an unlikely point at Etihad Stadium but they fell short of another comeback to boost their fading survival hopes.\nDavid Silva had put City ahead with a superb free-kick after just six minutes, curling in from the right-hand corner of the box via the underside of the bar.\nPep Guardiola's side had scored five times in each of their previous two outings but, in their first game since learning their European ban has been overturned, they did not seem in the mood to punish their opponents further.\nInstead it was Bournemouth, fresh from their remarkable comeback to beat Leicester at the weekend, who threatened a repeat of that recovery here.\nThe visitors went close in the first half when Ederson had to push Junior Stanislas's whipped free-kick on to his post, and was fortunate when the ball bounced back off his head and out of play.\nSoon afterwards, City's Brazilian goalkeeper needed the help of Nicolas Otamendi to deflect Dominic Solanke's goalbound shot over the bar, and Philip Billing headed over from the resulting corner.\nBournemouth were on top and appeared full of confidence, but they were left to rue their wastefulness in front of goal when Gabriel Jesus struck City's second before half-time.\nThere were five defenders around Jesus when he collected David Silva's pass inside the box but he beat two of them with a step-over and a dart into space before planting his shot into the bottom corner of the net.\nEven then, the Cherries were not done but when they did get the ball in the City net after the break, it was ruled out for the most marginal of offsides.\nStanislas cut back inside the box and bent the ball past Ederson but Joshua King was flagged offside after applying the final touch at the far post, and the video assistant referee confirmed the decision by the width of his big toe.\nIt appeared City would get the chance to wrap things up from the spot when Lee Mason awarded them a penalty for Steve Cook's tackle on Jesus, but VAR overruled his decision.\nThat gave Bournemouth fresh hope and Brooks set up a frenetic finish when Callum Wilson burst forward and found Brooks clear in front of goal to slot home.\nThe duo combined again deep in injury time, but Wilson saw his shot roll wide and his side's hopes of salvaging a point were over.\nHowe said: \"I'm hugely disappointed not to get anything. We were fully committed and the players gave everything, right to the end, and created a number of chances. It is a tough one to take.\n\"We have to take a lot of confidence from the last three matches and we are certainly much improved from where we were. Hopefully the players will take a lot of confidence from that today and Southampton is our only focus now.\"\nCoverage of Wednesday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v DJ & Aston Villa fan Nathan Dawe\nBournemouth left to rue what might have been\nBournemouth had lost all nine of their previous Premier League meetings with City but they will feel they deserved to end that poor run here.\nEddie Howe's side managed 14 shots in total, more than any other away league team at the Etihad during Guardiola's reign.\nA combination of bad luck and poor finishing means they do not have anything tangible to show for it, at least in terms of points that are so precious to them in their current situation.\nBut there were positives, not least the way they avoided any further damage to their goal difference - something Howe must have feared before the game given City's current form.\nHowe spoke before the game about how his side still believed they could stay up, and this performance proved they are still fighting hard to save themselves.\nCity short of energy and ideas\nCity's team selection appeared to have one eye on their date with Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday night, and their performance was below par too.\nGuardiola's side are the highest scorers in the Premier League this season but they seemed short of energy and ideas in attack on this occasion, perhaps because of their intense recent schedule.\nTwo bits of lethal finishing gave them breathing space before the break but they only managed one further effort at goal in the second half, when Phil Foden saw his effort blocked at close-range by Aaron Ramsdale.\nWith second-place already secured and next year's Champions League appearance now certain, they had little to play for against Bournemouth, and it showed.\nMan of the match - Junior Stanislas (Bournemouth)\nThe stats\nThis was Guardiola's 150th Premier League match as manager. He has won 111 games - six more than any other manager in their first 150 in the competition.\nManchester City have won their last six home Premier League matches by an aggregate score of 21-1.\nMeanwhile, Bournemouth have lost their last nine away Premier League matches, conceding 22 goals in the process.\nThe Cherries were the first team to attempt more shots at goal (14-8) than Manchester City in a league match at the Etihad since Stoke City in April 2016.\nThey were also the first side to do so against a team managed by Guardiola since Hoffenheim in March 2014.\nEnglish managers have taken just four points in their last 30 away Premier League matches against Manchester City, with all four being won by Roy Hodgson's Crystal Palace.\nDavid Silva has scored with each of his last two direct free-kick attempts in the Premier League, with those coming in his last three games. He had scored just one direct free-kick goal in his previous 305 appearances.\nSilva is the third oldest player in Premier League history to reach 10 assists in a single campaign (34 years 189 days), after Dennis Bergkamp and Paolo Di Canio.\nWhat next? City head for Wembley\nCity, who have already successfully defended the Carabao Cup this season, are looking to keep the FA Cup in their trophy cabinet too, and the holders play Arsenal in the semi-finals at an empty Wembley on Saturday at 19:45 BST.\nBournemouth continue their survival fight when they host south-coast rivals Southampton on Sunday at 14:00 BST."

We've had sloppy moments before and not been punished for it but this is good because we have to learn from it.

He has been a real revelation since stepping in for the injured Bernd Leno and was excellent again here, dominating his area and also producing a fine save from Mohamed Salah in the second half.\nThis was not an artistic Arsenal performance but Arteta will have been delighted with the sheer industry and resilience on show, especially as they face another team who will want to dominate possession as they prepare to confront Manchester City at Wembley on Saturday to battle for a place in the FA Cup final.\nLiverpool lack their usual edge\nLiverpool will be disappointed to miss out on that Premier League points record but it is almost inevitable a crucial edge would be taken off their game after securing the club's first title in 30 years with seven games still to play.\nAnd it showed here in those awful errors by Van Dijk, so careless when he is normally so precise, and goalkeeper Alisson, who was sloppy with a clearance to allow Nelson to score.\nThere was no shortage of effort or determination from Jurgen Klopp's side but even up front they did not possess the ruthless streak that has been such a part of their success, with Salah heading tamely at Martinez when free at the far post and other good positions escaping them.\nLiverpool have now lost three league games in winning the title when they only lost one in finishing second to Manchester City last term, that sole defeat coming against the eventual champions at Etihad Stadium - and while one piece of history will not be theirs they can still look forward to receiving the trophy on a special podium erected on the Kop when they play Chelsea next Wednesday.\nMan of the match - Emiliano Martinez (Arsenal)\nKlopp suffers first league defeat by Gunners - the stats\nArsenal defeated Liverpool in the Premier League for the first time since April 2015, while it is the first time Jurgen Klopp has lost against the Gunners in the competition after winning five and drawing three previously.\nLiverpool suffered their first league defeat in a game in which they opened the scoring since April 2017, ending a run of 83 consecutive league games without losing after scoring first.\nThis was Arsenal's first Premier League win against the team starting at the top of the table since February 2016, losing each of their previous five.\nLiverpool have conceded 10 goals in their last five Premier League away games - as many as in their previous 19 league games on the road.\nSadio Mane has scored six goals against Arsenal in the Premier League, only scoring more against Crystal Palace (nine).\nArsenal's equaliser came from the first error made by Virgil van Dijk that has led to a goal in the Premier League since March 2019.\nAlexandre Lacazette has been directly involved in four goals in three Premier League appearances against Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium, scoring twice.\nReiss Nelson netted his first Premier League goal for Arsenal, becoming the fifth different player aged 20 or under to score for the Gunners in the competition this season along with Saka, Nketiah, Martinelli and Willock.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal face Manchester City in their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday (19:45 BST), before their penultimate Premier League game of the season against Aston Villa on Tuesday (20:15).\nLiverpool have a week to recover before their next league match, against Chelsea on Wednesday (20:15).\nThe Young Offenders are back: Watch the series three trailer now\nJoe Wicks with Gordon Ramsay: Nine things we learned about the famous chef"

We have two games to go to create some more history,\" he said.\n\"We all sat down at the start of season and said, it would be huge challenge for Leicester to get into Europe, so do that in my first season here, to guarantee that is a phenomenal achievement.\"\nThe hosts, who dominated most of the game, went ahead when impressive 19-year-old debutant Luke Thomas crossed low to set up Perez after 29 minutes.\nThey should have extended their lead after the break when Harvey Barnes was twice denied by United goalkeeper Dean Henderson after clever through balls by Jamie Vardy.\nThe Foxes' top scorer also hit the post, and it looked as though Sheffield United might be fortunate enough to equalise when Jack O'Connell's shot was tipped wide by Kasper Schmeichel.\nBut, as the game hung in the balance, substitute Gray, on for Barnes, collected Vardy's pass and beat Henderson to finally seal the win after 79 minutes.\nLeicester's victory was only their second in six games since the restart but it was a timely boost for Rodgers' team, who are ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United on goal difference.\nBlades boss Chris Wilder was fuming with his players afterwards as the result ended a four-game unbeaten run which included wins over Tottenham, Wolves and Chelsea.\nThey remain eighth, two points behind sixth-placed Wolves, with the prospect of European football next season now out of their hands.\nReaction to Thursday's Premier League action\nThomas and Vardy shine as Leicester impress\nThe hosts have struggled since the Premier League's restart, but this was a vastly improved display after their chastening 4-1 loss at relegation-threatened Bournemouth and it was engineered by an impressive blend of youth and experience in their side.\nTheir biggest threat in the first half came down the left side where Barnes's pace was boosted by some fine crossing by England under-19 international Thomas, who had already picked out Perez for a close-range header before he supplied the Spaniard's eighth goal of the season.\nFilling in for the injured Ben Chilwell, who has been linked with a move to Chelsea, Thomas showed his manager Rodgers that he is a more than capable back-up.\nLed by the impressive Youri Tielemans, who orchestrated Leicester's midfield to out-manoeuvre the visitors, the 2016 Premier League champions could have been further ahead before the break but for Henderson thwarting both Vardy and Perez.\nHaving bossed the first half, they were then forced to play on the counter attack after the break following a triple half-time substitution by Wilder.\nThat shift played into the hands of Vardy, who showed his guile at the age of 33 to twice set up Barnes. The midfielder really should have capitalised.\nIt felt like they could be crucial misses as the Blades pressed for an equaliser, but it was Barnes' replacement Gray who had the required composure as he collected Vardy's clever lay-off and steered into the net for his third of the season.\nIt was ample reward for a display which bodes well for their remaining games this season and another potential Champions League campaign next season.\nBlades suffer after impressive run\nWhether Sheffield United play European football next season or not, it has already been a brilliant campaign for Wilder's team, their first back in the top flight after a 12-season gap.\nThe fact they shook off a poor start when the Premier League resumed to earn 10 points from 12 in their previous four matches was a testament to their durability and craft.\nBut after three wins over teams above them, they found Leicester a more difficult task.\nAlthough they made a good start where David McGoldrick fired over from George Baldock's cross, they were second best for much of the first half as Leicester's players, set up in a 3-4-3 formation, continually asked questions of the Blades' resolute defence.\nMuch of that was down to Tielemans. Even though the visitors had an extra man in central midfield, they could not get near the excellent Belgian.\nThat led to Wilder making a triple substitution as John Lundstram, John Fleck and Lys Mousset replaced Sander Berge, Ben Osborn and the ineffective McGoldrick.\nIt led to a slight improvement, but O'Connell's effort after 63 minutes following John Egan's nod back from a corner was their first shot on target.\nThe Blades continued to probe, although their best efforts came from set-pieces and, as they left gaps in their defence, it was Vardy's threat was which eventually their undoing.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\nEvery day's a win day for Foxes - the stats\nLeicester have won back-to-back home league games without conceding in each victory for the first time since January 2018.\nThis is the first time they have kept a clean sheet in four straight home league matches since February 2016 during their title-winning campaign under Claudio Ranieri.\nSheffield United have gone five away league outings without a win (D2 L3) for the first time since April 2018 in the Championship.\nBrendan Rodgers is now unbeaten in 15 home Premier League matches against promoted clubs (W11 D4) across his time in charge at both Leicester and Liverpool.\nLeicester have completed a league double over Sheffield United for the first time since the 1928-29 campaign.\nLeicester have now won a Premier League game on every day of the week, with this their first top-flight victory on a Thursday since December 1985 versus Aston Villa (3-1).\nAged 19 years 36 days, Luke Thomas became the third youngest player to make his first Premier League start for Leicester City, after Emile Heskey (17y 56d v QPR in March 1995) and Stuart Campbell (18y 357d v Man Utd in November 1996).\nThomas is also the youngest English player to assist a goal on his Premier League debut since Marcus Rashford for Manchester United in February 2016 (18y 120d), and was and the 15th English teenager to do so overall.\n'We never deserved anything'\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder: \"We were way off of it. We have taken some enormous steps forward this season, but the goalkeeper kept us in the game. We never deserved anything form the game - off it from the first minute to the 90th, no excuse from us. Technically very poor, physically out-fought.\n\"We have done a job on a couple of teams recently but their fight was bigger than ours and they wanted the result more.\n\"They were sharper, quicker in thought and in action. We have helped them get going again.\"\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers on Sky Sports: \"I thought we were brilliant, Sheffield United deserve so much credit for how they have worked and how Chris Wilder has got them playing, but we were outstanding.\n\"We have played well since we have come back but not been consistent enough. Tonight we were able to do that. A very good performance.\n\"The result gives us the second-highest finish in Leicester's history. We have two games to go to create some more history.\"\nWhat next?\nLeicester visit Tottenham on Sunday (16:00 BST), while Sheffield United host Everton on Monday (18:00).\nFootball Daily: Reaction to the latest twists in the race for Europe\nHometown: A Killing: The story of a police shooting unravelled"

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-1 Brighton: Danny Ings goal keeps Brighton waiting\nBrighton need a point from their last two games to stay in the Premier League after Danny Ings' 20th league goal of the season denied them victory at Southampton.\nThe Seagulls would have secured a place in the top flight with a win and went ahead through Neal Maupay's low shot.\nBut the Saints improved in the second half and deservedly equalised when Ings easily beat goalkeeper Mat Ryan.\nIngs is the first Saints player to score 20 goals in a Premier League season since James Beattie in 2002-03.\nThe former Liverpool forward was once again outstanding in attack for the home side, having an effort rightly ruled out for offside in the first half and cracking a shot against the post before he eventually did score.\nHis goal also ensured that Southampton did not set a new club record of 11 home defeats in a Premier League season.\nBrighton are six points clear of 18th-placed Bournemouth with six available, and have a better goal difference, but a point against Newcastle next Monday would cement their place in the top flight.\nIngs excels again\nIngs predicted this would be his \"most exciting season\" when he joined permanently from Liverpool last summer for \u00a320m - and he was spot on.\nThat fee looks cheap now - at \u00a31m a goal - and only Jamie Vardy has scored more in the league.\nIngs had a match-high five shots and always looked a threat, as well as twice going close to creating a goal for substitute Che Adams in a second half dominated by Southampton.\n\"The progress he has made in this year is amazing,\" said manager Ralph Hasenhuttl after the game.\n\"He is fit, he works so hard, he wins the ball so many times. This is definitely a striker who deserves so many goals.\"\nThe Saints' poor home form remains somewhat of a mystery - they are the only club in the division to earn more points on the road - but they are unbeaten in five games now and are ending the season strongly.\nThey may soon lose midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, however. News broke during the match that Everton have opened talks with Southampton for the Denmark international - who actually filled in at right-back to good effect in the first half.\nPotter close to safety\nBrighton took a gamble last summer when they dispensed with safe pair of hands Chris Hughton and appointed Swansea's Graham Potter - but it has undoubtedly paid off.\nPotter has introduced a more attractive and fluid style of play and has increased the Seagulls' numbers for possession, successful passes, goals, shots, clean sheets and touches in the opposition's penalty area. Crucially, he has got them all but safe with two games to spare.\nHe has also now taken them beyond last season's points total of 36, and could yet engineer a best finish since 1982, when thy finished 13th in the old Division One table.\nGlenn Murray returned for a rare start up front and he made Maupay's goal with a flick-on, which the former Brentford striker buried for his 10th goal of the season.\nThe Seagulls were on top in the first half but then showed fine defensive commitment to keep the hosts down to one goal in reply.\nSouthampton had 15 efforts in the second half, with Brighton goalkeeper Ryan making one sensational save in particular when he turned Jannik Vestergaard's 25-yard strike against the crossbar.\nCentre-backs Lewis Dunk, Adam Webster and Dan Burn also made six blocks and seven interceptions between them as Brighton hung on at times.\n\"We have found resilience away from home and all credit to the players,\" Potter said.\n\"Our defensive effort was fantastic.\"\nReaction from all of Thursday's Premier League action\nLawro's predictions v DJ and Aston Villa fan Nathan Dawe\nMan of the match - Lewis Dunk (Brighton)\n'At half-time it was a disaster'\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"At half-time it was a disaster, we were not the team you have seen in the last weeks in the first half. But we played much quicker, made the right decisions and it was a good game in the second half.\n\"We made a few changes, maybe too many but what can you do? We didn't find the right tools in the first half but it was a very intensive rebuild at half-time.\"\nBrighton boss Graham Potter: \"Every point is hard earned in the Premier League. We've got two more games to get some more and this was an important point.\n\"Mat Ryan wasn't happy about his performance against Manchester City but that's the ups and downs of football, sometimes you're the hero and some times you're the villain.\n\"If we are being honest, Southampton were much better in the second half and pushed us back. We had to defend with our lives and make blocks.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton head down the coast to struggling Bournemouth on Sunday (14:00 BST), while Brighton can secure their place in the Premier League with a point at home to Newcastle on Monday (18:00).\nFootball Daily: Reaction to the latest twists in the race for Europe\nHometown: A Killing: The story of a police shooting unravelled"

These are the games that matter. That is the thing at Manchester United, you have to step up and show your personality.\"\nUnited were made to work for their victory, Marcus Rashford breaking the deadlock with a stylish finish in first-half stoppage time before playing his part in a sweet move involving Bruno Fernandes that was rounded off by Anthony Martial in the 78th minute.\nPalace felt a real sense of injustice, furious that they were denied a penalty just before United took the lead when Wilfried Zaha tangled with Victor Lindelof, and then seeing a potential 55th-minute equaliser from Jordan Ayew ruled out by VAR for a very marginal offside.\nIt meant Roy Hodgson's side slumped to their sixth consecutive league loss and their night was made worse when defender Patrick van Aanholt suffered a dislocated shoulder after trying to prevent Martial scoring United's second.\nUnited set up date with destiny\nUnited were not at their best and were grateful to goalkeeper David de Gea for some fine saves, particularly from Zaha, while he also did well to keep out Luka Milivojevic's free-kick.\nThis, however, is a United team developing a ruthless streak, demonstrated by Rashford's calm finish for the opener, and then an artistic move constructed by Rashford and Fernandes that enabled Martial to complete the job in style.\nUnited needed the instant response after Leicester's win earlier on Thursday and there is real efficiency as well as a rapier thrust to Solskjaer's side that has taken them on this long unbeaten run.\nIt leaves them in contention for that top-four place, as well as the Europa League, and they also have an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea at Wembley this weekend.\nMost mouth-watering of all, they face a potentially decisive visit to Leicester on the final day of the season.\nPalace cursing their luck\nPalace's season is fizzling out after their latest loss, the promise of that impressive first post-lockdown win at Bournemouth seeming an age away.\nThis, however, was no tame surrender and Palace gave a good account of themselves, only to be undone by United's quality.\nAnd certainly Hodgson and his players will feel they were hard done by when their appeals for a penalty as Zaha tangled with Lindelof were ignored.\nPalace chairman Steve Parish expressed his frustration on social media. \"Is the VAR broken? Serious question,\" he tweeted.\n, external\nThere was more frustration when Ayew's 55th-minute finish at the far post from Zaha's cross-shot was ruled out after a lengthy VAR inspection, the striker being ruled offside by the thinnest of margins.\n\"Certainly we are not fortunate at the moment. The gods of fortune are not smiling on us with certain decisions,\" Hodgson said afterwards.\n\"We have won games and got good results against top teams like Manchester United playing a lot worse than we did tonight.\"\nPalace are comfortable in 14th place but there is no question the end to their season has been something of an anti-climax.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford (Man Utd)\nUnbeaten run continues - the stats\nUnited have gone unbeaten in their last 19 games in all competitions (W14 D5) - their longest such run since a 29-game streak ending in November 2010 under Alex Ferguson.\nRoy Hodgson has lost six consecutive Premier League games for the first time since losing his last three with Blackburn in November 1998 and his first three with Fulham in January 2008.\nPalace remain winless in their last 16 home Premier League encounters against 'big six' sides (D3 L13) since a 2-1 victory against Chelsea in October 2017.\nSeven goals which were originally awarded against United have been overturned by VAR this season, the joint-most of any side in the Premier League this campaign (alongside Southampton and Brighton).\nAnthony Martial and Marcus Rashford have now assisted one another a combined seven times in this season's Premier League, the most of any pairing in a single season for Man Utd in the competition.\nTimothy Fosu-Mensah made his first league appearance for United since May 2017, three years and 56 days ago; only Paul Pogba (4y 154d in Aug 2016) and Will Keane (4y 44d in Feb 2016) have had a longer gap between appearances for the club in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nWhile Palace are away at Wolves on Monday (20:15 BST), United are getting ready for an FA Cup semi-final with Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday (18:00 BST).\nMore to follow.\nFootball Daily: Reaction to the latest twists in the race for Europe\nHometown: A Killing: The story of a police shooting unravelled"

To play 500 games for the club you grew up supporting, grew up half a mile away from here, your family support - it's what dreams are made of.\"\nThe picture looks much bleaker for Nigel Pearson's men, who lie just three points outside the relegation zone and face Manchester City and Arsenal in their remaining games.\nThe hosts scored twice in the opening 10 minutes through the in-form Michail Antonio, who swept home and Tomas Soucek's bullet header from Jarrod Bowen's cross.\nDeclan Rice curled in a sublime third before half-time and, although Troy Deeney pulled a goal back at the start of the second half, Watford could not conjure a miraculous turnaround.\nRelive West Ham's win over Watford\n'Promise less and deliver more' - West Ham do just that\nFormer Manchester United and Everton boss Moyes was appointed for a second spell as West Ham boss in December, with the side just one point above the relegation zone.\nPreserving the club's top-flight status will have been the aim and Moyes will achieve that objective barring a freak set of results over the coming days.\nWest Ham's goal difference currently stands at -13, considerably better than Bournemouth's -25 and Aston Villa's -27 so even if they are caught on points there will need to be a colossal goal swing for them to be dragged down into the Championship.\nPrior to the match, Moyes had asked his players to \"promise less and deliver more\" and they did just that in a terrific first-half showing that eased any nerves.\nForward Antonio, fresh from scoring four against Norwich in the previous game, took his tally to nine for the season with a calm, left-footed finish to set them on their way.\nSoucek's flying header and Rice's delightful goal ended the game as a contest, despite there being nearly an hour still to play.\nMoyes said: \"We are in a good position. Teams still have that chance and we have to do that job. Even scoring the goals has helped - I wanted us to keep our goal difference as good as it could be.\n\"We have 37 points with a couple of games to go. If we get 40 points we'll have done it off our own back.\"\nHammer blow for Hornets\nThe sides occupied the two places immediately outside the relegation zone and the result was a damaging blow for Watford and their ambitions of staying up.\nHeading into the game, the Hornets had shown decent form by picking up back-to-back victories but a desperately poor first half could prove fatal.\nPearson's men remain perilously placed - they need four points to be certain of staying up but finish the season with a daunting home fixture against Pep Guardiola's City and a trip to Arsenal.\nPearson said: \"First half we let the game pass us by. We had passengers, which is disappointing at this stage of the season.\n\"The second-half performance was much improved - very competitive. It's annoying. Very disappointing. It means now we have got to find another one or two good results.\n\"We know that [we have the toughest run-in] but we have to cope with it. I can't waste time thinking about what everyone else will do.\n\"It comes back to bite you where you don't want to be bitten.\"\nMan of the match - Declan Rice (West Ham)\nRice said: \"It's the best I've scored - it's only my third goal! I scored two bangers in the warm-up, the lads are always on to me to shoot more, when I saw it hit the back of the net it was a great feeling - it wouldn't have looked good to get a blank this season.\"\nWhat next?\nWatford host Manchester City on Tuesday (kick-off 18:00 BST), while West Ham travel to Manchester United the following day (18:00).\nGet the ball to Bowen - the stats\nWest Ham United have won consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since August 2019.\nWatford have lost five consecutive Premier League away matches for the first time since May 2018 (six in a row).\nSince the Premier League restarted in June, West Ham's Michail Antonio has scored more Premier League goals than any other player (7).\nWatford skipper Troy Deeney has scored in consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since March 2018.\nWest Ham scored twice in the first 10 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time since September 2014 against Liverpool.\nWest Ham's Jarrod Bowen has assisted four Premier League goals in his last five Premier League appearances.\nRupert Murdoch: The rise of a media dynasty\nThe Young Offenders are back: Watch the trailer for series 3 now"

They wanted to break up our rhythm. They tried to null ourselves a little bit, bring hectic into the game, tried to provoke a little bit,\" Farke told BBC Sport.\n\"I'm not accusing them because that's exactly what you have to do if you're an experienced team. My players walked into this trap and there were two red cards which of course was crucial to the game.\n\"You have to call this situation naive, inexperienced, stupid and not professional - all the words fit. The players know what they have done for this team. The red cards are not a doubt.\"\nIt had been an uneventful opening half an hour before Norwich's capitulation, with just one shot on target from either side.\nThe hosts defended well at times in the second half to keep the score down but Burnley's victory was confirmed when Ben Godfrey poked the ball into the back of his own net with 10 minutes remaining.\nNorwich become only the third club in the Premier League to lose five in a row at home without scoring, while Burnley move above Arsenal into ninth place.\nFrom disastrous to unforgiveable for Norwich\nAfter Norwich's relegation from the Premier League was confirmed by a 4-0 thrashing against West Ham at Carrow Road on 11 July, it seemed things could not get much worse for Daniel Farke's side.\nHowever, the 1-0 defeat by Chelsea that followed meant they set a new club record of eight consecutive league defeats, and 25 overall - which was also the most they had suffered in one campaign.\nCanaries fans' only hope was that they would go down with a fight in their remaining two games.\nBut the most conspicuous aggression shown from Farke's side in the first half was in Buendia's hot-headed elbow on Westwood - a reaction to a scuffle off the ball in midfield.\nFriend reviewed it on the screen following encouragement from the video assistant referee and that was the catalyst for a capitulation from Norwich that took all of 14 minutes.\nAlready a man down, the hosts started to face some pressure - Tim Krul reacted well to save Dwight McNeil's deflected free-kick, before Wood appeared to trip over his own feet as he tried to tap in from close range.\nThen came Drmic's reckless tackle on Pieters which drew another red card from Friend, again reviewed by VAR and the decision upheld.\nAnd Norwich's nightmare continued when Wood eventually gave Burnley the lead - Johann Gudmundsson slipped as he curled it in from the right and it bounced off Wood's shin as his overhead effort rolled into the bottom corner.\nKrul's reaction - punching the post in frustration - summed up Norwich's performance and when Godfrey slid the ball past Krul and into his own net under no pressure at the back post, the final whistle could not come soon enough for the Canaries.\nFor Norwich, the season could get worse still when they travel to Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City in their final game.\nAnother clean sheet for Pope\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche said his team would be ready to face whatever came their way from a struggling Norwich side.\nBut in truth, the Clarets were handed victory on a plate and will probably be disappointed not to have scored more in the second half.\nRodriguez, Wood, Phil Bardsley and Matej Vydra all came close but Krul was sharp in goal for Norwich and the hosts showed at least the desire to put their bodies on the line to block every shot.\nThe victory was Burnley's 15th in the Premier League this season - a club record for the competition. Not since 1975 have they won 15 or more top-flight matches.\nIt was also another clean sheet which means Burnley keeper Nick Pope takes his tally to 15 - the most of any keeper in the league. He had a quiet evening but reacted well to a late effort from Onel Hernandez which deflected off a defender, and kept out a diving header from Godfrey in the first half.\nPope is on course to become the first goalkeeper from a club outside the established 'big six' to win the Golden Glove award, and team-mate Wood told Sky Sports afterwards they would be \"fighting like hell\" to help him achieve it.\n'We walked into the trap' - what they said\nNorwich boss Daniel Farke speaking to Sky Sports: \"Burnley reacted in their expected ways. They are such an experienced and established Premier League team. They realised they had problems and needed to disrupt the rhythm and provoke.\n\"We walked into the trap and two red cards. Naive, inexperienced, stupid - all the words are right. It's not acceptable. It's not possible to win points with eight players.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to Sky Sports: \"I don't think I've played against a team with two sendings-off. It was a bizarre game! We'll take the clean sheet and the win.\n\"We needed something because it was a strange game. The whole thing was strange. [Chris Wood] found the net from an awkward one. In the second half, we tried but our quality in the final third was quite obvious today. It's hard to judge it. We weren't really at it in the first half but we just need that sharpness. It's a lot to ask of the players.\"\nThe best of the stats\nSince the restart last month, only Manchester City (18) and Manchester United (17) have earned more Premier League points than Burnley (15 - W4 D3 L1).\nBurnley extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to seven games (W4 D3) - only Manchester United are currently on a longer active streak (12).\nNorwich suffered their 12th home defeat of the Premier League campaign, their joint-most in a league campaign in the club's history (also 12 in 1946-47 in the Third Division South).\nWood has scored three of Burnley's four goals against Norwich in the Premier League this season - the only player to score more for the club against an opponent in the same Premier League campaign is Graham Alexander (four versus Hull in 2009-10).\nBuendia was sent off in a game within the top five European leagues for the first time since May 2016, when he was dismissed while playing for Getafe v Real Betis in LaLiga.\nMan of the match - Ashley Westwood (Burnley)\nWhat's next?\nNorwich travel to Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City in their final match of the season on Sunday, 26 July (16:00 BST).

It feels like that has slipped away a little bit.\n\"I am deeply disappointed, hurt, loads of different emotions are going through my body right now.\"\nThe Cherries - who must win at Everton next Sunday to have any chance of survival - are three points behind the 17th-placed Hornets, who are set to sack Nigel Pearson, with a worse goal difference by four.\nIngs, 27, opened the scoring with a fine finish from just outside the box - his 21st Premier League goal of the season.\nBut he failed to move within a goal of the league's top scorer Jamie Vardy when his penalty was saved by Aaron Ramsdale.\nBournemouth ended with half their team playing up front and Harry Wilson's curling effort was tipped around the post by Alex McCarthy before the late, late drama.\nAfter Surridge's goal was ruled out, Adams smashed home to make the Cherries' goal difference even worse.\nBournemouth were so close...\nBournemouth's rise from the bottom of League Two to become an established Premier League team under Eddie Howe has been a great story in recent years.\nBut that could soon all be over after a run of nine defeats in their past 12 games.\nThree points off safety - with a worse goal difference and one game left - might seem like a forgone conclusion. But Watford's tough run-in against the Gunners and City will give Howe hope of at least taking it to the final day.\nHowever, their goal difference takes them below Aston Villa in the league, and four points from Villa's last two games - against Arsenal and West Ham - would also relegate the Cherries.\nThey played some nice football against their neighbours, especially in the first half, but all their efforts on target came in the last 25 minutes as they threw everything at Saints.\nHarry Wilson hit a weak shot towards McCarthy, with Steve Cook then heading straight at the keeper before Harry Wilson was so close to rescuing a point in injury time.\nSurridge thought he had his first Premier League goal late on but Callum Wilson was rightly judged to be offside before the substitute pounced by VAR.\nThe Cherries have been toothless this season and their fight was too little, too late on Sunday.\nNow they must just wait and hope their dreams do not end in two days' time at Vicarage Road.\nHas Ings missed chance at golden boot?\nSouthampton have been safe for a while - having looked doomed before Christmas - but their season has not petered out, with their unbeaten run now extended to six games.\nThe major subplot has been whether Ings, who has a solitary England cap, can win the Golden Boot.\nHe is on 21 goals for the season after his fine opener, when he took Nathan Redmond's pass, cut past a defender onto his right foot and curled his shot home.\nThat is the 10th time he has opened the scoring in a league game this season - and his fourth Premier League goal from outside the box this term. No player has managed more of either this campaign.\nHe went close again just after the break but curled wide.\nAnd he will rue his slow run-up for his penalty as Ramsdale guessed correctly to save his spot-kick. That leaves him two behind Leicester's 23-goal Vardy, who has two games left.\nAdams added a 98th-minute second from Michael Obafemi's pass as Bournemouth sent most of their players forward.\nRalph Hasenhuttl's side face Sheffield United next week in their final game.\nMan of the match - Aaron Ramsdale\n'We have to believe it's possible' - what the managers said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe speaking to BBC Sport: \"In some ways it sort of mirrored our season.\n\"It was a really cruel twist. We worked so hard to create the chances we needed and you think in that moment you've been rewarded.\n\"We've had a couple of nearly moments. If that was scored last year it would have counted. It certainly hurt us psychologically in that moment.\n\"We were in the game. The players were committed to everything we asked them to do today. I'm disappointed with the two goals we conceded.\n\"We've got to still believe it is possible. It is difficult and fate is out of our hands. We'll wait and see.\"\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl to BBC Sport: \"We had it in our own hands to make it clear and massive chances in the second half. I think Ingsy only makes the difficult ones, not the easy ones.\n\"He had to wait to shoot (the penalty) and maybe he's thinking about the 21 goals in his mind and maybe getting 22.\n\"The second goal would have killed the game earlier so it was a massive battle from my side. You see it is not necessary to play for relegation or Europa league, it is enough to play for three points.\"\nMatch stats - only Liverpool better on road than Saints\nBournemouth have suffered their 22nd league defeat of the season; only in the 1933-34 Third Division South (24) and the 1983-84 Third Division (23) have they lost more.\nSouthampton have picked up 31 points in away league games this season, their best ever return on the road in a top-flight campaign, while only champions Liverpool (41) have earned more in the 2019-20 Premier League.\nSouthampton are unbeaten in six Premier League matches (W3 D3), their longest such run since going seven unbeaten from April to August 2016.\nDanny Ings has scored in 19 different Premier League games this season, the most by any Southampton player in a single season in the competition, overtaking James Beattie's 18 in 2002-03.\nChe Adams' strike for Southampton (97:56) was the latest Premier League goal since November 2011, when Yakubu scored against Wigan for Blackburn (98:14).\nSouthampton's Nathan Redmond has assisted four Premier League goals against Bournemouth, at least twice as many as he has versus any other opponent. Redmond has assisted a goal in three consecutive league games for the first time in his career.\nSouthampton have missed three of their four penalties in the Premier League this season, while Ings missed one for the very first time in the competition having scored each of his first four.\nMatch of the Day Top 10: Gianfranco Zola reveals his career highlights\nGo Ask Your Mother: A parenting podcast with style"

        "article_text": "Tottenham 3-0 Leicester: Son Heung-min and Harry Kane score\nTottenham boosted their chances of Europa League football next season and inflicted a huge blow on Leicester's Champions League ambitions with a superb performance.\nBrendan Rodgers' Leicester side have been in the Premier League's top four for much of the season but this devastating away defeat leaves them with a difficult task going into their final league game next Sunday.\nThe Foxes finish the season against fifth-placed Manchester United, but should the Red Devils beat West Ham on Wednesday and claim a draw at the King Power, they will be assured of a top-four finish at the expense of Leicester.\nJames Justin's own goal from Son Heung-min's strike and a double from Harry Kane - including a sumptuous curling effort - sealed Spurs' victory following a splendid first-half showing.\nLeicester did have chances but could not find a way past an inspired Hugo Lloris, who made a string of superb saves to deny Jamie Vardy, Ayoze Perez and Demarai Gray.\nJose Mourinho's side move up to sixth in the table, two points clear of Wolves, but Nuno Espirito Santo's side have a game in hand.\nRelive Tottenham's victory over Leicester\nMourinho working his magic\nSpurs were in disarray when chairman Daniel Levy made the shock decision to sack the popular Mauricio Pochettino and replace him with ex-Chelsea and Manchester United boss Mourinho.\nThey were 14th in the league and had won just three of their opening 12 league games this season, but the Portuguese boss has utilised his vast experience to turn things around.\nThough a desperately poor loss against Sheffield United left him questioning the mentality of his players, their overall form has been excellent since the restart, and they have collected five wins and two draws from eight games.\nWhile clinching European football for next season looked unlikely earlier in the campaign, a late season surge means seventh could be enough for a Europa League spot, depending on the winners of the FA Cup.\nSpurs' finishing in the first 45 minutes was clinical - forward Son seeing his shot deflect in off James after wrong-footing Kasper Schmeichel, before England captain Kane showed his class.\nThe striker, who recently passed 200 career goals, has tormented Leicester whenever he has played against them and took his tally to 16 in 14 games against the Foxes with a cool, left-footed finish and a brilliant second which curled precisely into the far post past the reach of Schmeichel.\nHaving gone 3-0 up by half-time, there was no way back for Leicester in the second period as Mourinho's men expertly saw out the game.\nLeicester's misery continues\nLeicester boss Rodgers had said that a European spot was their target, one which they have accomplished, but he will be distraught at his side's capitulation since the restart which leaves them uncertain of a place in the Champions League next term.\nHaving been outstanding for the entire season and at one point being the closest challengers to eventual champions Liverpool, their miserable run has come at the wrong time and they have now won just two of their last eight games.\nThey are clinging on to fourth place but are level on points and goal difference with Manchester United, who know a heavy victory against West Ham in their next league match will leave Leicester needing a big win of their own on the final day.\nThey will be thankful to captain Schmeichel for making a crucial stop to thwart Son's dipping effort, as conceding another goal would have seen them drop down to fifth on goal difference.\nLeicester could easily have scored four or five goals but were unable to penetrate Lloris' goal, the France World Cup winner keeping out top-scorer Vardy's backheel.\nAnd the Tottenham captain made even better stops to add to Leicester's torment, showcasing his sharp reactions to twice repel Perez's volley and long-range drive as well as flying saves off Gray's long-range free-kick and Kelechi Iheanacho's curler.\n'We are really distraught at the first half' - what they said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers tells BBC Sport: \"They are a brilliant bunch of guys and honest. We played the shape well and were causing them problems. The first goal was a huge disappointment and that gave them energy.\n\"When they get to 3-0 at half-time they can then stay in and close it out. We are really distraught at the first half.\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho speaking to Sky Sports: \"I think we were strategically good. We knew what worked for us. Brendan Rodgers did an amazing job since he arrived but in this moment he is in a little bit of trouble with injuries. I know what it is because I had similar problems at the other end.\n\"Clearly we are one of the teams with more points during this period than after the break. Now we have to fight to finish sixth. We have to win and that is difficult and wait for something in our other opponents.\n\"Seventh is what we can achieve without dependence on the others. What we are doing and what we are improving is very important for next season.\"\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\nMourinho added: \"It is difficult for me to compare strikers but I had almost in every club some of the best. Of course, Harry is second to none. It's just different qualities. As a striker, as a goalscorer, a team player and a leader, he is fantastic.\n\"He is an amazing professional and works very well. He cannot play any better. He is a fantastic striker and Tottenham is so lucky to have him.\"\nWhat next?\nSpurs end their season with a trip to Crystal Palace, while Leicester host Manchester United in what could turn out to be winner-takes-all for a Champions League place. All 10 fixtures on the last day take place on Sunday, kicking off at 16:00 BST).\nSpurs finally feel at home - the stats\nTottenham have won four consecutive Premier League games at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first time - it's their longest winning run at home since December 2018 (4).\nLeicester City (D3 L5) have gone eight away Premier League games without a victory for the first time since February 2017 (a run of 15).\nLeicester City have lost three consecutive away league games against Tottenham for the first time since December 1966.\nSince Jose Mourinho's first game in charge of Tottenham in November 2019, the Lilywhites have won 44 points; only Liverpool (59), Man City (50) and Man Utd (46) have picked up more in this period.\nTottenham striker Harry Kane has now scored 16 goals in 14 games against Leicester in all competitions, more than he's scored against any other opponent in his career.\nTottenham's Lucas Moura assisted two goals in a single game for Tottenham for only the second time, also doing so against Rochdale in the FA Cup in February 2018.\nTottenham Hotspur have benefited from more own goals (5) than any other team in the Premier League this season.\nLeicester City conceded an own goal in consecutive away Premier League games for the first time since February 2004.\nMatch of the Day Top 10: Gianfranco Zola reveals his career highlights\nGo Ask Your Mother: A parenting podcast with style"

        "article_text": "Brighton 0-0 Newcastle: Hosts secure Premier League safety\nBrighton manager Graham Potter says \"the financial implications are massive\" after his side secured their Premier League status for another season with a goalless draw against Newcastle.\nThe Seagulls needed one point to guarantee their survival and they were rarely threatened by the Magpies in an uneventful game at the Amex Stadium, which felt more like a pre-season friendly.\nChances at either end came at a premium but the hosts were unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty in the first half when Neal Maupay appeared to be brought down by Matt Ritchie, while the visitors best chance was headed wide by substitute Andy Carroll late on.\n\"It's so important for a club like us, especially with how the year has been and how next year looks potentially,\" said Potter.\n\"We're fighting every year to keep in the Premier League. We want to get past that, of course, but it's so tough. I'm just delighted for the players, the chairman, all the support I've had.\n\"It's really, really pleasing.\"\nBrighton move into 15th place in the table, seven points from the relegation zone, while Newcastle remain 13th.\nRelive the action as it happened\nMission complete for Seagulls\nPremier League survival was always going to be the main objective for Potter when he accepted the Brighton job at the end of last season, and with one game to go, the former Swansea boss has delivered another year in the top flight.\nWith goal difference in their favour, Brighton's safety looked all but certain before kick-off despite a tough run of three consecutive home defeats - with only two heavy defeats coupled with two large wins for Aston Villa still threatening Albion's status.\nBut the Seagulls' home form will be a cause of concern for Potter and his staff as they prepare for a short turnaround before the 2020-21 season gets under way.\nOnly Southampton (18) and relegated Norwich (19) have scored fewer home goals than Brighton (20) this season, and they were limited to just three shots on target against the Magpies.\nMaupay is the club's top goalscorer this term and when Ritchie hesitated in possession inside the Newcastle box, the Frenchman reacted quickly to seize on the loose ball before appearing to be brought down by the midfielder.\nRitchie lost his footing as he tried to scramble back into position, but no one in blue and white stripes appealed for referee Simon Hooper to point to the spot.\nCentre-back Adam Webster also forced Martin Dubravka into an acrobatic save after the break, as he was gifted too much space by the backpedalling Newcastle defence, but Brighton will simply have to score more goals next season if they are to confirm their safety before their penultimate match.\nMagpies at ease in Sussex sunshine\nNewcastle have not won in their last five league games but the Magpies have not been threatened by the relegation trapdoor since beating Sheffield United on their return to action last month.\nAnd with very little riding on their cross-country trip for an outing in the Sussex sunshine, the visitors produced a lacklustre performance.\nBruce, whose side only recorded one shot on target, pointed to his team's relentless run of matches in recent weeks - and with 10 games in 35 days, he could have a point.\nThe Magpies could have taken all three points in the final five minutes, but Carroll was unable to end his run of 32 Premier League games without a goal as he nodded wide after meeting Shelvey's corner at the back post.\nUncertainty looms over Newcastle, with speculation still surrounding a potential takeover, but Bruce will be keen for clarity as he tries to build a team capable of bringing European football back to St James' Park.\nMan of the match - Federico Fernandez (Newcastle)\n'We have not had to rely on anyone else' - what they said\nBrighton manager Graham Potter on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We have faced some tough games in some tough moments but we have been together. In the Premier League, the margins are so small and pressure starts to mount but you have to come through that.\n\"The players have been a joy to work with, we are delighted we have the points we need and we have not had to rely on anyone else. It has been a long lockdown period analysing, planning and thinking what you might need.\n\"Everyone was talking about how difficult our run was, so it was just about staying focused on what we had to do. I'm really proud of the players and they have responded to some pressure moments and got the results.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce on Sky Sports: \"That's our 10th game in 35 days. We have got a lot of tired bodies. We can't rotate like some others can. Andy Carroll is beating himself up, he knows he should have scored the winner.\n\"I let other people reflect on that [how the season has gone]. It's been difficult for everyone concerned, and we've done OK. I would have taken 44 points. I think we were safe when we beat Southampton in March.\n\"In every interview for 15 weeks I've been asked the same thing [about the takeover delay]. We need a bit of clarity. Until then I'll go to work and see the CEO and plan for the summer. That's all we can do. It's frustrating.\"\nA fixture for the purists - the stats\nBrighton are unbeaten in all six of their Premier League meetings with Newcastle (W2 D4) - against no other side have they played more games without losing (West Ham also six).\nBrighton v Newcastle is the only Premier League fixture to be played more than five times with fewer than one goal per game on average (0.7).\nNewcastle have had one or fewer shots on target in seven Premier League games this season - their most in a top-flight season since 2006-07 (8).\nThis was Brighton's 11th goalless draw in the Premier League; no other side has had more since they were promoted to the division in 2017.\nNewcastle kept a clean sheet for the first time since June; they had shipped 10 goals in their previous three Premier League matches.\nNewcastle's Allan Saint-Maximin has completed 121 of his 194 dribbles in the Premier League this season - only Adama Traore (174) and Wilfred Zaha (161) have completed more.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton will travel to Burnley on the final day of the season (Sunday, 26 July - 16:00 BST), while Newcastle host champions Liverpool at the same time.\nFrom Beckham to Murray: Jack Whitehall looks at Britain's sporting heroes\nThe Young Offenders: Check out the trail for series 3 now"

        "article_text": "Sheffield United 0-1 Everton: Chris Wilder praises 'overachieving' Blades despite defeat\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder praised his players for \"massively overachieving\" after the Blades' hopes of securing European football next season were ended by Everton.\nRicharlison's header early in the second half secured a victory for the Toffees and means Wilder's side cannot finish higher than eighth with one game remaining.\nThe Blades were favourites to make an immediate return to the Championship but have surpassed expectations with a superb season in which they are guaranteed to finish inside the top 10.\n\"The club and the players have overachieved massively,\" Wilder told BBC Sport. \"To have had any talk of jumping into the top six means the players deserve an enormous amount of credit.\n\"We are delighted as staff we have got the maximum out of the players. They have left everything out there yet again.\n\"Yes they lacked that bit of quality in the final third but top 10 guaranteed and another season in the Premier League - that is what we should be reflecting on.\"\nWolves' win against Crystal Palace later on Monday ended Sheffield United's slim hopes of playing European football next season.\nRicharlison's goal just after the break brought the game to life after a dire first half in which Dominic Calvert-Lewin had the only real chance, but his header hit the post.\nDavid McGoldrick was denied a immediate response for Sheffield United when his low drive inside the box was blocked, but the Blades looked distinctly off key throughout.\nInstead it was Everton who looked the most likely to add to their lead as Calvert-Lewin brought a save out of Dean Henderson before Andre Gomes drove just wide of the post in the closing stages.\nThe win for Everton moved them above Southampton and into 11th.\n\"The spirit was really good,\" said Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti. \"It is not a surprise, the players know really well what our supporters ask for on the pitch - to have a good spirit and fight and we showed that today.\n\"We had opportunities on the counter-attack, I am really pleased with the performance. We are at the end of the season but this fantastic spirit can be a good sign for the future.\"\nReaction to Sheffield United's defeat to Everton, plus the rest of Monday's Premier League action\nAre Sheffield Utd the Premier League's best newcomers?\nBlades' impressive campaign starting to take its toll\nWilder was hugely critical of his players after the 2-0 defeat by Leicester last time out, calling them League One and Championship players playing in the Premier League.\nThe 52-year-old is known for his tough love approach to management - an attitude that has helped his squad play beyond their perceived individual ability this season.\nWilder clearly expected a positive reaction as he named the same side that started in that Foxes defeat. There was plenty of huff and puff from his players against the Toffees but they lacked quality in the final third.\nThere was also a distinct lack of urgency, with the toils of a long but hugely impressive first season back in the Premier League looking like it is starting to take its toll.\nThey pressed in the final few minutes as Everton sat back but finished the game without mustering a shot on target.\nRegardless, Sheffield United have one game remaining of a superb season and they can be proud of their efforts.\nRicharlison underlines importance to Toffees\nThis was a much needed win for Everton with their season having looked in danger of fizzling out in disappointing fashion.\nA run of two wins and a draw after the restart was followed by a four-game winless run that ended their hopes of a top-10 finish.\nCarlo Ancelotti approached this game with one eye on next season, assessing his options from the club's youth team by handing promising 18-year-old defender Jarrad Branthwaite his first Premier League start while 19-year-old forward Ellis Simms was included on the bench.\nBut whatever changes Ancelotti decides to make to his squad over the summer, this game underlined the importance of Richarlison to the Toffees' aspirations next season.\nHe was one of the few players for either side looking to make something happen in a dull first half with some determined runs, while it was his goal - a superbly guided header after a clever run - that finally provided the spark the game needed.\nRicharlison has scored 15 goals so far this season - 14 of those coming in the Premier League - an impressive return in a difficult campaign for Everton in which they had looked in danger of being involved in a relegation battle before Ancelotti's arrival in December.\nA full pre-season working with the Italian and the Brazilian has a real chance of developing into a 20-goals-a-season forward next term.\nMan of the match - Richarlison (Everton)\nA rare blank for the Blades - the stats\nThis was Everton's first away league win against Sheffield United since October 1972, ending a run of eight successive visits to Bramall Lane without victory.\nSheffield United have lost four of their nine Premier League matches since the restart (W3 D2), as many as they had in their previous 21 before the break (W9 D8 L4).\nAll five of Everton's away wins in the Premier League this season have been by a one-goal margin. They're the only side in the division this season to have had 100% of their away wins by a single goal.\nSheffield United failed to register a shot on target in a home league game for the first time since August 2016, in a 0-3 defeat to Southend in League One.\nEverton have kept two clean sheets in their last four Premier League away games, having conceded in 14 consecutive games on the road previously.\nEverton have scored 14 headed goals in the Premier League this season - only Liverpool have netted more (16). It's the Toffees most headed goals in a single campaign since 2010-11 (also 14)\nRicharlison has scored 26 Premier League goals since joining Everton - among Brazilian players in the top five European leagues, only Neymar (28) has more in that time.\nAll three of Gylfi Sigurdsson's assists in the Premier League for Everton this season have been for headed goals.\nWhat next?\nSheffield United complete their Premier League campaign with an away trip to Southampton on Sunday, 26 July (16:00 BST), while Everton host Bournemouth at the same time.\nFrom Beckham to Murray: Jack Whitehall looks at Britain's sporting heroes\nThe Young Offenders: Check out the trail for series 3 now"

Against Palace, they were playing their 56th game of the campaign.\nBut despite Wolves' long season, victory on Monday night gave them their highest points tally in the Premier League and they could still compete in the Europa League next season.\nThe Molineux men are still in this season's competition, which will prolong their campaign into August when they face Olympiakos in the second leg of their last-16 tie. Going all the way to lifting the trophy would upgrade their achievement to a place in the Champions League next term.\nWolves are a well-drilled side and kept Palace at bay before a moment of brilliance from midfielder Joao Moutinho saw them open the scoring.\nThe Portugal midfielder chipped a perfectly weighted pass into the path of the on-running Matt Doherty, who pulled a pass back for Podence to nod in an easy finish.\nThey grabbed a second on 68 minutes courtesy of Jonny's first goal at Molineux since September 2018, receiving a lay-off from Raul Jimenez before spinning expertly and curling home a smart finish.\nAdama Traore worked tirelessly down the right flank and could have scored but saw a low drive at the near post kept out by Vicente Guaita.\nHaving scored 51 goals this season, Wolves go into the last game of the season as the only team without an English player finding the net for them.\nGoal-shy Palace\nPalace's woeful form has now seen them lose their past seven games in the league and the Eagles seem like a team already looking towards next season.\nIt is just as well then that Hodgson's side had won four straight games, all with clean sheets, either side of the restart to put them in a safe place in the table, away from a relegation fight.\nOnly bottom side Norwich have scored fewer than Palace's 30 goals this season, which is three fewer than their lowest tally in the top flight.\nAnd they never really looked like finding the net against Wolves.\nJeffrey Schlupp broke clear and dragged a shot wide early on, while Zaha could not come up with any magic on his 200th Premier League appearance for the Eagles.\nMan of the match - Adama Traore (Wolves)\nDangerous defender Doherty - the stats\nWolves have picked up 59 points in the Premier League this season, surpassing their total for last term (57); assuming three points for a win, this is their best return in a top-flight campaign since 1979-80 (66 points when adjusted to 3/win).\nCrystal Palace have lost seven league games in succession, failing to score in six of those defeats. They have earned just three points since the Premier League resumed in June (P8 W1 D0 L7); only bottom-placed Norwich City (none) have fewer in this time.\nWolves have won back-to-back home league games for the first time this season having last done so in May 2019; they have done so without conceding in both victories for the first time since September 2018.\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson has lost seven consecutive league games for the first time in his managerial career in England.\nWolves have now had 12 different goalscorers in this season's Premier League without any being English; only Arsenal (13 in 2006-07) have had more in a campaign in the competition without having an English scorer (excluding own goals).\nDaniel Podence became the seventh different Portuguese player to score a Premier League goal for Wolves, more than any other side.\nJonny Otto scored what was only his third Premier League goal, and his second at Molineux for Wolves (also September 2018 against Southampton).\nAmong defenders for Premier League clubs since the start of last season, only Trent Alexander-Arnold (33) has been directly involved in more goals in all competitions than Wolves' Matt Doherty (27 - 15 goals, 12 assists).\nFrom Beckham to Murray: Jack Whitehall looks at Britain's sporting heroes\nThe Young Offenders: Check out the trail for series 3 now"

        "article_text": "Watford 0-4 Man City: Raheem Sterling deepens Hornets' drop fears\nWatford were plunged into the relegation zone in the wake of Nigel Pearson's surprise sacking as they were hammered by a Raheem Sterling-inspired Manchester City.\nThe defeat, coupled with Aston Villa's win over Arsenal on Tuesday, means the Hornets' battle to stay up will go to the final day of the season on Sunday, when they visit Arsenal.\nPearson became the Hornets' third managerial casualty of the campaign on Monday, leaving Under-23 coach Hayden Mullins and his assistant Graham Stack in charge for their final two games.\nAnd they could hardly have had a tougher first assignment than against City, who completed the double over them with this win, at an aggregate score of 12-0 - a joint top-flight record for one team against another in a single season.\nSterling took the game away from the home side before half-time, firing in a rising shot to open the scoring before doubling the advantage by following up his own saved penalty - awarded for a foul on him by Will Hughes.\nPhil Foden added a third after Ben Foster had parried a Sterling shot before Aymeric Laporte nodded in from Kevin de Bruyne's free-kick.\nCity's fourth straight league win could have been even more emphatic but Gabriel Jesus had an injury-time header ruled out for offside.\nThis could well be important to Watford, with goal difference potentially a crucial deciding factor going into the weekend.\nThe defeat leaves the Hornets 18th, level on points but a goal worse off than Villa, with both three points ahead of 19th-placed Bournemouth.\nVilla's last-day opponents West Ham, on 37 points, are not yet safe from the drop, although a point from their game in hand at Manchester United on Wednesday will secure survival.\nAction and reaction from Tuesday's Premier League matches\nLawro's predictions v Future Islands frontman Samuel T Herring\nWatford down and possibly out\nPearson's sacking came out of the blue, as the former Leicester boss was still within sight of securing Premier League survival - the remit given to him on his appointment in December.\nHaving taken over with the club seven points adrift at the bottom of the table, he won seven of 20 matches - results that not only lifted them out of the bottom three but also gave him the best win percentage of any Watford boss since they were promoted in 2015.\nPearson, though, is now the past and Mullins, his players and the rest of the club are left to consider a deeply worrying present and potentially devastating future.\nThey were outclassed by City, barely allowed a kick in what amounted to an exercise in damage limitation from the moment the visitors broke the deadlock.\nThey were allowed just 23.7% possession and managed just two shots at goal, neither on target. The only time they threatened in any way was when substitute Danny Welbeck got in behind the City defence but saw a tame, poked effort saved by Ederson.\nThat goalkeeper Foster was the Watford player who attempted the most passes (29) tells a story in itself.\nSo too does the fact their team pass total was a paltry 232, against the visitors' 750. City midfielder Rodri alone made 131.\nAll they can do now is hope that they can better the result of Villa on Sunday when they face Arsenal.\nMan City's perfect pick-me-up\nThis was a wounded Manchester City, who at the weekend saw another road to a trophy blocked courtesy of that FA Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal.\nThey couldn't have asked for better opponents to get things back on track.\nWatford haven't beaten City in 18 games in all competitions - a run stretching back to March 1989, and one that includes a 6-0 loss in last season's FA Cup final and an 8-0 thrashing in September's reverse league fixture.\nCity now have a 13th straight win against the Hornets, during which the aggregate score is 50-6, and they barely seemed to get out of second gear to achieve it.\nSterling tormented the home side and De Bruyne and Foden beguiled them, while full-backs Kyle Walker and Joao Cancelo operated practically as forwards.\nHaving got just one of their 16 shots on target against Arsenal at Wembley, they managed a much healthier ratio of 10 out of 26 at Vicarage Road.\nThey have accrued a league-high 21 points since the restart and scored a division-best 29 goals.\nIt is this form that they will hope to take into their final league fixture against Norwich on Sunday and then into the remainder of a Champions League campaign that now feels vital to provide a successful cap to their season.\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling (Manchester City)\n'City do this to most teams'\nWatford caretaker boss Hayden Mullin, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It was always going to be a tough ask, we knew that. They are a great side with a great manager. They were hurt after their result at the weekend - the Arsenal game - so we knew it would be tough.\n\"We set up a certain way and I thought we did well right up until the first goal. The second goal was a bit unfortunate. Will Hughes maybe gets a foot on it for the penalty, but those decisions don't really go for you when you are at the wrong end of the table.\n\"City do this to most teams. The minute you come out and give space they take advantage of it. It didn't work today for us so we look to go again.\"\nMan City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: \"A different competition, reality and opponent. But we did it today. We were so focused on ourselves so we didn't speak much about Watford.\n\"We can win or we can lose, it is part of the game. In your career as a football player you can lose more games than you win. But always we must finish the game, go into the locker room and say 'yes, I did everything to win the game'. When this happens we can be proud of ourselves.\"\nOn Raheem Sterling: \"He is quality. But the personal achievements are always related to how we have done in the Premier League. We finished far behind the champions so that is why Raheem must not be happy for the season we have done in the Premier League.\"\nGulf in class underlined by goal difference\nManchester City have scored 12 goals against Watford in the Premier League this season without conceding once - this goal difference of 12 over the two fixtures is the largest in the top flight since 1947-48, when Arsenal also scored 12 without reply against Grimsby Town.\nHayden Mullins is the first manager to see his side fail to score in each of his first three Premier League games since Frank de Boer with Crystal Palace in 2017-18 (four games).\nManchester City have scored 12 goals against Watford in the Premier League this season, a joint-record for most goals against an opponent in a single campaign in the competition - Blackburn put 12 past Nottingham Forest in 1995-96 (conceding one) and Tottenham did so against Wigan in 2009-10 (also conceding one).\nSince Watford returned to the Premier League in 2015-16, they have conceded 37 league goals against Manchester City, at least seven more than any side has conceded against another in this fixture in this time.\nManchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne registered his 19th league assist of the season, equalling Mesut Ozil in 2015-16 and one behind Thierry Henry's league record of 20 in 2002-03.\nIn Phil Foden's 16 starts in all competitions for Manchester City in 2019-20, he has been directly involved in 14 goals (six goals and eight assists).\nWatford goalkeeper Ben Foster has lost on each of his past 13 starts against Manchester City in the Premier League, the longest run of defeats by a starting player against a specific side in Premier League history.\nRaheem Sterling's penalty, the rebound for which he scored, was the fifth Manchester City have missed in the Premier League this season; no side have ever missed more in a single Premier League campaign (Liverpool in 2011-12 and Spurs in 1994-95 also missed five each).\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola has made 143 changes to their starting XIs in the Premier League this season, the most by any manager in a single season in the competition's history.\n'I'll swallow blood before my pride': Meet Scotland's first pro female boxer\nLockdown love life: How can romance spark in a global pandemic?"

        "article_text": "Aston Villa 1-0 Arsenal: Trezeguet winner lifts Villa out of bottom three\nAston Villa's players must prepare for a \"cup final\" after showing \"courage\" to secure a priceless win over Arsenal and move out of the Premier League relegation zone with one game to go, says boss Dean Smith.\nTrezeguet beat Emiliano Martinez with a powerful first-time finish after Tyrone Mings had diverted a corner into the Egypt international's path to lift Villa out of the bottom three for the first time since 28 February.\nVilla moved above managerless Watford, who had started the day 17th before a heavy 4-0 home defeat by Manchester City, on goal difference.\nThe Midlanders' second win in three games sets up a dramatic final day at the bottom of the table on Sunday, which Villa will begin level on points with Watford and three points ahead of Bournemouth - with two of those three teams likely to go down.\nWho needs what to survive? Final-day permutations\nMeanwhile, 16th-placed West Ham, who also play on Wednesday, still require one point to secure safety, although their goal difference ought to keep them up.\nVilla's last game is away to West Ham and if they win - providing Watford do not win by a margin two or more goals greater than they do - Smith's men will secure another season in the top flight, having spent much of it in the bottom three.\n\"We had seen Watford play earlier and get beat. We knew we had to get a win to even catch them up,\" Smith told BBC Sport. \"By getting the win it puts our fate in our own hands.\n\"There was a lot of character and a lot of courage from the players. It was a massive performance and I am proud of the players for that but now we have to recover and get ready for our cup final.\n\"We're working hard to maintain our status and the last three results have shown that.\"\nA 10th league defeat means Arsenal, playing in their first match since reaching the FA Cup final, will finish outside the top six for the first time in 25 years.\nThey can come no higher than eighth after a disappointing performance by Mikel Arteta's side, Eddie Nketiah going closest to equalising with a header which hit the post.\nHowever, the Gunners will still have a big say in the relegation battle when they host Villa's rivals Watford on Sunday.\nDuring the match, a banner reading \"Back Arteta Kroenke Out' was towed by an aeroplane over Villa Park in reference to Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke.\nVilla's fate back in their own hands\nAfter Watford's 2-1 win over Newcastle on 11 July, Villa looked down and out - seven points from safety with four games to go.\nBut Smith's side have reacted magnificently in the closing stages of the season, beating Crystal Palace, drawing at Everton before overcoming Arsenal with a gritty display oozing in character to give themselves a fighting chance of staying up.\nWatford's defeat earlier on Tuesday opened the door for Villa to climb out of the relegation zone for the first time in five months, despite being forced to reshuffle their defence in the first half after Ahmed Elmohamady was forced off with an injury.\nSmith's side have scored six goals since the restart with Trezeguet netting half of them, his latest an instinctive finish which beat Martinez for pace and power.\nVilla were forced to endure some nervous moments, particularly towards the end after substitute Keinan Davis wasted a glorious chance to double the lead after firing wide.\nSmith reacted to the final whistle by clenching his fist - with Villa's fate back in their own hands.\nThey will be safe if they win (presuming Watford do not win by two more goals than they do), or draw providing the Hornets do not win. But defeat would send Villa down if Watford avoid defeat or if Bournemouth win at Everton.\nGunners take a step backwards\nThis felt like a big step backwards for Arsenal after a positive spell in which they collected 13 points from six games.\nHaving followed up victory over runaway champions Liverpool by beating Manchester City to seal a first FA Cup final visit since 2017, the Gunners did not force Villa keeper Pepe Reina into a serious save.\nIt was the first time Villa had not faced any shots on target in a Premier League game since January 2016.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang's stream of goals have been a highlight of his side's season, but the Gabon forward was frustrated at Villa Park and his future remains a hot topic of conversation among supporters.\n\"The quicker we do it the better because the player will be more focused, more determined and more calm,\" said Arteta on the eve of this game when asked if Aubameyang, whose current deal expires next summer, will sign a new contract.\nIt was Nketiah who went closest to scoring for the visitors, the England Under-21 forward heading against the post after connecting with a corner.\nThe Gunners can still qualify for Europe but they will now have to win the FA Cup to play in next season's Europa League.\n\"I don't think the league table lies at all,\" conceded Arteta. \"You can see the gap and the difference in points with the other teams. It's where we are. That's the reality.\"\nMan of the match - Jack Grealish (Aston Villa)\nA 22-year wait - the stats\nVilla have beaten Arsenal at Villa Park in a Premier League game for the first time since they did so in December 1998 under John Gregory, ending a run of 17 home games without a win against the Gunners.\nArsenal have lost four of their six away Premier League matches since the restart.\nThe Gunners have lost 10 league matches for a third consecutive season for the first time since a run of seven seasons between 1981-82 and 1987-88.\n21 of the 46 goals Arsenal have conceded in the Premier League this term have come from set-pieces.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are involved in games which affect relegation on the final day of the season - while Villa visit West Ham on Sunday (16:00 BST) looking to stay up, Arsenal round off their Premier League campaign at home to relegation-threatened Watford at the same time.\n'I'll swallow blood before my pride': Meet Scotland's first pro female boxer\nLockdown love life: How can romance spark in a global pandemic?"

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-1 West Ham: Red Devils need point to reach Champions League\nManchester United need a point from their final game of the season to clinch a Champions League place after coming from behind to draw against West Ham, who confirmed their Premier League survival.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side moved third, a point ahead of Leicester, who they face at the King Power Stadium on Sunday.\nBut victory for Brendan Rodgers' team will deny the Red Devils a spot in Europe's elite club competition next season - unless fourth-placed Chelsea lose to Wolves.\nMichail Antonio put the Hammers ahead in first-half stoppage time with his eighth goal in six games after Paul Pogba gave away a penalty when he raised his hands to block a Declan Rice free-kick.\nEighteen-year-old Mason Greenwood levelled with his 17th goal of a stellar first season as a senior player.\nBoth sides had chances to win it, with under-pressure David de Gea producing a fingertip save to repel a deflected Jarrod Bowen effort and substitute Odion Ighalo turning a near-post effort wide at the other end.\nManchester United already knew their efforts to secure a top-four berth would go down to the last day at Leicester. However the point means that, after being in fifth since February, Solskjaer's side have moved back into the top four for the first time since 14 September.\nRelive the draw between Manchester United and West Ham\nGreenwood the United star\nAlthough Solskjaer said during his side's pre-season tour of Australia he rated Greenwood as the best finisher at the club, it was not until December that he gave the Yorkshireman his first Premier League start of the season.\nTwenty-two games on, it is hard to imagine the line-up for an important game being picked without him.\nHis latest clinical effort was his 10th in the league this term. Michael Owen's astonishing effort in 1997-98, when he scored 18, is the only time a teenager has done better since the Premier League was formed in 1992.\nThe intricate close passing with Anthony Martial which created the shooting opportunity underlined that Greenwood is much more than a goalscorer. It felt like he was taking responsibility when other, more experienced, team-mates had not.\nOwen went to a World Cup after his stellar season. Greenwood has more time and, although he will still be a teenager when the European Championship begins next summer, on this evidence it would be no surprise to see him in Gareth Southgate's squad.\nThe goal was vital for Manchester United, who have failed to win successive home games for the first time in nearly six months, but have the advantage at just the right time as Solskjaer looks to return the club back to something like its former self.\nAfter going on a 19-match unbeaten run the team have flagged in the last week, being beaten by Chelsea in an FA Cup semi-final before this draw with the Hammers.\nBut Solskjaer knows the importance of qualifying for the Champions League.\nAfter 22 years of never finishing below third under Sir Alex Ferguson, they have managed only two top-four finishes in the years since his retirement. And Champions League qualification will increase their chances of signing England winger Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund for a start.\nAnd, in a year when their finances have been badly affected like all their rivals because of the coronavirus pandemic, it would mean they avoid giving Adidas a \u00a322.5m rebate on their 10-year shirt deal.\nMoyes on a mission\nAt half-time, Moyes marched towards the dressing rooms with a look of determination on his face. He must also have been feeling of immense satisfaction.\nMoyes was sacked as Manchester United boss in April 2014, less than a season into a six-year contract as Ferguson's successor.\nIn the build-up to the game, Moyes said the only difference between him and Solskjaer was that the Norwegian was given time.\nThe statistics suggest Moyes has a point. Solskjaer's results in his first 51 games are broadly similar to the Scot, who won two games more, but lost an extra one as well.\nThe obvious difference is Moyes was not a legendary figure at Old Trafford and never scored an injury-time goal to win a Champions League final. It means no-one will ever know if he could have turned around a dismal first season.\nHowever, thanks to Antonio, who has scored more goals in the past 22 days than he has managed in either of the two previous seasons, we do know Moyes has twice dragged West Ham clear of a perilous situation in a relegation fight.\nUnlike two years ago, when they ditched the Scot in favour of Manuel Pellegrini, West Ham seem certain to stick with Moyes, who has already told the club he wants them to start promising less and delivering more.\nMan of the match - Mason Greenwood (Man Utd)\nWhat next?\nManchester United end the season with a crunch game at Leicester while West Ham host Aston Villa. All of the final games kick-off at 16:00 BST on Sunday.\nGreenwood keeps on growing - the stats\nManchester United have won 10 of their 19 home league games this season (D7 L2); only in 2016-17 (eight) and 2013-14 (nine) have they earned fewer home victories in a Premier League campaign.\nWest Ham have collected eight points in their last five Premier League games against United (W2 D2 L1), more than they managed in their previous 18 league encounters (seven points - W1 D4 L13) between May 2008 and August 2017.\nSolskjaer's side are unbeaten in 13 Premier League games (W8 D5), which is now the Norwegian's best run in the competition with the Red Devils and his best league run in his managerial career with a single club.\nWest Ham have dropped 26 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other team in the competition in 2019-20.\nMan Utd's Greenwood has become the first player to score 10 Premier League goals in a season as a teenager since Romelu Lukaku in 2012-13 (14), and the first English player to do so since Wayne Rooney in 2004-05 (11).\nNo teenager has ever scored more goals in a single season in all competitions for United than Greenwood (17 - level with George Best in 1965-66, Brian Kidd in 1967-68 and Rooney in 2004-05).\nWest Ham's Antonio has scored eight goals in the Premier League since the restart, the joint-most of any player alongside Raheem Sterling. He now has 10 Premier League goals this season - his best tally in a single campaign in the competition.\nMark Noble has created 14 goalscoring chances in West Ham's last two away league outings (8 v Norwich, 6 v Man Utd), one more than his previous 18 away league appearances combined beforehand.\nBrave conversations: The black experience in the UK\nThe great escape: Will Villa stay up?"

        "article_text": "Newcastle 1-3 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp's side come from behind to win\nChampions Liverpool finished on the second-highest points total in top-flight history as they came from behind to beat Newcastle on the final day of the season.\nJurgen Klopp's Reds accumulated 99 points, one fewer than Manchester City managed two years ago, and one more than Liverpool managed in 1978-79, once the two points they got for a win back then is altered to three.\nThey finished 18 points above Pep Guardiola's runners-up - one short of City's record winning margin two seasons ago.\nDwight Gayle put Newcastle ahead after 25 seconds from Jonjo Shelvey's free-kick, the fastest goal ever scored on a Premier League final day.\nBut Liverpool, who left their vaunted front three of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino on the bench, levelled through Virgil van Dijk's header.\nDivock Origi put Liverpool ahead from 20 yards from Andrew Robertson's pass before Senegal forward Mane curled home a late third for the visitors.\nFollow reaction to all of Sunday's games\n'An incredible game, not a perfect game'\nIn truth it was a game with little on the line, Liverpool's points target aside. They had looked destined to break the 100-point record before the coronavirus break, but they have dropped points four times since - compared to twice beforehand over a significantly longer period.\nLiverpool boss Klopp experimented with his selection in their final game of a successful season - with the star-studded front three and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold left on the bench.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the back-up frontline of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Takumi Minamino and Origi lacked the same threat and quality.\nThe champions were far from their best, with Minamino's saved effort after 28 minutes their first real chance.\nBut from that point until the final whistle, the new champions dominated.\nVan Dijk equalised when he headed a looping effort into the top corner from Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross - his fifth Premier League goal of the season.\nOrigi then powered home in the second half to end a 23-game goal drought that stretched back to December.\nSalah, Mane and Firmino all came on with 26 minutes to go and Liverpool predictably looked more fluid and dangerous.\nEgypt forward Salah drove a shot off the post from a tight angle while Mane cut in from the left from Firmino's ball before adding a late third.\n\"We played an incredible game, not a perfect game,\" said Klopp.\n\"We made so many changes after a long time of playing with similar line-ups. It's not fair to judge (players who came in) because they need to get used to each other's games.\n\"We really worked in the game and got better and better and better even before the changes. But the changes helped massively.\n\"I liked the game. It's far away from being perfect but over the season we did not just win games when everything was perfect, we won a lot of difficult games too.\"\nKlopp was happy to see several of his fringe players have a run-out and they are likely to play a key part in the new campaign, not least because with the new season beginning so soon it leaves little chance for a proper break.\nRotation is likely to be crucial next season if they are to become the fourth team to retain the Premier League title.\n\"Two weeks and a couple of days and we start again,\" said Klopp. \"I'm not going to the office for a while.\"\n'How long do we need to make that decision?'\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce's frustrations have been clear for a long time.\nThe Magpies have been safe from relegation for weeks but only picked up two points from their final six games.\nThey have been in limbo because of the delayed Saudi Arabian takeover, with documents for the deal passed to the Premier League over three months ago.\nNewcastle have been struggling with injuries too - and have ended the season with only one fit centre-back in Federico Fernandez. He played alongside full-backs Danny Rose and Javier Manquillo in a back three against Liverpool.\n\"We've dropped like nine pins over the last few weeks,\" Bruce told BBC Sport. \"I've never known anything like it.\"\nTheir game against Liverpool peaked after 25 seconds - although Bruce was happy \"we showed up and had a go\".\nThey had a dream start when Gayle latched onto Shelvey's opportunistic quick free-kick and slotted past Alisson, who got a touch to the ball but could not keep it out.\nThat would be the only time they touched the ball in the Reds' area in the first half.\n\"We're disappointed that we faded a bit at the death [in recent weeks],\" said Bruce.\n\"We're disappointed not to overtake last year's tally. But if someone said at the start of the season 'would you be happy to finish with seven teams below you?' we'd have taken that.\n\"But that's not enough.

We had strong offensive moments, and solutions against these teams is not easy, but we deserved this win.\n\"It is important for him [Che Adams] and for us. I was very happy for all the guys playing up front. Danny [Ings] was looking for the pass and was not egotistical and Che is the one that has scored.\n\"We now have a short pre-season and then hopefully we can build on the performances we have made in these last few games.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder told BBC Sport: \"We should have been comfortably up in the game but we have missed some golden chances. They were ruthless in our box and we weren't in theirs. In the last 25 minutes, they were comfortably the better side but the game should have been out of sight.\n\"We have lost a game of football and that is the feeling I have. It looked like a second half too far for the players. We have finished ninth against some really good teams which we can proud of but we wanted to finish on a high.\n\"We have to recruit right and we have to invest. First season back in the Premier League for a long time and our long-suffering supporters would have enjoyed it. Southampton have finished below us and they have some fantastic footballers which shows how tough a challenge it is.\"\nSaints' run continues - the stats\nSouthampton have gone unbeaten in seven consecutive Premier League games (W4 D3) within the same season for the first time since November 2013 (eight).\nSheffield United end the 2019-20 season having lost three straight Premier League games for the first time since April 2007.\nThis was the third time Southampton won a Premier League game in which they conceded the first goal this season (also v Watford in Nov 2019 and Leicester in Jan 2020); they only did so twice in 2017-18 and 2018-19 combined before this campaign.\nJohn Lundstram has scored his first away goal in the Premier League, and his second on the road in all league competitions for Sheffield United after September 2017 against Nottingham Forest in the Championship.\nOnly strikers Oli McBurnie and Lys Mousset (both six) have scored more Premier League goals this season for Sheffield United than midfielder John Lundstram (five).\nChe Adams has scored in back-to-back Premier League games having only scored in one of his first 28 appearances in the competition for Southampton before this. Indeed, he netted his first league brace since February 2019 for Birmingham against Blackburn.\nDanny Ings scored his 22nd Premier League goal of the season, to finish second behind Jamie Vardy (23); only Matt Le Tissier (25 in 1993-94) and James Beattie (23 in 2002-03) have ever scored more in a campaign in the competition for Southampton.\nHis Dark Materials 2 is coming: Watch the epic new trailer now\n'I lost my boyfriend to cancer conspiracy theories': Are alternative cures false hope?"

Significant changes to the squad are also expected.\n'Cojones' jibe comes back to haunt Deeney\nSkipper Deeney, one of the last Watford players to leave the pitch, looked crestfallen as he made his way back to the dressing room.\nIn October 2017 Deeney accused Arsenal's players of lacking \"cojones\" after the Hornets came from behind to beat Arsene Wenger's side at Vicarage Road.\nSwitzerland midfielder Granit Xhaka and France forward Lacazette, who featured in that game three years ago, were part of the Arsenal side that sent Watford down.\nBusy summer for Arteta\nArsenal's worst league season for 25 years at least ended on a high but the record books will show they finished 10 points off the top four - and 43 behind runaway champions Liverpool.\nThey will secure a place in the Europa League if they beat Chelsea in Saturday's FA Cup final but Mikel Arteta knows an eighth-placed finish is not good enough for a club of Arsenal's stature.\nRegardless of the outcome at Wembley, it promises to be a busy summer at Emirates Stadium.\nTop of Arteta's list of duties will be to convince Aubameyang to sign a new contract after the forward scored another two goals to finish joint runner-up with Southampton's Danny Ings in the Premier League scoring charts on 22 - one behind Leicester's Jamie Vardy.\nIn addition, there is a decision to be made about on-loan midfielder Dani Ceballos, who is due to return to Real Madrid.\nThe future of Mesut Ozil, who became the highest paid player in the club's history when he signed a three-and-a-half-year deal in January 2018, needs clarifying after he was left out of Arsenal's last 10 games, while French midfielder Matteo Guendouzi has not featured since the defeat at Brighton on 20 June.\nMan of the Match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal)\n'I didn't like what I was watching - what they said\nWatford interim head coach Hayden Mullins: \"We're really disappointed with the start we made. To concede a penalty in the opening minute was always going to make things tough. I'm disappointed with some of the goals we gave away.\"\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta: \"It was a really tough game. The level of urgency they had is not what we had.\n\"After going 2-0 up you think this is going to easy but that's a big mistake because without the ball we weren't at the races. In certain aspects of the game I didn't like what I was watching. I tried to correct that.\"\nThird Premier League relegation for Hornets - the stats\nWatford have been relegated from the Premier League for a third time, with the Hornets also suffering the drop in 1999-00 and 2006-07.\nDespite the victory, Arsenal have had their lowest Premier League finish since 1994-95 when they finished 12th.\nThis was the first Premier League match to see both sides win a penalty in the opening half since Arsenal against Tottenham in December 2018.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang's goal after five minutes was the earliest penalty Arsenal have scored in a Premier League match since April 1999.\nKieran Tierney became the first Scottish player to score for Arsenal since Scott Marshall against Newcastle in March 1996.\nDanny Welbeck's goal made him the fourth different player to score at Emirates Stadium for three different clubs - Manchester United, Arsenal and Watford.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal will spend the week preparing for Saturday's FA Cup final with Chelsea at Wembley (17:30 BST) - a match they have to win to qualify for Europe.\nHis Dark Materials 2 is coming: Watch the epic new trailer now\n'I lost my boyfriend to cancer conspiracy theories': Are alternative cures false hope?"

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-2 Brighton: Yves Bissouma's stunning strike sees off Clarets\nBrighton recorded their highest Premier League points total as they completed their campaign with an impressive win at Burnley.\nThe victory, courtesy of goals from Yves Bissouma and Aaron Connolly, means the Seagulls finish 15th with 41 points - one better than the total achieved in 2017-18.\nThe Seagulls rattled the Clarets during the opening 30 minutes and took the lead through Malian Bissouma, who marked his first Premier League goal with wonderful side-foot strike from 25 yards.\nIt should have been 2-0 seconds after the restart when Neal Maupay, the club's top scorer this season with 10 goals, headed Tariq Lamptey's cross against the bar.\nBurnley, without five key first-team players including skipper Ben Mee, looked off the pace in the first half, but managed to level just before the break when Chris Wood fired in with a low shot.\nReaction from Burnley v Brighton, plus the rest of the final day of the Premier League\nLawro's predictions v singer and Newcastle fan James Bay\nHowever, it was again advantage Brighton five minutes after the restart when Connolly shrugged off an attempted challenge by Kevin Long on the left before threading his angled shot past Nick Pope.\nThe Seagulls' stubborn defence was then pushed to the limit by waves of Burnley attacks. It seemed the home side had equalised again when Jay Rodriguez headed in - but a video assistant referee check ruled that team-mate Wood was offside.\nDespite defeat Sean Dyche has led his modestly-priced squad to a second top-10 finish in five Premier League seasons.\nBrighton's defence keeps Burnley at bay\nBrighton's style of play may have changed under manager Graham Potter, but one thing that has remained constant from the Chris Hughton era is the miserly defence.\nIn fact, Potter has made them a tighter outfit, conceding 1.42 goals per game this season compared to 1.57 in 2018-19 when they also finished just above the drop zone. Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy were the mainstays in central defence back then, but this season it has been Dunk and \u00a320m signing Adam Webster.\nBoth acted as barricades on Sunday, repelling Burnley's physical attack and aerial assaults. Dunk was particularly outstanding and made a superb block to deny Kevin Long. With centre-back Ben White set to return to the south coast from a very successful loan spell at Leeds, expect Brighton to be even tougher to break down next season.\nAs for the attack, which is not as widely hailed, it caused Burnley plenty of consternation in the opening half. Bissouma's strike was the standout moment, but both Maupay and Connolly excelled. The expected free capture of former Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana will add to the creativity behind the front-line.\nOn that speculation, Potter said: \"There's a lot of names in the paper at this time of year but with the greatest respect I just speak about the guys at our club.\"\nThe Seagulls boss praised his side for inflicting Burnley's first home league defeat since New Year's Day, and added: \"We can go into a little break and have some time with the family, hopefully enjoy that and come back and try to improve.\"\nQuestions remain as Burnley end on low note\nDyche might use this match to highlight how threadbare his squad can look with a handful of injuries. His bench again featured a group of inexperienced youngsters, with several first-team players sidelined.\nLast month, the manager publicly stated his gripes with the board regarding his squad, and has since been asked about his future at the Clarets who, in many people's eyes, have overachieved since their return to the top flight in 2016.\nThe usually robust defence looked flimsy at times on Sunday. Little could have been done to stop Bissouma's strike, which effectively ended Pope's hopes of winning the Premier League Golden Glove, but Long should have done better to hold off Connolly for the second goal.\nIn attack, Wood took his goal well, controlling Erik Pieters' perfect pass before slotting in, while the hard-working Jay Rodriguez will be aggrieved his second-half header was chalked off by VAR because Wood was offside.\nThe Clarets finish 10th - an achievement that should be celebrated - but doubts remain over Dyche's future.\nWhen he was again asked about it after the match, he said: \"I've been asked that question about 4,000 times and I answer the same every time.\n\"I'll be going on holiday tomorrow, that's what I'll be doing.\"\nMan of the match - Lewis Dunk (Brighton)\nBrighton end Burnley jinx - the stats\nBurnley have now lost all four of their matches on the final day of the season since their return to the Premier League in 2016-17, with each of them coming at home.\nBrighton have won their first league meeting against Burnley since August 2013 after failing to win their previous eight (D6 L2).\nBrighton's two goals against Burnley were as many as they managed in their first five Premier League matches against the Clarets combined.\nPieters has provided four assists for Burnley in the Premier League this season - more than he managed in his previous three seasons in the competition with Stoke City (three).\nWood scored 14 goals in the league this season - the third-best return in a single campaign in his career in the English leagues after 2012-13 (20) and 2016-17 (27).\nBissouma scored his first goal in the Premier League in his 50th appearance in the competition.\nHis Dark Materials 2 is coming: Watch the epic new trailer now\n'I lost my boyfriend to cancer conspiracy theories': Are alternative cures false hope?"

But their form nosedived and a run of 19 defeats in their last 25 games meant they plummeted into trouble.\nInjuries have not helped Bournemouth's cause, with the likes of Charlie Daniels, Joshua King, David Brooks, Nathan Ake and Callum Wilson having had significant spells on the sidelines.\nBut the disappointing form of players who have been available did not help. Ryan Fraser provided 14 assists in 2018-19 - only Eden Hazard managed more - but was a shadow of his former self this season and has not played since the restart after rejecting a short-term extension to his expiring contract.\nMeanwhile, big-money signings Solanke and Jordan Ibe, who was released this summer, ultimately failed to deliver.\nSolanke and his team-mates all stepped up on the final day of the season to give Bournemouth a chance - they were first to every ball in a determined first-half display and looked much more like the Bournemouth of previous seasons.\nBut ultimately that show of fight came too little, too late as they now contemplate a first Championship campaign since 2014-15.\nToffees fail to impress as season fizzles out\nIt was hard to read too much into this performance from an Everton side that were largely going through the motions.\nTheir season had effectively ended some weeks ago and they could not finish higher than 11th, even if they had managed to beat Bournemouth.\nBut the Toffees' display will still have been disappointing to Everton fans, who were perhaps hoping they would show signs that they could develop into a team that could fight for a top-six finish next season.\nKean was handed a chance to impress Carlo Ancelotti as he made his first start since 21 January and he repaid his manager's faith with a goal and an overall positive display, with the striker one of the few home players willing to chase down lost causes and make attacking runs.\nJarrad Branthwaite, Everton's 18-year-old defender, started for the second game in a row and once again did not look out of place, but too many other players put in distinctly average performances.\nThe defeat meant Everton finished 12th - their lowest placing at the end of a season in 16 years - and Ancelotti knows plenty of work will need to be done over the summer if he is to get the Toffees challenging higher up the table.\nMan of the match - Diego Rico (Bournemouth)\n'We haven't been good enough' - what they said\nEverton manager Carlo Ancelotti: \"It is a performance that we could expect, it was the last game of the season and the motivation was not so strong. We are not happy, but we have to look forward. The players need rest, it was a busy season and we will come back with more ambition.\n\"Sometimes the motivation makes the difference on the pitch. Moise Kean did well, he is young and has to improve but it is important that he could score.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We were excellent today, the frustrating thing when you see us play like that and you wonder where it was throughout the season.\n\"Over a 38-game period we haven't been good enough, I'm not going to sit here and complain about how other teams got their points. When you see how we played today, that is a side that should have got more than 38 points.\"\nA first for Ancelotti - the stats\nEverton lost a home Premier League game for the first time since November against Norwich, with their first home defeat under Carlo Ancelotti.\nJoshua King scored 48 Premier League goals for Bournemouth - seven more than any other player.\nBournemouth ended a run of nine consecutive away Premier League defeats, with their first away win since triumphing 1-0 at Chelsea in December - and their first ever victory at Goodison Park.\nBournemouth striker Dominic Solanke has scored three goals in his last four Premier League appearances, having found the net only once in his first 59 games in the competition.\nHis Dark Materials 2 is coming: Watch the epic new trailer now\n'I lost my boyfriend to cancer conspiracy theories': Are alternative cures false hope?"

and break the hearts of the Foxes, who were in a Champions League spot for so much of the season.\nLeicester needed victory once Chelsea took command at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers but their dreams were dashed as Bruno Fernandes scored a 71st-minute penalty after Anthony Martial tumbled under challenge from Wes Morgan and Jonny Evans.\nBoth sides had their chances, with Leicester City keeper Kasper Schmeichel saving well from Marcus Rashford in the first half and Jamie Vardy seeing a header glance off the frame of the goal after the break.\nLeicester pressed but could not break Manchester United down and their misery was compounded when Evans was sent off against his former club for a wild, late lunge on Scott McTominay.\nManchester United confirmed the formalities seconds from time when substitute Jesse Lingard robbed Schmeichel and rolled the ball into an empty net.\nIt is a result that fulfils the usual minimum requirement of Champions League qualification for Manchester United.\nBut while Leicester City's fifth-placed finish is highly creditable and earns a place in the Europa League, this will undoubtedly be a huge disappointment and anti-climax after being in a position to reach the Champions League for so long.\nIt will be scant consolation for them that striker Vardy will claim the Golden Boot, as the Premier League's top scorer with 23 goals.\nReaction to the Premier League final day\nJamie Vardy wins Premier League Golden Boot\nFernandes transforms Man Utd\nAfter Fernandes had made an impressive debut in a goalless draw at home to Wolves on 1 February, Manchester United stood 14 points adrift of Leicester City, who were third.\nFast forward to his decisive role in this victory that sees United qualify for next season's Champions League by taking that third place, and you can see the extent of his impact.\nThe Portuguese attacker - a mid-season signing from Sporting Lisbon in a deal that could eventually be worth around \u00a368m - has provided the missing link for this Manchester United side.\nHe has built a bridge between midfield and a talented attacking array of strikers with his talent and his positive style, looking forward every time he receives possession.\nFernandes was not at his best here but he was the man who unlocked Leicester's defence as Martial won the crucial penalty, then performed his usual hop, skip and jump to send Schmeichel the wrong way and ease any lingering United nerves.\nIt capped a remarkable recovery for Manchester United - with credit also due to manager Solskjaer for guiding his side into the top four.\nLeicester suffer bitter disappointment\nThe scenes at the final whistle here showed the extent of Leicester City's bitter disappointment at being denied the footballing and financial prize that seemed theirs for the taking for so long.\nBrendan Rodgers' side had started to lose their early-season sparkle even before the campaign was halted in March by the coronavirus pandemic - yet they were still in a powerful position as the finish line approached.\nThey have still had a fine season but there is no point glossing over this huge missed opportunity.\nRodgers is left to rue moments such as the inexplicable meltdown at Bournemouth, where they led at half-time only to lose 4-1.\nThe manager faces a big job to pick his players up and remind them of what they have achieved in returning to European football.\nWhen they go into next season's Europa League, will they be without players such as Ben Chilwell, a target for Chelsea and reduced here to exhorting his team-mates from the directors' box as he was absent through injury?\nMan of the match - Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United)\nFoxes fail to hang on to top four - the stats\nLeicester finished fifth despite ending 325 days inside the top four places during the season.\nManchester United recorded a top-four finish in the Premier League for just the second time in five seasons - and the third time in seven seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers has lost 10 of his 12 meetings with Manchester United across all competitions, suffering defeats in each of the past five.\nManchester United extended their unbeaten run to 14 games in the Premier League, their longest run without defeat in the competition since April 2017.\nBruno Fernandes' penalty was the 14th Manchester United have been awarded in the Premier League this season, which is the most for a team in a single campaign in the competition's history.\nSince making his debut in the competition in February, Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals in the competition than any other player (15).\nJesse Lingard scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester United since December 2018, when he hit two in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first game in charge against Cardiff.\nHarry Maguire became the first outfield player since Gary Pallister in 1994-95 to start every game in a Premier League campaign for Manchester United."

        "article_text": "West Ham 1-1 Aston Villa: Villa survive relegation with final-day draw\nAston Villa will play Premier League football next season after a draw at West Ham was enough to ensure they escaped relegation on the final day of the campaign.\nHometown hero and captain Jack Grealish looked to have sealed a win for Villa with a powerful strike in the 84th minute, but Andriy Yarmolenko's deflected leveller soon after made it a nervy finale for the visitors.\nThey hung on though and the point, coupled with a defeat for Watford at Arsenal, ensured Villa's survival and consigned the Hornets to the Championship next season along with Bournemouth, whose win at Everton was not enough.\nIt caps an impressive end to the season for Dean Smith's side, who were seven points from safety two weeks ago but then put together their first four-game unbeaten run of 2019-20 to survive.\nIt was a game of few chances at the London Stadium, although the in-form Michail Antonio would have made Villa's afternoon a lot more tense had he not blazed a shot wide with just the keeper to beat in the first half.\nWest Ham secured their own Premier League place for 2020-21 with a draw at Manchester United on Wednesday and end the season in 16th.\nAction and reaction from the final round of Premier League games\nLawro's predictions v singer and Newcastle fan James Bay\nGrealish is Villa's talisman to the end\nPossessing only a goal difference advantage of one over Watford, Villa came into this tense final day with all possibilities on the table - even the prospect that they might lose and stay up, or win and go down.\nThat this situation even existed in the first place is a feather in the cap of Smith's side, who fought hard despite seemingly looking doomed to the drop.\nA long way from safety and on a three-game losing streak heading into their game against Crystal Palace on 12 July, they beat the Eagles, drew at Everton and then recorded a win over Arsenal to edge ahead of the faltering Hornets.\nThis final point sealed a second-successive season in the top-flight and to some extent justified the lavish spending they undertook last summer.\nIn the end, though, it was one of their own who stood head and shoulders above the rest to earn them the point they needed.\nGrealish was neat and energetic without being spectacular for much of the game but came alive when he was needed.\nSoon after dancing through the Hammers defence and seeing a shot deflected wide, he went one better, finding space on the edge of the box before firing in.\nThat should have been the end of it, but West Ham provided one final scare for Villa at the end of what has been a dramatic, rollercoaster season.\nInevitably, Villa will have to spend a portion of the upcoming truncated off-season dealing with rumours linking Grealish with a move away from the club.\nBut at least they will now be able to negotiate from a relative position of strength as a top-flight club.\nHammers earn their bit of luck\nHaving already secured their place in the Premier League next season, there was a risk that West Ham's players might have played within themselves on Sunday.\nVilla boss Smith asserted beforehand that his opposite number David Moyes would not allow this from his players and he was proven right.\nThe Hammers were not at the level that has seen them take seven points from their last three games, but they certainly weren't already on the beach.\nThe biggest testament to this is the manner in which they rallied after conceding so late, when they could have been excused just allowing the clock to run down on a slim defeat.\nTheir equaliser - coming just a minute or so after Villa's opener - owed plenty to fortune, with Yarmolenko's effort from range looping up off Grealish, over Pepe Reina and in.\nBut it was a moment of luck to cap what has been an impressive last four games of a campaign that has lurched between crises but has set them up a stable off-season and a fresh start to 2020-21.\nMan of the match - Jack Grealish (Aston Villa)\n'My dad will be looking down on us'\nAston Villa boss Dean Smith: \"When Jack scores you think 'That's it we're safe' but a deflection made it a little bit nervous, but we saw it out well.\n\"I'm immensely proud and I've said that in the dressing room. We now look like Premier League players.\n\"My whole family are in the living room watching together. It's been emotional because I lost my father to coronavirus. I'm sure he'll be looking down on us.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We didn't play so well today but if you put it in perspective the players have done a brilliant job. Today was a bit of a chance to play. But we were playing against an opponent with a lot to play for. A draw is about fair.\n\"We are trying to get a young, fresh group of players and they have done really well for us. Today is another experience for them. Every game in football matters. The standards they have set since lockdown have been really good.\"\nVilla fail to collect a clean sheet on the road\nAston Villa's point means they have survived relegation from the Premier League, despite failing to keep a clean sheet away from home all season - only the 10th time this has happened in a Premier League campaign.\nWest Ham have finished this Premier League season with 39 points - their lowest in a top-flight campaign since 2010-11 (33) when they finished bottom of the table.\nIn 19 games under David Moyes, West Ham recorded one more Premier League point (20) than they managed in their 19 previous games this season under Manuel Pellegrini (19).\nJack Grealish's opener was his 10th goal of the season for Aston Villa; the club's outright top scorer in all competitions in 2019-20.\nWest Ham midfielder Declan Rice has become the fourth player to play every minute of a Premier League season aged 21 or younger - along with Gary Kelly (1993/94), Frank Lampard (1998/99) and Wayne Bridge (2001/01 and 2001/02).\nExactly 100 seconds separated Jack Grealish's opener for Aston Villa and Andriy Yarmolenko's equaliser for West Ham.\nHis Dark Materials 2 is coming: Watch the epic new trailer now\n'I lost my boyfriend to cancer conspiracy theories': Are alternative cures false hope?"

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-0 Wolves: Mason Mount and Olivier Giroud secure win\nChelsea sealed fourth place in the Premier League to wrap up qualification for next season's Champions League with a comfortable victory over Wolves.\nFrank Lampard's side needed a point from the potentially nervy encounter at Stamford Bridge in order to clinch a top-four place - but they claimed all three in style.\nMason Mount's delightful 25-yard curling free-kick and Olivier Giroud's effort from close range were just 144 seconds apart shortly before half-time and they settled the contest.\nThe defeat means Nuno Espirito Santo's men finish seventh behind Tottenham on goal difference after Jose Mourinho's side drew 1-1 at Crystal Palace.\nHowever Wolves' league position could still be enough to claim a Europa League place for next season, should the Blues beat Arsenal in the FA Cup final next month.\nChelsea ended the season on the same points as Manchester United, who beat Leicester City 2-0, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side finish third on goal difference.\nRelive Chelsea v Wolves and all of Sunday's Premier League games\nChelsea to push on next season?\nDespite winning the Europa League last season and finishing third, Chelsea replaced Italian manager Maurizio Sarri with club legend Lampard, who was in his first role in management at Derby.\nWith champions Liverpool and runners-up Manchester City possessing strong and settled sides, Lampard will have been tasked with emulating his predecessor by securing Champions League football for next season.\nHe has duly achieved that and there is the real possibility of ending the campaign with further success with the FA Cup final at Wembley still to come.\nA number of youth players have featured in the starting line-up this season including striker Tammy Abraham and defender Reece James - but England playmaker Mount has been the pick of the bunch.\nHe demonstrated his class just when his side needed it in the crucial game against Wolves.\nThere was little happening in a cagey and uneventful encounter until the sprightly midfielder curled in a glorious free-kick following Pedro Neto's foul on Marcos Alonso.\nIf there was still any tension in the Chelsea ranks, it surely will have disappeared just two minutes later when France World Cup winner Giroud took the ball past Rui Patricio and slid in his seventh goal in his last eight starts.\nNew signing Timo Werner was at the game and with Hakim Ziyech also joining from Ajax as well as the prospect of Germany winger Kai Havertz also arriving, Chelsea will possess a formidable attacking armoury next term.\nBut despite keeping a clean sheet in this game, the 54 league goals conceded this season is only one short of their worst tally - so a centre-back is also likely to be on Lampard's agenda, as will a goalkeeper.\nThe confidence of Kepa Arrizabalaga, the world's most expensive keeper, will not have improved after being dropped for the game in favour of 38-year-old Willy Caballero, whose only meaningful contribution was to claw out Leander Dendoncker's dangerous cross.\nWolves' season continues\nWolves have endured a long and arduous campaign that started one year and one day ago in the Europa League and has seen them travel nearly 30,000 miles during that period.\nNuno's men are still in the Europa League and face Olympiakos in the last 16 next month, but they will have to go all the way in that competition to seal a Champions League place - or rely on a favour from Chelsea at Wembley to compete on the continent next term.\nThey will lament back-to-back defeats against Arsenal and Sheffield United at the start of the month as the reason they missed out on a top-six place and although they held out until first-half injury time against Chelsea, the home side's two quick-fire goals took the wind out of them.\nWolves never really looked like getting back into the game in the second period but can be proud of a season in which they collected 59 points, their highest tally in the Premier League.\nMan of the match - Mason Mount (Chelsea)\nWolves' continental cast - the stats\nChelsea are unbeaten in all six of their Premier League home games against Wolves (W5 D1), last losing against them in the top flight at Stamford Bridge in March 1979 (1-2).\nWolves have lost five of their six closing-day matches in the Premier League, winning the other against Sunderland in 2009-10.\nAfter just five wins at Stamford Bridge in their opening 13 Premier League games this season (D3 L5), Chelsea have ended the season with six successive home victories.\nWolves have lost their first Premier League game in London since March 2012 (5-0 v Fulham), with Chelsea ending their 10-game unbeaten run in the capital.\nWolves are the fourth different side to go through an entire Premier League campaign without any English goalscorers (excluding own goals), after Fulham (2001-02 and 2005-06), Arsenal (2006-07) and Stoke (2015-16).\nOlivier Giroud has scored eight Premier League goals this season, his best tally since 2016-17 when he netted 12 for Arsenal.\nAt the age of 33, Giroud has become the oldest player to score in five consecutive Premier League starts, taking over from Jamie Vardy (32).\nMason Mount is the second Englishman to score a direct free-kick for Chelsea in the Premier League, after current manager Frank Lampard.\nHis Dark Materials 2 is coming: Watch the epic new trailer now\n'I lost my boyfriend to cancer conspiracy theories': Are alternative cures false hope?"

        "article_text": "De Bruyne stars as Man City thrash Norwich\nManchester City legend David Silva made his final Premier League appearance but Kevin de Bruyne stole the show as his side brushed aside already-relegated Norwich.\nSilva, who has won four league titles during a glittering 10-year spell at City, was desperate to mark the occasion with a goal, but his best effort was kept out by Tim Krul's flying save.\nCity still ended up comfortable winners, thanks to Gabriel Jesus's close-range finish from a deflected Raheem Sterling cross and a superb curling strike from De Bruyne, who as usual took centre stage.\nDe Bruyne slipped Sterling clear to add a third, meaning the Belgian equalled Thierry Henry's record of 20 assists in a single Premier League season.\nAfter Riyad Mahrez blasted home a fourth, Silva was applauded off, although an empty Etihad Stadium was not the send-off he deserved.\nDe Bruyne was not done yet, brilliantly bending home his side's fifth goal off the inside of the post before the end.\nNorwich had their moments too as they bid farewell to the top flight, with Ederson denying Teemu Pukki and Onel Hernandez in one-on-one situations.\nHernandez thought he had put the Canaries ahead with the score at 0-0 but his low long-range effort was disallowed after he was ruled offside by the video assistant referee.\nIt meant Ederson kept his 16th clean sheet of the season, enough to give him the Premier League's golden glove award outright after Burnley's Nick Pope conceded against Brighton.\nCity finished runners-up, 18 points behind Premier League champions Liverpool - keeping the record they set for the biggest winning margin, 19 points in 2017-18.\nManager Pep Guardiola will now turn his attention to the Champions League - they host Real Madrid in Manchester in the second leg of their last-16 tie on 7 August.\nRelive Manchester City v Norwich and the rest of the Premier League's final day\nDe Bruyne equals Thierry Henry's assists record\nSilva's emotional farewell\nSilva was applauded by both sets of players and given a hug by his manager when he came off before the end.\nCity chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak rang the 34-year-old Spaniard after the final whistle to thank him for his efforts for the club over the past decade.\nReflecting on his day, Silva said: \"It was emotional because they are amazing people, I have been working for them for 10 years and I have a good relationship with them. I love them and I am going to miss all of them.\n\"I am a lucky guy. I have had lot of nice moments, including this one as well - the last one.\"\nMan City hit a century of league goals\nDoubts remain about City's defence despite Ederson's accolade but they continue to have few problems in front of goal - they have found the net 34 times in 10 league games since the restart.\nAs a team they are the top scorers in the country and passed the century mark in the Premier League in this final game. Individually, they have plenty of men in rich scoring form too.\nSergio Aguero will miss the Real game through injury, but Jesus appears to be growing in confidence - with 22 goals in all competitions his best City return, including four in his past six appearances.\nLike the Brazilian, Sterling is also having his most prolific season and his goal on Sunday means he found the net 30 times in all competitions, including 20 in the Premier League.\nNorwich fail to take their chances\nThe highlight of Norwich's season was a victory over City at Carrow Road in September, but a repeat of that performance or result always looked beyond them.\nThey did create chances on the break despite being penned in their own half for the majority of the game, but their failure to take them was a reminder of why they are the Premier League's bottom side - as well as conceding the most goals in the top-flight in 2019-20, they have also scored the fewest.\nOnce Norwich go a goal down, they seem unable to respond - in the 27 games where they have fallen behind in the league this season, they have ended up losing all of them, and are the only team in Premier League history to fail to recover a single point from a losing position in an entire campaign.\nIt might have made some difference if Pukki had put away his golden chance when he ran clear before the break. But the Finnish striker has not scored for 14 matches and his shot - straight at Ederson - belied his lack of belief as Norwich lost their 10th successive league game.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City)\nNorwich's season to forget - the key stats\nManchester City have scored 100+ league goals in a top-flight season for a fifth time, an English record (also 1936-37, 1957-58, 2013-14 and 2017-18).\nNorwich's return of 21 points is the sixth-lowest figure in Premier League history, while it is the Canaries' lowest return in any division in their history.\nNorwich are the third team in Premier League history to lose 10 consecutive matches, after Sunderland (20 as of September 2005) and Aston Villa (11 as of April 2016).\nRaheem Sterling became the first Englishman to net 20 goals in a top-flight campaign for Manchester City since Brian Kidd scored 21 back in 1976-77.\nManchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne assisted his 20th Premier League goal of the season, a joint-record in the competition alongside Thierry Henry in 2002-03.\nDe Bruyne has been directly involved in 33 Premier League goals this season (13 goals & 20 assists), the most of any player.\nHis Dark Materials 2 is coming: Watch the epic new trailer now\n'I lost my boyfriend to cancer conspiracy theories': Are alternative cures false hope?"

So that's where we belong.\n\"I want to have my team, my players, not a medical room full of players. I want a pitch full of players.\n\"Of course as a squad, the main thing is to keep our very good players and after that improve the squad.\n\"Are we going to buy 10 players? No. Are we going to buy players for \u00a3100m? No. We are going to improve.\"\nHarry Kane opened the scoring for Spurs, dispatching a low finish into the bottom left corner after collecting Giovani lo Celso's pass.\nHowever, Jeffrey Schlupp levelled for Palace with a close-range finish after some poor Tottenham marking at a corner.\nIt was no more than Roy Hodgson's side deserved, as they ended a run of seven straight defeats.\nThey matched their London rivals for endeavour and could have snatched all three points, with Scott Dann heading a late effort wide.\nPalace need more goals\nWhile this was a welcome point and performance from Palace, it also perfectly characterised their entire campaign.\nThe Eagles may well have steered clear of the relegation battle but they ended the season with their lowest points tally since Hodgson took charge in September 2017.\nThat has largely been due to a lack of goals, with Palace having the second-worst scoring record in the top flight, after bottom club Norwich.\nIt has not helped that the contributions of both Wilfried Zaha and Serbia midfielder Luka Milivojevic have dropped off significantly this term.\nBoth reached double figures in 2018-19 but have mustered just seven goals between them this time around.\nTo underscore the point, Palace registered 13 efforts against Spurs, but just two were on target.\n\"Even if the intention and desire from the board is to spend some money and rejuvenate the team, whether it's a possibility in the market is another matter,\" Hodgson said.\n\"Unless we get help soon, the job gets harder and harder. We need some players who can do what Harry Kane did for Tottenham today.\"\nDann and Jordan Ayew should both have at least worked Hugo Lloris from close range on the left side of the Tottenham penalty area.\nAnd Hodgson, who has repeatedly stressed his desire to bolster his squad, now has around seven weeks to rectify the issue before the 2020-21 Premier League gets under way on 12 September.\nMission accomplished for Spurs\nIt appeared to be a case of mission accomplished for Mourinho and his staff at the final whistle as they celebrated the prospect of playing in Europe next term.\nThe result means that Spurs are guaranteed to earn a minimum of around \u00a310m for their involvement in European competition next season.\nHowever, few Tottenham supporters could have imagined such a difficult campaign - or that the Portuguese boss would take charge less than six months on from their appearance in last season's Champions League final.\nWhen Mourinho succeeded Mauricio Pochettino as manager, the club were languishing in 14th in the table.\n\"Of course everybody that one day plays Champions League doesn't want to go back and play Europa League - but it was the only thing possible after such a difficult season for the club,\" Mourinho added.\n\"Arriving 14th and handling things is not bad at all. I am quite happy that next season we play in the Europa League and it's just a question to motivate ourselves for that competition and try to motivate the fans to support us and do something beautiful.\"\nWhile Mourinho has overseen an upturn in results and the number of goals they have scored, he is yet to remedy their problems in defence.\nEric Dier put in an accomplished performance alongside Toby Alderweireld on his return from suspension, but Palace's equaliser is likely to have infuriated the Spurs boss.\nHis defenders stood like statues as Dann headed a deep corner back across goal, with Schlupp converting after Ayew had diverted the ball into his path.\nUntil then, Tottenham had looked capable of extending their lead via the pace and power of Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura, on the break.\nMan of the match - Lucas Moura (Tottenham)\nCapital joy for Kane - the stats\nCrystal Palace are unbeaten in their past five final-day Premier League games played at home (W4 D1).\nTottenham Hotspur registered just eight clean sheets in their 38 Premier League games in 2019-20, their lowest tally of shutouts in the competition since 2010-11 (also eight).\nCrystal Palace have become just the eighth team to go through an entire Premier League season without scoring more than twice in a match and are the first side to do so without being relegated.\nTottenham have finished the Premier League campaign in the top six for the 11th consecutive season, after managing to do so just twice in their previous 17 seasons in the competition.\nOnly Andy Cole (nine), Les Ferdinand (nine) and Matt Le Tissier (eight) have scored more Premier League goals on the final day than Tottenham striker Harry Kane (seven in six final-day games).\nGiovani lo Celso's two Premier League assists for Tottenham have come in his past three appearances in the competition (28 games in total).\nTottenham striker Harry Kane netted his 31st goal in Premier League London derbies, with only three players managing more (Thierry Henry got 43, Teddy Sheringham and Frank Lampard each got 32).\nCrystal Palace midfielder Jeffrey Schlupp has netted three goals in his past six Premier League appearances, as many as he managed in his previous 40 in the competition.\nHis Dark Materials 2 is coming: Watch the epic new trailer now\n'I lost my boyfriend to cancer conspiracy theories': Are alternative cures false hope?"
